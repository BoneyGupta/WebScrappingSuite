            "[CONTENT]": "Artificial Intelligence (AI) is a hot word these days. In this post, we cover artificial intelligence in detail \u2013 its meaning, scope, risks, ethics etc.\n\nTable of Contents\n\nWhat is Artificial Intelligence (AI)?\nIs it possible for a computer to become completely Artificially Intelligent?\nWhat is the philosophy and ethics of Artificial Intelligence?\nThree main philosophical questions related to Artificial Intelligence\nExamples of Artificially Intelligent Technologies\nApplications of Artificial Intelligence (AI)\nWhat are the downsides and risks of Artificial Intelligence (AI)?\nPossible areas for AI applications in Indian conditions\nWhich is the nodal organization of the government for the research work on Artificial Intelligence (AI)?\nWhat are the challenges India\u2019s Artificial Intelligence Development is facing?\nLatest Developments\nConclusion\nWhat is Artificial Intelligence (AI)?\nTo make it simple \u2013 Artificial Intelligence is intelligence exhibited by machines.\nIt is a branch of computer science that deals with creating computers or machines as intelligent as human beings.\nThe term was coined in 1956 by John McCarthy at the Dartmouth conference, Massachusetts Institute of Technology.\nIt is a simulation of human intelligence processes such as learning (the acquisition of information and rules for using the information), reasoning (using the rules to reach approximate or definite conclusions), and self-correction by machines, especially computer systems.\nNowadays it has become an umbrella term that encompasses everything from robotic process automation to actual robotics.\nRecently it has become widely popular and gained prominence due to its multifaceted application ranging from healthcare to military devices.\nIs it possible for a computer to become completely Artificially Intelligent?\n\nWork is being done in this arena however except in some instances of computers playing games faster than the best human players no success has been achieved.\nFor Example: In May 1997, an IBM super-computer called Deep Blue defeated world chess champion Gary Kasparov in a chess match.\nAnother recent example of 2016 is, AlphaGo, a program driven by Google\u2019s DeepMind AI, which has won Korean Lee Sedol, one of Go\u2019s most dominant players.\nWhat is the philosophy and ethics of Artificial Intelligence?\nThe research and development of AI started with the intention of creating intelligence in machines that we find and regard as high in humans. Thus answering the big question which is can machines think and behave like humans do?\nThree main philosophical questions related to Artificial Intelligence\nAre they dangerous to humanity? How can we ensure that machines behave ethically and that they are used ethically?\nIs artificial general intelligence probable? Can a machine decipher any problem that a human being can solve using intelligence? Or are there hard boundaries to what a machine can accomplish?\nIs it possible for machines to have a mind, consciousness, and mental state in the same sense that human beings do? Can a machine be sentient, and thus deserve certain rights? Can a machine intentionally cause harm?\nExamples of Artificially Intelligent Technologies\nRobotic process automation: Automation is the process of making a system or process function automatically. Robots can be programmed to perform high-volume, repeatable tasks normally performed by humans and further, it is different from IT automation because of its agility and adaptability to the changing circumstances.\nNatural language processing (NLP) is the processing of human language and not computer language by a computer program. For Example, spam detection, which looks at the subject line and the text of an email and decides if it\u2019s junk.\nPattern recognition is a branch of machine learning that focuses on identifying patterns in data.\nMachine vision is the science of making computers visualize by capturing and analyzing visual information using a camera, analog-to-digital conversion, and digital signal processing. It is often compared to human eyesight, but machine vision isn\u2019t bound by biology and can be programmed to see through walls. It is used in a range of applications from signature identification to medical image analysis.\nMachine learning: A field of study that gives computers the ability to learn without being explicitly programmed. \u00a0Deep learning is a subset of machine learning and can be thought of as the automation of predictive analytics.\nRobotics is a field of engineering focused on the design and manufacturing of robots. Robots are often used to perform tasks that are difficult for humans to perform or perform consistently.\nApplications of Artificial Intelligence (AI)\n\nHealthcare Sector: Machine learning is being used for faster, cheaper, and more accurate diagnosis thus improving patient outcomes and reducing costs. For Example, IBM Watson and chatbots are some of such tools.\nBusiness Sector: To take care of highly repetitive tasks Robotic process automation is applied which performs faster and effortlessly than humans. Further, Machine learning algorithms are being integrated into analytics and CRM platforms to provide better customer service. Chatbots are being used in websites to provide immediate service to customers. Automation of job positions has also become a talking point among academics and IT consultancies such as Gartner and Forrester.\nEducation Sector: AI can make some of the educational processes automated such as grading, rewarding marks, etc. therefore giving educators more time. Further, it can assess students and adapt to their needs, helping them work at their own pace. AI may change where and how students learn, perhaps even replacing some teachers.\nFinancial Sector: It can be applied to personal finance applications and could collect personal data and provide financial advice. Today software trades more than humans on Wall Street.\nLegal Sector: Automation can lead to faster resolution of already pending cases by reducing the time taken while analyzing cases thus better use of time and more efficient processes.\nManufacturing sector: Robots have been used for manufacturing for a long time now, however, more advanced exponential technologies have emerged such as additive manufacturing (3D Printing) which with the help of AI can revolutionize the entire manufacturing supply chain ecosystem.\nIntelligent Robots \u2212 Robots can perform the tasks given by a human because of sensors to detect physical data from the real world such as light, heat, temperature, movement, sound, bump, and pressure. Moreover, they have efficient processors, multiple sensors, and huge memory, to exhibit intelligence. Further, they are capable of learning from their errors and therefore can adapt to the new environment.\nGaming \u2013 AI has a crucial role in strategic games such as chess, poker, tic-tac-toe, etc., where the machine can think of a large number of possible positions based on heuristic knowledge.\nSpeech Recognition \u2013 There are intelligent systems that are capable of hearing and grasping the language in terms of sentences and their meanings while humans talk to it. It can handle different accents, slang words, noise in the background, changes in human noise due to cold, etc.\nCyber Security: In the 20th conference on e-governance in India it was discussed that AI can provide more teeth to cyber security and must be explored.\n\nRead:\u00a0AI in Elections\n\nWhat are the downsides and risks of Artificial Intelligence (AI)?\nThe decrease in demand for human labour is due to machines and intelligent robots taking over the jobs in the manufacturing and services sectors. For Example: In China, some customs officers are now robots, In Japan robots such as housemaids is an emerging trend.\nExistential risks: Stephen Hawkins once said \u201cThe development of full artificial intelligence could spell the end of the human race. Once humans develop artificial intelligence, it will take off on its own and redesign itself at an ever-increasing rate. Humans, who are limited by slow biological evolution, couldn\u2019t compete and would be superseded\u201d.\nAI technologies falling into terrorist hands may unleash modern terror networks including machines and therefore vulnerability of humans may magnify.\nIt may lead to moral degradation in society due to decreased human-to-human interactions.\n\nIn such an era of rapid and disruptive changes, many questions arise:\n\nWill these technological changes be accompanied by equally profound economic, social, and cultural changes?\nWill technology destroy jobs at a faster rate than the rate of creation of jobs?\nWill future governments be forced to fork out Universal Basic Income?\nHow could education be redefined with artificial intelligence, big data, augmented reality, and personalized learning pathways?\nAre conventional manufacturing plants under threat with the advent of additive manufacturing?\nWhat will be the impact on the skills required?\nAfter all these changes, do people-to-people communication and socio-economic activities remain the same?\nPossible areas for AI applications in Indian conditions\nIt can complement Digital India Mission by helping in the big data analysis which is not possible without using AI.\nTargeted delivery of services, schemes, and subsidies can be further fine-tuned.\nSmart border surveillance and monitoring to enhance security infrastructure.\nWeather forecasting models may become proactive and therefore preplanning for any future mishaps such as floods, and droughts and therefore addressing the farming crisis, farmer\u2019s suicide, crop losses, etc.\nBy analyzing big data of road safety data and NCRB (National Crime Record Bureau) data for crimes, new policies can be formulated.\nDisaster management can be faster and more accessible with the help of robots and intelligent machines.\nIn the counterinsurgency and patrolling operations, we often hear the loss of CRPF jawans which can be minimized by using the robotic army and lesser human personnel.\nAI can be used to automate government processes, therefore, minimizing human interactions and maximizing transparency and accountability.\nIt can be applied to study ancient literature on medicines and therefore help in modernizing health care with the juxtaposition of modern machines and ancient techniques.\nIn the remotest areas where the last leg of governance is almost broken, AI can do the job. For Example: in the tribal areas and the hilly areas of the northeast.\nWhich is the nodal organization of the government for the research work on Artificial Intelligence (AI)?\nCentre for Artificial Intelligence and Robotics (CAIR), is the primary laboratory of DRDO for research and development in different areas of defense, Information and Communication Technology (ICT) and is located in Bangalore. It is involved in the Research & Development of high-quality Secure Communication, Command, and Control, and Intelligent Systems.\nCAIR came into existence in 1986.\nProjects: NETRA- software to intercept online communication, SECOS- Secure operating system.\nWhat are the challenges India\u2019s Artificial Intelligence Development is facing?\nAI-based applications are mostly driven largely by the private sector and have been focused largely on consumer goods.\nPublic-private funding model which is a success in the United States, China, South Korea, and elsewhere may be considered good for India. Presently it is not present in India.\nOur educational system is not updated to modern technologies and is outdated in today\u2019s economic environment as the nature of jobs shifts rapidly and skills become valuable and obsolete in a matter of years.\nThe debate of poverty vs. technology and where to spend the most is more likely to persist until the political class takes a higher interest in real issues than trivial ones.\nLatest Developments\n\nMarch 2024: The UN General Assembly adopted a landmark resolution to promote \u201csafe, secure and trustworthy\u201d artificial intelligence (AI) systems that will also benefit sustainable development for all.\n\n\ud83d\udc49 Which year are YOU targeting for success in the IAS/IPS/IFS Exam? \ud83d\ude80\n\n(1) \u21d2 UPSC 2025: Prelims cum Mains\n\n(2) \u21d2 UPSC 2026: Prelims cum Mains\n\n(3) \u21d2 UPSC 2027 Prelims cum Mains\n\nTip: Know more about ClearIAS Courses (Online/Offline)\n\nThe Assembly resolved to bridge the artificial intelligence (AI) and other digital divides between and within countries and promote safe, secure and trustworthy AI systems to accelerate progress towards the full realization of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development.\nThe United States is spearheading the first United Nations resolution on\u00a0artificial intelligence, aimed at ensuring that the new technology is \u201csafe, secure and trustworthy\u201d and that all countries, especially those in the developing world, have equal access.\nThe resolution aims at closing the digital divide between countries and making sure they are all at the table in discussions on AI \u2014 and that they have the technology and capabilities to take advantage of its benefits, including detecting diseases, predicting floods and training the next generation of workers.\nConclusion\n\nDespite these threats and challenges, it would be stupid to argue that Artificial Intelligence (AI) is not the future and it\u2019s only a matter of time before machines replace most jobs. It does not mean the end of the road for humanity and we have a history of technological revolutions causing social and political changes in society.\n\nThere were bound to be some fears and challenges in the early years, but so was the case with the French Revolution, steam engines, industrial revolutions, and most recently the computers.\n\nNevertheless, there will be more opportunities in the fields not yet known and there will be more jobs to cater to human needs. In the case of India, Innefu is one such Artificial Intelligence (AI) based company that is still in its nascent phase but soon may challenge global companies and therefore can create an AI ecosystem in India.\n\nAlso read: Future of Work and AI; IndiaAI Mission;\u00a0International AI Treaty\n\nArticle by: Nishant\u00a0Raj.

            "[CONTENT]": "Technologists, investors, policymakers, and the general public now consider generative AI to be the next big thing in the world of technology. Any sort of artificial intelligence that uses unsupervised learning techniques to generate fresh digital images, video, audio, text, or code is referred to as generative AI. Read here to learn more.\n\nBasically, \u201cgenerative AI\u201d refers to any instance in which an Artificial Intelligence technology creates its content, whether that information is written, visual, or multimodal.\n\nThis contains tools for drawing and painting pictures as well as tools for using data acquired from the internet to produce press releases, white papers, company brochures, website articles, and article summaries.\n\nDespite the current downturn and layoffs in the tech sector, generative AI companies continue to receive huge interest from investors.\n\nBy 2025, generative AI is expected to produce 10 percent of all data (now less than 1 percent) with 20 percent of all test data for consumer-facing use cases.\nIt will be sided by 50 percent of drug discovery and development initiatives.\nThirty percent of manufacturers will use it to enhance their product development effectiveness.\n\nTable of Contents\n\nWhat is Generative AI?\nHow is generative AI governed?\nApplications of Generative AI\nConcerns about Generative AI\nWay forward\nPrevious year question\nWhat is Generative AI?\n\nGenerative AI is a cutting-edge technological development that uses Artificial Intelligence and machine learning to produce new types of media, including text, audio, video, and animation.\n\nIt is now possible to produce original and creative short and long-form content, synthetic media, and even deepfakes with simple text, also known as prompts, thanks to the development of advanced machine learning capabilities like large language models, neural translation, information understanding, and reinforcement learning.\n\n\ud83d\udc49 Which year are YOU targeting for success in the IAS/IPS/IFS Exam? \ud83d\ude80\n\n(1) \u21d2 UPSC 2025: Prelims cum Mains\n\n(2) \u21d2 UPSC 2026: Prelims cum Mains\n\n(3) \u21d2 UPSC 2027 Prelims cum Mains\n\nTip: Know more about ClearIAS Courses (Online/Offline)\n\nTo speed up these AI advances, leading technology companies like Microsoft, Google, Facebook, and others have commercial AI laboratories that do research and publish academic papers.\n\nInvesting in GANs (Generative Adversarial Networks), LLMs (Large Language Models), GPT (Generative Pre-trained Transformers), and Image Generation in recent years has allowed researchers to experiment and, in some cases, develop commercial products like DALL-E for image generation and ChatGPT for text generation.\n\nFor instance, ChatGPT is capable of writing blogs, computer code, marketing copy, and even producing search query results.\n\nA Generative Pretrained Transformer (GPT) is a type of large language model (LLM) that uses deep learning to generate human-like text.\n\nThey are called \u201cgenerative\u201d. They can generate new text based on the input they receive, and \u201cpretrained\u201d because they are trained on a large corpus of text data before being fine-tuned for specific tasks.\nAnd \u201ctransformers\u201d because they use a transformer-based neural network architecture to process input text and generate output text.\nHow is generative AI governed?\n\nIn the private sector, two approaches to the governance of generative AI models are currently emerging.\n\nIn one camp, companies such as OpenAI are self-governing the space through limited release strategies, monitored use of models, and controlled access via API for their commercial products like DALL-E2.\nIn the other camp, newer organizations, such as Stability AI, believe that these models should be openly released to democratize access and create the greatest possible impact on society and the economy.\n\nIn the public sector, little or no regulation governs the rapidly evolving landscape of generative AI.\n\nOther issues surround intellectual property and copyright. The datasets behind generative AI models are generally scraped from the internet without seeking consent from living artists or work still under copyright.\n\nApplications of Generative AI\nRealistic visuals and animations can be made with generative AI. To animate virtual characters in real time, researchers have employed generative models to produce photorealistic representations of faces and animals.\nMusic and art can be produced with generative AI. For instance, academics have utilized generative models to produce new musical compositions that are stylistically similar to those of a certain artist.\nText written in natural language can be produced using generative AI. For instance, scientists are employing ChatGPT to produce poetry, news stories, and even computer code.\nDrug discovery could be greatly sped up with the help of artificial intelligence. This will be a boost to the healthcare sector.\nRobotic system design and control can be done using generative AI. A robot\u2019s behavior can be simulated using generative models, which can also produce control signals that let the robot carry out specified tasks.\n\nText-to-image programs such as Midjourney, DALL-E, and Stable Diffusion have the potential to change how art, animation, gaming, movies, and architecture, education among others, are being rendered.\n\nRead:\u00a0AI in Elections\n\nConcerns about Generative AI\n\nWhile generative AI has the potential to boost productivity and efficiency across a variety of fields and applications, abuse of the technology could have a negative influence on society by encouraging prejudice, exclusion, and discrimination.\n\nIt will have a profound effect on jobs as automation will replace humans, especially in the creative industry.\nLarge parts of the creative workforce, including commercial artists working in entertainment, video games, advertising, and publishing, could lose their jobs because of generative AI models.\nArtists are worried that the internet will be flooded with artwork that is indistinguishable from their own, simply by telling the system to reproduce the artwork in a unique style.\nOne of the problems with large language models is their ability to generate false and misleading content.\nSuch capabilities can be misused to generate fake news and disinformation across platforms and ecosystems.\nThere is also the worry that once generative AI becomes popular, the creation and use of these models will be centralized in a small number of big businesses and nations, leading to a concentration of power and the possibility of abuse.\nWay forward\n\nEven while generative AI has the potential to revolutionize a variety of industries and tasks, there is a clear need to control the spread of these models and their effects on society and the economy.\n\nIn the upcoming years, the generative AI community will need to pay close attention to the debate that is currently taking place between centralized, regulated adoption with clear ethical boundaries and quicker innovation and decentralized distribution.\n\nNot only are private firms responsible for completing this task; but civil society and policymakers must also weigh in. This includes the potential for labor markets to be disrupted, the validity of data that has been scraped, licensing, copyright, and the possibility of inaccurate or otherwise harmful content.\n\nGenerative AI requires a considerable amount of training data required to generate outputs, else the output may turn out to be subpar or not good. But an enormous amount of work needs to go into securing the data to avoid any privacy concerns.\n\nThe development of generative AI technology and solutions can only proceed with greater consideration and benefit when reliable checks and balances are in place.\n\nAlso Read:\u00a0IndiaAI Mission;\u00a0IRIS: Kerala introduces India\u2019s first AI Teacher Robot;\u00a0International AI Treaty\n\nPrevious year question\n\nQ.

            "[META]": "Last updated on March 6, 2024 by ClearIAS Team",
            "[CONTENT]": "Digital monopolies by big tech firms have become a significant concern in the global economy, raising debates about market power, competition, consumer choice, and innovation. This article delves into the nature of digital monopolies, their implications, and their regulatory challenges.\n\nThe firms, often called \u201cBig Tech,\u201d include giants like Amazon, Google, Facebook (now Meta), Apple, and Microsoft.\n\nTheir dominance in digital markets has brought them under regulators, policymakers, and public scrutiny.\n\nTable of Contents\n\nDigital monopolies\nThreats of digital monopolies\nRegulatory Challenges\nResponses to digital monopolies\nWhy in the news?\nGlobal responses to digital monopolies\nConclusion\nDigital monopolies\n\nA digital monopoly occurs when a company gains predominant control over a digital market, allowing it to set or influence prices, control supply, limit entry to new competitors, or significantly impact user choice and innovation. These monopolies are characterized by:\n\nNetwork Effects: The value of the service increases as more people use it, making it difficult for newcomers to compete.\nData Control: Accumulation and control of vast amounts of user data, enabling better market targeting and personalization, further entrenching their market position.\nEcosystem Lock-in: Creating a comprehensive ecosystem of interconnected products and services that make users reliant on a single provider for their digital needs.\nThreats of digital monopolies\nMarket Power and Competition: Digital monopolies can stifle competition by using their dominant position to favor their products and services, potentially leading to less innovation and higher prices for consumers.\nData Privacy and Security: With massive amounts of user data, these firms wield significant power and responsibility, raising concerns about privacy, data protection, and potential misuse of information.\nInfluence on Society and Democracy: Their control over digital platforms, especially social media, gives them considerable influence over public discourse, media, and even political processes, raising questions about accountability and transparency.\nRegulatory Challenges\n\nRegulating digital monopolies poses unique challenges, given the fast-paced nature of technology and the global reach of these companies:\n\nGlobal Jurisdictional Issues: Big Tech firms operate across borders, making regulation complex due to differing legal frameworks and jurisdictions.\nInnovation vs. Regulation: Finding a balance between curbing anti-competitive practices and not stifling innovation is a critical challenge for regulators.\nDynamic Markets: The digital economy is rapidly evolving, requiring regulatory frameworks that are flexible and adaptive to keep pace with technological advancements.\nResponses to digital monopolies\n\nGovernments and regulatory bodies worldwide have been exploring various approaches to address the issues posed by digital monopolies:\n\n\ud83d\udc49 Which year are YOU targeting for success in the IAS/IPS/IFS Exam? \ud83d\ude80\n\n(1) \u21d2 UPSC 2025: Prelims cum Mains\n\n(2) \u21d2 UPSC 2026: Prelims cum Mains\n\n(3) \u21d2 UPSC 2027 Prelims cum Mains\n\nTip: Know more about ClearIAS Courses (Online/Offline)\n\nAntitrust Actions: Investigating and taking action against anti-competitive practices, including breaking up parts of their businesses, imposing fines, or enforcing behavioral remedies.\nLegislative Reforms: Updating competition laws to better address the unique aspects of digital markets and monopolies.\nData Protection and Privacy Laws: Implementing stringent data protection regulations to safeguard user privacy and limit the power of Big Tech firms over consumer data.\nPromoting Open Standards and Interoperability: Encouraging or mandating standards that ensure interoperability between different platforms and services to enhance competition.\n\nIndia has a few measures in place for the same:\n\nCompetition Commission of India (CCI) protects Indian markets against anti-competitive practices by enterprises. It is a statutory body under the Competition Act, of 2002.\nConsumer Protection (E-Commerce) Rules, 2020 regulates e-commerce platforms and protects the rights of consumers.\nThe Digital Personal Data Protection Act, of 2023 ensures data privacy and security.\nWhy in the news?\n\nGoogle has taken down from the Play Store the apps of ten Indian companies, including prominent matrimony and dating apps in the country, that remained non-compliant with the tech giant\u2019s app billing policy for an extended period.\n\nThis comes in the wake of continued non-payment of service fees by these companies and their refusal to comply with the updated Payment Policy for the Google Play Store.\nIt also comes three weeks after the Supreme Court refused to grant any interim protection to domestic start-ups against the removal of the apps from the Play Store by Google.\nGlobal responses to digital monopolies\n\nGovernments and international bodies have increasingly scrutinized Big Tech\u2019s actions due to concerns over anti-competitive practices, privacy breaches, tax strategies, and their overall influence on democracy and society.\n\nEuropean Union: The EU has been at the forefront, implementing stringent regulations like the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) and pursuing antitrust investigations against companies like Google, Apple, and Amazon. The Digital Markets Act (DMA) and the Digital Services Act (DSA) are recent legislative proposals aimed at curbing the power of digital giants.\nUnited States: The U.S. has seen a resurgence in antitrust scrutiny under various administrations, with significant lawsuits filed against Google and Facebook for alleged anti-competitive practices. Efforts to break up these companies have been discussed, and there are calls for revising antitrust laws to better address the nuances of digital markets. In 2022, the five largest tech companies (Apple, Google, Meta/Facebook, Amazon, and Microsoft), all faced lawsuits or investigations.\nChina: China has taken robust actions against its tech giants, such as Alibaba and Tencent, to curb their market dominance, enforce anti-monopoly laws, and ensure data security and consumer protection.\n\nGlobal actions concerning data privacy and security have intensified, with numerous countries adopting or planning to introduce regulations inspired by the EU\u2019s GDPR.\n\nCross-border data flows: There is growing concern and action regarding the control and flow of data across borders, with implications for data sovereignty and national security.\nData localization: Countries like India and Russia have implemented data localization requirements, demanding that certain types of data be stored within national borders.\n\nThe issue of fair taxation of multinational tech companies has led to global initiatives aimed at ensuring these companies pay taxes where they generate value.\n\nOver 130 countries agreed on a framework under the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) to ensure multinational enterprises pay a fair share of taxes, including a global minimum corporate tax rate.\n\nIn response to the dominance of American and Chinese tech giants, several countries are promoting digital sovereignty and supporting local competitors.\n\nDigital services taxes: France and other countries have introduced or are considering digital services taxes aimed specifically at tech giants, which has led to international disputes and negotiations.\nSupport for local tech ecosystems: Nations are investing in their digital infrastructure, education, and startup ecosystems to foster local competitors that can offer alternatives to services provided by Big Tech.\nConclusion\n\nDigital monopolies by Big Tech firms present a complex challenge that intersects with economics, technology, society, and law. While these companies have brought significant benefits in terms of innovation and convenience, their dominant positions raise critical concerns that require a nuanced and proactive regulatory approach.\n\nBalancing the promotion of competition, innovation, and the protection of consumer rights and societal values is crucial in shaping the future of the digital economy.\n\nRelated articles:\n\nOpen Network for Digital Commerce (ONDC)\nNet neutrality\n\n-Article by Swathi Satish"

These collaborations can offer high ROI, making them a cost-effective choice for businesses, especially SMEs (Small and Medium Enterprises).\nCreative Content Production: Creators are professional content producers who understand what resonates with their audience. By collaborating with them, businesses can tap into their creativity and expertise to produce innovative and engaging content. This not only helps in marketing the product but also in refreshing the brand\u2019s content strategy.\nIncreased Brand Loyalty: When creators share their positive experiences with a brand, it can significantly enhance the brand\u2019s image and increase loyalty among existing and potential customers. The personal touch that creators add helps in humanizing the brand, making it more relatable and trustworthy.\nMarket Insights: Creators are in constant communication with their audiences, giving them unique insights into consumer preferences and trends. Businesses can leverage these insights to better understand their target market, refine their products or services, and tailor their marketing strategies accordingly.\nGlobal Reach: The digital nature of the creator economy means that content can reach audiences worldwide. For businesses looking to expand their market presence, partnering with creators can be an effective way to enter new markets and connect with international customers.\nSEO Benefits: Collaborations with content creators can also enhance a brand\u2019s SEO strategy. High-quality content that links back to the business\u2019s website can improve search engine rankings, drive traffic, and increase online visibility.\nFlexibility and Scalability: The creator economy allows businesses to scale their marketing efforts up or down with ease. Companies can start with small collaborations and gradually increase their investment as they see positive results, offering flexibility that\u2019s harder to achieve with traditional advertising contracts.\nInnovative Advertising Formats: Creators often pioneer new content formats and marketing techniques, from interactive stories on Instagram to long-form content on YouTube. Partnering with creators allows businesses to experiment with innovative advertising formats and stay ahead of the curve in digital marketing trends.\nWhy in the news?\n\nThe government has introduced the \u2018National Creators Award\u2018 in an attempt to recognize the increasing impact of digital producers and influencers and support India\u2019s digital economy.\n\nAccording to the Ministry of Electronics & IT (MeitY), the award\u2019s objectives are to promote good social change and innovation in the digital sphere, as well as to highlight the many voices and talents influencing India\u2019s future.\n\nFuture of the Creator Economy\n\nThe future of the creator economy looks promising but is also fraught with uncertainties related to platform policies, copyright laws, and the evolving digital landscape.\n\nAs platforms seek to retain and attract creators, we may see more innovative tools and better revenue-sharing models. Simultaneously, the rise of decentralized platforms and technologies like blockchain could offer creators more control over their content and earnings.\nMoreover, as the audience becomes more discerning, there will be a greater emphasis on quality, authenticity, and value-driven content.\nCreators who can adapt to these changes, diversify their income streams, and maintain a strong connection with their audience are likely to thrive in this evolving economy.\nConclusion\n\nThe creator economy is still in its early stages, but it is growing rapidly. In 2021, the creator economy was valued at $104 billion, and it is projected to reach nearly half a trillion by 2027.\n\nThe creator economy opens up a world of opportunities for businesses willing to engage with new marketing strategies. By harnessing the power of creators, companies can achieve authentic engagement, targeted reach, and creative collaboration, leading to increased brand awareness, customer loyalty, and ultimately, business growth.\n\nRelated articles:\n\nRole of social media in UPSC CSE preparation\nSocial media and Civil servants\nRole of social media in internal security challenges\n\n-Article by Swathi Satish"

However, to get the complete immersion experience \u2013 specific hardware devices like virtual reality headsets, augmented reality glasses, gaming consoles, etc are recommended.\n\nSo, what is metaverse?\n\nYou can call it a platform, environment, ecosystem, world, or universe.\n\nWe call it a futuristic virtual universe.\n\nNeed a more elaborate definition?\n\nMetaverse is a futuristic digital world where people get chances to immerse in virtual and augmented versions of reality through their digital avatars.\n\nMetaverse: The Word Meaning\n\nMetaverse is a combination of the words \u2018meta\u2019 and \u2018universe\u2019.\n\n\u2018Meta\u2019 means \u2018Beyond\u2019.\n\nSo metaverse is a universe that is beyond the universe as we know it. It exists in the virtual realm but feels just as real.\n\nWhere did the idea of the metaverse originate?\nThe term \u2018metaverse\u2019 was first mentioned in the 1992 science fiction novel \u2018Snow Crash\u2019 by Neal Stephenson.\nThe novel is set in a dystopian world where the governments have ceded power to private corporations and have references to many present-day aspects of the modern world such as virtual reality, digital currency, etc.\nMany movies have explored this concept such as \u2018The Matrix\u2019, \u2018Ready Player One\u2019, \u2018The Tron Legacy\u2019 etc.\nWhy Metaverse is in the news?\n\nMultiple companies investing in metaverse-related technologies.\n\nFacebook recently changed its name to \u2018Meta\u2019 to align the company with its ambitions to build the \u2018metaverse\u2019.\nMicrosoft has come up with its \u2018Mesh\u2019 platform which has mixed reality capabilities.\nNvidia is working on their versions of the virtual universe.\nEpic, the company behind the video game phenomenon Fortnite, has moved beyond games to social experiences like dance parties and virtual music concerts.\nMetaverse: The future of the internet?\n\nThe metaverse is not yet a reality, it is still a work in progress.\n\nHowever, the metaverse could be the next evolution of the internet.\n\nMany are hypothesizing that the metaverse will be the next iteration of the internet.\n\nHow is Metaverse different from the present form of the Internet?\n\nThe present form of the Internet is two-dimensional ie 2D.\n\nIf you are browsing Facebook, you are seeing your social connections on a 2D screen as 2D images, right?\n\n2D to 3D is the next move.\n\nSo Metaverse is internet rendered in 3D! OR Internet brought to life!\n\nMetaverse: Everything you need to know\nMetaverse will include elements from both physical and virtual worlds.\nThe metaverse will be decentralized (just like the internet).\nNobody owns the metaverse like how nobody owns the internet. It is an open platform.\nThere will be many companies and individuals that will operate their own spaces within the virtual world.\nA metaverse is a form of mixed reality ie a\u00a0combination of augmented and virtual reality.\nMetaverse will introduce digital elements in the real world.\nMetaverse will support 3-D virtual spaces.\n3D spaces in the virtual world will let you socialize, learn, collaborate, and play in ways that go beyond what we can imagine.\nAs per Facebook, the metaverse is the next evolution of social connection.\nMetaverse is expected to expand the internet to combine digital spaces like online gaming, social media, cryptocurrency, virtual reality, and augmented reality.\nExamples of a Meta-Verse 3D Space\n\nScenario 1: Meet your friend living in New York City in a local coffee shop in Mumbai \u2013 in a virtual environment in real-time via digital avatars.\n\nScenario 2: Shop with your friend living in Australia in a shopping mall in Delhi \u2013 in a virtual environment in real-time via digital avatars.\n\nScenario 3: Land and walk on the moon \u2013 in a virtual environment.\n\nWhat is the present state of Metaverse?\nGaming: As of now, many gaming platforms have successfully used the metaverse concept. For example, Epic Games, the creator of Fortnite, recently held a music concert by pop singer Ariana Grande in their game.\nCryptocurrency: Cryptocurrency is another aspect of a virtual universe that has been successfully realized, and it will be part of the new metaverse world order where all services will be offered in exchange for crypto.\nThe Potential of Metaverse:\nHardware Sales: Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg believes augmented reality glasses will eventually be as widespread as smartphones. If that is the case, this will be a very big market.\nSoftware Sales: Huge scope in the development of software applications to support the meta-verse ecosystem.\nGaming:\u00a0Facebook\u2019s gaming platform Oculus VR is expected to be the gateway into the metaverse.\nPhysical Sales: Sales of physical goods and services will be linked to the virtual ecosystem in the future.\nImmersive Learning: Immersive Learning is a training methodology that uses Virtual Reality (VR) to simulate real-world scenarios and train students in a safe and engaging immersive training environment.\ndecentralized commerce (dCommerce): in-world transactions to happen peer-to-peer.\nNon-Fungible Tokens (NFTs): NFTs \u2013 the claim of ownership for a unique, non-interchangeable digital asset that is stored on a blockchain \u2013 may be widely adopted.\nWhat are the challenges at present?\n\nAt this moment, no one is sure about the final form of Metaverse. There are also questions about who will finally have control over this virtual environment.\n\nThis mixed reality space will represent an entire ecosystem of various virtual realities that cannot be built by just one company hence building one is likely to take decades and require thousands of companies to pool in resources, including hardware, software, and content.\n\nThe metaverse requires technologies and infrastructure that currently do not exist. The current form of the Internet and its bandwidth is limited in their design to hold the 3D digital space.\n\nThe space will need a broader and more complex set of standards and protocols than the traditional Internet. This means large technology companies like Amazon, Google, and Facebook will need to prepare for cross-integrating their systems.\n\nThe interoperable virtual environment could also raise questions about data protection in the industry as wide consensus on data security and persistence will be harder to establish.\n\nThis virtual universe will need altogether new rules for censorship, control of communications, regulatory enforcement, tax reporting, the prevention of online radicalization, and many more challenges that are still unresolved today.\n\nCriticisms\n\nMany criticize \u2018Metaverse\u2019 as an over-hyped concept based on existing technology. Such critics argue that technologies like AR, and VR are existing for quite some time. Even the term \u2018Metaverse\u2019 is not new.\n\nExperts point out that VR data is biometric. In such a case, all personal and behavioral characteristics of the people will be recorded making them susceptible to cyber-crimes.\n\nUser addiction is a concern for the development of virtual reality.\n\nThe metaverse may distort users\u2019 perceptions of reality with biased content to keep them engaged.\n\nConcepts to focus on in this article\nMetaverse\nVirtual Reality (VR)\nAugmented Reality (AR)\nMixed Reality (MR)\nExtended Reality (XR)\nImmersive Learning\n3D spaces\ndecentralized commerce (dCommerce)\nnon-fungible tokens (NFTs)\nBlock-chain technology"

Yes, blockchain technology is changing our world.\n\nLet\u2019s decode the latest buzzword \u2013 Blockchain Technology \u2013 in this post. Thank you for the excellent feedback on our earlier articles in this series \u2013 on Artificial Intelligence,\u00a0Internet of Things (IoT), and Automation. Feel free to post your feedback on this article in the comment section at the post bottom.\n\nTable of Contents\n\nComparing Blockchain to an Excel Sheet\nWhat is a blockchain?\nDefinition of Blockchain\nWho invented blockchain technology?\nInternet Technology vs Blockchain Technology\nTechnologies behind blockchain technology!\nWhat is the need for blockchain technology?\nBlockchain technology \u2013 opportunities and advantages\nBlockchain Technology \u2013 Criticisms and Challenges\nSummary\nReferences\nComparing Blockchain to an Excel Sheet\n\nImagine a Microsoft Excel Sheet file on your laptop with details of some transactions you made. You can call it a ledger.\n\nNow, imagine that your Excel Sheet file is copied to hundreds of your friends\u2019 computers, connected forming a network. The ledger in your laptop has become a distributed ledger.\n\nThen imagine that this network of computers is designed with a technology to regularly update this Excel Sheet, whenever you or your friends update the ledger.\n\nYou now have a basic understanding of the blockchain!\n\nWhat is a blockchain?\n\nIn simple terms, blockchain is a digital ledger.\n\n\ud83d\udc49 Which year are YOU targeting for success in the IAS/IPS/IFS Exam? \ud83d\ude80\n\n(1) \u21d2 UPSC 2025: Prelims cum Mains\n\n(2) \u21d2 UPSC 2026: Prelims cum Mains\n\n(3) \u21d2 UPSC 2027 Prelims cum Mains\n\nTip: Know more about ClearIAS Courses (Online/Offline)\n\nWondering what is a ledger?\n\nA ledger is a book containing accounts to which debits and credits are posted from books of original entry.\n\nA blockchain is a digitized, decentralized, public\u00a0ledger. So simple, right?\n\nDefinition of Blockchain\nThe main chain (black) consists of the longest series of blocks from the genesis block (green) to the current block. Orphan blocks (purple) exist outside of the main chain.\n\nThe blockchain is an incorruptible digital ledger of transactions that can be programmed to record virtually everything of value.\n\nEach list of records in a blockchain is called a block.\n\nSo a blockchain\u00a0is a continuously growing list of records called blocks, which are linked and secured.\n\nWho invented blockchain technology?\n\nBlockchain Technology was invented by\u00a0Satoshi Nakamoto\u00a0in 2008 for use in the\u00a0cryptocurrency\u00a0bitcoin, as its public transaction\u00a0ledger.\u00a0Satoshi Nakamoto\u2019s aim in creating the decentralized Bitcoin ledger\u2014the blockchain\u2014was to allow users to control their own money so that no third party, not even the government, would be able to access or monitor it.\n\nThe creator of Bitcoin, Satoshi, disappeared back in 2011, leaving behind open-source software that the users of Bitcoin could update and improve.\n\nThe invention of the blockchain for Bitcoin made it the first digital currency to solve the double spending problem without the need of a trusted central authority or central server.\n\nThe Bitcoin design has been the inspiration for other applications.\n\nInternet Technology vs Blockchain Technology\n\nIn the 1990s, when internet technology (TCP/IP or HTTP) was in the native stages, email was the first major application. Later new applications like web browsers came. Websites became popular. People started using chat software like Skype. Now if you look at your mobile, see how many different applications are run using the Internet.\n\nSimilarly, when blockchain technology emerged, bitcoin was the first major application that used it. Other cryptocurrencies followed the trend. Now, blockchain technology is used in a variety of applications like security, online voting, etc.\n\nSimply put, the Internet allows computers to exchange information; Blockchain allows computers to record information.\n\nBoth use a lot\u00a0of computers (nodes).\n\nThe Digital Economy, Wikinomics is bold on the subject and reflects on Blockchain that:\n\nThe first generation of the digital revolution brought us the Internet of information. The second generation \u2014 powered by blockchain technology \u2014 is bringing us the Internet of value: a new platform to\u00a0reshape the world of business and transform the old order of human affairs for the better.\n\nBlockchain is a vast, global distributed ledger or database running on millions of devices and open to anyone, where not just information but anything of value \u2014 money, but also titles, deeds, identities, even votes \u2014 can be moved, stored and managed securely and privately. Trust is established through mass collaboration and clever code rather than by powerful intermediaries like governments and banks.\n\nTechnologies behind blockchain technology!\n\nPrivate Key Cryptography\nP2P Network (Peer-2-Peer)\nProgram (the blockchain\u2019s protocol)\nWhat is the need for blockchain technology?\n\nThe blockchain is a mechanism to bring everyone to the highest degree of accountability. No more missed transactions, human or machine errors, or an exchange that was not done with the consent of the parties involved.\n\nThe most critical area where Blockchain helps is to guarantee the validity of a transaction by recording it not only on the main register but a connected distributed system of registers, all of which are connected through a secure validation mechanism.\n\nBlockchain technology can find applications in the following areas in the future:\n\nSmart contracts \u2013 Any industry heavily reliant on contracts, such as insurance, financial institutions, real estate, construction, entertainment, and law, would benefit from blockchain\u2019s indisputable way of updating, managing, tracking, and securing contracts. Smart contracts, those that are embedded with if/then statements and are executed without the involvement of an intermediary, also use blockchain technology.\nSupply chain management \u2013\u00a0Whenever value changes hands or the status of an asset changes, blockchain is ideally suited for managing the process.\nAsset protection \u2013\u00a0Whether you\u2019re a musician who wants to ensure you get royalties when your music gets played or a property owner, blockchain technology can help you protect your assets by creating an indisputable record of real-time ownership.\nPersonal Identification \u2013 Governments manage vast amounts of personal data from birth and death records to marriage certificates, passports, and census data. Blockchain technology offers a streamlined solution for managing all of it securely.\nPayment processing \u2013\u00a0Blockchain has the potential to be highly transformative to any company that processes payments. It can eliminate the need for intermediaries that are common in payment processing today.\nCrowdfunding \u2013\u00a0As with traditional crowdfunding, a blockchain-powered crowdfunding campaign seeks to secure investment for a new project from an interested community. But in this instance, funding is most likely to come in the form of bitcoin or other cryptocurrencies.\nBlockchain technology \u2013 opportunities and advantages\n\nThe blockchain allows our smart devices to speak to each other better and faster.\nBlockchain solves the problem of manipulation.\u00a0It brings everyone to the highest degree of accountability.\nOnline identity and reputation will be decentralized. We will own the data that belongs to us.\nCryptocurrencies take the power away from governments to control the value of currencies and hand it to people.\nThe potential is great for people in the informal economy to exploit the blockchain\u2019s middleman-free way to exchange assets.\nBlockchain technology can more equitably address issues related to freedom, jurisdiction, censorship, and regulation, perhaps in ways that nation-state models and international diplomacy efforts regarding human rights cannot.\nBlockchain-based systems allow for the removal of intermediaries involved in the record-keeping and transfer of assets.\nThe removal of intermediaries and settlement on distributed ledgers allows for dramatically increased transaction speeds compared to a wide range of existing systems.\nData entered on the blockchain is immutable, preventing fraud through manipulating transactions and the history of data. Transactions entered on the blockchain provide a clear trail to the very start of the blockchain allowing any transaction to be easily investigated and audited.\n\nRead:\u00a0National Blockchain Framework\n\nBlockchain Technology \u2013 Criticisms and Challenges\n\nHuge power required: Remember all that computing power required to verify transactions? Those computers need electricity. Bitcoin is a poster child of the problematic escalation in power demanded by a large blockchain network. That\u2019s not appealing given today\u2019s concerns about climate change, the availability of power in developing countries, and the reliability of power in developed nations.\n\nSecurity about the private key: The private key must remain secret at all times because revealing it to third parties is equivalent to giving them control over the bitcoins secured by that key. The private key must also be backed up and protected from accidental loss, because if it\u2019s lost it cannot be recovered and the funds secured by it are forever lost, too.\n\nTransaction speed: Transaction speed is also an issue. As we noted above, blocks in a chain must be verified by the distributed network, and that can take time.\n\nSummary\n\nIn scaling society up from tribes and small groups, governments have had to confront the problem of enabling secure commerce and other interactions among strangers. The methods now may be very different, but the goal is still the same \u2013 a secure way of transactions.\n\nThe complex world of big data and IoT is emerging.\u00a0 Blockchain\u00a0will be an important part of our financial and technological digital future.\n\nThe \u2018blockchain\u2019 technology behind Bitcoin could prove to be an ingredient of an entirely new world of technology, as big as the internet itself, a wave of innovation that drives the middleman out of much commerce and leaves us much more free to exchange goods and services with people all over the world without going through corporate intermediaries.\n\nIt could radically decentralize society itself, getting rid of the need for banks, governments, even companies and politicians.\n\nRead:\u00a0Bitcoin halving\n\nReferences\nInvestopedia\u00a0| FusionTourism\u00a0| Blockgeeks\u00a0| Wikipedia\u00a0| Digitial Trends\u00a0| Efuture\u00a0| Forbes"

            "[CONTENT]": "Bitcoin halving is a significant event in the cryptocurrency world that directly impacts the number of new bitcoins generated and rewarded to miners for validating transactions and securing the Bitcoin network. Read here to learn more about it.\n\nThis event occurs approximately every four years, or more precisely, every 210,000 blocks.\n\nThe process is a core part of Bitcoin\u2018s economic model, based on deflationary principles, to control the supply of new bitcoins entering the market and, over time, mimic the scarcity and value preservation similar to precious metals like gold.\n\nWhat is the significance of this event and why does it matter to cryptocurrency investors?\n\nTable of Contents\n\nWhat Happens During a Bitcoin Halving?\nSignificance of Bitcoin Halving\nWhat impact will the Bitcoin Halving have on investors?\nChallenges and Criticisms\nWhy in the news?\nFuture of Bitcoin Halving\nConclusion\nWhat Happens During a Bitcoin Halving?\n\nWhen Bitcoin miners successfully process other people\u2019s cryptocurrency transactions and add them to the blockchain, a public digital record, they are rewarded with 50% less money. This is known as the \u201cBitcoin Halving.\u201d\n\nMining Bitcoin requires sophisticated computer hardware to solve a challenging mathematical puzzle through a method called \u201cProof of work,\u201d which is necessary to \u201cgrow\u201d the blockchain and maintain the ecosystem.\n\n\ud83d\udc49 Which year are YOU targeting for success in the IAS/IPS/IFS Exam? \ud83d\ude80\n\n(1) \u21d2 UPSC 2025: Prelims cum Mains\n\n(2) \u21d2 UPSC 2026: Prelims cum Mains\n\n(3) \u21d2 UPSC 2027 Prelims cum Mains\n\nTip: Know more about ClearIAS Courses (Online/Offline)\n\nBitcoin transactions have a significant carbon footprint and need a significant amount of power due to their intensive activity.\n\nDuring a Bitcoin halving, the reward that miners receive for adding a new block to the Bitcoin blockchain is cut in half.\n\nWhen Bitcoin was first introduced in 2009, the block reward was 50 bitcoins per block.\nThe first halving in 2012 reduced this reward to 25 bitcoins, the second halving in 2016 brought it down to 12.5 bitcoins, and the third halving in 2020 further reduced the reward to 6.25 bitcoins per block.\nThe next halving is expected to occur in 2024, which will decrease the block reward to 3.125 bitcoins.\nSignificance of Bitcoin Halving\nControlled Supply: Bitcoin\u2019s total supply is capped at 21 million coins. Halvings are crucial to ensure that this cap is not reached too quickly. By reducing the rate at which new bitcoins are generated, Bitcoin mimics the extraction curve of a resource like gold\u2014becoming harder and more resource-intensive to mine over time.\nInflation Rate: Halving events decreases the rate at which new bitcoins are created, effectively lowering the inflation rate of the Bitcoin ecosystem. This is in stark contrast to fiat currencies, where central banks can print money at will, potentially leading to high inflation.\nMarket Impact: Historically, halving events have led to increased public interest and speculative activity around Bitcoin, often resulting in significant price movements. Many investors view halving as a bullish event due to the reduced supply of new bitcoins against what is assumed to be a consistently growing or stable demand.\nMiner\u2019s Revenue: The halving can impact miners\u2019 profitability as their rewards for mining new blocks are reduced. However, if the price of Bitcoin increases sufficiently following a halving, it can potentially offset the reduced block reward, maintaining or even increasing the profitability of mining.\nWhat impact will the Bitcoin Halving have on investors?\n\nThese impacts are multifaceted, affecting investor sentiment, market volatility, and the long-term valuation of Bitcoin. Understanding these impacts can help investors navigate the complexities of cryptocurrency markets, especially around halving events.\n\nShort-term Impact on Investors\n\nIncreased Volatility: Halving events often leads to increased market volatility. Investors might see significant price swings as the halving approaches and in the immediate aftermath. This volatility can create profit opportunities but also poses substantial risks.\nSpeculative Trading: The anticipation of a halving can attract speculative trading, as some investors may buy Bitcoin hoping its price will increase post-halving, given the reduced supply of new bitcoins entering the market. This speculative frenzy can inflate prices temporarily but can also lead to corrections if the price increase is not sustained in the aftermath.\n\nLong-term Impact on Investors\n\nPotential Price Appreciation: Historically, Bitcoin\u2019s price has appreciated significantly following halving events, although past performance is not indicative of future results. The reduced pace at which new bitcoins are generated post-halving can create supply pressures if demand remains constant or increases, potentially driving up the price over the long term.\nIncreased Institutional Interest: The deflationary aspect of Bitcoin becomes more pronounced with each halving, which can attract institutional investors looking for a hedge against inflation. Increased institutional investment can bring more stability to the Bitcoin market, benefiting long-term investors.\nRisk and Reward Reassessment: The changing dynamics post-halving require investors to reassess their risk and reward expectations. As the block reward decreases and the cost of mining increases, the security and economic model of Bitcoin may also evolve, affecting its long-term viability and value.\nChallenges and Criticisms\nMiner Concentration: As block rewards decrease, smaller miners may find it unprofitable to continue mining, potentially leading to a concentration of mining power among large-scale mining operations. This centralization can pose security risks to the Bitcoin network.\nMarket Volatility: Halving events can introduce significant volatility in the Bitcoin market. Speculative trading in anticipation of price increases can lead to sharp price swings.\nEnergy Consumption: The Bitcoin mining process is energy-intensive, and as the rewards decrease, there is a concern about the sustainability of mining practices, especially if the energy used is sourced from non-renewable resources.\nWhy in the news?\n\nThe next Bitcoin Halving is due to take place around April 2024.\n\nAs of February 14, 2024, the price of 1 BTC was around $49,528. This means a mining reward on February 14 would be worth around $3,09,550 (6.25 x price of 1 BTC).\nWhether this value will rise or fall after the Bitcoin Halving depends on the price of Bitcoin.\nFuture of Bitcoin Halving\n\nThe process of halving will continue approximately every four years until the maximum supply of 21 million bitcoins has been mined, which is expected to occur around the year 2140.\n\nAfter the last Bitcoin halving, miners will no longer receive block rewards in the form of new bitcoins.\n\nInstead, their compensation will solely come from transaction fees paid by users to process transactions. This shift is anticipated to ensure the long-term economic viability and security of the Bitcoin network.\n\nConclusion\n\nBitcoin halving remains a fundamental aspect of Bitcoin\u2019s economic model, demonstrating its unique approach to creating a decentralized, deflationary, and digital store of value. While it presents challenges, particularly for miners, its historical significance in driving interest and investment in Bitcoin cannot be understated.\n\n-Article by Swathi Satish"

            "[CONTENT]": "What is a Conjugate Vaccine? What are the highlights of the Typbar Typhoid Conjugate Vaccine? What is the significance of the Typbar Typhoid Vaccine?\n\nTyphoid fever, a life-threatening bacterial infection caused by the bacterium Salmonella Typhi, remains a significant public health issue globally, especially in developing regions lacking access to clean water and sanitation.\n\nIn India as well typhoid fever remains an important public health challenge that disproportionately impacts children.\n\nTypbar Typhoid Conjugate Vaccine (TCV)\u00a0 was developed by Hyderabad-based Bharat Biotech which is the world\u2019s first clinically proven conjugate vaccine offering long-term protection against typhoid.\n\nTable of Contents\n\nTypbar Typhoid Vaccine\nWhat is a Conjugate Vaccine?\nSignificance of Typbar Typhoid Vaccine\nTyphoid Disease Burden\nRole of Vaccination\nWhy in the news?\nTrial Design of Typbar Typhoid Vaccine\nKey Findings\nThe Way Forward\nConclusion\nTypbar Typhoid Vaccine\n\nThe Typbar vaccine is a well-known vaccine used to prevent typhoid fever, a serious and potentially fatal disease caused by the bacterium Salmonella Typhi. The Typbar vaccine is significant in public health efforts, especially in endemic regions, as it helps reduce the incidence of this disease.\n\nTypbar is available in two main forms:\n\nTypbar TCV (Typhoid Conjugate Vaccine): This is a more recent and advanced version, suitable for children as young as six months of age, and provides longer-lasting immunity than the older polysaccharide vaccines. It is a conjugate vaccine, which means that the polysaccharide antigen is chemically linked to a carrier protein, enhancing the immune system\u2019s response to the vaccine.\nTypbar Vi Polysaccharide Vaccine: This is an older version of the typhoid vaccine, suitable for children over two years of age and adults. It offers good protection but needs to be administered more frequently than the TCV for sustained immunity.\n\nEfficacy and Duration:\n\n\ud83d\udc49 Which year are YOU targeting for success in the IAS/IPS/IFS Exam? \ud83d\ude80\n\n(1) \u21d2 UPSC 2025: Prelims cum Mains\n\n(2) \u21d2 UPSC 2026: Prelims cum Mains\n\n(3) \u21d2 UPSC 2027 Prelims cum Mains\n\nTip: Know more about ClearIAS Courses (Online/Offline)\n\nTypbar TCV: Studies have shown that the Typbar TCV is highly effective in preventing typhoid fever, with a single dose providing long-lasting protection. The World Health Organization (WHO) has recommended the Typbar TCV for routine immunization programs, especially in countries with high typhoid prevalence. The protection duration is believed to be at least 5 years, with ongoing studies to determine the exact duration of immunity.\nTypbar Vi Polysaccharide Vaccine: While effective, the immunity from the polysaccharide vaccine tends to wane after 2 to 3 years, necessitating booster doses for continued protection.\n\nAdministration:\n\nThe Typbar vaccine is administered as an injection. The TCV is usually given as a single dose, which can simplify vaccination campaigns and ensure broader coverage in endemic areas.\n\nSafety and Side Effects:\n\nThe Typbar vaccine is generally safe and well-tolerated. Common side effects are mild and may include pain at the injection site, fever, headache, and nausea. These side effects typically resolve without treatment within a few days.\n\nWhat is a Conjugate Vaccine?\n\nTypbar TCV is a conjugate vaccine.\n\nConjugate vaccines combine a weak antigen with a strong antigen or carrier protein. This augments the immune response to the weak antigen, creating a more robust and durable immune response.\n\nFor Typbar, the weak S. Typhi antigen is conjugated with a carrier protein. When injected, this triggers the body to produce T-cell-dependent anti-S. Typhi antibodies and memory B cells.\n\nThe carrier protein enables the induction of immune memory, providing long-lasting immunity against typhoid fever.\n\nAlso read: Immunity: Understand Human Immune System\n\nSignificance of Typbar Typhoid Vaccine\n\nThe significance of the Typbar Typhoid Vaccine is:\n\nThe results so far demonstrate Typbar TCV\u2019s ability to provide durable, long-term protection against typhoid fever in both children and adults.\nIt is the first typhoid vaccine to show efficacy beyond 2 years post-vaccination.\nEarlier efficacy trials had follow-up periods of only 2-3 years after vaccination.\nThe 4-year protection data is vital evidence for policymakers considering large-scale typhoid vaccination.\nThe findings validate Typbar TCV\u2019s role in long-term typhoid control and prevention in endemic regions.\nTyphoid Disease Burden\n\nTyphoid remains a serious public health problem that disproportionately impacts children and marginalized populations in Asia and Sub-Saharan Africa lacking access to safe water and sanitation.\n\nIn 2019, nearly 11 million typhoid cases and 110,000 typhoid deaths occurred globally.\nChildren bear the highest burden, with the majority of cases and deaths occurring in children under 15 years of age.\nSouth Asia accounts for nearly 80% of the global typhoid burden, followed by Sub-Saharan Africa.\nAntimicrobial resistance is making typhoid harder to treat, increasing risks of complications and death.\nOutbreaks continue to emerge globally, including in Fiji, Pakistan, and the Democratic Republic of Congo in recent years.\nClimate change and increasing urbanization may further increase typhoid risk in vulnerable regions.\n\nAlso Read: Sanitation System in India\n\nRole of Vaccination\n\nThe role of vaccination for typhoid is:\n\nTyphoid vaccination is an important prevention strategy, alongside safe water, sanitation, and hygiene interventions.\nMultiple typhoid vaccines exist, but Typbar TCV is the only one suitable for children under 2 years old.\nIts compatibility with routine childhood immunization schedules facilitates reaching high coverage.\nWHO recommends routine programmatic use of TCVs in typhoid-endemic countries.\nGavi provides financial support for vaccine introduction in eligible low-income countries.\nOver 20 countries have introduced TCVs so far, including Nepal, Bangladesh, Pakistan, Liberia, Zimbabwe, and India.\nWidespread TCV vaccination can significantly reduce disease incidence and save lives.\nWhy in the news?\n\nRecently, a phase-3 clinical trial conducted in Malawi, Africa has demonstrated the long-term protective efficacy of Bharat Biotech\u2019s Typbar Typhoid Conjugate Vaccine (TCV) in children and adults.\n\nThese landmark findings have vital implications for India\u2019s typhoid control strategy.\n\nThe trial provides the first evidence of long-term efficacy for TCVs in children aged 9 months to 12 years.\n\nTypbar TCV conferred 77% protective efficacy against typhoid fever through 4 years post-vaccination.\nThe efficacy was consistent across all age groups studied, including infants, toddlers, young children, and older children.\nTypbar is the world\u2019s first clinically proven conjugate typhoid vaccine with long-term protection data.\nThe results validate Typbar TCV as a tool to improve long-term typhoid fever control in endemic regions.\nTrial Design of Typbar Typhoid Vaccine\n\nPhase 3, a double-blind, randomized, controlled field trial was conducted from 2015 to 2019 in Blantyre, Malawi. This urban area has a high burden of typhoid.\n\nThe trial had over 20,000 participants aged between 9 months and 45 years. They were randomized to receive either a single dose of Typbar TCV or a control vaccine.\n\nBlood samples were collected and tested for anti-S. Typhi antibodies periodically after vaccination. Participants were followed for typhoid fever incidence through passive surveillance at health centers.\n\nKey Findings\n\nSome important findings related to the Typbar Typhoid Vaccine are:\n\nFrom 9 months to 4 years post-vaccination, the cumulative efficacy of Typbar was 77%.\nProtection was consistent across all pediatric age cohorts \u2013 infants, toddlers, young children, and older children.\nSeroconversion rates (antibody response) exceeded 90% in all age groups.\nNo significant waning in antibody titers occurred during the 4 years, indicating sustained vaccine effectiveness.\nThe vaccine was well-tolerated with no serious adverse events reported.\nThe Way Forward\n\nThe Malawi trial results validate Typbar TCV as an effective, practical tool for long-term typhoid control even in very young children.\n\nPolicymakers in typhoid-endemic countries should utilize these findings to make evidence-based decisions on national typhoid vaccination policies and strategies.\n\nFinancial and technical support from partners like Gavi must continue to expedite TCV rollout in countries that need them most.\n\nInvesting in typhoid vaccines today will ultimately help save lives, reduce poverty, unlock human potential, and accelerate progress towards the UN Sustainable Development Goals.\n\nConclusion\n\nThe proven long-term efficacy of Typbar TCV is a game-changer for typhoid control in India.\n\nWidespread TCV vaccination, as recommended by WHO, combined with continued investments in water, sanitation, and hygiene, will be pivotal for India to achieve its target of typhoid elimination by 2030 in line with the Sustainable Development Goals.\n\nOn the self-reliance front, Typbar demonstrates India\u2019s growing capabilities in developing and producing life-saving vaccines domestically.\n\nRead: Modern vaccines: Why do they have low durability?\n\nArticle Written By: Priti Raj"

This article delves into the intricacies of BCIs, exploring their development, functioning, applications, and the ethical considerations they entail.\n\nIn the latest developments in Neurotechnology, Neuralink has developed a fully implantable Brain-Computer Interface (BCI) that allows direct communication between the brain and computer.\n\nNueralink\u2019s first product will be telepathy, which will allow users to control a computer or phone just by thinking.\n\nTable of Contents\n\nBrain-Computer Interface (BCI)\nHow do BCIs Work?\nTypes of BCIs\nApplications of Brain-Computer Interface\nChallenges and Ethical Considerations\nExamples of BCIs developed\nConclusion\nBrain-Computer Interface (BCI)\n\nBCI facilitates direct communication between the brain and external devices, effectively bypassing conventional neuromuscular pathways.\n\nBCIs hold immense potential in medical rehabilitation, assistive technologies, and even in augmenting human capabilities.\n\nThe concept of BCIs has evolved significantly since the early 20th century, with pivotal research in neurophysiology and computer technology laying the groundwork. Initial experiments in the late 1900s demonstrated the feasibility of direct brain-to-machine communication.\n\n\ud83d\udc49 Which year are YOU targeting for success in the IAS/IPS/IFS Exam? \ud83d\ude80\n\n(1) \u21d2 UPSC 2025: Prelims cum Mains\n\n(2) \u21d2 UPSC 2026: Prelims cum Mains\n\n(3) \u21d2 UPSC 2027 Prelims cum Mains\n\nTip: Know more about ClearIAS Courses (Online/Offline)\n\nHow do BCIs Work?\nBCIs read brain signals, translate them into digital commands, and send these commands to an output device. This process involves signal acquisition, signal processing, and command execution.\nThere are invasive (implanted electrodes) and non-invasive methods (EEG, fMRI) of signal acquisition. Invasive methods offer higher accuracy but come with greater medical risks.\nTypes of BCIs\n\nThere are two main types of brain-computer interfaces: invasive and non-invasive.\n\nInvasive BCI\n\nUsing surgical techniques, invasive BCIs are implanted directly into a patient\u2019s brain tissue.\nInvasive brain-computer interfaces (BCIs) are a better option for individuals recovering from serious diseases such as paralysis, accidents, and neuromuscular disorders since surgery carries significant risks.\n\nNon-invasive BCI\n\nWhen a patient wears a non-invasive brain-machine interface (BCI), an electrical sensor-equipped device acts as a two-way communication channel between the patient\u2019s brain and the machine.\nSince these brain-computer connections aren\u2019t attached directly to brain tissue, their impulses are weaker.\nTherefore, non-invasive BCIs would be more appropriate for applications like augmented reality, virtual gaming, and controlling the movements of robots and other devices.\nApplications of Brain-Computer Interface\nMedical Rehabilitation: BCIs have been instrumental in aiding patients with paralysis or loss of limb function. Devices controlled by neural activity can restore some degree of autonomy, enabling individuals to control prosthetic limbs, wheelchairs, or computers.\nCommunication Aid: For individuals with conditions like ALS or severe paralysis, BCIs offer a means of communication, using brain signals to operate speech-generating devices or keyboards.\nNeurofeedback and Therapy: BCIs are used in neurofeedback therapies for conditions like ADHD or PTSD, helping patients learn to regulate their brain activity.\nAugmenting Human Capabilities: In non-medical applications, BCIs are being explored for enhancing cognitive abilities, gaming, and even in military applications.\nDrones: Research is been going on to develop hands-free drones for military use. This would allow soldiers to telepathically control swarms of unmanned aerial vehicles.\nChallenges and Ethical Considerations\nTechnical Challenges: The accuracy, speed, and reliability of BCIs are ongoing challenges. Signal interference and the complexity of the brain\u2019s neural network are significant hurdles.\nEthical and Privacy Issues: BCIs raise ethical questions about privacy (thoughts read by machines), identity (changes in self-perception), and equity (access to advanced technologies).\nRegulatory Hurdles: The regulation of BCIs, especially in medical contexts, is complex, involving various standards and approvals to ensure safety and efficacy.\nSocial Impact: As BCIs become more prevalent, there are concerns about societal impacts, including the potential for widening the gap between those with access to such technologies and those without.\nExamples of BCIs developed\n\nNEURALINK\u2019S COIN-SIZED BRAIN CHIP\n\nThe neurotechnology company, headed by Elon Musk, is developing a coin-sized surgical implant. To monitor brain activity as closely as possible, Neuralink\u2019s device, the Link, uses micron-scale wires of electrodes that fan out into the brain. Its primary focus is to treat paralysis. In addition to a \u201cFitbit for your skull,\u201d the startup is building an eight-foot robot to place the neural threads.\n\nNEURABLE\u2019S BCI-ENHANCED HEADPHONES\n\nThe brain-computer interface startup is building software and hardware, in the form of headphones that interpret brain signals to level up productivity. The wearable, BCI-enhanced device auto-mutes notifications, activates noise canceling, and turns on \u2018Do Not Disturb.\u2019 It also tracks how different songs and genres impact a user\u2019s focus, then recommends personalized playlists and suggests breaks.\n\nPRECISION NEUROSCIENCE\u2019S ELECTRODE-PACKED FILM\n\nThe neural platform is approaching brain-computer interface systems with a surgically implanted brain chip that\u2019s minimally invasive and fully reversible. The Layer 7 Cortical Interface is a thin film of micro-electrodes, about 1.5 centimeters in length and a fraction of a hair thick, that conforms to the brain\u2019s cortex just under the skull without damaging any tissue. Precision tech wants to mainstream BCIs from small-scale research labs to medical facilities as a way to treat neurological diseases. In June 2023, Precision conducted an in-human clinical study of its neural implant.\n\nSYNCHRON\u2019S ENDOVASCULAR ALLOY CHIP\u00a0\n\nBacked by Bill Gates and Jeff Bezos, Synchron, a bioelectronics medicine company, is mapping the brain via blood vessels. Inserted through the jugular vein, the Stentrode is a neuroprosthesis placed in the superior sagittal sinus near the motor cortex. The eight-millimeter flexible alloy chip transmits neurological signals to a receiver unit implanted into the patient\u2019s chest, which then translates thoughts into clicks and keystrokes on a computer or mobile device in real-time. Synchron received approval from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration for human clinical trials in 2021, totaling four patients thus far, according to medical journal JAMA Network.\n\nBLACKROCK NEUROTECH\u2019S MESH LACE\n\nThe neurotech platform Blackrock Neurotech has been testing its devices in humans since 2004 in its two decades of brain-computer interface development. Blackrock\u2019s product portfolio has helped patients regain tactile function, movement of their limbs and prosthetics as well as the ability to control digital devices solely from thought. Its latest project, Neuralace, is a flexible, hexagonal mesh patch \u2014 thinner than an eyelash \u2014 designed to conform to the fissures and sulci of the brain. Its large surface area can capture 10,000 neural channels, inching closer to whole-brain data capture.\n\nConclusion\n\nBrain-computer interfaces stand at the convergence of technology and human cognition, offering revolutionary applications that could redefine medical treatment, communication, and human-computer interaction.\n\nWhile the path forward is fraught with technical, ethical, and social challenges, the potential benefits of BCIs in improving quality of life and enhancing human capabilities are immense.\n\nThe future of BCIs is incredibly promising, with ongoing research pushing the boundaries of what is possible. Developments in machine learning, nanotechnology, and neuroimaging are likely to enhance the capabilities and applications of BCIs.\nCollaborative efforts between neuroscientists, engineers, ethicists, and policymakers are crucial to addressing the challenges and harnessing the full potential of BCIs responsibly.\n\nAs we venture further into this uncharted territory, it is imperative to navigate these challenges thoughtfully, ensuring that the development of BCIs is guided by a commitment to bettering human lives and upholding ethical standards.\n\nAlso Read:\u00a0Artificial Neural Network\n\n-Article by Swathi Satish"

The energy emitted during a GRB is so intense that it can outshine an entire galaxy for a brief moment.\n\nGamma-ray bursts were first discovered in the late 1960s by satellites designed to monitor the Partial Test Ban Treaty.\n\nThe Vela satellites, part of the United States Vela Hotel program, detected bursts of gamma rays coming from random directions in space.\nSince then, dedicated satellites like NASA\u2019s Swift Observatory and the Fermi Gamma-ray Space Telescope have been used to observe and study GRBs.\n\nGamma-ray bursts are broadly classified into two types:\n\nLong-duration bursts, lasting more than two seconds, are associated with the collapse of massive stars. The progenitors of long-duration gamma-ray bursts are believed to be massive stars that have exhausted their nuclear fuel and undergo core collapse, leading to the formation of a black hole.\nShort-duration bursts, lasting less than two seconds, are thought to result from the merger of compact objects like neutron stars. Short-duration bursts are associated with the merger of compact binary systems, such as neutron star-neutron star or neutron star-black hole pairs.\nThe scientific significance of GRBs\n\nAfter the initial burst of gamma rays, there is often an \u201cafterglow\u201d in other wavelengths, such as X-rays, visible light, and radio waves.\n\nStudying the afterglows allows astronomers to gather information about the environment surrounding the burst, the distance to the burst, and the nature of the progenitor system.\n\nGamma-ray bursts are distributed isotropically in the sky, indicating that they come from all directions in the universe.\n\nThey are thought to be associated with extremely distant and powerful events.\nBecause of their immense energy, they can be detected across vast cosmic distances, providing insights into the early universe.\n\nWhile gamma-ray bursts are intriguing cosmic phenomena, they are not a direct threat to Earth.\n\nThe intense bursts of gamma rays, however, could potentially impact the atmospheres of planets in the line of sight if they were to occur in relatively proximity to our solar system.\n\nStudying gamma-ray bursts is crucial for understanding the processes associated with extreme astrophysical events, the formation and behavior of black holes, and the conditions in the early universe. They serve as natural laboratories for testing the limits of our understanding of physics.\n\nImpact of GRBs on Planets\n\nWhile GRBs themselves are not a direct threat to planets in the vicinity, their impact could potentially influence the atmospheres of planets under certain conditions.\n\nIonization of Atmospheres: The intense gamma-ray radiation from a GRB could ionize the atmospheres of planets in the line of sight. This ionization process involves stripping electrons from atoms, creating charged particles. The extent of ionization depends on factors such as the distance from the GRB, the intensity of the burst, and the composition of the planet\u2019s atmosphere.\nOzone Depletion: Gamma-ray bursts have the potential to deplete ozone in a planet\u2019s atmosphere. The high-energy gamma rays can break apart oxygen molecules in the atmosphere, leading to the destruction of ozone. Ozone depletion could have implications for a planet\u2019s climate and the levels of ultraviolet radiation reaching the surface.\nBiological Impact: On Earth, the ozone layer provides a crucial shield against harmful ultraviolet (UV) radiation from the Sun. If a nearby GRB were to cause significant ozone depletion, it could have adverse effects on the biosphere by allowing more UV radiation to reach the surface. This could harm living organisms, particularly those not adapted to higher UV levels.\nGalactic and Cosmic Impacts: While individual GRBs are rare and generally occur at cosmological distances, their cumulative impact over cosmic time could have broader effects on the chemistry and composition of galaxies and the interstellar medium.\nPlanetary Conditions: The potential impact of a GRB on a planet\u2019s atmosphere also depends on the specific conditions of the planet, such as its atmospheric composition, magnetic field strength, and the presence of protective elements. Planets with thick atmospheres and strong magnetic fields may be more resilient to the effects of GRBs.\n\nThe impact of a GRB on a planet depends on its distance from the burst. The intensity of gamma-ray radiation diminishes with distance, so planets located far from the source of the GRB would experience less ionization and atmospheric effects\n\nConclusion\n\nGamma-ray bursts continue to be a fascinating area of research in astrophysics, and advances in observational technology and theoretical modeling contribute to our growing understanding of these spectacular cosmic events.\n\nRelated articles:\n\nFast Radio bursts\nMajor telescopes\n\n-Article by Swathi Satish"

            "[CONTENT]": "The Holocene extinction, often referred to as the Sixth Mass Extinction or Anthropocene Extinction, is an ongoing period of biodiversity loss marked by a significant decline in the diversity and abundance of various species on Earth. Read here to learn more.\n\nUnlike previous mass extinctions, the Holocene extinction is primarily driven by human activities, particularly habitat destruction, overexploitation of resources, pollution, climate change, and the introduction of invasive species.\n\nThe term \u201cHolocene\u201d refers to the current geological epoch, which began approximately 11,700 years ago and continues to the present day.\n\nTable of Contents\n\nHolocene Extinction\nWhy is the Holocene extinction worrying?\nExamples of recent extinctions\nEfforts to curb the sixth mass extinction\nDe-extinction\nConclusion\nHolocene Extinction\n\nThe primary driver of the Holocene extinction is human activity. The expansion of agriculture, urbanization, deforestation, industrialization, and other anthropogenic activities has led to widespread habitat destruction and fragmentation.\n\nOverexploitation: Overharvesting of natural resources, including overfishing, poaching, and hunting, has contributed to the decline of numerous species. Economic activities driven by human demand for food, medicine, and other products have led to the depletion of many populations.\nHabitat Loss and Fragmentation: The conversion of natural habitats into agricultural land, urban areas, and infrastructure projects has significantly reduced the available living space for many species. Habitat fragmentation isolates populations, making it challenging for them to survive and reproduce.\nClimate Change: Human-induced climate change is altering temperature patterns, precipitation, and ecosystems. These changes can lead to shifts in species distribution, disrupt ecological relationships, and exacerbate the vulnerability of certain species.\nPollution: Pollution from industrial activities, agriculture, and waste disposal has contaminated air, water, and soil. Chemical pollutants and plastic waste, in particular, have harmful effects on ecosystems and wildlife.\nInvasive Species: The introduction of non-native species to new environments, intentionally or accidentally, can outcompete or prey upon native species, leading to their decline or extinction.\n\nCurrently, 40% of all land has been converted for food production. Agriculture is also responsible for 90% of global deforestation and accounts for 70% of the planet\u2019s freshwater use, devastating the species that inhabit those places by significantly altering their habitats.\n\nIt\u2019s evident that where and how food is produced is one of the biggest human-caused threats to species extinction and our ecosystems.\n\n\ud83d\udc49 Which year are YOU targeting for success in the IAS/IPS/IFS Exam? \ud83d\ude80\n\n(1) \u21d2 UPSC 2025: Prelims cum Mains\n\n(2) \u21d2 UPSC 2026: Prelims cum Mains\n\n(3) \u21d2 UPSC 2027 Prelims cum Mains\n\nTip: Know more about ClearIAS Courses (Online/Offline)\n\nUnsustainable food production and consumption are significant contributors to greenhouse gas emissions that are causing atmospheric temperatures to rise, wreaking havoc across the globe.\nThe climate crisis is causing everything from severe droughts to more frequent and intense storms.\nIt also exacerbates the challenges associated with food production that stress species, while creating conditions that make their habitats inhospitable.\nIncreased droughts and floods have made it more difficult to maintain crops and produce sufficient food in some regions.\nThe intertwined relationships among the food system, climate change, and biodiversity loss are placing immense pressure on our planet.\nWhy is the Holocene extinction worrying?\n\nSpecies do not exist in isolation; they are interconnected. A single species interacts with many other species in specific ways that produce benefits to people, like clean air, clean water, and healthy soils for efficient food production.\n\nWhen one species goes extinct in an ecosystem or its population numbers decline so significantly that it cannot sustain its important function, other species are affected, impacting the way the ecosystem functions and the benefits it provides.\n\nCurrently, the species extinction rate is estimated between 1,000 and 10,000 times higher than natural extinction rates, the rate of species extinction that would occur if humans were not around.\n\nWhile extinctions are a normal part of the evolutionary process, the current rates of species population decline and species extinction are high enough to threaten important ecological functions that support human life on Earth, such as a stable climate, predictable regional precipitation patterns, and productive farmland and fisheries.\n\nExamples of recent extinctions\n\nThe International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) characterizes \u2018recent\u2019 extinction as those that have occurred past the cut-off point of 1500, and at least 875 plant and animal species have gone extinct since that time and 2009.\n\nWhile it\u2019s challenging to provide a comprehensive list of all affected species, here are some examples of species that have been particularly impacted by the Holocene extinction:\n\nAmphibians:\n\nHarlequin Frog: Many species of harlequin frogs, once abundant in Central and South America, have experienced dramatic declines due to a combination of habitat loss and the spread of the chytrid fungus.\n\nBirds:\n\nPassenger Pigeon: The passenger pigeon was once one of the most abundant bird species in North America but became extinct in the early 20th century due to habitat destruction and overhunting.\nCalifornia Condor: Facing threats from lead poisoning, habitat destruction, and hunting, the California condor is one of the most critically endangered bird species.\n\nMammals:\n\nNorthern White Rhinoceros: The northern white rhinoceros is functionally extinct, with only two surviving females. Poaching for their horns and habitat loss have contributed to their decline.\nSumatran Orangutan: Orangutans, particularly the Sumatran orangutan, face severe threats from habitat destruction, primarily due to palm oil plantations.\nJavan Tiger: The Javan tiger became extinct in the mid-20th century due to habitat loss and hunting.\nPinta Island Tortoise: Lonesome George, the last known individual of this tortoise species, died in 2012, marking the species\u2019 extinction.\n\nReptiles:\n\nVaquita: The vaquita, a small porpoise species, is critically endangered, with a population decline primarily attributed to bycatch in illegal gillnets.\n\nInsects:\n\nMonarch Butterfly: The monarch butterfly population has declined due to habitat loss, pesticide use, and climate change, affecting their migratory patterns.\n\nFish:\n\nChinese Paddlefish: Declared extinct in 2020, the Chinese paddlefish was a large freshwater species that declined due to overfishing, habitat degradation, and dam construction.\n\nPlants:\n\nFranklinia Tree: This tree species, native to the southeastern United States, is believed to be extinct in the wild due to habitat loss.\n\nMarine Species:\n\nGreat Barrier Reef Corals: Coral reefs, including those in the Great Barrier Reef, are facing significant threats from climate change, coral bleaching, and ocean acidification.\nEfforts to curb the sixth mass extinction\nParis Agreement: We can ramp up our commitments to cutting carbon emissions under the Paris Agreement and limit global warming to 1.5 degrees Celsius.\nKunming-Montreal Agreement:\u00a0 The global fraternity needs to put more effort into conserving at least 30% of lands, inland waters, and oceans worldwide.\nDe-extinction\n\nDe-extinction reverses plant and animal extinctions by creating new proxy versions of previously lost species. Conservationists frame de-extinction as \u201cdeep ecological enrichment\u201d or restoring ecosystem functions lost through the extinctions of keystone species, which leave an ecological void by their absence.\n\nThis idea is the motivation for de-extinction projects: releasing resurrected animals into suitable habitats to increase biodiversity and restore ecosystem resilience. Assisted breeding, cloning, and genome editing are species restoration methods undertaken with the goal of re-establishing the dynamic processes that produce healthy ecosystems and restore biodiversity.\n\nTo de-extinct species, there are established research methods which include assisted breeding, cloning, and genetic engineering.\n\nAssisted breeding\u00a0uses the principles of\u00a0biobanking\u00a0and\u00a0assisted reproductive technologies to help restore species.\nAssisted reproductive scientists have highly characterized assisted breeding technologies in model species. However, non-model species have not been characterized at all, and this set includes many critically endangered species. These technologies enable scientists to increase overall population fitness and heterozygosity within fragmented populations.\nOne of the best examples of successful assisted reproductive technologies (ART) for species with declining populations is the Northern White Rhino project, which has been underway for decades and continues today. In projects such as these, scientists retrieve and preserve gametes (oocytes and sperm) from populations at the brink of extinction.\nCloning\u00a0is another option useful for continuing a species, but not for returning or bringing back a lost one.\nGenome editing and synthetic genomics, using tools like CRISPR, are addressing de-extinction with positive results.\nConclusion\n\nThe Holocene extinction underscores the urgency of addressing human-induced threats to biodiversity and implementing effective conservation strategies to ensure the survival of diverse species and the health of ecosystems.\n\n-Article by Swathi Satish"

            "[CONTENT]": "An algal bloom refers to a rapid and excessive increase in the population of algae (phytoplankton) in aquatic ecosystems. Harmful algal blooms, or HABs, occur when colonies of algae grow out of control. Read here to learn more.\n\nRecently, a report was published about the sea turning red at Puducherry Beach, and the preliminary analysis suggests an algal bloom.\n\nRanging from microscopic, single-celled organisms to large seaweeds, algae are simple plants that form the base of food webs. Sometimes, however, their roles are more sinister.\n\nUnder the right conditions, algae may grow out of control and a few of these \u201cblooms\u201d produce toxins that can kill fish, mammals, and birds, and may cause human illness or even death in extreme cases.\n\nTable of Contents\n\nAlgal bloom\nTypes of Algae in Blooms\nCauses of algal blooms\nImpact of Algal Blooms\nPrevention and Mitigation\nConclusion\nAlgal bloom\n\nHarmful algal blooms in marine environments are often called \u201cred tides\u201c.\n\nThe sudden proliferation of algae can lead to visible discoloration of the water, often giving it a greenish hue, but blooms can also manifest in shades of red, brown, or other colors depending on the types of algae involved.\n\n\ud83d\udc49 Which year are YOU targeting for success in the IAS/IPS/IFS Exam? \ud83d\ude80\n\n(1) \u21d2 UPSC 2025: Prelims cum Mains\n\n(2) \u21d2 UPSC 2026: Prelims cum Mains\n\n(3) \u21d2 UPSC 2027 Prelims cum Mains\n\nTip: Know more about ClearIAS Courses (Online/Offline)\n\nAlgal blooms can occur in freshwater, marine, and brackish water environments. While not all blooms are harmful, certain types can have detrimental effects on the ecosystem, water quality, and even human health.\n\nNutrient Enrichment: Algal blooms are often associated with an excess of nutrients, particularly nitrogen and phosphorus, in the water. These nutrients may come from agricultural runoff, sewage discharge, or other human activities.\nWarm Temperatures and Sunlight: Algal blooms tend to occur in warm conditions with abundant sunlight, as these factors promote the rapid growth of algae through photosynthesis.\nToxic Algae Species: Some algal blooms are caused by toxic species of algae, known as harmful algal blooms (HABs). These toxins can have adverse effects on aquatic life, animals, and humans.\nDepletion of Oxygen: As algae die and decompose, they consume oxygen. In cases of extensive algal blooms, the decomposition process can deplete oxygen levels in the water, leading to hypoxic or anoxic conditions, which can harm fish and other organisms.\nTypes of Algae in Blooms\nCyanobacteria (Blue-Green Algae): Certain species of cyanobacteria can form toxic algal blooms. The toxins produced by these algae, such as microcystins and saxitoxins, can be harmful to animals and humans.\nDinoflagellates: Some dinoflagellates, a type of microscopic algae, can cause red tide events. These algae can produce toxins that can lead to fish kills and harm marine organisms.\nDiatoms: Diatoms are a group of algae that can contribute to non-toxic algal blooms. While they are generally not harmful, their rapid growth can still have ecological consequences.\nGolden algae: Although found mostly in oceans, golden algae (Prymnesium parvum) are an emerging problem in freshwater rivers, reservoirs, and lakes, particularly those with higher salinity (due to higher mineral content).\nCauses of algal blooms\n\nAlgal blooms are caused by a combination of environmental factors that create favorable conditions for the rapid growth and proliferation of algae.\n\nNutrient pollution\n\nNutrients like nitrogen and phosphorus, essential to plant growth, are a natural part of underwater ecosystems. But when they run off urban and rural surfaces and flow into a river, lake, pond, or reservoir in excess, a phenomenon known as nutrient pollution, they act like fertilizer and promote the growth of algae and bacteria.\n\nWarm water\n\nAlgae thrive in warm water conditions. Warmer temperatures enhance the metabolic rates of algae, allowing them to grow and reproduce more quickly.\nAlgae are photosynthetic organisms that require sunlight for photosynthesis. Adequate sunlight promotes the photosynthetic activity of algae, leading to their rapid growth.\n\nStable Water Column\n\nIn some water bodies, especially freshwater lakes, stratification can occur, creating distinct layers of water with different temperatures. The stable stratification prevents the mixing of surface and deeper waters, trapping nutrients in the upper layer where they fuel algal growth.\n\nStagnant Water\n\nStagnant or slow-moving water allows algae to remain concentrated in one area, facilitating their growth. In contrast, swift currents may disperse algae, preventing the development of dense blooms.\n\nNatural or Anthropogenic Eutrophication\n\nEutrophication is the process by which a water body becomes enriched with nutrients, leading to increased algal growth. While natural eutrophication occurs over geological time scales, anthropogenic eutrophication is accelerated by human activities.\n\nOther causes\n\nAgricultural Runoff: Runoff from agricultural lands can carry fertilizers, pesticides, and other pollutants into water bodies, contributing to nutrient enrichment.\nUrban Runoff: Urban areas with impervious surfaces can contribute to nutrient-rich stormwater runoff, enhancing nutrient levels in water bodies.\nAlgae Trapping: Reservoirs created by dams can trap nutrients, leading to increased nutrient concentrations in the water. This can create conditions favorable for algal blooms.\nAltered Precipitation Patterns: Changes in precipitation patterns, a consequence of climate change, can influence nutrient runoff and water temperature, affecting the occurrence and intensity of algal blooms.\n\nRead:\u00a0Planetary boundaries; Nitrogen pollution\n\nImpact of Algal Blooms\nWater Quality Degradation: Algal blooms can lead to the deterioration of water quality by reducing clarity and imparting undesirable colors and odors to the water.\nFish Kills: Depletion of oxygen during the decomposition of algae can result in fish kills and harm other aquatic organisms.\nToxicity to Animals: Harmful algal blooms can produce toxins that are harmful to aquatic animals, leading to illness or death.\nHuman Health Risks: Some algal blooms produce toxins that pose health risks to humans through exposure via recreational activities, drinking water, or consumption of contaminated seafood.\nEconomic Impact: Algal blooms can have economic implications, affecting fisheries, tourism, and recreational activities.\nPrevention and Mitigation\nNutrient Management: Implementing practices to reduce nutrient runoff from agriculture and urban areas can help prevent excessive nutrient enrichment in water bodies. These practices include planting cover crops, diversifying what\u2019s grown, reducing tillage, properly applying compost and manure, and following fertilizer best practices.\nMonitoring and Early Detection: Regular monitoring of water bodies for algal biomass and toxin levels can facilitate early detection and management of potential algal blooms.\nWater Treatment: Certain water treatment technologies, such as the use of algaecides, can be employed to control algal blooms in specific situations. Protecting wetlands, which act as natural filters to improve water quality, capture runoff, and enhance biodiversity, is also vital.\nRestoration of Riparian Zones: Restoration of riparian zones and wetlands can help filter nutrients before they enter water bodies, reducing the risk of algal blooms.\nConclusion\n\nAlgal blooms are complex phenomena influenced by various environmental factors. Managing and mitigating their impacts often requires a holistic approach that addresses nutrient inputs, land-use practices, and the restoration of natural ecosystems.\n\nUnderstanding the interactions among the factors is crucial for managing and preventing algal blooms. Implementing measures to control nutrient inputs, improve water quality, and promote sustainable land and water management practices can help mitigate the occurrence and impacts of algal blooms.\n\n\u00ad-Article by Swathi Satish"

The aims of Paris Agreement is as below:\n\nKeep the global temperature rise this century well below 2 degrees Celsius above the pre-industrial level.\nPursue efforts to limit the temperature increase even further to 1.5 degrees Celsius.\nStrengthen the ability of countries to deal with the impacts of climate change.\n\nIt may seem a small change in temperature but this can mean a big difference for the Earth!\n\nParis Agreement: Things to note\nIn French, the Paris\u00a0Agreement\u00a0is known as L\u2019accord de Paris.\nThe key vision\u00a0of Paris Agreement is to keep global temperatures \u201cwell below\u201d 2.0C (3.6F) above pre-industrial times and \u201cendeavour to limit\u201d them even more, to 1.5C.\nParis Accord talks about limiting\u00a0the amount of greenhouse gases emitted by human activity to the same levels that trees, soil and oceans can absorb naturally, beginning at some point between 2050 and 2100.\nIt also mentions the need to\u00a0review each country\u2019s contribution to cutting emissions every five years so they scale up to the challenge.\nRich countries should help poorer nations by providing \u201cclimate finance\u201d to adapt to climate change and switch to renewable energy.\nThe Paris Agreement has a \u2018bottom up\u2019 structure in contrast to most international environmental law treaties which are \u2018top down.\nThe agreement is\u00a0binding in some elements like reporting requirements, while leaving other aspects of the deal such as the setting of emissions targets for any individual country as non-binding.\nNote: You can download the Paris Agreement from this link.\nIs this the first international agreement to combat climate change due to global warming?\n\nNo. In fact, Paris Agreement comes under the broad umbrella of United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC). UNFCCC is a convention held in 1992 to combat climate change. Kyoto Protocol (1997) was another major international commitment under UNFCCC.\n\n\ud83d\udc49 Which year are YOU targeting for success in the IAS/IPS/IFS Exam? \ud83d\ude80\n\n(1) \u21d2 UPSC 2025: Prelims cum Mains\n\n(2) \u21d2 UPSC 2026: Prelims cum Mains\n\n(3) \u21d2 UPSC 2027 Prelims cum Mains\n\nTip: Know more about ClearIAS Courses (Online/Offline)\n\nParis Agreement (2015) vs\u00a0Kyoto Protocol (1997)\nParis Agreement is\u00a0the world\u2019s first comprehensive climate agreement. Although developed and developing countries were parties to Kyoto Protocol,\u00a0developing countries were not mandated to reduce their emissions.\nThis means that while Paris Agreement is legally binding to all parties, Kyoto Protocol was not.\nParis Agreement was reached on\u00a0the twenty-first session of the Conference of the Parties (COP) and the eleventh session of the Conference of the Parties serving as the meeting of the Parties to the Kyoto Protocol (CMP).\n\nNationally Determined Contributions (NDC)\nThe national pledges by countries to cut emissions are voluntary.\nThe Paris Agreement requires all Parties to put forward their best efforts through \u201cnationally determined contributions\u201d (NDCs) and to strengthen these efforts in the years ahead.\nThis includes requirements that all Parties report regularly on their emissions and on their implementation efforts.\nIn 2018, Parties will take stock of the collective efforts in relation to progress towards the goal set in the Paris Agreement.\nThere will also be a global stock take every 5 years to assess the collective progress towards achieving the purpose of the Agreement and to inform further individual actions by Parties.\nIndia\u2019s Intended Nationally Determined Contribution (INDC)\n\nIndia\u2019s INDC include a reduction in the emissions intensity of its GDP by 33 to 35 per cent by 2030 from 2005 level.\nIndia has also pledged to create an additional carbon sink of 2.5 to 3 billion tonnes of CO2 equivalent through additional forest and tree cover by 2030.\nIndia will\u00a0anchor a global solar alliance, INSPA (International Agency for Solar Policy & Application), of all countries located in between Tropic of Cancer and Tropic of Capricorn.\nFrameworks\u00a0under Paris Agreement\nTechnology Framework\nCapacity Building Framework\nTransparency Framework\nWhy is Paris Agreement important?\nCurrent commitments on greenhouse gas emissions (Kyoto Protocol) will expire in 2020. Paris Agreement deals with what should be done in the decade after 2020 and beyond this time frame.\nThe text of the agreement includes a provision requiring developed countries to send $100 billion annually to their developing counterparts beginning in 2020. That figure will be a \u201cfloor\u201d that is expected to increase with time.\nThe Paris Agreement has a \u2018bottom up\u2019 structure in contrast to most international environmental law treaties which are \u2018top down.\nFor the first time, the accord lays out a longer-term plan for reaching a peak in greenhouse emissions \u201cas soon as possible\u201d and achieving a balance between the output of man-made greenhouse gasses and absorption \u2013 by forests or the oceans \u2013 \u201cby the second half of this century\u201d.\nWhen will Paris Agreement come into force?\nThirty days after the date on which at least 55 Parties to the Convention accounting in total for at least an estimated 55 % of the total global greenhouse gas emissions have deposited their instruments of ratification, acceptance, approval or accession with the Depositary.\nOn 5 October 2016, the threshold for entry into force of the Paris Agreement was achieved.\nThe Paris Agreement will enter into force on 4 November 2016.\nCriticisms about Paris Agreement\nAccording to a study published in Nature on June 2016, current country pledges are too low to lead to a temperature rise below the Paris Agreement temperature limit of \u201cwell below 2 \u00b0C\u201d.\nEven a UNFCCC report had observed that even if all the pledges made by 197 countries that are signatory to the Paris pact were fulfilled, it would be insufficient to meet the conservative goal of keeping global temperature rise within the 2 degree Celsius threshold.\nMost of the agreement consists of \u201cpromises\u201d or aims and not firm commitments.\nThe starting point of $100bn per year remains under 8% of worldwide declared military spending each year.\nSince the only mechanism remains voluntary national caps on emissions, without even any guidance on how stringent those caps would need to be, it is hard to be optimistic that these goals are likely to be achieved.\nThere is only a \u201cname and shame\u201d system or\u00a0a \u201cname and encourage\u201d plan and\u00a0the \u2018contributions\u2019 themselves are not binding as a matter of international law.\nSummary\nThe Paris Agreement is an agreement within the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC).\nCountries will aim to keep global temperatures from rising more than 2\u00b0C (3.6\u00b0F) by 2100 with an ideal target of keeping temperature rise below 1.5\u00b0C (2.7\u00b0F).\nParis is only the beginning of a shift towards a low-carbon world, and there is much more to do.\nREFERENCE:\nUNFCCC.\nIndia\u2019s INDC \u2013 PIB.\nBBC\nTime.\nWikipedia."

This will reduce the emission by 100 million tons equivalent of Carbon dioxide in next 15 years.\nImplications of Kigali Agreement on India\n\nIndian industries using HFCs like Air-Conditioning industry, Automobiles, and refrigeration industry have some serious implications on financial and technical fronts:\n\n\ud83d\udc49 Which year are YOU targeting for success in the IAS/IPS/IFS Exam? \ud83d\ude80\n\n(1) \u21d2 UPSC 2025: Prelims cum Mains\n\n(2) \u21d2 UPSC 2026: Prelims cum Mains\n\n(3) \u21d2 UPSC 2027 Prelims cum Mains\n\nTip: Know more about ClearIAS Courses (Online/Offline)\n\nFinancial implications \u2013 Industries have to either invest in R & D to find out the substitutes for HFCs or they have to buy patented substances and technologies from other MNCs. Consequently, the cost of production will increase which may ultimately shrink the buyer base for their products.\nTechnological implications \u2013 Some of the developed nations have already started using substitutes of HFCs in their products and have a sound technological knowledge about their use. Without technology transfer or research, it would be difficult for domestic industries to compete with them in global as well as domestic market.\n\nOn a positive side, this will incentivise business and scientific fraternity to invest their financial and intellectual resources in finding out more economic and environment-friendly technological alternatives.\n\nWhat next, after HFCs?\n\nThe answer is HFO refrigerants.\u00a0HFO stands for hydrofluoro olefin.\u00a0HFC refrigerants are composed of hydrogen, fluorine and carbon atoms connected by single bonds between the atoms. HFO refrigerants are composed of hydrogen, fluorine and carbon atoms, but contain at least one double bond between the carbon atoms.\n\nHFO-1234yf has physical properties similar to HFC-134a.

Western Ghats host India\u2019s richest wilderness in 13 national parks and several sanctuaries. Recognised by UNESCO as one of the world\u2019s eight most important biodiversity hotspots, these forested hills are also sourcing to numerous rivers, including the Godavari, Krishna and Cauvery.\n\nThe Western Ghats acts as a huge water tank supplying water to six states. Now there are many leakages and there is a water shortage.\u00a0All the rivers are running dry now. And wherever there is water, it is highly polluted.\n\nThe Western Ghats needs high attention in the sustainability aspect of whole India and especially South India. Ministry of Environment and Forests\u00a0of India\u00a0set up in March 2010 an expert panel (Gadgil commission) to find a strategy for conserving these Ghats.\n\nMadhav Gadgil Committee Report on the Western Ghats\n\nGadgil Commission, an\u00a0environmental research commission\u00a0is named after its chairman\u00a0Madhav Gadgil.\u00a0The commission is formally known as\u00a0Western Ghats Ecology Expert Panel\u00a0(WGEEP).\u00a0\u00a0The commission submitted the report to the\u00a0Government of India\u00a0on 31 August 2011.\n\nGadgil Committee Recommendations:\n\nGadgil committee had eminent ecologists and their report too reflected that. The report was labelled favourable to environment and environmentalists and not development (or illegal mining \ud83d\ude42 ). Remember, there is a never-ending debate between environment and development; it\u2019s tough to balance both without compromising the other. Anyway, let\u2019s come back to Gadgil Report highlights.\n\nThe Western Ghats Ecology Expert Panel (WGEEP) designated the entire hill range as an Ecologically Sensitive Area (ESA).\nThe panel, in its report, has classified the 142 taluks in the Western Ghats boundary into Ecologically Sensitive Zones (ESZ) 1, 2 and 3.\nESZ-1 being of high priority, almost all developmental activities (mining, thermal power plants etc) were restricted in it.\nGadgil report recommended that \u201cno new dams based on large-scale storage be permitted in Ecologically Sensitive Zone 1. Since both the Athirappilly of Kerala and Gundia of Karnataka hydel project sites fall in Ecologically Sensitive Zone 1, these projects should not be accorded environmental clearance,\u201d it said.\nGadgil Committee report specifies that the present system of governance of the environment should be changed. It asked for a bottom to top approach (right from Gram sabhas) rather than a top to bottom approach. It also asked for decentralization and more powers to local authorities.\nThe commission recommended constitution of a Western Ghats Ecology Authority (WGEA), as a statutory authority under the Ministry of Environment and Forests, with the powers under Section 3 of the\u00a0Environment (Protection) Act, 1986.\nCriticisms of Madhav Gadgil Report\nThe major criticism faced by Gadgil Committee report was that it was more environment-friendly and not in tune with the ground realities.\nRecommendations were cited as impractical to implement.\nGadgil report has asked for a complete eco-sensitive cover for the Western Ghats which hamper different states on energy and development fronts.\nThere was a criticism against the constitution of a new body called WGEA. States insist that protection can be given under existing laws.\nGadgil report doesn\u2019t give a solution for revenue losses due to the implementation of its recommendations.\nGadgil report is against dams in the Western Ghats, which is a crucial blow on the ailing power sector. Considering the growing energy needs of India, critics argue that this recommendation cannot be taken.\nAnd the most important: The Gadgil Committee report adversely affects the various mafia \ud83d\ude42 . When the Gadgil Committee report was first made public, there were a lot of protests against it from the sand mining and quarrying lobbies in Goa. Many mafias created fear among farmers in Kerala that the Gadgil report is against them, and that they will lose livelihood if its recommendations are implemented.\nDarker side and Hidden Agenda\n\nMinistry of environment and forests kept the Gadgil report in safe custody for eight months with them. It was not available for public discussion as expected by Gadgil committee members.\u00a0People asked for a copy, but the ministry said it could not be given. When\u00a0an RTI petition\u00a0was filed, it was not given. Then the matter is taken to the Delhi high court and only when the court passed an order, the ministry released the report!\n\nThe court ordered that all the reports should be put on websites. Now it\u2019s there in the ministry website and for those who want to read the 522-page report, the link for the same is here \u2013\u00a0Report.\n\nAs many mafias created fear among the people that the Gadgil report is anti-farmer and anti-people,\u00a0people burnt the Gadgil Committee report and the effigy of the well-known environmentalist, Madhav\u00a0Gadgil.\n\nThe problem was that most people had not read it. (Who bothers to read a 522-page report, that too in English, uh!;-) ).\n\nSo, the mining lobby took advantage of this aspect and misled the people. They convinced the people against the report in their favour.\u00a0The lobby told the people that the report was against farmers and they would have to leave the area. People got really worried.\n\nAnd it is in this background that another committee was appointed to study Gadgil Report, review and suggest measures for implementation.\u00a0The name of the committee was\u00a0Kasturirangan committee.\n\nKasturirangan committee on the Western Ghats\n\nAs said earlier, the Kasturirangan committee was constituted\u00a0to examine the WGEEP report. The committee is often called HLWG \u2013 it denotes the\u00a010 member high-level working group (HLWG), headed by Kasturirangan.\n\n(PS: When you finish the 522 page Gadgil Report, you can read the Kasturirangan report here \ud83d\ude42 ).\n\nKasturirangan committee Report Recommendations\nInstead of the total area of Western Ghats, only 37% (i.e. 60,000 sq. km.) of the total area be brought under ESA under Kasturirangan report.\nA complete ban on mining, quarrying and sand mining in ESA.\nDistinguished between\u00a0cultural\u00a0(58% occupied in the Western Ghats by it like human settlements, agricultural fields and plantations)\u00a0and natural\u00a0landscape (90% of it should come under ESA according to the committee).\nCurrent mining areas in the ESA should be phased out within the next five years, or at the time of expiry of mining lease, whichever is earlier.\nNo thermal power\u00a0be allowed and hydropower projects are allowed only after detailed study.\nRed industries\u00a0i.e. which are highly polluting be strictly banned in these areas.\nKasturirangan report on the Western Ghats has made several pro-farmer recommendations, including the exclusion of inhabited regions and plantations from the purview of ecologically sensitive areas (ESAs).\nThe Kasturirangan report had said 123 villages fall under the ESA purview.\nCriticisms of Kasturirangan committee Report\nThe Kasturirangan panel used remote sensing and aerial survey methods for zonal demarcation of land in the Western Ghats. The usage of such techniques, without examining the ground reality, has caused many errors in the report.\nThe power is vested with the bureaucrats and forest officials and not with gram sabhas.\nMany fear that\u00a0the farmers would get evicted if the Kasturirangan Committee report is implemented. Under this report, the mining and quarrying lobbies are expected to flourish.\u00a0When these lobbies and tourism flourish, it will be disastrous for the environment.\u00a0There will be a water shortage, there will be pollution.\u00a0Finally, farmers will have to quit the area. They will not be able to do farming there.\nThe use of \u201cerroneous method\u201d had caused inclusion of many villages under Ecologically Sensitive Areas (ESA) though there were only rubber plantations and no forest land!\nKasturirangan report included ecologically non-sensitive areas under ESA, and left out many ecologically sensitive areas!\nComparison of Gadgil Report and Kasturirangan Report\n\nWhenever we study environment, the evergreen topic of debate is between environment and development. It is tough to achieve a perfect balance. The same happened with both these reports.\n\nIf Gadgil report laid too much importance to the environment, Kasturirangan report was biased towards development. Kasturi Rangan report was criticized by many as that it provided loopholes for mining, which if allowed would turn detrimental to the environment, in long-term will affect development too.\u00a0Kasturirangan report got the tag as anti-environmental soon after its release. But this report was tagged anti-development too by many who fear that their livelihood and interests will be affected.\n\nGadgil\u2019s Western Ghats \u00a0(Western Ghats landscape across 1,29,037 sq km.)\u00a0is smaller than that of Kasturirangan\u2019s (Western Ghats landscape, according to Kasturirangan is 1,64,280 sq km).\u00a0Gadgil report marked out 60 percent of the Western Ghats as the highest-priority Ecologically Sensitive Zone (ESZ -1).\n\nKasturirangan report marks only 37 percent area (but considers wider Western Ghat boundaries) as ESA. Gadgil\u2019s report proposed to declare this entire landscape as ESA, creating three ESZs within it. He prescribed that the existing sanctuaries and ESZ-1 would together cover 60 percent of this landscape. The 25 percent lowest priority areas would be marked as ESZ-3 to allow all developmental activities with precautions. The remaining 15 percent area would become ESZ-2. For example, while no mining would be allowed within ESZ- 1, existing mines could continue in ESZ-2 with a moratorium on new licences. In ESZ-3, new mines could come up.\n\nThe Kasturirangan panel, on the other hand, adopted the criteria followed by the Western Ghats Development Programme of the Planning Commission and identified 188 talukas as its Western Ghats landscape, which worked out to 1,64,280 sq km. He marked 37 percent of this stretch as ESA where hazardous industries, thermal plants or mines would not be allowed. In effect, the restriction level of Kasturirangan\u2019s ESA corresponds to that of Gadgil\u2019s ESZ-1.\n\nNow, according to the Gadgil report, the ESZ-1 areas add up to approximately 77,000 sq km (60 percent of 1,29,037 sq km). Kasturirangan\u2019s ESA, on the other hand, accounts for around 60,000 sq km (37 percent of 1,64,280 sq km). That is a reduction of 17,000 sq km in the top priority segment. (Source : Western Ghats \u2013 Tehelka).\n\nAnother committee to study Kasturi Rangan report! Oh ! Please, No!\n\nYes, Oommen V Oommen Committee : As people turned violent and started protests, Oommen Chandy, the then Chief Minister of Kerala set up an expert committee (the chairman has same first name as CM, did you see that; though he made life of UPSC aspirants difficult by appointing another committee, he made things a little easy by selecting a chairman whose first name is same as his, so that UPSC aspirants can remember: To the notice of all future committees and commissions! \ud83d\ude09 ).\u00a0The expert committee, appointed by the\u00a0Kerala government, to study the\u00a0Kasturirangan report\u00a0in detail\u00a0submitted its report to chief minister Oommen Chandy (CM).\n\nRecommendations of Oommen V Oommen Committee\nThe committee recommended the government to make changes in the clauses of\u00a0Environmentally Fragile Land\u00a0(EFL) in the Western Ghats.\nThe Oommen Committee reported that serious lapses happened in determining the EFL areas. The committee adopted a satellite survey to determine EFL and even plantations and estates were included in it!\nIt also recommended stopping land acquisition proceedings according to the Kasturirangan committee report.\nThe panel has made several pro-farmer recommendations, including the exclusion of inhabited regions and plantations from the purview of ecologically sensitive areas (ESAs). The Kasturirangan report had said 123 villages fall under the ESA purview.\nThe state-level panel said a field survey should be held in places that the Madhav Gadgil and Kasturirangan reports have identified as ESAs to demarcate forest land and human settlements. After examining the population density of these areas, human settlements should be exempted from the category of ESAs.\nIt also said farmers should not be stopped from rearing hybrid varieties of milking animals and suggested that the grace period is given to shift to organic farming be extended from five years to 10 years.\nThe report said forest areas should be fenced to prevent the animals from straying into them.\nWhy have people turned violent?\n\nNo, not after the 3rd committee! But even before that!\n\nFarmers were worried about Gadgil\u2019s report, fearing their eviction.\n\nThey fear the same of the Kasturirangan report too.\n\nBy this time UPSC aspirants should have realized that no report can satisfy all!\n\nThough there are many who treat the Kasturirangan report as a more practical report, the truth is that Gadgil\u2019s report was not anti-farmer. Also, people had misconceptions about Ecologically Fragile Lands (EFL) and Ecologically Sensitive Areas (ESA). Both of them were different concepts under different laws\u2013the first under the forest department and the latter under the district administration and pollution control board.\n\nAnd remember that protests often are not due to love towards the environment, but often because of fear of eviction or loss of livelihood. Centre issued an office order in November 2013 directing the immediate implementation of five proposals in the Kasturirangan report. This was the immediate provocation for the agitation. Later, the central government sought the opinion of the five states in implementing the report. Dialogues were still on and the government had asked the state governments to submit their views on the report.\n\nCurrent situation and updates\n\nThe Ministry of Environment had enough reports (Gadgil and Kasturirangan; Ooman committee was state-level), but still, they didn\u2019t take any action. The reports were neither available in the public domain nor the opinion of states was asked. So guess who intervened by this time? None other than the National Green Tribunal (NGT)! A bench headed by NGT Chairperson Justice Swatanter Kumar imposed a fine of Rs 25,000 on the ministry for failing to file its final report on recommendations of two panels set up to study environmental sensitivity and ecological significance of the Western Ghats, saying better standards were expected from it. [Oct1, 2013]\n\nGadgil Report \u2013 TOI\nKasturirangan report \u2013 FirstPost.\n\nThe Kasturirangan panel had submitted its report to the Ministry on April 15, 2013. (Finally) it was put in public domain and also disseminated to all stakeholders including the six Western Ghats states including Gujarat, Karnataka, Maharashtra, Goa, Kerala and Tamil Nadu for feedback and comments. Going with the recommendations of the high-level panel that was headed by Mr. Kasturirangan, the Ministry has decided to declare the ESA over 37% of the Western Ghats under the Environment Protection Act, of 1986.\n\nWith the central government deciding to implement the Kasturirangan Committee report on the Western Ghats, there were several protests in Kerala. Even those who opposed the Gadgil Committee report now want it in place of the Kasturirangan Committee report. People now fear that due to illegal mining, they would get evicted indirectly.\n\nGoing against the recommendation of the Environment Secretary, the Minister retained the criteria to leave areas with high-density populations out of this regulated zone\u2019s ambit. The high-level panel had recommended that the hill tracts with high population densities be kept out of the ESA ambit. The MoEF recently came out with the order, and according to directions under Section 5 of the Environment (Protection) Act, 1986, bars mining in ecologically fragile areas (EFA not to be confused with ESA), setting up of thermal plants and restricts buildings to less than 20,000 sq ft in 123 villages mentioned in the K. Kasturirangan report of the state.\n\nAlso read: Biodiversity and Environment: Conservation\n\nUpdate 2018:\u00a0As Kerala faces its worst floods in several decades, Madhav Gadgil, the author of a landmark report on the conservation of the Western Ghats said that Kerala Floods are partly man-made. He said the scale of the disaster would have been smaller had the state government and local authorities followed environmental laws.\n\n\u201cYes, there is an intense rainfall event which has caused this. But I am quite convinced that the last several years\u2019 developments in the state have materially compromised its ability to deal with events like this and greatly increased the magnitude of the suffering that we are seeing today. Had proper steps been taken, the scale of the disaster would have been nowhere near what it is today,\u201d says Dr. Gadgil.\n\nThis statement has again brought the debate \u2013 development vs. environment \u2013 back into the mainstream. As you all know, the need of the hour is sustainable development.\n\nRelated Posts\nWestern Ghats: Explained\nEastern Ghats: Explained"

            "[CONTENT]": "The Women\u2019s Reservation Bill in India seeks to reserve a certain percentage of seats in both the Lok Sabha and state legislative assemblies for women. The primary aim of the bill is to enhance women\u2019s political representation and participation in decision-making processes at the highest levels of government. Read here to learn the latest developments.\n\nIndian Parliament passed the Women\u2019s Reservation Bill on September 18, 2023. It is a landmark moment for gender equality, especially in terms of women\u2019s political leadership.\n\nThe passage of the bill is testimony to India\u2019s commitment to women-led development, for which it mobilized global support during its G20 Presidency in 2023.\n\nTable of Contents\n\nThe Women\u2019s Reservation Bill 2023\nWomen\u2019s Reservation Bill: History\nObjectives of the Bill\nCriticism of the bill\nSignificance of the bill\nConclusion\nPrevious year question\nThe Women\u2019s Reservation Bill 2023\n\nThe Women\u2019s Reservation Bill 2023, officially titled The Constitution (One Hundred and Twenty-Eighth Amendment) Bill 2023, was introduced in the Parliament of India, marking a significant moment in the legislative arena.\n\nThe current legislation aims to reserve 33 per cent of seats in both the directly elected Lok Sabha and state legislative assemblies exclusively for women.\n\nIt was historic as being the first bill considered in the newly inaugurated parliament building.\n\n\ud83d\udc49 Which year are YOU targeting for success in the IAS/IPS/IFS Exam? \ud83d\ude80\n\n(1) \u21d2 UPSC 2025: Prelims cum Mains\n\n(2) \u21d2 UPSC 2026: Prelims cum Mains\n\n(3) \u21d2 UPSC 2027 Prelims cum Mains\n\nTip: Know more about ClearIAS Courses (Online/Offline)\n\nThe women\u2019s reservation would be implemented following the first delimitation, which is currently on hold until 2026.\n\nWomen\u2019s Reservation Bill: History\n\nThe bill has its roots in the recommendations of various committees and commissions, including the National Commission for Women and the United Nations, which have advocated for increased women\u2019s participation in politics.\n\nThe bill was first introduced in Parliament in the 1990s but has faced numerous challenges in the legislative process.\n\nOver the years, the Women\u2019s Reservation Bill has been introduced in Parliament multiple times but has not been passed into law. It has lapsed or been deferred several times due to political disagreements and resistance.\n\nThe bill has faced opposition from various quarters, including some political parties and lawmakers.\n\nCritics have raised concerns about its implementation, its potential impact on other marginalized groups, and whether it addresses the broader issue of women\u2019s empowerment beyond political representation.\nDespite its challenges, the bill has received support from women\u2019s rights activists, civil society organizations, and many women politicians. They argue that it is a necessary step to break down gender barriers in Indian politics.\nSupporters of the bill iterate that it will help address gender disparities in political representation and empower women to actively participate in policy formulation and decision-making. It is seen as a step toward achieving gender equality in politics.\n\nSome states in India have taken independent measures to increase women\u2019s representation in local governance. For example, several states have introduced a quota system to reserve seats for women in panchayats (local self-government bodies).\n\nObjectives of the Bill\n\nThe proposed bill calls for the reservation of one-third (33.33%) of the total seats in the Lok Sabha and state legislative assemblies for women.\n\nIt mandates 33 percent reservation for women in the Lok Sabha, the state Legislative Assemblies, and the Delhi Assembly.\nIt also reserves one-third of seats for women within the existing SC and ST reservations.\nSeats will be reserved on a rotational basis, and reservations will cease after 15 years.\nCriticism of the bill\n\nTwo reasons call for criticism of the 2023 Bill.\n\nFirst, the implementation schedule\u2019s complexity. The Constitution (One Hundred and Twenty-eighth Amendment) Act of 2023 would go into effect once \u201can exercise of delimitation is undertaken for this purpose after the relevant figures for the first Census taken after that date have been published,\u201d according to the bill. The election cycle from which women will get their fair share is not specified.\nSecond, the new Bill does not offer women\u2019s reservation in the Rajya Sabha and state legislative councils, in keeping with the previous regimes. Women are currently underrepresented in the Rajya Sabha compared to the Lok Sabha. The Lower and Upper Houses must both adhere to the concept of representation.\n\nPreviously, numerous critical arguments against the reservation for women in politics had surfaced-\n\nSome argue that reservation policies can lead to tokenism, where women are seen as filling quotas rather than being genuinely supported and empowered.\nThere can be resistance and backlash against women in leadership roles, which may not necessarily dismantle entrenched patriarchy.\nReservation policies typically apply to political representation but may not address broader societal and cultural norms that perpetuate patriarchy.\nThe effectiveness of reservation policies may vary for women of different social, economic, and cultural backgrounds. Intersectionality\u2014the overlapping of multiple forms of discrimination\u2014needs to be considered.\nReservation policies may be a starting point, but achieving lasting change in gender equality requires addressing systemic issues beyond political representation.\nSignificance of the bill\n\nThe significance of the Women\u2019s Reservation Bill in India is multifaceted and has far-reaching implications:\n\nUnder Representation of Women in Legislature: Globally, women currently occupy only 26.7% of parliamentary seats and 35.5% of local government positions. Such a step by India, a large economy can have a positive impact globally as well.\nGender Equality and Empowerment: The primary objective of the bill is to promote gender equality and empower women by providing them with adequate political representation. Women constitute nearly half of India\u2019s population, and ensuring their participation in decision-making processes is a fundamental aspect of gender justice.\nPolitical Participation: The bill aims to increase the political participation of women at all levels of government. By reserving seats for women, it encourages women to enter politics, contest elections, and hold public office.\nWomen\u2019s Voices and Issues: Increased representation of women in legislatures ensures that women\u2019s voices are heard on critical issues, including those related to women\u2019s rights, education, health, and safety. It can lead to policies and legislation that address gender-based discrimination and violence.\nWomen elected to political office can serve as role models for other women and girls, inspiring them to pursue leadership roles in various fields, including politics.\nTackling Patriarchy: The reservation\u00a0of seats for women challenges traditional gender roles and stereotypes, challenging the patriarchal nature of Indian politics and society.\nGender Inclusive Governance: Research has shown that gender diversity in decision-making bodies, including legislatures, often leads to better governance and decision-making, as diverse perspectives and experiences are considered.\nSocial and Economic Development: Empowering women politically can have positive effects on social and economic development. It can lead to policies that promote gender-sensitive development, improved access to education and healthcare for women, and increased economic opportunities.\nAddressing Gender Disparities: The bill can contribute to reducing gender disparities in various sectors, including education, employment, and healthcare, as women\u2019s concerns and priorities are more likely to be addressed.\nInternational Commitments: India is a signatory to international agreements and conventions that call for gender equality and women\u2019s empowerment. Implementing the Women\u2019s Reservation Bill demonstrates India\u2019s commitment to these international obligations.\nThe bill encourages political parties to promote women leaders and give them opportunities to contest elections, which can lead to a more inclusive and diverse political landscape.\n\nRelated articles: Women in Politics, Women in Judiciary, Women in Armed Forces, Women in STEM\n\nConclusion\n\nAccording to the United Nations, \u201cThis quota reserving 33% seats for women will leapfrog India into one of 64 countries around the world who have reserved seats for women in their national Parliaments. Typically, achieving a critical mass of 30 percent representation by women in Parliament is known to yield positive outcomes for women\u2019s empowerment. However, we hope that implementing such reservations will ultimately lead to achieving 50 percent representation of women in Parliaments across the globe.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s important to note that the Women\u2019s Reservation Bill has faced opposition and debates within India\u2019s political landscape.\n\nSome critics argue that it might perpetuate tokenism, while others believe that it is necessary to address the underrepresentation of women in politics.\n\nReservation for women in politics can be a valuable tool in challenging patriarchy and promoting gender equality, but it should be part of a broader strategy that addresses cultural norms, education, economic empowerment, and social change to create a more inclusive and equitable society.\n\nAdditionally, the impact of such policies can vary, and their success depends on various factors, including their design and implementation.\n\nPrevious year question\n\nQ. \u201cThe reservation of seats for women in the institutions of local self-government has had a limited impact on the patriarchal character of the Indian Political Process.\u201d Comment.

Qazis adjudicated criminal cases based on Islamic jurisprudence.\nHindu-Muslim Legal Synthesis: The synthesis of Hindu and Islamic legal principles occurred in areas where both communities coexisted.\n\nColonial Era:\n\nRegulating Act of 1773: The British East India Company established a legal system under the Regulating Act, introducing English law and creating courts to administer justice.\nIndian Penal Code (IPC), 1860: Drafted by Thomas Babington Macaulay, the IPC was enacted and came into effect on January 1, 1862. It remains one of the foundational criminal statutes in India, providing a comprehensive list of offenses and their punishments.\nCode of Criminal Procedure (CrPC), 1898: The CrPC established procedures for the administration of criminal justice. It outlined the powers of the police, the conduct of trials, and the role of the judiciary.\n\nPost-Independence Period:\n\nConstitution of India, 1950: The Constitution of India guarantees certain fundamental rights and principles of criminal justice, emphasizing fair trial and protection against arbitrary arrest and detention.\nAmendments and New Legislation: Over the years, the IPC and CrPC have been amended to adapt to changing societal needs. New laws, such as the Narcotic Drugs and Psychotropic Substances Act (1985) and the Prevention of Corruption Act (1988), have been enacted to address emerging challenges.\nCourts have also de-criminalized certain offenses such as consensual intercourse between same-sex adults, adultery, and attempts to commit suicide.\n\nRecent Reforms:\n\nCriminal Law (Amendment) Act, 2013: Enacted in response to the Nirbhaya case, this amendment strengthened laws related to sexual offenses, introducing new offenses and enhancing penalties.\nJuvenile Justice (Care and Protection of Children) Act, 2015: This law addresses offenses committed by juveniles and aims to rehabilitate and protect children in conflict with the law.\nThe Criminal Law (Amendment) Act, 2018: This amendment introduced changes to the IPC and CrPC, including stricter provisions for crimes against women and children.\nBharatiya Nyaya (second) Sanhita, 2023\n\nThe Indian Penal Code (IPC), 1860 is the principal law on criminal offenses in India.\u00a0 Offenses covered include those affecting:\n\nhuman body such as assault and murder,\nproperty such as extortion and theft,\npublic order such as unlawful assembly and rioting,\npublic health, safety, decency, morality, and religion,\ndefamation, and\noffences against the state.\n\nThe Bharatiya Nyaya (Second) Sanhita (BNS2) retains most offences from the IPC.\u00a0 It adds community service as a form of punishment.\n\nSedition is no longer an offence. Instead, there is a new offence for acts endangering the sovereignty, unity, and integrity of India.\nThe BNS2 adds terrorism as an offence. It is defined as an act that intends to threaten the unity, integrity, security, or economic security of the country, or strike terror in the people.\nOrganised crime has been added as an offence. It includes crimes such as kidnapping, extortion and cyber-crime committed on behalf of a crime syndicate.\u00a0 Petty organised crime is also an offence now.\nMurder by a group of five or more persons on grounds of certain identity markers such as caste, language, or personal belief will be an offence with a penalty of life imprisonment or death, and with a fine.\n\nKey changes in the BNS2 include:\n\nOffences against the body: The IPC criminalizes acts such as murder, abetment of suicide, assault, and causing grievous hurt.\n\nThe BNS2 retains these provisions. It adds new offences such as organised crime, terrorism, and murder or grievous hurt by a group on certain grounds.\n\nSexual offences against women: The IPC criminalises acts such as rape, voyeurism, stalking, and insulting the modesty of a woman.\u00a0 The BNS2 retains these provisions.\n\nIt increases the threshold for the victim to be classified as a major, in the case of gang rape, from 16 to 18 years of age.\nIt also criminalises sexual intercourse with a woman by deceitful means or making false promises.\n\nSedition: The BNS2 removes the offence of sedition.\u00a0 It instead penalises the following:\n\nexciting or attempting to excite secession, armed rebellion, or subversive activities,\nencouraging feelings of separatist activities, or\nendangering the sovereignty or unity and integrity of India.\n\nThese offences may involve the exchange of words or signs, electronic communication, or the use of financial means.\n\nTerrorism: Terrorism includes an act that intends to:\n\nthreaten the unity, integrity, security, or economic security of the country, or\nstrike terror in the people or any section of people in India.\nPunishment for attempting or committing terrorism includes:\ndeath or life imprisonment, and a fine, if it results in the death of a person, or\nimprisonment between five years and life, and a fine.\n\nOrganised crime: Organised crime includes offences such as kidnapping, extortion, contract killing, land grabbing, financial scams, and cybercrime carried out on behalf of a crime syndicate.\n\nAttempting or committing organised crime will be punishable with:\ndeath or life imprisonment and a fine of Rs 10 lakh, if it results in the death of a person, or\nimprisonment between five years and life, and a fine of at least five lakh rupees.\n\nMob lynching:\u00a0 The BNS2 adds murder or grievous hurt by five or more people on specified grounds, as an offence.\n\nThese grounds include race, caste, sex, language, or personal belief. The punishment for such murder is life imprisonment or death.\n\nRulings of the Supreme Court:\u00a0 The BNS2 conforms to some decisions of the Supreme Court.\n\nThese include omitting adultery as an offence and adding life imprisonment as one of the penalties (in addition to the death penalty) for murder or attempt to murder by a life convict.\nIssues with BNS2\n\nAge specifications for offences\n\nThe age of criminal responsibility is retained at seven years. It extends to 12 years depending upon the maturity of the accused.\u00a0 This may contravene recommendations of international conventions.\nThe BNS2 defines a child to mean a person below the age of 18. However, for several offences, the age threshold of the victim for offences against children is not 18.\u00a0 The threshold for the minority of the victim of for rape and gang rape is different.\n\nOverlap with special laws\n\nIn many cases, both carry different penalties or provide for different procedures.\u00a0 This may lead to multiple regulatory regimes, additional costs of compliance and possibility of levelling multiple charges.\n\nThe BNS2 overlaps with the following special laws\n\nThe Food Safety and Security Act, 2006\nThe Drugs and Cosmetics Act, 1940\nThe Bonded Labour System (Abolition) Act, 1976\nThe Juvenile Justice Act, 2015\nThe Motor Vehicles Act, 1988\nThe Bharatiya Nagarik Suraksha (Second) Sanhita, 2023\n\nThe Bharatiya Nagarik Suraksha (Second) Sanhita, 2023 (BNSS2) seeks to replace the Criminal Procedure Code, 1973 (CrPC).\n\nThe BNSS2 mandates forensic investigation for offences punishable with seven years of imprisonment or more. Forensic experts will visit crime scenes to collect forensic evidence and record the process.\nAll trials, inquiries, and proceedings may be held in electronic mode. Production of electronic communication devices, likely to contain digital evidence, will be allowed for investigation, inquiry, or trial.\nIf a proclaimed offender has absconded to evade trial and there is no immediate prospect of arresting him, the trial can be conducted and judgment pronounced in his absence.\nAlong with specimen signatures or handwriting, finger impressions, and voice samples may be collected for investigation or proceedings. Samples may be taken from a person who has not been arrested.\n\nThe BNSS2 retains most of the provisions of the CrPC.\u00a0 Key changes proposed include:\n\nDetention of undertrials: \u00a0As per the CrPC, if an accused has spent half of the maximum period of imprisonment in detention, he must be released on personal bond.\n\nThis does not apply to offences punishable by death.\nThe BNSS2 adds that this provision will also not apply to:\noffences punishable by life imprisonment, and\npersons against whom proceedings are pending in more than one offence.\n\nMedical examination: \u00a0The CrPC allows medical examination of the accused in certain cases, including rape cases.\n\nSuch examination is done by a registered medical practitioner at the request of at least a sub-inspector-level police officer.\nThe BNSS2 provides that any police officer can request such an examination.\n\nForensic investigation: \u00a0The BNSS2 mandates forensic investigation for offences punishable with at least seven years of imprisonment.\n\nIn such cases, forensic experts will visit crime scenes to collect forensic evidence and record the process on a mobile phone or any other electronic device.\nIf a state does not have a forensics facility, it shall utilise such a facility in another state.\n\nSignatures and finger impressions: \u00a0The CrPC empowers a Magistrate to order any person to provide specimen signatures or handwriting.\n\nThe BNSS2 expands this to include finger impressions and voice samples.\nIt allows these samples to be collected from a person who has not been arrested.\n\nTimelines for procedures: \u00a0The BNSS2 prescribes timelines for various procedures.\n\nIt requires medical practitioners who examine rape victims to submit their reports to the investigating officer within seven days.\nOther specified timelines include: (i) giving judgment within 30 days of completion of arguments (extendable up to 45 days), (ii) informing the victim of the progress of the investigation within 90 days, and (iii) framing of charges by a sessions court within 60 days from the first hearing on such charges.\n\nHierarchy of Courts: \u00a0The CrPC establishes a hierarchy of courts for the adjudication of criminal matters in India.\n\nThese courts include: (i)\u00a0Magistrate\u2019s Courts:\u00a0subordinate courts responsible for the trial of most criminal cases, (ii)\u00a0Sessions Courts:\u00a0presided over by a Sessions Judge and hear appeals from Magistrate\u2019s Courts, (iii)\u00a0High Courts:\u00a0have inherent jurisdiction to hear and decide criminal cases and appeals, and (iv)\u00a0Supreme Court:\u00a0hear appeals from High Courts and also exercise its original jurisdiction in certain matters.\nThe CrPC empowers the state governments to notify any city or town with a population of more than one million as a metropolitan area. \u00a0Such areas have Metropolitan Magistrates.\nThe BNSS2 removes the classification of metropolitan areas and Metropolitan Magistrates.\nIssues with BNSS2\n\nThe power of the police may be expanded\n\nThe BNSS2 amends the provisions related to detention, police custody, and the use of handcuffs, which may present some issues.\nThe BNSS2 allows up to 15 days of police custody, which can be authorized in parts during the initial 40 or 60 days of the 60- or 90-day period of judicial custody.\nThe Supreme Court has also issued various guidelines to prevent such arbitrary exercise of police powers.\n\nRights of the accused\n\nThe power to attach property from proceeds of crime does not have safeguards provided in the Prevention of Money Laundering Act.\nThe BNSS2 denies this facility to anyone facing multiple charges. As many cases involve charges under multiple sections, this may limit such bail.\nThe use of handcuffs is permitted in a range of cases including organised crime, contradicting Supreme Court directions.\n\nPrison congestion\n\nRestricting bail, and limiting the scope for plea bargaining could deter decongesting of prisons.\n\nRecommendations not incorporated\n\nRecommendations of high-level committees on changes to the CrPC such as reforms in sentencing guidelines and codifying rights of the accused have not been incorporated in the BNSS2.\nThe Bharatiya Sakshya (Second) Bill, 2023\n\nThe Bharatiya Sakshya (Second) Bill, 2023 (BSB2) replaces the Indian Evidence Act, 1872 (IEA).\n\nThe IEA provides two kinds of evidence \u2013 documentary and oral. Documentary evidence includes primary (original documents) and secondary (that prove the contents of the original).\u00a0 The BSB2 retains the distinction.\u00a0 It classifies electronic records as documents.\nUnder the IEA, electronic records are categorized as secondary evidence. The BSB2 classifies electronic records as primary evidence.\u00a0 It expands such records to include information stored in semiconductor memory or any communication devices (smartphones, laptops).\nThe BSB2 expands secondary evidence to include: (i) oral and written admissions, and (ii) the testimony of a person who has examined the document and is skilled in the examination of documents.\n\nKey changes of the BSB2 are:\n\nDocumentary evidence: \u00a0Under the IEA, a document includes writings, maps, and caricatures. \u00a0The BSB2 adds that electronic records will also be considered as documents.\n\nDocumentary evidence includes primary and secondary evidence.\nPrimary evidence includes the original document and its parts, such as electronic records and video recordings.\nSecondary evidence contains documents and oral accounts that can prove the contents of the original. The BSB2 retains this classification.\n\nOral evidence: Under the IEA, oral evidence includes statements made before Courts by witnesses about a fact under inquiry.\n\nThe BSB2 allows oral evidence to be given electronically.\nThis would permit witnesses, accused persons, and victims to testify through electronic means.\n\nAdmissibility of electronic or digital records as evidence:\u00a0Documentary evidence includes information in electronic records that have been printed or stored in optical or magnetic media produced by a computer.\n\nSuch information may have been stored or processed by a combination of computers or different computers.\nThe BSB2 provides that electronic or digital records will have the same legal effect as paper records.\nIt expands electronic records to include information stored in semiconductor memory or any communication devices (smartphones, laptops).\nThis will also include records on emails, server logs, smartphones, locational evidence, and voice mails.\n\nSecondary evidence:\u00a0 The BSB2 expands secondary evidence to include: (i) oral and written admissions, and (ii) the testimony of a person who has examined the document and is skilled to examine the documents.\n\nJoint trials:\u00a0A joint trial refers to the trial of more than one person for the same offence.\n\nThe IEA states that in a joint trial, if a confession made by one of the accused which also affects the other accused is proven, it will be treated as a confession against both.\nThe BSB2 adds an explanation to this provision. \u00a0It states that a trial of multiple persons, where an accused has absconded or has not responded to an arrest warrant, will be treated as a joint trial.\nIssues with BSB2\n\nThe admissibility of electronic records as evidence\n\nThe Supreme Court has recognized that electronic records may be tampered with. While the BSB2 provides for the admissibility of such records, there are no safeguards to prevent the tampering and contamination of such records during the investigation process.\nThe BSB2 also classifies electronic evidence as documents (which may not need certification).\u00a0 This creates a contradiction.\n\nAdmissibility of information\n\nUnder the IEA, a fact discovered due to information received from an accused in police custody may be provable. The BSB2 retains this provision.\nThe Law Commission recommended to remove this distinction.\nIn news\n\nFrom July 1, 2024, India has replaced its colonial-era criminal laws with a set of three new penal laws.\n\nThe Indian Penal Code of 1860 will be substituted by the Bharatiya Nyaya Sanhita or the BNS, the Code of Criminal Procedure of 1973 will give way to the Bharatiya Nagarik Suraksha Sanhita or the BNSS, and the Indian Evidence Act, 1872 will be replaced by the Bharatiya Sakshya Adhiniyam or the BSB.\nConclusion\n\nIndia\u2019s criminal laws have evolved over the centuries, influenced by indigenous legal traditions, foreign invasions, and the colonial legacy. The legal system continues to undergo reforms to address contemporary challenges and uphold principles of justice, equity, and human rights.\n\nRelated articles:\n\nCriminal Procedure (Identification) Act 2022\nCriminal Justice System (CJS)\nBail laws in India\nPreventive detention\nFIR\nNational Forensic Infrastructure Enhancement Scheme (NFIES)\n\n-Article by Swathi Satish"

It is based on the idea that individuals should have control over their personal data and the right to have their personal information deleted or removed from online platforms or search engines if it is no longer relevant or necessary.\n\nThe right to be forgotten is often associated with the right to privacy and data protection. It is designed to protect individuals from the potentially harmful effects of having their personal information available online, such as identity theft, cyberbullying, or discrimination.\n\nThe right to be forgotten is a relatively new concept in India and has not yet been fully recognized by the courts or the legislature. However, there have been some developments in recent years that have touched upon issues related to data privacy and the right to be forgotten.\n\n\ud83d\udc49 Which year are YOU targeting for success in the IAS/IPS/IFS Exam? \ud83d\ude80\n\n(1) \u21d2 UPSC 2025: Prelims cum Mains\n\n(2) \u21d2 UPSC 2026: Prelims cum Mains\n\n(3) \u21d2 UPSC 2027 Prelims cum Mains\n\nTip: Know more about ClearIAS Courses (Online/Offline)\n\nAlso read: Digital Personal Data Protection\n\nK.S. Puttaswamy v. Union of India 2017\n\nOne of the significant developments in this area was the recognition of the right to privacy as a fundamental right under article 21 of the Indian Constitution in the landmark case of Justice K.S. Puttaswamy (Retd.) and Another v. Union of India and Others in 2017. This case laid the foundation for recognizing the importance of data privacy and individual autonomy in India.\n\nGoogle LLC v. Visakha Industries 2018\n\nIn 2018, the Delhi High Court, in the case of Google LLC v. Visakha Industries and Another, directed Google to de-index certain web pages that contained allegedly defamatory content. While this case did not explicitly recognize the right to be forgotten, it did provide some guidance on how the courts in India may approach issues related to data privacy and online content.\n\nDraft of MeitY\n\nIn 2019, the Ministry of Electronics and Information Technology (MeitY) released a draft of the Personal Data Protection Bill, which includes provisions related to the right to be forgotten. The bill recognizes the right of individuals to have their personal data erased in certain circumstances, including when the data is no longer necessary for the purpose for which it was collected, or if the individual withdraws their consent for the data to be processed.\n\nSignificance of the Right to be Forgotten\n\nThe right to be forgotten is a complex legal concept that can have both advantages and disadvantages. Here are some of the key advantages of the right to be forgotten:\n\nProtects Privacy: The right to be forgotten can help individuals protect their privacy and personal information by allowing them to request the removal of their personal information from online platforms or search engines.\n\nReduces the Risk of Harm: The right to be forgotten can help reduce the risk of harm to individuals by preventing their personal information from being used for malicious purposes, such as identity theft.\n\nSupports Freedom of Expression: The right to be forgotten can support freedom of expression by allowing individuals to control their personal information and ensure that it is accurate and up-to-date.\n\nAlso read: Data Localisation\n\nChallenges\n\nHere are some of the key challenges of the right to be forgotten:\n\nLimitations on free speech: The right to be forgotten can potentially limit freedom of speech and the public\u2019s right to access information, as it can result in the removal of legitimate and important information from online platforms or search engines.\n\nTechnical challenges: The implementation of the right to be forgotten can be technically challenging, as it requires online platforms and search engines to develop complex systems for managing and removing personal information.\n\nConflicts with other legal rights: The right to be forgotten can conflict with other legal rights, such as the right to access information, the right to freedom of expression, and the right to conduct research and journalism.\n\nAlso read: Right to Disconnect\n\nOther Government Steps to Protect Privacy\n\nThe government has taken several steps to protect privacy in India. Here are some of the key steps taken by the government:\n\nAadhaar Act: The Aadhaar Act was enacted in 2016 to establish a unique identification system for Indian residents. The act includes provisions related to data protection and privacy, including the requirement to obtain consent from individuals before collecting their personal information.\nPersonal Data Protection Bill: The government introduced the Personal Data Protection Bill in 2019, which aims to provide a comprehensive framework for the protection of personal data in India. The bill includes provisions related to data privacy, data localization, and the right to be forgotten.\nThe Cyber Security Policy: The Indian government introduced the National Cyber Security Policy in 2013, which includes measures to protect personal data from cyber threats and enhance cybersecurity in India.\nIT Act: The Information Technology Act was enacted in 2000 to provide legal recognition for electronic transactions and protect electronic records and data. The act includes provisions related to data privacy and data protection.\nConclusion\n\nOverall, the right to be forgotten is still in the process of development in India, and there is no specific case that has been solely responsible for its development. Moreover, with the recognition of the right to privacy as a fundamental right and the introduction of the Personal Data Protection Bill, the right to be forgotten is gaining increasing attention from both the courts and the legislature in India.\n\nHowever, it is important to carefully balance the right to be forgotten with other legal and social interests, such as freedom of expression and access to information, in order to ensure that it is used in a responsible and ethical manner.\n\nArticle Written By: Priti Raj"

What are the criteria to give the status of Special Category States? Read further to know more.\n\nThe Center categorises states with socioeconomic and geographic disadvantages as having special category status to help them flourish. Under the Fifth Finance Commission\u2019s advice, this classification was made in 1969.\n\nIndia is a \u201cunion of the states\u201d. There are currently 29 states and 7 union territories in India. According to the recommendations of the Finance Commission, which the President of India established, all of these states and union territories receive a portion of the central government\u2019s revenues every five years.\n\nAccording to Article 275 of the Indian Constitution, the central government may provide any state with additional financial aid outside of the recommendations of the Finance Commission. Out of the 29 Indian states, 11 already have the designation of Special Category States, and 5 more are requesting it. This is important to note.\n\nTable of Contents\n\nSpecial Category Status\nHistorical Perspective\nCriteria to give the status of Special Category States\nStates with Special Category Status\nBenefits of Special Category Status\nConcerns Related To Special Category Status\nConclusion\nSpecial Category Status\n\nThree states\u2014Jammu and Kashmir (currently union territories), Assam, and Nagaland\u2014were granted the status of Special Category States in 1969 by the Fifth Finance Commission, under the chairmanship of Mahavir Tyagi. When the Gadgil formula was authorised in 1969, the idea of Special Category Status was first introduced.\n\nThe social, economic, and geographic backwardness of these three states was the justification for granting them special status.\nStates that meet certain requirements, including hilly and challenging terrain, strategic border locations, low per capita income, low population density, the presence of sizable tribal populations, economic and infrastructure backwardness, and the unviable nature of State finances, are given special category status.\n\u00a0In order to attain uniform growth, and equality, and promote inclusive development, some states require special attention due to their non-uniformity, unequal development, tribal areas, backwardness, and people\u2019s desires.\nOn the other hand, all of these special arrangements have emerged as a result of ongoing constitutional changes.\nThe Constitution does not contain any SCS provisions.\nThe National Development Council has in the past granted States with a variety of characteristics that call for particular consideration Special Category Status for plan assistance. Today, the central government handles it.\nHistorical Perspective\nGoal: To provide central assistance and tax breaks to underprivileged states as preferential treatment. Many states have received help from the National Development Council in the past as part of the Central Plan.\nAt first, only Assam, Nagaland, Jammu, and Kashmir received special status.\nUnder the 4th Five-Year Plan, Assam, Nagaland, and Jammu & Kashmir received special status (1969-1974).\nNote: On August 5, 2019, the Constitution (Application to Jammu & Kashmir) Order, 2019, was published by the President of India. The unique status granted to Jammu and Kashmir under Article 370 is revoked.\nFive more states were included in the special category between 1974 and 1979. These include Himachal Pradesh, Manipur, Meghalaya, Sikkim, and Tripura.\nThe number of states with Special Category status rose to eleven in 1990, with the accession of Arunachal Pradesh and Mizoram.

ST is only allowed in the districts with the highest percentage of Scheduled Tribe residents.\nThe Delimitation Commission considers two factors when deciding how to divide up Scheduled Castes.\nIt chooses congressional districts where the population of Scheduled Castes is more prevalent.\nHowever, it also disperses these constituencies across the State\u2019s various regions.\nBecause the population of Scheduled Castes is typically distributed evenly across the nation, this is done.\nEvery time the Delimitation exercise is carried out, these reserved constituencies can be switched out.\nOther underprivileged groups are not similarly protected by the Constitution.\nFunctions of the Delimitation Commission\n\nThe Delimitation Commission is a powerful organisation, and its decisions are binding. Its decisions cannot be contested in court. The copies of the orders are presented to the Lok Sabha and the relevant legislative assemblies, but no modifications are allowed.\n\nThe Delimitation Commission must choose the number and boundaries of the constituencies in such a way that, as practically possible, the population of each seat is the same.\nThe Commission also specifies which seats in areas with sizable scheduled castes and scheduled tribes population are to be reserved for those communities.\nIf there is disagreement among the Commission members, the decision of the majority will be considered.\nThe Commission publishes draught proposals for public comment in regional language newspapers as well as the Indian Gazette and official state gazetted.\nAdditionally, it holds open meetings where the general public can voice their opinions orally or in writing.\nThe draught proposal is amended if deemed necessary.\nThe final order is published in the Gazettes and takes effect on the day that the President specifies.\nDuties of the Delimitation Commission\n\nOn the basis of the most recent population census data, the Commission shall be responsible for readjusting the representation of the various territorial constituencies in the House of the People and of the various territorial constituencies in the Legislative Assembly of each state.\n\nDelimitation Commission \u2013 Significance\nThe Delimitation Commission of India has been regarded as having absolute jurisdiction, and any court or piece of legislation can never overturn a decision made by this commission.\nHowever, it has been demonstrated that these instructions from the Indian Delimitation Commission are being followed as of a specific date provided by the Indian President.\nA legislatively supported body that functions independently of the executive branch and political parties is the Delimitation Commission.\nTo ensure that the population is roughly equal throughout all constituencies, it establishes the number and boundaries of constituencies.\nIdentifies seats in areas with a significant population that are reserved for Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes.\nDelimitation Commission \u2013 Criticism\nStates that don\u2019t care about population control might end up with more seats in the House of Representatives. States in the South that supported family planning ran the risk of having fewer seats available.\nThe number of seats in the Assemblies and Parliament that were decided upon in 1971 remained the same despite delimitation being done in 2008 based on the 2001 census.\nIn accordance with the constitution, there are a maximum of 550 Lok Sabha seats and 250 Rajya Sabha seats, respectively, and growing populations are each represented by a single representative.\nWay Forward\nAnother amendment has delayed this until 2026, even though the number of Lok Sabha and Assembly seats should have been unfrozen following the 2001 Census.\nThis was justified on the grounds that by 2026, there would be a uniform population growth rate across the nation.\nA national consensus exercise should be started in order to resolve issues before 2026.\nThe Finance Commission\u2019s weighting of the population can be lowered to 10% or even 5%.\nThe strength of the Lok Sabha is anticipated to increase from 543 to 888 when parliamentary constituency boundaries are redrawn, according to data from the 2011 Census. The Rajya Sabha could have 384 members instead of the current 245.\nConclusion\n\nThe Indian government established the Delimitation Commission of India, also referred to as the Boundary Commission of India, in accordance with the Delimitation Commission Act. The commission\u2019s main duty is to redraw the boundaries of each assembly and Lok Sabha seat in light of a recent census.\n\nAlthough it was anticipated that the limit on the number of Lok Sabha and Assemblies seats would be lifted after the 2001 Census, an amendment delayed it until 2026. This was supported by the prediction that by 2026, the nation\u2019s population growth rate would be uniform.\n\nArticle Written by: Remya"

This article covers almost everything you need to know about the RBI policies.\n\nWhy should a country need a monetary policy? Who makes it? What is the purpose of monetary policy? What are the instruments used for it?\n\nIn this article, let\u2019s learn and understand all major concepts associated with the monetary policy of India.\n\nTable of Contents\n\nWhat is meant by Monetary Policy?\nExpansionary and Contractionary Monetary Policy\nHow does the Reserve Bank of India get its mandate to conduct monetary policy?\nWhat is the main goal of Monetary Policy of India?\nFlexible Inflation Targeting Framework (FITF)\nThe Monetary Policy Framework (MPF)\nMonetary Policy Committee (MPC)\nThe present Monetary Policy Committee (MPC)\nThe Monetary Policy Process (MPP)\nMonetary Policy Instruments (MPI)\nSummary\nWhat is meant by Monetary Policy?\n\nMonetary policy refers to the policy of the central bank \u2013 ie Reserve Bank of India \u2013 in matters of interest rates, money supply and availability of credit.\n\nIt is through the monetary policy, RBI controls inflation in the country.\n\nRBI uses various monetary instruments like REPO rate, Reverse RERO rate, SLR, CRR etc to achieve its purpose. (This is explained well in one of our earlier articles \u2013 basics of economy concepts).\n\nIn short,\u00a0Monetary policy refers to the use of monetary instruments under the control of the central bank to regulate magnitudes such as interest rates, money supply and availability of credit with a view to achieving the ultimate objective of economic policy.\n\n\ud83d\udc49 Which year are YOU targeting for success in the IAS/IPS/IFS Exam? \ud83d\ude80\n\n(1) \u21d2 UPSC 2025: Prelims cum Mains\n\n(2) \u21d2 UPSC 2026: Prelims cum Mains\n\n(3) \u21d2 UPSC 2027 Prelims cum Mains\n\nTip: Know more about ClearIAS Courses (Online/Offline)\n\nAlso read: Loan Loss Provisions\n\nExpansionary and Contractionary Monetary Policy\n\nWe have already seen that monetary policy refers to the actions undertaken by a nation\u2019s central bank\u00a0to control the\u00a0money supply. Control of money supply helps to\u00a0manage inflation or deflation.\n\nThe monetary policy can be expansionary or contractionary.\n\nAn expansionary monetary policy is focused on expanding (increasing) the money supply in an economy. An expansionary monetary policy is implemented by\u00a0lowering key interest rates thus increasing market liquidity.\n\nA contractionary monetary policy is focused on contracting (decreasing) the money supply in an economy. A contractionary monetary policy is implemented by\u00a0increasing key interest rates thus reducing market liquidity.\n\nHow does the Reserve Bank of India get its mandate to conduct monetary policy?\n\nThe Reserve Bank of India (RBI) is vested with the responsibility of conducting monetary policy. This responsibility is explicitly mandated under the Reserve Bank of India Act, 1934.\n\nRecently there were many changes in the way Monetary Policy of India is formed \u2013 with the introduction of Monetary Policy Framework (MPF), Monetary Policy Committee (MPC), and Monetary Policy Process (MPP). We shall see each of these terms in detail soon.\n\nWhat is the main goal of Monetary Policy of India?\n\nMaintain price stability.\n\nThe primary objective of monetary policy is to maintain price stability while keeping in mind the objective of growth. Price stability is a necessary precondition for sustainable growth.\n\nTo maintain price stability, inflation needs to be controlled. The government of India sets an inflation target for every five years. RBI has an important role in the consultation process regarding inflation targeting. The current inflation-targeting framework in India is flexible in nature.\n\nAlso read: Interest Coverage Ratio \u2013 Explained with Example\n\nFlexible Inflation Targeting Framework (FITF)\n\nFlexible Inflation Targeting Framework: Now there is a flexible inflation targeting framework in India (after the 2016 amendment to the\u00a0Reserve Bank of India (RBI) Act, 1934).\nWho sets the inflation target in India: The amended RBI Act provides for the inflation target to be set by the Government of India, in consultation with the Reserve Bank, once every five years.\nCurrent Inflation Target: The Central Government has notified 4 per cent Consumer Price Index (CPI) inflation as the target for the period from August 5, 2016, to March 31, 2021, with the upper tolerance limit of 6 per cent and the lower tolerance limit of 2 per cent.\nFactors that constitute a failure to achieve the inflation target:\u00a0(1) the average inflation is more than the upper tolerance level of the inflation target for any three consecutive quarters, OR (2) the average inflation is less than the lower tolerance level for any three consecutive quarters.\nThe Monetary Policy Framework (MPF)\n\nWhile the Government of India sets the Flexible Inflation Targeting Framework in India, it is the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) which operates the Monetary Policy Framework of the country.\n\nThe amended RBI Act explicitly provides the legislative mandate to the Reserve Bank to operate the monetary policy framework of the country.\nThe framework aims at setting the policy (repo) rate based on an assessment of the current and evolving macroeconomic situation, and modulation of liquidity conditions to anchor money market rates at or around the repo rate.\nNote: Repo rate changes transmit through the money market to the entire financial system, which, in turn, influences aggregate demand \u2013 a key determinant of inflation and growth.\nOnce the repo rate is announced, the operating framework designed by the Reserve Bank envisages liquidity management on a day-to-day basis through appropriate actions, which aim at anchoring the operating target \u2013 the weighted average call rate (WACR) \u2013 around the repo rate.\nMonetary Policy Committee (MPC)\n\nNow in India, the policy interest rate required to achieve the inflation target is decided by the Monetary Policy Committee (MPC). MPC is a six-member committee constituted by the Central Government (Section 45ZB of the amended RBI Act, 1934).\n\nThe MPC is required to meet at least four times a year. The quorum for the meeting of the MPC is four members. Each member of the MPC has one vote, and in the event of an equality of votes, the Governor has a second or casting vote.\n\nThe resolution adopted by the MPC is published after the conclusion of every meeting of the MPC. Once in every six months, the Reserve Bank is required to publish a document called the Monetary Policy Report to explain: (1) the sources of inflation and(2) the forecast of inflation for 6-18 months ahead.\n\nAlso read: LIBOR (London Interbank Offered Rate)\n\nThe present Monetary Policy Committee (MPC)\n\nThe Central Government constituted the present MPC as under:\n\nGovernor of the Reserve Bank of India \u2013 Chairperson,\u00a0ex officio;\nDeputy Governor of the Reserve Bank of India, in charge of Monetary Policy \u2013 Member,\u00a0ex officio;\nOne officer of the Reserve Bank of India to be nominated by the Central Board \u2013 Member,\u00a0ex officio;\nShashanka Bhide, Senior advisor at National Council for Applied Economic Research (NCAER) \u2013 Member;\nAshima Goyal, Professor at the Indira Gandhi Institute of Development Research in Mumbai\u00a0\u2013 Member; and\nJayanth Varma, Professor, Indian Institute of Management, Ahmedabad \u2013 Member.\n\nNote: Members referred to at 4 to 6 above, will hold office for a period of four years or until further orders, whichever is earlier.\n\nThe Monetary Policy Process (MPP)\n\nThe Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) determines the policy interest rate required to achieve the inflation target.\n\nThe Reserve Bank\u2019s Monetary Policy Department (MPD) assists the MPC in formulating the monetary policy. Views of key stakeholders in the economy and analytical work of the Reserve Bank contribute to the process of arriving at the decision on the policy repo rate.\n\nThe Financial Markets Operations Department (FMOD) operationalises the monetary policy, mainly through day-to-day liquidity management operations.\n\nThe Financial Market Committee (FMC) meets daily to review the liquidity conditions so as to ensure that the operating target of monetary policy (weighted average lending rate) is kept close to the policy repo rate. This parameter is also known as\u00a0the weighted average call money rate (WACR).\n\nMonetary Policy Instruments (MPI)\n\nThere are several direct and indirect instruments that are used for implementing monetary policy.\n\nRepo Rate: The (fixed) interest rate at which the Reserve Bank provides overnight liquidity to banks against the collateral of government and other approved securities under the liquidity adjustment facility (LAF).\nReverse Repo Rate: The (fixed) interest rate at which the Reserve Bank absorbs liquidity, on an overnight basis, from banks against the collateral of eligible government securities under the LAF.\nLiquidity Adjustment Facility (LAF): The LAF consists of overnight as well as term repo auctions. Progressively, the Reserve Bank has increased the proportion of liquidity injected under fine-tuning variable rate repo auctions of a range of tenors. The aim of term repo is to help develop the inter-bank term money market, which in turn can set market-based benchmarks for pricing of loans and deposits, and hence improve the transmission of monetary policy. The Reserve Bank also conducts variable interest rate reverse repo auctions, as necessitated under the market conditions.\nMarginal Standing Facility (MSF): A facility under which scheduled commercial banks can borrow an additional amount of overnight money from the Reserve Bank by dipping into their Statutory Liquidity Ratio (SLR) portfolio up to a limit at a penal rate of interest. This provides a safety valve against unanticipated liquidity shocks to the banking system.\nCorridor: The MSF rate and reverse repo rate determine the corridor for the daily movement in the weighted average call money rate.\nBank Rate: It is the rate at which the Reserve Bank is ready to buy or rediscount bills of exchange or other commercial papers. The Bank Rate is published under Section 49 of the Reserve Bank of India Act, 1934. This rate has been aligned to the MSF rate and, therefore, changes automatically as and when the MSF rate changes alongside policy repo rate changes.\nCash Reserve Ratio (CRR): The average daily balance that a bank is required to maintain with the Reserve Bank as a share of such percentage of its Net demand and time liabilities (NDTL) that the Reserve Bank may notify from time to time in the Gazette of India.\nStatutory Liquidity Ratio (SLR): The share of NDTL that a bank is required to maintain in safe and liquid assets, such as unencumbered government securities, cash and gold. Changes in SLR often influence the availability of resources in the banking system for lending to the private sector.\nOpen Market Operations (OMOs): These include both, outright purchase and sale of government securities, for injection and absorption of durable liquidity, respectively.\nMarket Stabilisation Scheme (MSS): This instrument for monetary management was introduced in 2004. Surplus liquidity of a more enduring nature arising from large capital inflows is absorbed through the sale of short-dated government securities and treasury bills. The cash so mobilised is held in a separate government account with the Reserve Bank.\nSummary\n\nMonetary policy refers to the use of monetary instruments under the control of the central bank to regulate magnitudes such as interest rates, money supply and availability of credit with a view to achieving the ultimate objective of economic policy."

It encompasses diverse sectors like fisheries, tourism, shipping, offshore energy, and biotechnology.\n\nWith the oceans facing unprecedented threats from climate change, pollution, and unsustainable exploitation, there is an urgent need to transition to a Blue Economy model that balances economic development with environmental sustainability.\n\n\ud83d\udc49 Which year are YOU targeting for success in the IAS/IPS/IFS Exam? \ud83d\ude80\n\n(1) \u21d2 UPSC 2025: Prelims cum Mains\n\n(2) \u21d2 UPSC 2026: Prelims cum Mains\n\n(3) \u21d2 UPSC 2027 Prelims cum Mains\n\nTip: Know more about ClearIAS Courses (Online/Offline)\n\nBlue Economy 2.0 is a step ahead in this direction. Through its multi-pronged approach focused on restoration, adaptation, and expansion of mariculture and coastal aquaculture, the policy aims to promote climate-resilient and sustainable development in India\u2019s coastal regions.\n\nWhy Does Blue Economy Matter for India?\n\nOceans cover three-fourths of the Earth\u2019s surface and contain 97% of the planet\u2019s water. They also represent 99% of the Earth\u2019s living space and play an important role in regulating the global climate besides being a rich source of biodiversity and natural resources.\n\nThe global ocean economy currently generates over USD 1.5 trillion annually, making it the world\u2019s seventh-largest economy. This is projected to double to USD 3 trillion by 2030 underscoring the vast scope for harnessing the blue economy.\n\nFor India, the stakes are even higher considering the country\u2019s vast coastline, network of ports, vibrant maritime sector, and rich ocean biodiversity.\n\nSome key aspects that highlight the importance of the blue economy for India are:\n\nLong coastline \u2013 With a coastline of 7,500 km and over 1200 islands, India has a massive ocean resource base waiting to be tapped sustainably.\nVibrant ports sector \u2013 India has 12 major and over 200 minor ports that handle 95% of India\u2019s trading by volume and 70% by value. The ports sector is poised for robust growth.\nRich marine biodiversity \u2013 India\u2019s EEZ has over 5,000 species of flora and fauna. Sustainably harnessing ocean resources can create livelihoods.\nFood and nutrition security \u2013 Oceans support over 4 million fishermen and fish production of 13 million tonnes annually in India. The blue economy is key for food security.\nClimate change mitigation \u2013 Oceans are the largest carbon sinks absorbing 25% of CO2 released into the atmosphere. Conserving blue carbon ecosystems like mangroves, and sea-grass meadows is important.\nEnergy security \u2013 Offshore oil and gas, ocean energy, and offshore wind energy are integral to India\u2019s energy security and transition to green energy.\nHigh growth potential \u2013 Studies estimate the Indian Ocean economy can grow at 15% annually to over USD 120 billion by 2025.\nKey Components of Blue Economy 2.0\n\nThe goal of Blue Economy 2.0 is to encourage activities and development along coastlines that can withstand and adapt to climate change.\n\nMarine environments are encountering immense threats from climate change, contamination, and excessive exploitation.\n\nThis highlights the need for collaborative efforts to protect ocean resources and strengthen their durability.\n\nKey aspects of the Blue Economy 2.0 Policy are:\n\nCoastal Ecosystem Restoration and Adaptation Measures\n\nRestoring degraded coastal ecosystems like mangroves, coral reefs, and sea-grass meadows through natural and artificial interventions.\n\nImplementing shoreline protection, beach nourishment, and other adaptation measures to mitigate rising sea levels, erosion, flooding, and extreme weather events.\n\nAdopting disaster risk reduction strategies like early warning systems, and climate-proofing coastal infrastructure.\n\nConducting ecological assessments for judicious coastal zone planning balancing development needs with sustainability.\n\nExpanding Coastal and Mariculture\n\nPromoting the sustainable expansion of coastal aquaculture of shrimps, crabs, Mollusca, seaweed, etc. through productive interventions.\n\nExpanding mariculture through farming of high-value marine fish like seabass, and groupers in open seas within EEZ.\n\nProviding funding, tax incentives, and subsidies to fishermen, farmer cooperatives, and private firms for adopting sustainable coastal and mariculture practices.\n\nInvesting in R&D, technology incubation, and innovations in areas like offshore cage farming, sea ranching, and integrated multi-trophic aquaculture.\n\nIntegrated Planning and Multi-Sectoral Approach\n\nAdopting a multi-sectoral approach with coordinated planning and action across shipping, ports, tourism, offshore energy, biotechnology, and security sectors related to oceans.\n\nMainstreaming blue economy across national and state policies, schemes, and developmental plans including marine spatial planning.\n\nFostering multi-stakeholder partnerships between different ministries, state governments, industry, and coastal communities.\n\nDeveloping sustainability criteria, guidelines, and standards for the use of ocean resources across sectors.\n\nLeveraging the latest technologies like geospatial mapping, ocean observation systems, communication networks, and big data analytics to support evidence-based planning and monitoring.\n\nWhy in the news?\n\nThe government in its Interim Budget 2024 highlighted the plans to promote Blue Economy 2.0. This will be done through a new program concentrated on restoration, adaptation, coastal aquaculture, and mariculture.\n\nThis policy aimed at harnessing the vast potential of the country\u2019s 7,500 km coastline and 2.2 million sq km Exclusive Economic Zone (EEZ).\nThe specific details regarding the budget allocation for the scheme or the activities it would entail have not been revealed yet.\nWay Forward\n\nThe Indian government recently announced the Blue Economy 2.0 policy in the budget. This policy aims to use India\u2019s oceans and coastal areas to create economic growth sustainably.\n\nTo make this policy work, the government will need to get many groups to work together. These include state governments, businesses, science institutions, thinkers, and local coastal communities.\n\nThe government will need to provide enough money and incentives for people to use the oceans responsibly. New technologies can help monitor the oceans and coastal areas. This information can help plan and check that rules are followed.\n\nIndia can learn from other countries about sustainable fishing, eco-tourism, and green ports. Partnering with international organizations can also provide useful insights.\n\nIf all groups work together responsibly, the Blue Economy 2.0 scheme can sustainably create jobs and growth. But it remains to be seen if this will happen. Overall, the scheme aims to use India\u2019s vast oceans and coasts to benefit the economy while protecting the environment.\n\nArticle Written By: Priti Raj"

This includes facilitating access to credit and financial services for rural households.\n\nSocial Mobilization and Capacity Building: NRLM emphasizes social mobilization and capacity building at the grassroots level. This involves building the skills and capabilities of the rural poor, particularly women, to enable them to take charge of their development.\n\nAajeevika \u2013 National Rural Livelihoods Mission (DAY-NRLM): In 2015, the program was renamed DAY-NRLM to honor Pandit Deendayal Upadhyaya and to reflect a broader focus on livelihoods.\n\nAided in part through investment support by the World Bank, the Mission aims at creating efficient and effective institutional platforms for the rural poor, enabling them to increase household income through sustainable livelihood enhancements and improved access to financial services.\n\nKey benefits of the Scheme\nOne member (preferably a woman) from each rural poor household would be brought under the Self-Help Group (SHG) network. Women SHG groups would have bank-linkage arrangements.\nSHGs would be federated at the village level and higher levels to provide space, voice, and resources and to reduce dependence on external agencies.\nThe Mission consists of four components, viz., (i) social mobilization, community institution, and capacity building; (ii) financial inclusion; (iii) livelihood promotion; and (iv) convergence.\nThe participatory social assessment would be organized to identify and rank all households according to vulnerability.

food patterns, vast farming areas, diverse agriculture, and a large population dependent on agriculture has propelled India to the world\u2019s center stage as a big consumer market and also as a key supplier of food products.\n\nIt has often been suggested that an essential element of \u201cMake in India\u201d has to be \u201cBake in India\u201d, i.e., a renewed focus on value addition and processed agricultural products.\nThe rapidly growing global population and shrinking farmlands, coupled with changing socio-economic, agroclimatic, and dietary patterns, have challenged scientists and policymakers to reconsider how we grow and feed 7.5 billion global citizens.\nIndia\u2019s quest is to grow sustainably, trade abundantly, and progress harmoniously.\nAgriculture export, if properly supported by infrastructure, institutional backup, packaging, freight transport and connected to the internal production system backed by market access will be in a position to transform the agricultural economy.\n\nWith numerous challenges, there has been a long-felt need for a dedicated agricultural export policy in India.\n\nThe Agriculture Export Policy is framed with a focus on agriculture export-oriented production, export promotion, better farmer realization and synchronization within policies and programs of the Government of India.\nIt is required to have a \u201cFarmers\u2019 Centric Approach\u201d for improved income through value addition at the source itself which will help to minimize losses across the value chain.\nIndia needs to have a

During the positive phase, the eastern North Pacific tends to be warmer than average, while during the negative phase, it tends to be cooler than average.\nThe positive phase is characterized by cool SSTs north of Hawaii and warmer-than-normal sea surface temperatures along the western coast of North America.\nThe negative phase is a mirror image with warm ocean temperatures in the Central North Pacific and cooler than normal waters along the western coast of North America.\n\nSpatial Patterns:\n\nThe positive phase is associated with a horseshoe-shaped pattern of above-average sea surface temperatures, with warm waters extending along the western coast of North America and into the central North Pacific.\nIn the negative phase, the pattern is reversed, with cooler waters along the western coast of North America.\n\nDuration:\n\nThe PDO is a long-term climate pattern that typically lasts for 20 to 30 years in one phase before transitioning to the opposite phase. However, the timing and duration of these phases can vary considerably.\n\nNatural Climate Variability:\n\nThe PDO is considered a part of natural climate variability and is driven by a combination of oceanic and atmospheric processes.\nIt is not directly related to human-induced climate change, although it can interact with and modulate the effects of climate change in certain regions.\nImpact of Pacific Decadal Oscillation\n\nThe PDO can influence weather patterns, ocean conditions, and ecosystems over a wide area, including North America and the North Pacific region.\n\nPositive Phase Impacts\nDuring the positive phase, it is often associated with milder winters in the western United States, increased rainfall in the Pacific Northwest, and changes in marine ecosystems.\nThe Northern Rockies and the Midwest are likely to be drier than normal, while Texas, the Gulf states, and the East are likely to be wetter than normal.\nDuring the positive phase of the PDO in the northern hemisphere wintertime, much of Asia is usually cooler than normal, with above-normal temperatures more likely over India.\nAt the same time, China and Japan are likely to be drier than normal, while India often has a winter that is wetter than normal.\nNegative Phase Impacts\nDuring the negative phase, it can lead to colder winters in the western U.S., drier conditions in the Pacific Northwest, and different marine ecosystem dynamics.\nMany parts of the US will see drier than normal weather, but there are some notable exceptions.\nDuring a negative PDO, winter rainfall is usually above normal for the Ohio and Tennessee Valleys as well as the Northern Rockies and Plains.\nDuring the negative phase of the PDO in the northern hemisphere wintertime, much of India and China is usually cooler than normal, But Japan has warmer than normal weather, especially in the North.\nAt the same time, Japan and Northwest China are usually wetter than normal, while Southwest China and much of India are usually wetter than normal\nPDO vs ENSO\n\nIt\u2019s important to note that the PDO is distinct from ENSO, which operates on a shorter timescale (typically 2 to 7 years) and involves interactions between the ocean and atmosphere in the tropical Pacific.\n\nHowever, there can be interactions between the PDO and ENSO, where the phase of one pattern can influence or reinforce the phase of the other.\n\nParameter\n\n\t\nPDO\n\t\n\nENSO\n\n\n\n\nTimescale\n\n\t\nThe PDO is a long-term climate pattern that varies on decadal to multi-decadal timescales, typically ranging from 20 to 30 years for each phase.\n\t\nENSO is a shorter-term climate phenomenon, with irregular cycles that typically last 2 to 7 years. It has two primary phases: El Ni\u00f1o (warm) and La Ni\u00f1a (cool), with a neutral phase in between.\n\n\n\nNature\n\n\t\nThe PDO is characterized by a shift in sea surface temperature (SST) patterns in the North Pacific Ocean. It involves the alternation between warm (positive) and cool (negative) phases.\n\t\nENSO involves changes in sea surface temperatures and atmospheric pressure patterns in the tropical Pacific Ocean, primarily in the eastern and central equatorial Pacific.\n\n\n\nGeographic scope\n\n\t\nThe PDO affects the entire North Pacific Ocean, from the west coast of North America to Japan and beyond.\n\t\nENSO\u2019s primary impacts are felt in the tropical Pacific region, but it has far-reaching global consequences.\n\n\n\nOceanic and atmospheric effects\n\n\t\nThe PDO primarily influences sea surface temperatures and oceanic patterns in the North Pacific. It can have secondary effects on atmospheric circulation, precipitation patterns, and climate conditions in the surrounding regions.\n\t\nENSO can lead to significant shifts in atmospheric circulation, altering weather patterns, precipitation, and temperature anomalies across the Pacific basin and beyond.\n\n\n\nImpact\n\n\t\nThe PDO can influence weather patterns and climate conditions over extended periods, affecting fisheries, marine ecosystems, and even temperature and precipitation patterns in North America.\n\t\nENSO can have profound and immediate impacts on global weather and climate. El Ni\u00f1o is associated with warm oceanic conditions and can lead to droughts, flooding, and extreme weather events, while La Ni\u00f1a tends to have the opposite effects.\nConclusion\n\nPDO and ENSO are distinct climate phenomena, each with its timescale, geographic scope, and influence on oceanic and atmospheric conditions. Understanding these patterns is essential for climate forecasting and assessing their impacts on weather, agriculture, and ecosystems.\n\nScientists monitor the PDO to understand its phase and anticipate its impacts on regional climate and ecosystems. Understanding the PDO can be valuable for various sectors, including agriculture, fisheries, and water resource management, as it provides insights into long-term climate patterns in the North Pacific region.\n\n-Article by Swathi Satish"

The IOD is often referred to as the \u201cIndian Ocean\u2019s counterpart to El Ni\u00f1o.\u201d\n\nThe IOD\u2019s influence on sea surface temperatures and atmospheric pressure can have far-reaching effects on regional weather patterns.\nPositive IOD events can lead to droughts in countries like India, which rely heavily on the monsoon rains, as well as reduced agricultural productivity in affected areas.\nConversely, negative IOD events can bring relief from drought conditions in some regions but can also lead to an increased risk of flooding.\n\nRead:\u00a0Impact of climate change on Indian monsoon\n\nVariability and Prediction\nThe Indian Ocean Dipole exhibits variability on various timescales, from intra-seasonal to interannual.\nPredicting the IOD is challenging, but advances in climate modeling and monitoring have improved the ability to forecast its development.\nThe IOD is influenced by multiple factors, including ocean-atmosphere interactions and interactions with other climate phenomena like El Ni\u00f1o.\nPast events\n\nThe positive IOD event is known to help the South-West monsoon. The 2019 event was one of the strongest on record.\n\nIt drove the Indian monsoon to excess and extended it into October.\nFor Australia, a positive IOD event year brought low rainfall from October to December, a late monsoon onset, and low tropical cyclone activity.\nIndian Ocean Dipole and ENSO\n\nIndian Ocean Dipole is a varying ocean-atmosphere system in the Indian Ocean like ENSO in the Pacific Ocean.\n\nENSO and IOD are not directly linked but can influence each other indirectly. For example, during El Ni\u00f1o, the warming of the central and eastern Pacific can affect atmospheric circulation and rainfall patterns, which, in turn, can impact the IOD by affecting the trade winds and ocean currents in the Indian Ocean.\n\nThere are instances when a positive IOD and El Ni\u00f1o occur simultaneously, leading to compounded and potentially more extreme impacts on regional climate variability.\nIt was observed that a positive IOD index often negated the effect of ENSO, resulting in increased Monsoon rains in several ENSO years like 1983, 1994, and 1997.\nConclusion\n\nThe Indian Ocean Dipole is a vital climate driver that can significantly impact ecosystems, agriculture, water resources, and economies in the Indian Ocean region.\n\nIt underscores the complex interactions between ocean and atmosphere and the need for improved climate prediction systems to manage the potential impacts of its positive and negative phases.\n\nPrevious year question\n\nQ. With reference to \u2018Indian Ocean Dipole (IOD)\u2019 sometimes mentioned in the news while forecasting the Indian monsoon, which of the following statements is/are correct? (2017)\n\nThe IOD phenomenon is characterized by a difference in sea surface temperature between the tropical Western Indian Ocean and the tropical Eastern Pacific Ocean.\nAn IOD phenomenon can influence an El Nino\u2019s impact on the monsoon.\n\nSelect the correct answer using the code given below:\n\n(a) 1 only\n\n(b) 2 only\n\n(c) Both 1 and 2\n\n(d) Neither 1 nor 2\n\n-Article by Swathi Satish"

But what do they mean, what are events related to them, and how do they influence the seasons on Earth- these are some of the in-depth questions that will be answered here. Read further to learn more.\n\nEquinoxes and solstices are radically opposing. Equinoxes and solstices are what give rise to the earth\u2019s seasons.\n\nOn account of the planet\u2019s inclination towards its axis,\u00a0as it circles the Sun, seasons fluctuate on Earth. This implies that various regions of the Earth receive more or less sunlight depending on the time of year.\n\nThe Sun would constantly appear above the Equator, the amount of light received at any given position would be constant, and there wouldn\u2019t be any seasons if the Earth weren\u2019t tilted. The equinoxes and solstices wouldn\u2019t even need to be observed.\n\nTable of Contents\n\nSolstice\nScience of Solstices\nEquinox\nScience of Equinoxes\nSolstice and Equinox: Relation to seasons\nSolstice and Equinox: Cultural significance\nSolstice\n\nA solstice is an event in which a planet\u2019s poles are most extremely inclined toward or away from the star it orbits.\n\n\ud83d\udc49 Which year are YOU targeting for success in the IAS/IPS/IFS Exam? \ud83d\ude80\n\n(1) \u21d2 UPSC 2025: Prelims cum Mains\n\n(2) \u21d2 UPSC 2026: Prelims cum Mains\n\n(3) \u21d2 UPSC 2027 Prelims cum Mains\n\nTip: Know more about ClearIAS Courses (Online/Offline)\n\nSolar declination, the latitude of Earth where the sun is directly above at noon defines solstices on our planet.\n\nThe solar declination reaches the Tropic of Cancer in the north and the Tropic of Capricorn in the south at the solstices, which occur twice a year on Earth.\nThe solar declination of the June solstice, which is observed between June 20 and June 22, is around 23.5\u00b0N (the Tropic of Cancer).\nSolar declination is around 23.5\u00b0S (the Tropic of Capricorn) during the December solstice, which is observed between December 20 and December 23.\n\nSolar declination describes the latitude of Earth where the sun is directly overhead at noon.\n\nThe Earth\u2019s 23.5\u00b0 axial tilt as it circles the sun causes solitons and varying solar declinations.\n\nThis indicates that, depending on which hemisphere is inclined towards the sun during the year, it gets the sun\u2019s rays at their strongest intensity.\n\nDespite having distinct dates in the Northern and Southern Hemispheres, the solstices are referred to as the \u201csummer solstice\u201d and the \u201cwinter solstice,\u201d respectively.\n\nThe longest day of the year is the summer solstice when the sun is at its strongest and there are the most hours of daylight.\nThe winter solstice has the fewest daylight hours and is the shortest day of the year.\nThe June solstice is the summer solstice in the Northern Hemisphere and the winter solstice in the Southern Hemisphere.\nThe December solstice is the winter solstice in the Northern Hemisphere and the summer solstice in the Southern.\n\nSolstices occur on every planet in our solar system. The planet\u2019s axial tilt, orbital eccentricity, and distance from the sun all have a significant role in determining the date and size of solstices.\n\nThe axial tilt of Venus, the planet nearest to Earth, is barely 3\u00b0. Its solstices are spaced by around three months; thus, Venus suffers relatively little seasonal fluctuation.\nOur other close neighbor, Mars, has a 24\u00b0 axial tilt, which is identical to Earth\u2019s. Mars, on the other hand, orbits the sun in an orbit that is noticeably more elliptical than Earth\u2019s because of its substantially higher orbital eccentricity. Mars has dramatic seasonal fluctuations and its solstices are spaced around 11 months apart due to its greater orbital eccentricity and axial tilt.\nScience of Solstices\n\nSubscribe to the ClearIAS YouTube Channel for more informative videos on UPSC preparation, tips, and strategies. Stay updated with our latest content and enhance your exam readiness.\n\nThe solstices are felt differently depending on the latitude of Earth. The solstice marks the maximum point of dramatic exposure to daylight at the poles while scarcely being recognized near the equator.\n\nEquatorial regions\n\nThe Equator, at 0\u00b0 latitude, receives a maximum intensity of the sun\u2019s rays all year.\nAs a result, areas near Earth\u2019s Equator experience relatively constant sunlight and little solstice variation.\n\nMidlatitudes\n\nEarth\u2019s solstices are largely marked by the transition of the subsolar point across the tropics.\n\nThe latitude where the sun\u2019s rays strike Earth perfectly perpendicular to its surface is known as the subsolar point. It is the location where the sun is above at midday.\nThe subsolar point travels north and south over the tropics for the majority of the year before appearing at the Equator twice a year (around the equinoxes).\nThe subsolar point travels to its northern and southernmost latitudes at the solstices.\nOn the June solstice, the Tropic of Cancer, which is 23.5\u00b0 north of the equator, receives direct sunlight.\nThe subsolar point then starts moving south, and on the December solstice, vertical rays fall on the Tropic of Capricorn, which is 23.5\u00b0 south of the equator.\nEvery latitude in between these two extremes will be traversed by the subsolar point twice annually.\n\nPolar regions\n\nThe Arctic and Antarctica are never reached by the subsolar point.\n\nThe solstices represent the times when the sun is highest or lowest in the sky at the North and South Poles, respectively.\nTherefore, the solstices serve as the most extreme manifestations of the \u201cmidnight sun\u201d and \u201cpolar night.\u201d\nThe phenomena around the summer solstice, when the sun is still visible at midnight in the weeks preceding and after the event, is referred to as the \u201cmidnight sun.\u201d\nThe weeks preceding and after the winter solstice are referred to as the \u201cpolar night\u201d since the sun is below the horizon.\nEquinox\n\nAn equinox is an event in which a planet\u2019s subsolar point passes through its Equator.\n\nThe equinoxes are the only time when both the Northern and Southern Hemispheres experience roughly equal amounts of daytime and nighttime.\n\nTwo equinoxes occur annually on Earth: one around March 21 and the other around September 22. Even though the spring and fall equinoxes have distinct dates in the Northern and Southern Hemispheres.\n\nThe equinoxes are occasionally referred to as the \u201cvernal equinox\u201d (spring equinox) and the \u201cautumnal equinox\u201d (fall equinox).\nIn the Northern Hemisphere, the March equinox marks the spring equinox, whereas, in the Southern Hemisphere, it marks the autumnal equinox.\nIn the Northern Hemisphere, the equinox in September is the autumnal equinox; in the Southern, it is the vernal equinox.\n\nOn most planets, equinoxes occur. The axial tilt and orbital properties of the planet dictate when the equinoxes occur.\n\nEquinoxes are very spectacular on the gas giant Saturn. The equinoxes on Saturn occur every 15 years and last for around four days.\nThe magnificent ring system of Saturn revolves in the same plane as the equator of the planet.\nThe rings span thousands of kilometers across, yet they are just a few kilometers broad, making them exceedingly thin.\nThe rings and Saturn\u2019s equator exactly align with the sun during Saturn\u2019s equinoxes. Images taken from the perspective of the sun show the rings as a fine line.\nScience of Equinoxes\n\nDuring the equinoxes, solar declination is 0\u00b0. So, equinoxes are the only times of the year when the subsolar point is directly on the Equator.\n\nThe apparent center of the Sun\u2019s disc is in the same plane as the Equator during an equinox, which prevents Earth\u2019s 23.5\u00b0 axis from tilting either towards or away from the Sun.\n\nThe subsolar point moves north or south both before and after the equinox.\n\nThe subsolar point moves northward after the March equinox when the Northern Hemisphere tilts towards the sun.\nThe subsolar point crosses the Tropic of Cancer (23.5\u00b0N) around June 21.\nThe subsolar point starts to move southward after this June solstice.\nThe subsolar point keeps moving south after the September equinox as the Southern Hemisphere tilts towards the sun.\nThe subsolar point crosses the Tropic of Capricorn (23.5\u00b0S) around December 21 which is the December solstice.\n\nThe sun terminator equally divides the Earth from north to south at an equinox, indicating equally lighted hemispheres.\n\nOn a globe, the darkened line denoting day and night is known as the solar terminator.\nThere would be 12 hours of day and night on an actual equinox.\n\nEquatorial regions\n\nThe sun\u2019s rays are at their strongest all year round in the Equator, which is located at 0\u00b0 latitude.\nAs a result, there is little equinoctial oscillation and generally consistent sunshine in regions close to the equator.\nIn general, equinoxes and celestial seasons have less of an effect than climate-driven patterns like precipitation (rainy seasons and dry seasons).\n\nMidlatitudes\n\nWith latitude, seasonal fluctuation gets more extreme. The difference between the lengths of day and night during the \u201cequinox\u201d is significantly widened by atmospheric refraction.\nThe day lasts roughly eight minutes longer than the night at a latitude of around 30\u00b0.\n\nPolar regions\n\nIn the Arctic and Antarctic, where atmospheric refraction is most pronounced, the length of the day is approximately 12 hours, 16 minutes.\nThe equinoxes in polar locations thus serve as a signal for the gradual transition from \u201cmidnight sun\u201d to \u201cpolar night.\u201d\nThe phenomenon known as the \u201cmidnight sun\u201d occurs when the sun never sets below the horizon, illuminating the area all day long.\nIn contrast, \u201cpolar night\u201d refers to a period when the sun never rises, putting the area in complete darkness for 24 hours.\nSolstice and Equinox: Relation to seasons\n\nWe all know that the Earth follows an elliptical orbit around the sun, doing a full rotation once every 365 days.\n\nThis implies that the average distance of 93 million miles between the Earth and the Sun fluctuates during the year.\nThe Earth travels around 1.6 million miles closer to the sun during the first week of January. The perihelion is used to describe this.\nThe first week of July marks the aphelion, or the moment at which the Earth is approximately 1.6 million miles further from the sun.\n\nAlthough this information may seem to contradict what we know about seasons in the Northern Hemisphere, the climatic difference is not that big and is NOT the cause of our seasons.\n\nThe Earth\u2019s 23.5\u00b0 tilt on its axis is what causes the seasons. The Northern Hemisphere has tilted away from the sun in December and towards the sun in June because the tilt\u2019s position about space remains constant throughout the year.\n\nThe solstices and equinoxes mark the beginning and end of each season on Earth.\n\nSolstice and Equinox: Cultural significance\n\nThe solstices currently signal the start of winter and summer, but in certain ancient societies, these were the only seasons acknowledged (autumn and spring were not there). As a result, the solstices took place in the middle of the seasons.\n\nDue to this, the solstices are sometimes referred to as midwinter and midsummer.\nNumerous civilizations have celebrated the solstices with celebrations and festivals since ancient times.\n\nLike the solstices, equinoxes are historic markers of seasonal change.\n\nThe March equinox is historically recognized as a time of rebirth and regeneration since it unofficially ushers in the spring season. Because of this, the March equinox has traditionally been observed by many civilizations as the start of a new year.\nThe majority of September equinox-related cultural celebrations are linked to harvest festivities in the fall.\n\nRead:\u00a0Leap year: How does it work?\n\n-Article by Swathi Satish"

This translates to about 1,720 cubic meters (61,000 cu feet) of freshwater per person.\n\nFor most places in India, groundwater is the main source of water supply, and the country\u2019s rapidly declining groundwater resources demand immediate attention if water security is to be ensured in the upcoming years.\n\nAlso read: Aravalli Green Wall Project\n\nTable of Contents\n\n\ud83d\udc49 Which year are YOU targeting for success in the IAS/IPS/IFS Exam? \ud83d\ude80\n\n(1) \u21d2 UPSC 2025: Prelims cum Mains\n\n(2) \u21d2 UPSC 2026: Prelims cum Mains\n\n(3) \u21d2 UPSC 2027 Prelims cum Mains\n\nTip: Know more about ClearIAS Courses (Online/Offline)\n\nRainwater harvesting\nTraditional water harvesting systems in India\nGovernment policies for Rainwater harvesting\nWay forward\nRainwater harvesting\n\nThe act of collecting and storing rainwater as opposed to letting it flow off is known as rainwater harvesting.\n\nRainwater is gathered from a surface like a roof and directed to a container with percolation, such as a tank, cistern, deep pit (well, shaft, or borehole), aquifer, or reservoir where it seeps down and replenishes the groundwater table.\n\nThe rainwater harvesting process includes the collection and storage of collected rainwater with the help of artificially designed systems.\n\nThe main components of the system are-\n\nCatchment: Used to collect and store the captured rainwater.\nConveyance system: It is used to transport the harvested water from the catchment to the recharge zone.\nFlush: It is used to flush out the first spell of rain.\nFilter: Used for filtering the collected rainwater and removing pollutants.\nTanks and recharge structures: Used to store the filtered water which is ready to use.\n\nRainwater harvesting has significance in solving other related issues in a nation like food security, rapid urbanization, and industrial developmental demands. This method acts as a decentralized source of water for all needs.\n\nTraditional water harvesting systems in India\n\nWater has been harvested in India since antiquity, with our ancestors perfecting the art of water management. The raindrops were harvested directly from rooftops collected water and stored in tanks built in their courtyards.\n\nFrom open community lands, the rain was collected and stored in artificial wells.\nThe monsoon runoff was harvested by capturing water from swollen streams during the monsoon season and storing it through various forms of water bodies.\nThe water was also harvested from flooded rivers.\n\nPaar system: Paar is a common water harvesting practice in the western Rajasthan region.\n\nIt is a common place where the rainwater flows from the agar (catchment) and in the process percolates into the sandy soil.\nTo access the Rajani pani (percolated water) kuis or beris are dug in the agor (storage area).\n\nTalan/bandhis: Talabs are reservoirs.\n\nThey may be natural, such as the ponds (pokhariyan) at Tikamgarh in the Bundelkhand region.\nThey can be human-made, such as the lakes in Udaipur.\nA reservoir area of fewer than five bighas is called a talai; a medium-sized lake is called a bandhi or talab; bigger lakes are called sagar or samand.\nThe pokhariyan serves irrigation and drinking purposes. When the water in these reservoirs dries up just a few days after the monsoon, the pond beds are cultivated with rice.\n\nSaza kuva: An open well with multiple owners (saza means partner), saza kuva is the most important source of irrigation in the Aravalli hills in Mewar, eastern Rajasthan.\n\nThe soil dug out to make the well pit is used to construct a huge circular foundation or an elevated platform sloping away from the well.\nThe first is built to accommodate the rehat, a traditional water lifting device; the sloping platform is for the chada, in which buffaloes are used to lift water.\n\nJohads: Johads are small earthen check dams that capture and conserve rainwater, improving percolation and groundwater recharge.\n\nStarting in 1984, the last sixteen years have seen the revival of some 3000 johads spread across more than 650 villages in the Alwar district, Rajasthan.\nThis has resulted in a general rise of the groundwater level by almost 6 meters and a 33 percent increase in the forest cover in the area.\n\nPat: Bhitada village, Jhabua district of Madhya Pradesh developed the unique pat system.\n\nThis system was devised according to the particularities of the terrain to divert water from swift-flowing hill streams into irrigation channels called pats.\n\nJhalaras: Jhalaras are typically rectangular-shaped step-wells that have tiered steps on three or four sides.\n\nThese step-wells collect the subterranean seepage of an upstream reservoir or a lake.\nJhalaras were built to ensure an easy and regular supply of water for religious rites, royal ceremonies, and community use.\nThe city of Jodhpur has eight jhalaras, the oldest being the Mahamandir Jhalara which dates back to 1660 CE.\n\nBawari: Bawaris are unique step-wells that were once a part of the ancient networks of water storage in the cities of Rajasthan.\n\nThe little rain that the region received would be diverted to man-made tanks through canals built on the hilly outskirts of cities.\nThe water would then percolate into the ground, raising the water table and recharging a deep and intricate network of aquifers.\nTo minimize water loss through evaporation, a series of layered steps were built around the reservoirs to narrow and deepen the wells.\n\nTaanka: Taanka is a traditional rainwater harvesting technique indigenous to the Thar desert region of Rajasthan.\n\nA Taanka is a cylindrical paved underground pit into which rainwater from rooftops, courtyards or artificially prepared catchments flows.\n\nAhar Pynes: Ahar Pynes are traditional floodwater harvesting systems native to South Bihar.\n\nAhars are reservoirs with embankments on three sides that are built at the end of diversion channels like pynes.\nPynes are artificial rivulets led off from rivers to collect water in the ahars for irrigation in the dry months.\nPaddy cultivation in this relatively low rainfall area depends mostly on ahar pynes.\n\nPanam keni: The Kuruma tribe (a native tribe of Wayanad) uses a special type of well, called the Panam keni, to store water.\n\nWooden cylinders are made by soaking the stems of toddy palms in water for a long time so that the core rots away until only the hard outer layer remains.\n\nKhadin: Khadins are ingenious constructions designed to harvest surface runoff water for agriculture.\n\nThe main feature of a khadin, also called dhora, is a long earthen embankment that is built across the hill slopes of gravelly uplands.\nSluices and spillways allow the excess water to drain off and the water-saturated land is then used for crop production.\nFirst designed by the Paliwal Brahmins of Jaisalmer in the 15th century, this system is very similar to the irrigation methods of the people of ancient Ur (present Iraq).\n\nKund: A kund is a saucer-shaped catchment area that gently slopes towards the central circular underground well. Its main purpose is to harvest rainwater for drinking.\n\nKunds dot the sandier tracts of western Rajasthan and Gujarat. Traditionally, these well-pits were covered in disinfectant lime and ash.\nRaja Sur Singh is said to have built the earliest known kunds in the village of Vadi Ka Melan in the year 1607 CE.\n\nBaoli: These were built by the nobility for civic, strategic, or philanthropic reasons, baolis were secular structures from which everyone could draw water.\n\nThese beautiful stepwells typically have beautiful arches, carved motifs, and sometimes, rooms on their sides.\nBaolis within villages were mainly used for utilitarian purposes and social gatherings.\nBaolis on trade routes were often frequented as resting places.\nStepwells used exclusively for agriculture had drainage systems that channeled water into the fields.\n\nNadi: These are village ponds that store rainwater collected from adjoining natural catchment areas. These are found near Jodhpur in Rajasthan.\n\nZings: These are found in Ladakh. They are small tanks that collect melting glacier water.\n\nA network of guiding channels brings water from the glacier to the tank. The melting waters of the glacier are article in the mornings and turn into a flowing stream by the afternoon.\nThe water, collected by evening, is used in the fields on the following day.\nA water official called a Chirpun is responsible for the equitable distribution of water in this dry region that relies on melting glacial water to meet its farming needs.\n\nKuhls: Kuhls are surface water channels found in the mountainous regions of Himachal Pradesh.\n\nThe channels carry glacial waters from rivers and streams into the fields.\nThe Kangra Valley system has an estimated 715 major Kuhls and 2,500 minor kuhls that irrigate more than 30,000 hectares in the valley.\nKulhs are an important cultural tradition and were built either through public donations or by royal rulers.\n\nZabo: It means \u2018impounding run-off\u201d. This system combines water conservation with forestry, agriculture, and animal care.\n\nPracticed in Nagaland, Zabo is also known as the Ruza system.\nRainwater that falls on forested hilltops is collected by channels that deposit the run-off water in pond-like structures created on the terraced hillsides.\n\nEri: It is a tank system used in Tamil Nadu which is one of the oldest water management systems in India.\n\nGovernment policies for Rainwater harvesting\n\nCentral Government has formulated National Water Policy 2012 which inter alia contains provisions for rainwater harvesting like:\n\nincentivizing the revival of traditional water harvesting structures by States,\nencouraging rainwater harvesting to increase the availability of utilizable water in urban and industrial areas,\npreference to urban and rural domestic water supply from surface water in conjunction with groundwater and rainwater, etc.\n\nWater being a State subject, steps for augmentation, conservation, and efficient management of water resources are primarily undertaken by the respective State Governments.\n\nSome of the major steps taken by the Government of India for rainwater harvesting are as follows:\n\nJal Shakti Abhiyan: This was expanded as \u201cJal Shakti Abhiyan: Catch the Rain\u201d (JSA: CTR) in 2021 with the theme \u201cCatch the Rain Where it Falls When it Falls\u201d to cover all the blocks of all districts (rural as well as urban areas) across the country.\n\nAtal Bhuj Yojana: It is a Central Sector Scheme with an outlay of Rs. 6,000 crores in identified water-stressed areas of 8,220 Gram Panchayats (GPs) under 229 blocks in 80 districts of 7 States viz. Gujarat, Haryana, Karnataka, Madhya Pradesh, Maharashtra, Rajasthan, and Uttar Pradesh to arrest the decline in groundwater level through community-led sustainable groundwater management.\n\nWatershed Development Component of Pradhan Mantri Krishi Sinchayee Yojana (WDC-PMKSY) has got rainwater harvesting as one of the activities under its Natural Resource Management (NRM) component.\n\nSurface Minor Irrigation (SMI) and Repair, Renovation & Restoration (RRR) of Water Bodies have multiple objectives expanding the cultivable area under assured irrigation by improvement and restoration of water bodies inter alia increasing groundwater recharge and revival of lost irrigation potential.\n\nMaster Plan for Artificial Recharge to Groundwater- 2020 has been prepared by Central Ground Water Board in consultation with States/UTs which is a macro-level plan indicating various structures for the different terrain conditions of the country.\n\nAtal Mission for Rejuvenation and Urban Transformation (AMRUT) was launched in 2015 and focuses on the development of basic urban infrastructure especially water supply & access to tap connection to every household in 500 cities.\n\nMahatma Gandhi National Rural Employment Guarantee Scheme (MGNREGS) includes water conservation and water harvesting structures as one of the activities under its natural resource management (NRM) component.\n\nMission Amrit Sarovar was launched on National Panchayati Raj Day on 24th April 2022 as a part of the celebration of Azadi ka Amrit Mahotsav to conserve water for the future. The Mission is aimed at developing and rejuvenating 75 water bodies in each district of the country\n\nWay forward\n\nTo replenish India\u2019s depleting water supplies, it is urgent to encourage rainwater harvesting utilizing a combination of ancient rainfall-saving techniques including percolation tanks, injection wells, and subsurface barriers with modern rainwater-saving methods.\n\nBut relying just on conventional techniques is insufficient.

The literal meaning of the term vortex is the anti-clockwise movement of air that retains the cold air nearby the poles.\n\nIt is observed that throughout the winters in Northern Hemisphere, the polar low-pressure becomes comparatively less stable and often expands, sending cold Arctic air toward the south over the US with the jet stream.\n\nIt is primarily present in the upper troposphere that sometimes extends to the lower stratosphere, especially at the poles. It is a constant low-pressure area that rotates at the upper level of the north pole in an anti-clockwise direction, and at the South Pole, it rotates in a clockwise direction.\n\n\ud83d\udc49 Which year are YOU targeting for success in the IAS/IPS/IFS Exam? \ud83d\ude80\n\n(1) \u21d2 UPSC 2025: Prelims cum Mains\n\n(2) \u21d2 UPSC 2026: Prelims cum Mains\n\n(3) \u21d2 UPSC 2027 Prelims cum Mains\n\nTip: Know more about ClearIAS Courses (Online/Offline)\n\nThe polar low-pressure area has been in the bulletins afterwards the northern hemisphere faced its coldest age or phase during the winter season of 2013-2014. Furthermore, this same freezing air force came back in 2020. This time countries like the USA, Canada, and Russia suffered undergone one of their coldest winter seasons ever recorded.\n\nDuration and Strength of a\u00a0 Polar Vortex\n\nThe duration and strength of a Polar Vortex are as follows:\n\nStrength\nA Polar low-pressure area is at its highest during the winter and its lowest during the summer.\nIn the event of a volcanic eruption, a polar vortex will be further strengthened and it can stay that way for up to two years after the initial eruption\nThere will be a single vortex when the Arctic low-pressure is elongated in shape with two cyclone centres.\nThe Antarctic polar low-pressure is far more persistent than the Arctic variant.\nClimate phenomena related to the\u00a0La Nina will significantly strengthen a polar low-pressure.\nDuration\nThe Arctic polar vortex breaks up between mid-March to mid-May. This event marks the end of winter and the beginning of spring. Farming activities, ecosystems, and other weather cycles are impacted by this event\nThe same transition also impacts sea ice, ozone, air temperature, and cloud formation as well.\nAn early breakup of the polar low-pressure leads to one warming period that lasts from late February to mid-March. A late breakup period will lead to two warming periods, one in January and one in March.\nThere are times when the polar vortex breaks off before the end of the last warming period. If it is big enough then it can move into Canada and the Midwestern, Central and Northeastern United States\nPolar Vortex and Global Warming\n\nMany a time, the polar low pressure is associated with global warming. It is believed that many global warming issues are caused due to polar Vortex.\n\nThe worldwide temperature has increased by approx. 0.8\u00b0C since the 1880s.\nThe Arctic has heated and melted at more than double the rate due to the polar low pressure.\nThe North Pole, North America, and other similar regions have very little temperature difference from the Arctic region.\nThe jet stream\u2019s energy moves upward, disturbing the Polar Vortex and initiating it to split.\nImpacts of Polar low-pressure area on Earth\u2019s atmosphere\n\nA polar vortex and its related events can have the following impacts on the Earth\u2019s environment.\n\nThe Polar low-pressure breakups in the higher atmosphere can have significant sudden or delayed impacts on the environment, such as decreasing atmospheric temperature and extremely harsh cold in the winter in the Eastern United States, Western regions & Northern Europe.\nAbrupt stratospheric warming due to the polar Vortex can lead to the warm Arctic region in the stratosphere as well as the troposphere.\nThe warm Arctic region works in favour of cold air and causes more harsh winter weather in the Northern Hemisphere and mid-latitudes comprising the Eastern United States.\nFeatures of Polar Vortex\n\nA polar low-pressure swirls over the stratosphere, 10-48 Km above the ground level.\n\nA stronger or more potent polar vortex act as a protective barrier for the mid-latitudes protecting them from cold Arctic air.\nTypically, it happens when the polar low-pressure is most potent and cold air is less prone to fall deep into the mid-latitudes, including Northern US and Europe.\nHowever, the polar Vortex sometimes gets disrupted or weakens because of the wave energy rising skyward from the Earth\u2019s lower atmosphere.\nSuch happenings or events with the polar Vortex abruptly warm the stratosphere in just a few days, and this event is known as sudden stratospheric warming far above the Earth\u2019s surface.\nAs a consequence of this stratospheric warming, the polar low-pressure tends to shift its location a little toward the south of the north pole. Sometimes this shift splits the polar Vortex into \u2018sister vortices\u2019.\nSlipping or Shifting of the Polar low-pressure area\n\nA Polar vortex goes across somewhere above 650 North and South latitudes.\n\nThe polar Vortex becomes very powerful when the temperature contrast between the polar low-pressure and temperate regions is highest. At this stage, its meandering is insignificant or nearly null.\nHowever, the polar vortex meander is known as Rossby waves when this temperature contrast is slight.\nThe slight temperature contrast does not mean the summertime.\nThe meandering polar Vortex generates irregular or flashing low-pressure & high-pressure chambers.\nHigh-pressure chambers are formed underneath the ridges, and low-pressure chambers are formed underneath the troughs.\nIt happens because of the upper air circulations shaped by the polar low pressure.\nDue to the severe meandering of the Polar low-pressure, the high-pressure chambers force over to the north and shift the polar low-pressure from its standard position.\nIt means the polar low-pressure moves far from the pole and glides into the temperate regions having extremely low pressure.\nAs soon as the polar low-pressure holds back its strength, the high-pressure chambers become ineffectual and move back to their original latitudinal positions.\nThe polar vortex shifts or slips back to its original position or poles with the shift in high-pressure chambers.\nHow polar vortex shifts to the south?\n\nA high-pressure system from the west pushed the jet stream, and a portion of the polar Vortex shifted farther south than the normal position.\n\nThat brought a portion of the Polar Vortex well into North America and caused the temperature in the Midwest and the eastern US to dive to zero.\n\nPolar low-pressure area and Ozone layer Depletion\n\nEven though polar low-pressure and ozone layer depletion is two entirely diverse topics, however related phenomena of the Earth\u2019s atmosphere.\n\nThere is a constant decline in the total amount of the ozone layer, approx.\u20144% in the Earth\u2019s stratosphere. Additionally, a considerable reduction in the stratospheric ozone layer is observed in the vicinity of the Earth\u2019s polar regions.\n\nThe chemical makeup of the Antarctic polar low-pressure has led to severe ozone depletion. The nitric acid in the stratospheric clouds reacts with chlorofluorocarbons to form chlorine which further accelerates the destruction of the ozone layer.\n\nConclusion\n\nThe only threat of the Polar low-pressure to humans is the degree of cold temperatures that could get low when the polar low-pressure area spreads out and send Arctic air toward the south into the regions that are not cold usually.\n\nThe mild winters in the northern regions of the hemisphere which are particularly south of the Arctic circle have led to a decrease in energy consumption by the people.\n\nRead:\u00a0Polar Code\n\nArticle written by Aseem Muhammed"

Lachit Borphukan, with his strategic brilliance, organized the defense of the Ahom Kingdom.\nThe Ahom navy, under Lachit Borphukan\u2019s command, played a crucial role in defeating the Mughal forces on the Brahmaputra River.\nLachit Borphukan\u2019s leadership and the effectiveness of the Ahom navy are often cited as key factors in the Ahom victory at Saraighat.\n\nThe Ahom army launched a massive attack on the invaders and when the Mughal admiral Munnawar Khan was killed by a gunshot, the Mughal naval force became leaderless and they could not maintain the attack and ultimately had to retreat.\n\nThe heroic fight of Lachit Borphukan and his army remains one of the most inspiring military feats of resistance in the history of our country.\nThe Mughals were at the height of their power but failed to conquer Assam and the Northeast and consolidate their rule.\n17 attempts were made by the Mughals to conquer Assam but they failed every time.\n\nThe Mughals never attempted to capture Assam after the 1671 war.\n\nLegacy of Lachit Borphukan\n\nLachit Borphukan is celebrated as a hero and a symbol of resistance in Assamese history.\n\nHis leadership and valor in the Battle of Saraighat are remembered during the annual Lachit Divas, a celebration in Assam to honor his contributions.\n\nStatues, memorials, and awards have been dedicated to Lachit Borphukan as a tribute to his role in defending Assam against external invasions.\n\nOn 24 November each year, Lachit Divas is celebrated statewide in Assam to commemorate the heroism of Lachit Borphukan and the victory of the Assamese army at the Battle of Saraighat.\n\nThe best cadet from the National Defence Academy is awarded the Lachit Borphukan gold medal. It was first instituted in 1999 to inspire defence personnel to emulate Borphukan\u2019s heroism and sacrifices.\n\nQuotes\nOne of the famous quotes attributed to Lachit Borphukan is a message to his soldiers: \u201cWhen my countrymen are suffering from an unjust rule, and I am breathing, no enemy shall breathe.\u201d\nWhen on the battlefield of Saraighat, Lachit Borphukan asserted: \u201cDexotkoi Momai Dangor Nohoi\u201d (My uncle is not greater than my motherland) to punish his uncle for compromising the defence.\nHonors\nThe Lachit Borphukan Military Award is given by the Indian Army in recognition of outstanding service by its personnel.\nA warship of the Indian Navy has been named INS Lachit in his honor.\nAhom Kingdom\n\nThe Ahom Kingdom was a medieval kingdom that ruled over the Brahmaputra Valley in present-day Assam, a northeastern state of India. The Ahom dynasty, of Tai-Ahom ethnic origin, established and maintained this kingdom for nearly six centuries. The kingdom played a crucial role in shaping the region\u2019s cultural, political, and historical landscape.\n\nThe Ahom people, originally of Tai origin, migrated from Yunnan in present-day China to the region that is now Assam during the 13th century.\nSukaphaa, the founder of the Ahom Kingdom, established his rule in the early 13th century. The Ahoms gradually assimilated with the local communities.\nThe rulers of the Ahom Kingdom were titled Swargadeo. The kingdom was ruled by a hereditary monarchy.\nThe kingdom was divided into administrative units called \u201cBorgohain\u201d and \u201cBorpatrogohain,\u201d with officials responsible for governance at various levels.\n\nThe Ahom people had their distinct culture, which was influenced by their Tai heritage. The Ahom culture integrated with that of the local communities over time.\n\nThe Ahom script, known as the Ahom Buranji script, was used for writing chronicles and historical records.\nThe Ahom Kingdom had a formidable military force. The Ahom soldiers were known for their skills in archery, cavalry, and the use of firearms.\nThe Ahom Kingdom successfully resisted Mughal invasions during the 17th century, notably during the leadership of Lachit Borphukan in the Battle of Saraighat.\n\nDecline and Annexation:\n\nBurmese Invasions: The Ahom Kingdom faced invasions by the Burmese in the early 19th century. These invasions led to internal conflicts and weakened the kingdom.\n\nBritish Annexation: The British East India Company became involved in the conflicts, and the Ahom Kingdom eventually came under British control. The Treaty of Yandabo in 1826 marked the formal annexation of Assam by the British.\n\nConclusion\n\nLachit Borphukan\u2019s legacy is not only significant for Assam but also serves as a source of inspiration for those who value courage, leadership, and the defense of one\u2019s homeland.

Unexpectedly, a landlord stood up and gave the needed land. A fresh chapter in the story of sacrifice and non-violence was added by this incident.\nThe Bhoodan (Gift of the Land) movement was just getting started at the time. Vinoba traveled the entire country, covering a distance of 58741 km, during the thirteen-year movement.\nThe Gramdan Movement, also known as the village gift movement, was the next stage of the Bhoodan movement. It attempted to establish community land ownership, resulting in self-sufficient settlements.\nFor the village council to manage and distribute the donated land to the inhabitants, the Gramdan movement persuaded the villagers to surrender their land to the council.\nMany political figures supported this campaign, which they saw as a solution to the issue of unequal land distribution in rural India.\n\nVinoba Bhave set up several Ashrams to promote a simple way of life, devoid of luxuries that took away one\u2019s focus from the Divine.\n\nHe established the Brahma Vidya Mandir in 1959, a small community for women, aiming at self-sufficiency on the lines of Mahatma Gandhi\u2019s teachings.\n\nAs a result of a fast in 1979, he secured the government\u2019s promise to enforce the law prohibiting the killing of cows throughout India.\n\nDeath\n\nBhave lived out the last years of his life at his ashram, the Brahma Vidya Mandir, near Paunar, Wardha, Maharashtra.

Lala Hardayal, Ramchandra, Bhagwan Singh, Kartar Singh Saraba, Barkatullah, and Bhai Parmanand were the driving forces behind the Ghadr Party. The Gadites wanted to incite a rebellion in India.\n\nAlso read: UPSC Prelims 2022 Question Topics: What are the 100 Areas from which UPSC Framed Questions last year?\n\nBackground of the Ghadar Party\nAt the start of the 20th century, the growing Indian Independence Movement triggered a rise in nationalist feelings not just on the Indian subcontinent but also among students and emigrants from the same area all over the world.\nNationalist ideologies were instilled in these students by revolutionary thinkers like Taraknath Das and Lala Har Dayal to mobilise them.\nTo conduct revolutionary operations, activists had already constructed the \u201cSwadesh Sevak Home\u201d in Vancouver and the \u201cUnited India House\u201d in Seattle. The Ghadr party was formally established in 1913.\nLala Har Dayal, Sant Baba Wasakha Singh Dadehar, Baba Jawala Singh, Santokh Singh, and Sohan created the Ghadar Party, formerly known as the Pacific Coast Hindustan Association, on July 15, 1913, in the United States.\nAmong the Indian diaspora in the United States, Canada, East Africa, and Asia, the Ghadar party attracted a substantial following.\nFeatures of the Ghadar Party\n\nThe Ghadar Party was a predominantly Indian-founded revolutionary group. The party included Sikh, Hindu, and Muslim members, although Sikh leaders predominated. The party was multiethnic but primarily Punjabi. The Ghadar party, which had its headquarters in San Francisco and its origins in the rural Californian Punjabi immigrant community, was also dedicated to bringing about the independence of India by revolution.\n\nRevolution\nThe Ghadar programme sought to coordinate official assassinations, produce anti-imperialist and revolutionary literature, collaborate with Indian troops stationed abroad, acquire weapons, and incite a simultaneous uprising in all British colonies.\nA working committee was established, and it was decided to launch, \u201cThe Ghadar\u201d, a free weekly newspaper, and to build Yugantar Ashram as the organization\u2019s headquarters in San Francisco.\nThe militants in the Ghadar party immediately began an active propaganda campaign, visiting the farms and mills where the majority of the Punjabi immigrant labourers were employed.\nThe inaugural issue of Ghadar was released on November 1st in Urdu and in December in Gurmukhirumukhi. The paper\u2019s heading made it clear what it was about An enemy of British rule, or Angrezi Raj ka Dushman. Each issue\u2019s front page featured Angrezi Raj Ka Chittha, or \u201cAn Expose of British Rule.\nThey featured the eradication of Indian crafts and industries, the recurrence of famines and epidemics that claimed the lives of millions of Indians, and the usage of the Indian slave practice of giving money collected from Hindus and Muslims to Christian missionaries, as well as the attempt to sow discord between Hindus and Muslims: in short, the entire critique of British rule put forth by the Indian national movement was summarised and presented to Ghadar readers each week.\nThe Indian War of Independence \u2013 1857, written by Savarkar, was serialised to further the message.\nThe Ghadar also highlighted the heroic acts of the Anushilan Samiti, the Yugantar group, and Russian secret societies, as well as contributions from Lokamanya Tilak, Sri Aurobindo, V.D. Savarkar, Madame Cama, Shyamji Krishna Varma, Ajit Singh, and Sufi Amba Prasad.\nThe poetries out for their secular tone as much as their revolt was fervour was published in The Ghadar and afterwards compiled, published, and distributed for free under the title Ghadar di Goonj may have had the most influence.\nThe Ghadar reached populations in the Philippines, and Hong Kong, China, the Malay States, and was widely disseminated among Indians in North America.\nIt sparked a ferocious debate and discussion and received an unparalleled response. The poems it included were chanted during meetings of Punjabi immigrants and swiftly spread throughout the world.\nIn a\u00a0 short period, the Ghad\u00e1r was able to change the Punjabi immigrant\u2019s self-image from that of a devoted soldier of the British Raj to that of a rebel whose main objective was to overthrow the British control of his motherland. The Ghadar purposefully called the Punjabi\u2019s history as a loyalist to his attention, made him regret it, and tasked him with making amends in the spirit of his ancestors\u2019 earlier tradition of resistance to oppression.\nSome Ghadar Party members travelled to Punjab in 1914 after the Fitoroke out to spark an armed uprising for India\u2019s independence.\nAlong with smuggling firearms, the Ghadar party were successful in stirring up a rebellion among Indian soldiers serving in the British Army.\nThe British brutally put down the next revolt, which is now known as the Ghadar Mutiny, and killed 42 mutineers after the Lahore Conspiracy Case trial.\nNevertheless, from 1914 to 1917, the Ghadar Party opposed colonialism with the aid of Central Powers Imperial Germany and the Ottoman Empire both of which were Central Powers opposed to the British.\nThe Ghadar stated that they \u201cwanted brave soldiers to ignite rebellion in India.\u201d\nFollowing the Komagata Maru Incident in 1914, which directly challenged Canadian anti-Indian immigration rules, hundreds of Indians living in the US sold their companies and houses to force the British out of India, strengthening the Ghadar Party\u2019s numbers.\n\nAlso read: India\u2019s Struggle for Independence: Indian Freedom Movement\n\nKomagata Maru Incident\nThe ship Komagata Maru started on its terrible voyage to Canada in March 1914. Canada had long imposed strong limits on Indian immigration, passing legislation that restricted entry to only individuals who made a continuous journey from India. This strategy worked since no maritime lines provided a route along that line.\nHowever, in November 1913, the Canadian Supreme Court permitted 35 Indians who had not travelled continuously admission. Gurdit Singh, an Indian contractor based in Singapore, was inspired by this choice decision to charter a ship to carry Indians to Vancouver falls throughout East and Southeast Asia.\nWith 376 Indian passengers in total, the ship sailed for Vancouver. Ghadar activists held talks and distributed literature on the ship in Yokohama, Japan. The Punjabi press issued grave warnings if the Indians were denied access to Canada.\nIn contrast, the Canadian press adopted a different position, and some Vancouver newspapers published alerts about the \u201cMounting Oriental Invasion.\u201d The Canadian government, meantime, had filled the legal gaps that had prompted the Supreme Court\u2019s ruling in November. The lines of battle were marked in the sand.\nWhen the ship arrived in Vancouver, it was barred from entering the port and surrounded by police. Under the direction of Husain Rahim, Sohan Lal Pathak, and Balwant Singh, a \u201cShore Committee\u201d was established to defend the rights of the passengers. Meetings for protest were arranged, and money was raised.\nA British-backed uprising in India was on the verge of happening. Under the direction of Bhagwan Singh, Barkatullah, Ram Chandra, and Sohan Singh Bhakna, a potent campaign was organised throughout the United States, and the populace was counselled to gean t ready for an uprising.\nSoon later, the Komagata Maru was compelled to depart the Canadian seas. The British government ordered that no passenger be permitted to disembark anywhere along the journey, not even at the ports where they had boarded the ship, but only at Calcutta, Before World War I broke out, the ship arrived at Yokohama.\nThe ship became a focal point for anti-British mobilisation and unleashed a wave of anger and outrage among the Indian community in every port it stopped at. When the ship touched down in Budge, close to Calcutta, the anxious and incensed passengers, irritated by the hostile attitude of the government, fought the police, leading to a fight in which 18 passengers were killed and 202 were arrested. Some of them managed to escape.\nLeading members of the Ghadar Movement gathered for a special conference where they determined that the chance must be taken, that it is better to die than do nothing at all, and that their primary weakness\u2014a shortage of weapons\u2014can be solved by travelling to India and gaining the support of Indian soldiers.\nThe Ailan-e-Jung, or Proclamation of War, was published by the Ghadar Party and widely disseminated. Ram Chandra, Bhagwan Singh, and Mohammed Barkatullah organise several at several public gatherings to entice Indians to organise an armed uprising in their native country. Indians were despatched to Singapore, Burma, China, Hong Kong, the Malay States, Japan, the Philippines, and Singapore to convince people to come home and join the rebels. The more furious Ghadar supporters immediately departed for India, including Raghubar Dayal Gupta and Kartar Singh Sarabha, who was later killed by the British in a conspiracy case.\nImportance of Komagatha Maru incident\nDue to the prejudice and violation of human rights, the Komagata Maru incident garnered attention and outrage on a global scale.\nThis was one of many instances in the early 20th century where immigrants of Asian heritage were barred from entering Canada and the United States due to exclusion rules.\nThe incident provided the Ghadar party with more motivation to continue fighting against colonial control, which indirectly aided the Indian freedom movement.\nThe Ghadar Party extensively used the enflamed emotions following the tragedy to gain support for its objectives.\nThe incident also serves to remind Indians of the role played by individuals who fought for independence while living abroad.\n\nRelated Article: Popular Uprisings and Revolts against the British \u2013 ClearIAS\n\nReasons for failure of Ghadar Party\nBefore they even arrived in India, many Ghadar leaders were detained, and after they disembarked, they were imprisoned.\nKartar Singh Saraba, Pandit Kanshi Ram, and G. Pingale were among those who managed to avoid capture and gathered in Punjab to carry out the uprising. At the time, Punjab\u2019s Lieutenant-General was Michael O\u2019 Dwyer.\nGhadar Party leaders in Punjab employed a variety of tactics. Both the native Punjabi population and the British referred to them as dacoits, none of them welcomed them. The leaders of the Ghadar were directed to be apostates by some Punjabi Sikhs.\nAt the time, Sikhs were the most devoted soldiers in the British Army, and they had already garnered enough rewards from these positions.\nO\u2019Dwyer mandated the detention of all Ghadar party members, whether they were doing it lawfully or not.\nThe Ghadr party movement\u2019s achievement was in the realm of ideology. It preached militant nationalism while remaining completely secular.\nHowever, it failed to achieve much politically and militarily because it lacked organized and sustained leadership, and underestimated the extent of preparation required at every level\u2014organizational, ideological, financial, and tactical strategic.\n\nThe Ghadarites believed that India would be equally enthusiastic about revolution as it had been about their successful efforts to recruit Indians in the United States, but they soon realised that this was not the case. The Indian National Congress, the priests of several significant Sikh gurdwaras, and numerous other nationalist figures in India attacked the party. The interconnection of colonialism, racial subordination, and economic exploitation helped Ghadarites in North America mobilise thousands along the Pacific Coast, but they were unable to convince their Indian counterparts to join them.\n\nThe Ghadar Movement\u2019s legacy After the brutal British repression, the Ghadar Movement started to weaken. 1917 saw the Ghadar Party split into a Communist and a Socialist faction following the end of World War I. Despite this loss, the Ghadar Party served as an inspiration for many revolutionaries in the quest for liberation. Bhagat Singh is the most renowned among them. The Ghadar movement might be characterised as a story of extraordinary bravery, labour, and toil that touched the hearts of every Indian living in foreign lands.\n\nThe strong comments made by its leaders did influence the sentiment of foreigners against the British misrule in India. It qualifies as a significant conflict since it inspired the populace to fight for freedom and planted the seeds for all subsequent actions. This movement\u2019s legacy endures forever. The recent apologies from Canada to India over the event demonstrate how significant this movement is.\n\nPrevious year UPSC question (2022)\n\nConsider the following freedom fighters:\n\nBarindra Kumar Ghosh\nJogesh Chandra Chatterjee\nRash Behari Bose\n\nWho of the above was/were actively associated with the Ghadar Party?\n\n(a) 1 and 2\n\n(b) 2 only\n\n(c) 1 and 3\n\n(d) 3 only\n\nAnswer (d)\n\nArticle Written\u00a0 by Atheena Fathima Riyas"

Religious crisis struck the young king when he slew a Brahmin. Tradition relates that he invested greatly in construction projects for the public to expiate his sins.\n\nAmong the temples that he built were the ancillary shrines and the walls of Jagannath temple which took fourteen years to achieve completion in 1198 CE.\nHe organized the order of the temple servitors (Chattisanijoga) to manage the Temple built by his father.\nThe murtis of Lord Jagannath and his siblings were revered and worshipped here without interruption until 1568.\n\nThe temple annals, the Madala Panji records that the Jagannath temple at Puri has been invaded and plundered eighteen times.\n\nIn 1568, after defeating the Gajapati ruler Mukunda Deva, General Kalapahad led the victorious army of the Nawab of Bengal, Sultan Suleiman Karani into the Temple complex to loot it.

The poetry and other writings were fortunately mostly preserved as palm leaf manuscripts in Tamil academic houses and Shaiva Aatheenams close to Kumbakonam.\n\nBefore the palm leaves deteriorate, which takes around 50 years, replacements must be made by writing them down on fresh palm leaves.\n\nIn the nineteenth century, all of that changed.\n\nIn 1812, Thirukural was edited and printed from manuscripts by Francis Whyte Ellis. He was working as a Collector in the Madras Presidency when he published the Thirukural created by Thiruvalluvar.\n\nLife of Thiruvalluvar\n\nThiruvalluvar, also known as Valluvar, was a well-known Tamil philosopher and poet. His most famous work, the Tirukkural, is a collection of couplets addressing morality, politics, the economy, and love. The book is regarded as a unique and highly esteemed piece of Tamil literature.\n\nAccording to Kamil Zvelebil, a specialist in Tamil literature, there is essentially no reliable information accessible regarding Valluvar.\u00a0Different biographers have drawn different conclusions about his life and likely background from his literary works.\n\nHis family history, religion, or location of birth are all unknown certainties. According to traditional narratives and linguistic examinations of his texts, he is thought to have resided at least temporarily in the town of Mylapore, which is a neighborhood of modern-day Chennai.\n\nHis floruit is variously dated from the 4th century BCE to the early 6th century CE. Valluvar was born in 31 BCE according to Maraimalai Adigal, but according to Kamil Zvelebil, the ideal time to date the Thirukkural and Thiruvalluvar are between 500 and 600 CE.\n\nAccording to traditional accounts, thirukkural was the last work of the third Sangam.\n\nIn January 1935, the Tamil Nadu government officially recognized 31 BCE as the year of Valluvar.\n\nValluvar is generally thought to have belonged to either Jainism or Hinduism. Hinduism, Jainism, and Buddhism were the three religions that flourished in the Indian subcontinent during the time of Valluvar.\n\nHe has been speculated to be a learned Jain with in-depth knowledge of the Tamil classical period.\n\nThiruvalluvar was an accomplished poet and administrator in addition to his work in philosophy, for which he is best known.\n\nThirukkural\n\nTirukkural or Kural is the primary work credited to Thiruvalluvar. It contains 1330 couplets, which are divided into 133 sections of 10 couplets each.\n\nThe first 38 sections are on moral and cosmic order (Tamil: Aram, Sanskrit: dharma)\nthe next 70 are about political and economic matters (Tamil: porul, Sanskrit: artha)\nthe remaining 25 are about pleasure (Tamil: inbam, Sanskrit: kama).\n\nIt is considered one of the greatest works on ethics and morality, and it is known for its universality and secular nature.\n\nIt places a strong emphasis on moral vegetarianism and nonviolence as personal characteristics.\n\nIt emphasizes integrity, restraint, thankfulness, hospitality, kindness, wifely goodness, duty, generosity, and other virtues.\n\nAlong with a broad range of social and political subjects like the king, ministers, taxes, justice, forts, war, the greatness of the army and the honor of soldiers, the death penalty for the wicked, agriculture, education, and abstention from alcohol and intoxicants\n\nChapters on household life, friendship, and love are also included.\n\nThe Tirukkural text has been translated into several Indian and international languages. It was translated into Latin by Constanzo Beschi in 1730, which helped make the work known to European intellectuals.\n\nThiruvalluvar\u2019s straightforward yet profound insights into human nature are what made his teachings so timeless.\n\nHe offers insightful guidance on how to live a decent life while delving into a number of topics, including love, wisdom, justice, and renunciation.\n\nThiruvalluvar\u2019s philosophy stresses the importance of ethics and places a strong emphasis on self-discipline, honesty, and equality.\n\nLegacy of Thiruvalluvar\n\nValluvar is revered and highly regarded in Tamil culture, which is evident in the nine different names that his writings have been given: Tirukkural (the sacred kural), Uttaravedam (the ultimate Veda), Thiruvalluvar (named after the author), Poyyamoli (the falseness word), Vayurai valttu (truthful praise), Teyvanul (the divine book), Potumarai (the common Veda), M (the Tamil Veda).\n\nThroughout the Southern part of India, Valluvar is traditionally revered as a god and saint by numerous people. Many communities revere Valluvar as the 64th Nayanmar of the Shaivite tradition, notably those in Mylapore and Tiruchuli.\n\nIn South India, there are numerous temples solely devoted to Valluvar. The temple in Chennai\u2019s Mylapore is the most well-known of these. The temple was constructed in the early 16th century and is situated within the Mylapore Ekambareeswara-Kamakshi (Shiva-Parvati) temple complex.\n\nThe Government of Tamil Nadu celebrates the 15th (16th on leap years) of January as Thiruvalluvar Day in the poet\u2019s honor, as part of the Pongal celebrations.\n\nThiruvalluvar Day was first celebrated on 17 and 18 May 1935.\n\nAlso Read: Sangam Literature\n\n-Article written by Swathi Satish"

In fact, at the end of World War II, no claimant occupied a single island in the entire South China Sea.\nChina laid claim to the South China Sea in 1947. It demarcated its claims with a U-shaped line made up of eleven dashes on a map, covering most of the area.\nBut two \u201cdashes\u201d were removed in the early 1950s to bypass the Gulf of Tonkin as a gesture to communist comrades in North Vietnam.\nThe remaining \u2018nine-dash line\u2019 stretches hundreds of kilometers south and east of its southerly Hainan Island, covering almost 90% of the South China Sea.\nAfter the 1960s when a huge reserve of oil and natural gas was discovered in the region, the territorial claims started growing in an unprecedented manner.\nThe United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea (UNCLOS), which came into force in 1994, established a legal framework intended to balance the economic and security interests of coastal states with those of seafaring nations.\nWhile UNCLOS has been signed and ratified by nearly all the coastal countries in the South China Sea, based on their own interpretation of the UNCLOS, claimant countries started to legitimize their claims.\nIn 2002, ASEAN and China came together to sign the Declaration on the Code of Conduct of Parties in the South China Sea to keep disputes away. However, it didn\u2019t achieve the desired outcomes.\nIn 2009, Malaysia and Vietnam sent a joint submission to the Commission on the Limits of the Continental Shelf (CLCS) to set out some of their claims. In response to this China submitted a map containing the infamous \u201cnine-dash\u201d line and due to this, there was no headway in the dispute resolution.\nPCA-Ruling and implications\nBoth the Philippines and China laid their claims the Scarborough Shoal which is a little more than 100 miles from the Philippines and 500 miles from China. The Philippines and China are both dependent upon fishing in the South China Sea, specifically in the Scarborough Shoal, for the economic development and livelihood of their people. A tense but bloodless stand-off between China and the Philippines over Scarborough Shoal in 2012, led to China gaining de facto control over the region.\nBut in 2013, the Philippines raised the dispute with China to the PCA(Permanent Court Of Arbitration), saying China\u2019s claims violated Philippines\u2019 sovereignty under the 1982 U.N. Convention on the Law of the Sea(UNCLOS).\nThe Permanent Court of Arbitration ruled that\u00a0Chinese claims over 90 percent of the South China Sea area are illegitimate and under UNCLOS, China is intruding into the Philippines\u2019 sovereign waters as the 9-dash line which includes the Scarborough shoal and crosses into the Philippines EEZ.\nChina out rightly rejected the ruling. China prefers bilateral negotiations with the other parties. But many of its neighbors argue that China\u2019s relative size and clout give it an unfair advantage.\nASEAN and South China Sea\n\nOne of the fundamental principles of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) has been to resolve regional disputes by peaceful means. But over the years, the position of ASEAN on the South China Sea disputes has weakened its image internationally and failing to resolve this issue would lead to questions being raised about its credibility as an effective regional organization.\n\nThe US and the South China Sea\nThe U.S. has no claim in the South China Sea, but has been highly critical of China\u2019s assertiveness and insisted on free navigation of commercial vessels in the South China Sea is vital for regional and international trade.\nIt conducted joint military patrols with the Philippines and Japan, Australia, and Indonesia.\nUS also increased the financial support for enhancing the military capabilities of ASEAN and East Asian countries as well strengthened bilateral defense collaboration with these countries.\nIndia and the South China Sea\n\nIndia remained acutely conscious of its official position of neither being party to the disputes nor taking sides for many years. But with increasing ties with East Asian countries (Act East Policy), India indirectly started raising concerns about Chinese illegitimate claims in the South China Sea. India believes that the disputes in the Southeast Asian littorals are a litmus test for the international maritime law.\nIn the aftermath of the Hague Tribunal\u2019s verdict on the South China Sea, India obligated to take a principled stand on the issue of freedom of navigation and commercial access enshrined in the UNCLOS.\nDespite China\u2019s protests, India continues its oil exploration in Vietnam\u2019s exclusive economic zone(EEZ) in the South China Sea from where ONGC Videsh Limited supplies oil to Vietnam.\nIndia also supports a negotiated settlement of Brunei\u2019s maritime dispute with China and has inked defense cooperation agreement that would provide an institutional foundation for more collaborative work on maritime security and secure India\u2019s energy lanes to Brunei.\nSummary\n\nThe South China Sea have been witnessing a lot of unfortunate conflicts in terms of economic interests, civilian security, and the environment in the recent past. \u00a0The illegal construction of artificial islands\u00a0and nuclear power plants\u00a0on these fragile islands in the region raises severe environmental threats to the South China Sea.\n\nThe South China Sea situation will only be settled when the bordering countries change their mindsets from one of sovereignty and sole ownership of resources to one of functional cooperation and cooperative management. India\u2019s rising clout in the region due to enhanced economic cooperation would go a long way in resolving the disputes.\n\nArticle contributed by: Sree Resmi S"

Why?\n\nIn answer in short \u2013 opposition from come countries like China as India has not signed Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty. But there is more to this. Let\u2019s analyze first the sequences of some events connected to nuclear supply/proliferation.\n\n\ud83d\udc49 Which year are YOU targeting for success in the IAS/IPS/IFS Exam? \ud83d\ude80\n\n(1) \u21d2 UPSC 2025: Prelims cum Mains\n\n(2) \u21d2 UPSC 2026: Prelims cum Mains\n\n(3) \u21d2 UPSC 2027 Prelims cum Mains\n\nTip: Know more about ClearIAS Courses (Online/Offline)\n\nNPT and NSG\nNPT (Nonproliferation Treaty) is\u00a0an international\u00a0treaty, which came into force in 1970. The main objective was to prevent the spread of\u00a0nuclear weapons and weapons technology.\nApart from India, Pakistan and Israel have also not signed NPT.\nIndia refused to sign NPTbecause (1) The NPT defines \u201cnuclear weapons states\u201d as those that tested devices before 1967, which means India cannot ever be one. (2) No fixed timelines have been mentioned for disarmament. (3) NPT is unfair treaty as nuclear weapon states have no obligation to give them up while non-nuclear states are not allowed to have them.\nIndia conducted its first Nuclear test -Pokhran-I (Smiling Buddha), in 1974.\nThe nuclear powers were convinced that the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty (NPT) alone would not halt the spread of nuclear weapons. Consequently, NSG was formed in 1974.\nThe current guidelines of NSG state that a non-NPT state cannot become a member of NSG which keeps India out of the group.\nIn 1998 India conducted the second nuclear Test (Operation Shakti).\nIndia is committed to voluntary, unilateral moratorium on nuclear testing. It has taken voluntary measures to ensure strong nuclear export control.\nHowever, new sanctions were imposed on India by Western Countries, especially US.\nIn the pre-2005 period, the NSG denied fuel for the Tarapur Atomic Power station, while the US used MTCR (Missile Technology Control Regime) provisions to prevent the transfer of cryogenic engine technology from Russia.\nIndia finally managed to have some relief when the US relented and agreed to a civil nuclear deal with India in 2008. This agreement has been done in view of the requirement for the US under Section 123 of its Atomic Energy Act 1954, hence also known as 123 Agreement. Under this, India signed a civil-military separation plan and India-IAEA safeguard agreement. In return, US diplomacy helped us to get NSG waiver.\nDuring a state visit to India in November 2010, U.S. President Barack Obama announced U.S. support for India\u2019s participation in the Nuclear Suppliers Group, the Wassenaar Arrangement, the Australia Group and the Missile Technology Control Regime, \u201cin a phased manner,\u201d and to encourage the evolution of regime participation criteria to that end, \u201cconsistent with maintaining the core principles of these regimes\u201d.\nIndia has taken a formal pledge stating that it would not share sensitive nuclear technology or material with others and would uphold its voluntary moratorium on testing nuclear weapons.\nDue to which the NSG participating governments agreed to grant India a \u201cclean waiver\u201d from its existing rules, which forbid nuclear trade with a country which has not signed the\u00a0Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty\u00a0(NPT). This made India eligible to receive advanced nuclear technologies that could be used to enrich uranium and reprocess plutonium. This has helped India a lot.\nHowever, being out of the elite NSG group has kept India still out of latest technologies as it is the NSG members that have the latest and the most efficient technology.\nIn 2016 India applied for NSG membership. Pakistan and Namibia followed the suite.\nChina\u2019s Opposition\n\nWhile a majority of the 48-member group backed India\u2019s membership, China along with New Zealand, Ireland, Turkey, South Africa and Austria were opposed to India\u2019s admission.\n\nChina insisted that India should sign NPT for NSG membership. It wants a non-discriminatory criterion for the admission of countries who have not signed NPT. It is an open secret that China\u2019s resistance is to facilitate the entry of Pakistan a close ally of China.\n\nBut\u00a0Pakistan\u2019s credentials for NSG membership are highly flawed and inadequate. On the other hand, over the years India has shown adherence to IAEA safeguards and has taken voluntary measures to abide by NPT and NSG guidelines while Pakistan has not taken any such initiatives.\n\nNSG membership \u2013 Is it important for India?\n\nMembership to the NSG will essentially increase India\u2019s access to state-of-the-art technology from the other members of the Group.\nAccess to technology and being allowed to produce nuclear equipment will give a boost to the Make in India program. That will, in turn, boost the economic growth of our country.\nAs per India\u2019s INDC under the Paris Climate agreement, we have committed to reducing dependence on fossil fuels and ensuring that 40% of its energy is sourced from renewable and clean sources. In order to achieve this target, we need to scale up nuclear power production. This can only happen if India gains access to the NSG.\nNamibia is the fourth-largest producer of uranium and it agreed to sell the nuclear fuel to India in 2009. However, that hasn\u2019t happened, as Namibia has signed Pelindaba Treaty, which essentially controls the supply of uranium from Africa to the rest of the world. If India joins the NSG, such reservations from Namibia are expected to melt away.\nFactors in favor of India\u2019s membership\nFrance got membership in the elite group without signing the NPT.\nCommitment to nonproliferation: India\u2019s commitment to bifurcate its civilian and military nuclear programs along with its nonproliferation record ensured indigenously developed technology is not shared with other countries.\nTransparency: India has also ratified an Additional Protocol with the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) which means that its civilian reactors are under IAEA safeguards and open for inspections.\nConclusion:\n\nThe recently framed draft proposal for accepting new members into the Nuclear Suppliers Group increases India\u2019s chances of entry into NSG. It\u2019s a welcome development for India as NSG membership would definitely boost the economic and strategic development in the future.\n\nTherefore, India should take up this opportunity to aggressively pursue the development of nuclear energy while providing the essential emphasis on safety and addressing concerns of the public. It will also pave the way for clean energy initiatives and continued focus to achieve our commitments to reduce the carbon footprint pledged during the climate summit.\n\nReferences:\n\nIDSA\nNSG\nPRSindia\nArmsControl, ArmsControl and ArmsControl\nTOI\nLiveMint\nTeriin\n\nArticle contributed by: Sree Resmi S"

In 1992, it was extended for all types of weapons of mass destruction.\nNow, it has 35 full members including India and 4 \u201cnon-adherent members\u201d \u2013 Israel, Macedonia, Romania, Slovakia.\nChina is not a member of this regime but it had verbally pledged to adhere to its original guidelines but not to the subsequent additions.\nThese efforts of non-proliferation of ballistic missile systems had further been strengthened by \u201cThe International Code of Conduct against Ballistic Missile Proliferation\u201d, also known as the Hague Code of Conduct (HCOC), which was established on 25 November 2002 as an arrangement to prevent the proliferation of ballistic missiles with 136 UN member countries including India.\nMissile Technology Control Regime \u2013 Achievements\nIt has significantly contributed to curbing or slow down the nuclear programmes of some countries.\nArgentina dropped its joint ballistic missile programme\u201d Condor II\u201d with Egypt and Iraq.\nPoland and the Czech Republic vanished their ballistic missiles in an effort to join the regime.\nBrazil, South Africa, South Korea, and Taiwan also withdrew or curbed their missiles or space launch vehicle programs.\nRecently, it played a major role to hamper Libyan and Syrian missile efforts.\nMissile Technology Control Regime \u2013 Limitations\nIt is not a legally-binding treaty. Hence, no punitive measures could be taken against non-compliance to the guidelines of the regime.\nIt has only 35 member countries as full members. Whereas, countries like North Korea, Pakistan, Iran which have significant missile systems which could deliver WMDs, are not adherent to the regime.\nSome of such countries are exploring long \u2013 range intercontinental missiles and they are also sellers in the arms market.\nThere are incidences of violation of the rules by MTCR countries. In 2007, China secretly sold solid-fuel, medium-range ballistic missiles,\u201d DF 21\u201d, to Saudi Arabia. France sold the Storm Shadow/SCALP cruise missile to the UAE (Black Shaheen) in the 1990s.\nThe USA had bent some rules to give concessions to some Non -member countries aspiring to join the regime. Eg. Ukraine was allowed to retain its Scud missiles irrespective of the rule of destroying ballistic missiles (capable of carrying a 500kg payload for 300km) for the non-recognised nuclear state. Similarly, USA also allowed South Korea to develop ballistic missiles of the range of 800 kilometers with a 500-kilogram payload.\nWith a technological advancement, it is also possible to adapt and develop the existing missiles with a range shorter than 300km and carrying WMDs less than 500kgs to escape the regulations imposed by the regime.\nMissile Technology Control Regime (MTCR): Benefits to India\n\nIndia has joined MTCR as a full member and also agreed to join the Hague Code of conduct made it bolster its position as a responsible nuclear state and strengthen its case for the membership of other multilateral export control regimes like Nuclear Suppliers Group, Australia Group, and Wassenaar arrangement.\nIndia can buy high-end missile technology and run joint programmes for development of unmanned aerial vehicles with other countries. eg. Procurement of theater missile interceptor \u201cArrow II\u201d from Israel, military drones like \u201cAvenger\u201d from the USA etc.\nIndia can sell its missiles to other non-member countries with comparative ease.eg. Supersonic cruise missile, \u201cBrahMos\u201d, to Vietnam.\nISRO can access the forbidden cryogenic technology from Russia which is required for the space exploration operations.\nMTCR membership can be used as a bargaining chip against China which is not a full member of the regime and aspiring to be one as it has blocked India\u2019s way to NSG.\nMTCR Membership \u2013\u00a0Obligations for India\n\n\ud83d\udc49 Which year are YOU targeting for success in the IAS/IPS/IFS Exam? \ud83d\ude80\n\n(1) \u21d2 UPSC 2025: Prelims cum Mains\n\n(2) \u21d2 UPSC 2026: Prelims cum Mains\n\n(3) \u21d2 UPSC 2027 Prelims cum Mains\n\nTip: Know more about ClearIAS Courses (Online/Offline)\n\nMTCR membership does not guarantee any special technological entitlement from other members or adherent countries.\nIndia needs to align its national laws dealing with development, transfer, and procurement of the nuclear technologies and export policies as per the guidelines of the MTCR regime which could be stricter and stringent as compared to the existing ones and likely to have implications for the stakeholders.\nIt is unlikely to give an immediate boost to the export of the India missiles.\nIndia being a member of the regime will have some obligations like sharing critical information about its military and technological assets, consulting other member countries regarding the export of any MTCR items, especially those notified or denied by another partner.\n\nRead:\u00a0Missile Fuel Technology\n\nREFERENCES\nArms control.\nThe Economic Times.\nBusiness Standard.\nThe Indian Express.\nNuclear Threat Initiative.\nThe Hindu.\nThe Wire.\nFirstpost.\n\nArticle by: Manjiri Mulye"

Each of these people may have their own ideas about how the US government should work. People with similar ideas usually align behind the same political party. But they need to win the favour of their party members first.\n\nCandidates from each political party campaign throughout the country to win the favour of their party members.\n\nPrimaries and caucuses are methods that political parties use to select candidates for a general election.\nPrimary: A primary is a state-level election where party members vote for the best candidate that will represent them in the general election. Party candidates selected in a primary then run against each other in a general election. 34\u00a0U.S. states conduct primary elections.\nThere are several types of primaries in the U.S. system like\u00a0Closed primary, Semi-closed primary, Open primary and Semi-open primary.\nCaucus: A caucus is a local meeting where registered members of a political party in a city, town or county gather to vote for their preferred party candidate and conduct other party business.\u00a0A caucus is a substitute for a primary election to select delegates to the national party convention. 16\u00a0states hold caucuses to determine political party candidates.\nStep 2: National Conventions of Each Party\n\nOnce the primaries and caucuses are completed in each state, a national convention is held in which a party\u2019s nomination for president is formally announced to the public. During the convention, the elected delegates cast their vote for a party candidate and the candidate with the most delegates gets the party\u2019s nomination. The end of the convention marks the beginning of the general election process.\n\nEach party holds a national convention to finalize the selection of one presidential nominee. At each convention, the presidential candidate chooses a running-mate (vice-presidential candidate).\n\nStep 3: General Election Campaigning\n\nGeneral election campaigning begins after a single nominee is chosen from each political party, via primaries, caucuses, and national conventions.\n\nThese candidates travel the country, explaining their views and plans to the general population and trying to win the support of potential voters. Rallies, debates, and advertising are a big part of general election campaigning.\n\nStep 4: General Election (Popular Vote)\n\nUsually in November.\nMany modern voters might be surprised to learn that when they step into a ballot box to select their candidate for president, they actually are casting a vote for fellow Americans called electors.\nPeople in every state across the country vote for one president and one vice president. When people cast their vote, they are actually voting for a group of people known as electors.\nThe voters of each state, and the District of Columbia, vote for electors to be the authorized constitutional members in a presidential election. These voters form the electoral college.\nAn elector is a member of the electoral college.\u00a0These electors, appointed by the states, are pledged to support the presidential candidate the voters have supported.\nEven though the majority of people of the USA vote for a candidate, that does not mean that he/she will win the Presidential election. There are instances where a candidate who won the popular vote lost the election.\nTo win the election, a candidate needs to secure more than 270 electoral votes.\nStep 5: Electoral College (Electors vote for the US President)\n\nUsually in December.\nThe US the president is elected by the institution called the Electoral College.\nThe Constitution only states that the candidate who receives a majority of votes in the Electoral College becomes president. It says nothing about the popular vote.\nThe intent of the framers was to filter public opinion through a body composed of wiser, more experienced people; the framers did not want the president to be chosen directly by the people.\nEach state gets a certain number of electors. This is based on each state\u2019s total representation in Congress.\nEach of the 50 US states and the capital Washington DC (a district which does not belong to any state) have a set number of electors which reflects their size. California is the most populated (over 38 million people) and has 55 electoral votes \u2013 more than any other. On the other hand, a state such as Montana, which is geographically large but has a relatively small population (just over one million people) \u2013 only has three electors.\nAside from Maine and Nebraska, if a candidate gets the most votes within a state they receive that state\u2019s full quota of electoral college votes.\nEach elector casts one electoral vote following the general election.\nThere are a total of 538 electoral votes.\nThe candidate that gets more than half (270) wins the election.\nWhat happened in the 2016 elections?\n\nIn 2016, Donald J. Trump won the Electoral College with 304 votes compared to 227 votes for Hillary Clinton. However, seven electors voted for someone other than their party\u2019s candidate.\n\nEven though it doesn\u2019t matter, it was Hillary Clinton who won the popular vote in 2016.\n\nHow did Trump become the US president despite losing the popular vote in 2016?\n\nThough uncommon, it is possible to win the Electoral College, but lose the popular vote. That means that a candidate can win a combination of states and reach the 270 electors mark without winning the majority of votes across the country.\n\nThis has happened five times in American elections \u2013 most recently in 2000 and 2016.\n\nPopular Vote vs Electoral Vote: Understand the difference\n\nUS President and US Vice President\n\nWhy does the U.S. have an Electoral College?\n\nThe short answer is the framers of the Constitution didn\u2019t trust direct democracy and provided an extra layer to ensure, as James Madison put it, that \u201cfactions\u201d of citizens with a common interest don\u2019t harm the nation as a whole. However, the Electoral College has become a mere formality.\n\nThe Constitution doesn\u2019t require electors to vote according to the popular vote of the people they represent. But it\u2019s rare for an elector not to follow the people\u2019s and their party\u2019s choice.\u00a0Although the actual vote of the Electoral College takes place in each state between mid-November and mid-December, in most cases, a projected winner can be announced on election night.\n\nWhat Happens if No Candidate Gets 270 Electoral Votes?\n\nIn the rare event that no candidate gets the needed 270 electoral votes, the decision would go to the House of Representatives, who would vote to elect the new President from among the top three candidates. A similar process would take place in the Senate to elect the Vice President from among the top two candidates. The only time this has happened was during the 1824 election when John Quincy Adams received the most votes in the House of Representatives after no candidate won a majority of the Electoral College.\n\nAlso read:\u00a0United States Federal Government shut down.\n\nUS Presidential Election Disputes and Supreme Court\n\nIn 2000, for the first time in 112 years, the eventual winner of the election, Republican George W. Bush (47.87% of voters), failed to win the popular vote lagging behind the Democratic nominee Al Gore who won over 48.38 % of voters (edging out Bush nationwide by about 550,000 votes).\n\nThe outcome of that election came down to Florida, which at the time had 25 electoral college votes and gave Bush a narrow electoral college win with 271 electors over Gore\u2019s 266.\n\nHowever, the contest was so close in the sunshine state that a mandatory recount was triggered. And with legal challenges being launched in several Florida counties the case was eventually decided by the Supreme court who handed the state, and therefore the Presidency, to Bush with a ruling 5-4 in favour of the Republican on December 12 of that year.\n\nOk. Elections are over. What\u2019s next?\n\nThe president-elect and vice president-elect take the oath of office and are inaugurated in January.\n\nThe Election Process of US President: Infographic\n\nGo through the below infographic to know the steps in the election process of US President.\n\nConclusion\n\nUS President and Vice President are not directly elected by voters.\n\nIt is the \u2018electors\u2019 from each state who elect the US President and Vice President.\n\nThe Electoral College consists of 538 electoral votes (from 50 states and District of Columbia).\n\nThe elections results are largely influenced by the voter behaviour in large swing states.\n\nTo win the election the candidate needs to secure 270 electoral votes."

This region which originally was a part of the state of Jammu and Kashmir is claimed by China as part of its autonomous Xinjiang region. After the 1962 war, it was administered by China. It is the second largest Indo-China border area covering over 38000 sq. km. However, it is an uninhabited land. While India claims the entire Aksai Chin territory as well as the Shaksgam valley (Indian territory gifted to China by Pakistan-See Note), China contests Indian control over Daulat Beg Oldi (a tehsil in Leh, south of Aksai China is believed to host the world\u2019s highest airstrip)\nCentral Sector \u2013 UNDISPUTED \u2013 Although China has recognized India\u2019s sovereignty over Sikkim and had initiated the trade at Nathu La pass, the Doklam fiasco could mean trouble at all ends.\nEastern Sector \u2013 DISPUTED \u2013 The Arunachal Pradesh border that China still claims to be its territory is the largest disputed area, covering around 90000 sq. km. It was formally called the North East Frontier Agency. During the 1962 war, the People\u2019s Liberation Army occupied it but they announced a unilateral ceasefire and withdrew respecting the international boundary (McMahon Line). However, it has continued to assert its claim over the territory. Nowadays, almost the whole of Arunachal is claimed by China. (Note: This is the reason why the visit of Dalai Lama to Tawang Monastery became such a contentious bilateral issue)\n\nNote: Sino-Pakistani Border Agreement: China and Pakistan have an agreement known as the Sino-Pakistani border agreement, which cedes a part of the Pakistani-administered Kashmir region, Shaksgam Valley, to China. India has raised concerns about this agreement, as it affects its claims in the region.\n\nJohnson Line vs McDonald Line\n\nThe two nations have held on to their stands even on the Johnson line and McDonald line which demarcates the territories of the two.\nJohnson Line \u2013 India\u2019s accepted demarcation \u2013 It marks Aksai Chin as an Indian territory\nMcDonald Line \u2013 China\u2019s stance \u2013 It marks Aksai Chin as a Chinese territory\nThe India-China War of 1962\nThe pretext of the war was a dispute over the sovereignty of the Aksai Chin and Arunachal Pradesh.\nBut, in reality, there were many reasons and the prominent one was China\u2019s perception of India as a threat to its rule of Tibet.\nThe war was preceded by various conflicts and military incidents between India and China throughout the summer of 1962.\nThen on October 20, 1962, the People\u2019s Liberation Army (PLA) of China invaded India in Ladakh and across the McMahon line in Arunachal Pradesh.\nUntil the start of the war, India was confident that a war would not happen and made little preparations.\nAfter a month-long War, China unilaterally declared a ceasefire on 19 November 1962. By then China had made significant advances on both fronts. \u00a0India suffered a huge setback and was badly defeated.\nChina achieved its objective of acquiring control in the Aksai Chin. \u00a0In the eastern sector, their troops went back to the north of the McMahon line.\n\nAlso read: Assam-Meghalaya Border Dispute: Recent Developments\n\nIndia-China border conflicts after the war\nThere have been several instances of Chinese troops entering the Indian side and Indian troops entering the Chinese side.\nStill, the Indo-China border has remained largely peaceful, except in 1967 when there were two incidents of armed conflict first at Nathu La and then at Cho La.\nThe 1975 Sikkim merger, when Sikkim became an Indian state, led to changes in the eastern sector.\nThe 1987 Sino-Indian skirmish in the Sumdorong Chu Valley in Arunachal Pradesh.\nThe 2017 Doklam standoff, was a military standoff involving India, China, and Bhutan in the Doklam plateau, near the tri-junction of the three countries.\nAgreements and initiatives to resolve the border disputes\n\nShimla Agreement of 1914:\u00a0To demarcate the boundary between Tibet and North East India, a convention was held at Shimla in 1914, representatives of all three i.e. Tibet, China, and British India. After the discussion, the agreement was signed by British India and Tibet but not by the Chinese officials. Presently India recognizes the McMahon line, as agreed by the Shimla convention, as the legal boundary between India and China. However, China rejected the Shimla agreement and the McMahon line, contending that Tibet was not a sovereign state and therefore did not have the power to conclude treaties.\nPanchsheel Agreement of 1954: The Panchsheel doctrine indicated the willingness to \u2018Respect each other\u2019s sovereignty and territorial integrity\u2019. Although we have come a long way since, from the 1962 war to the cold peace era of 1962-1989, to the revived tensions of the present, the intent of the doctrine was well directed. It must have acted as a safeguard against any such disputes arising in the first place.\n\u00a0In 1989, India formed a Joint Working Group for Confidence Building Measures (CBMs)\u00a0and agreed to mutually settle all border disputes.\nIndia-China Agreements regarding the Line of Actual Control (LAC): The LAC is the effective military border that separates Indian-controlled areas of Jammu and Kashmir from Aksai Chin. It is to be noted that this border is not a legally recognized international boundary, but rather it is a practical boundary. Conventionally, India considers the Johnson line of 1865, marked by a civil servant W.H. Johnson, which put Aksai Chin in Jammu and Kashmir. On the other hand, China recognizes the Macartney-Macdonald Line as the actual boundary which puts Aksai Chin in the Xinjiang region of China. In 1993, when the then Prime Minister Narasimha Rao visited China, \u2018The Agreement for Maintenance of Peace and Tranquillity along the LAC\u2018\u00a0was signed between India and China. In 1996 an agreement took place on confidence-building measures\u00a0in the military field along the LAC.\nIn 2003 India and China signed a Declaration on Principles for Relations and Comprehensive Cooperation and also mutually decided to appoint Special Representatives to explore the framework of a boundary settlement from the political perspective. The India-China relations received a major boost in 2003. China recognized India\u2019s sovereignty over Sikkim. This was also followed by a framework of Guiding principles and political parameters to improve bilateral ties. It proposed a three-step resolution to the border disputes:\na. A bilateral agreement on the laid down principles.\nb. This was to be followed by an exchange of maps between the two countries.\nc. Once satisfied with the markings, the final demarcation of borders was to take place.\nIn 2005 a protocol was agreed on Modalities for the implementation of Confidence Building Measures in the Military field along the LAC.\nIn 2012 India and China agreed on the establishment of a working mechanism for Consultation and Coordination on India China borders.\n\nThe policies have not sufficed in realizing a solution to the long-standing disputes. A status quo exists owing to the face-off between the differential aspirations of the two nations. While China\u2019s support for the resolution of border disputes stands subservient to the Tibet issue, India would continue to hold on to the Tibet card unless the border disputes are resolved.\n\nBesides, the changing global and regional picture \u2013 from China\u2019s move towards \u2018assertive regionalism\u2019, it is strengthening ties with Pakistan and its complete disregard for counter-opinions on contentious issues like the South-China Sea \u2013 has only worsened the chances of a quick resolution.\n\nWhat is the Doklam issue?\n\nThe offensive stand of China on Doko La (Doklam) and India\u2019s strong warning in return, is the latest addition to the worries that spoil Indo-China relations.\nIt started when India (Indian Army) objected to road construction by the People\u2019s Liberation Army (PLA) of China in the Doklam plateau which China claims to be a part of its Donglang region. However, India and Bhutan recognize it as Doklam, a Bhutan territory.\nLater, China accused Indian troops of entering its territory and India accused the Chinese of destroying its bunkers (People\u2019s Liberation Army bulldozed an old bunker of the Indian army stationed in Doklam).\nThereafter China stopped the passage of pilgrims heading toward Kailash-Mansarovar through the Nathu La pass, Sikkim. The route is a better alternative to the Lepu Lekh route via Uttarakhand and was opened for pilgrims in 2015.\nHereafter, both India and China increased the presence of their troops and since then there has been a war of words especially from the Chinese state media.\nAlthough a military standoff was averted, diplomatic negotiations have not yielded many results to cool off the passions across the border.\nWhy is Doklam so critical?\n\nDoklam (Zhoglam or Droklam or Donglang) is a narrow plateau lying in the tri-junction of India, China, and Bhutan.\nChina believes Doklam to be a disputed territory between Bhutan and China.\nIt, therefore, contests the presence of the Indian army in the region as a transgression.\nThe disputed region is very close to India\u2019s Siliguri Corridor which connects the seven northeastern states to the Indian mainland.\nWhy is India supporting Bhutan in the Doklam issue?\n\nBhutan and India have a very cordial relationship as Bhutan and China do not have formal relations.\n\nBhutan has a very strategic position considering India\u2019s geography.\nTo foster the relationship, India and Bhutan signed a \u2018Friendship Treaty\u2019 in 2007 that commits India to protect Bhutan\u2019s interests and the close coordination between the two militaries.\nAlso, India is worried that if the road is completed, it will give China greater access to India\u2019s strategically vulnerable \u201cchicken\u2019s neck\u201d (Siliguri Corridor) that links the seven northeastern states to the Indian mainland.\n\nAlso read:\u00a0India-Bhutan-China Relations\n\nIs the Indian border ready to face challenges?\nIndia is far ahead of what it was in 1962, both militarily as well as infra-structurally. However, to undermine China would be to relive the fallacies that led to the 1962 war.\nThe \u2018Theory of asymmetry\u2019 does not hold ground when dealing with China. Therefore, a rational policy of dialogue is essential. Along with that, seeking gains on the work that has already been done must be the target.\n\n(Note: Theory of Asymmetry is an approach of capitalizing on the huge asymmetry in resources by the major party, followed by a show of magnanimity and conciliation. While this approach is a possibility when dealing with Pakistan, it can\u2019t be the way forward in the case of China)\n\nDrawbacks\n\nContrasting the border readiness of the two, for instance, we see stark distinctions, more often, revealing a Chinese upper hand.\nAs of now, only 21 of the proposed 73 roads have been developed by India for the Indo-China border (Also the revised target is now 2020 instead of the original target, 2012).\nChina, on the other hand, developed and still developing its borders under the pretext of CPEC, OBOR, or even otherwise (as in the case of Doklam). This exposes how we are lagging in the connectivity of our border posts.\nThe \u2018Mountain Strike Corps\u2019 of India, specifically proposed to be raised to check the Chinese influence, has a strength that is much less than the proposed strength. Along with that, the force is not yet equipped with the advanced armories that were envisioned for them.\n\nAdvantages\n\nThe recent initiatives including the Dhola-Sadiya bridge (Bhupen Hazarika Setu-9.2km-Connects Assam with Arunachal Pradesh) are a welcome step as they help bring down the travel time and as such, a military response time as well.\nA Brahmos cruise missile regiment is being deployed in Arunachal Pradesh. This signals Indian intentions to China, which finds every opportunity to reiterate its sanction over the territory.\nMany abandoned airstrips in India are also being reactivated. Though thought-provoking, it is a step in the right direction.\nIndia-China: Other Bilateral Issues\n\nThe recent standoff is seen as a culmination of several disagreements between India and China and the relations between the two sides have soured in the last 2-3 years. A few of them are:\n\nIndia\u2019s entry into the UNSC and the NSG: China has been opposing India\u2019s entry into the United Nations Security Council (UNSC) and the Nuclear Supplier\u2019s Group (NSG).\nIndia\u2019s opposition to the OBOR: India has been opposing China\u2019s flagship \u2018One Belt One Road\u2019 (OBOR) initiative\u2018, as the \u2018China Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC)\u2018, a part of OBOR, passes through the Pakistan-Occupied Kashmir (POK) and acceding to OBOR would mean undermining India\u2019s sovereignty.\n\u00a0Strengthening of India-USA relations: China is critical of India-USA relations and it is not merely a coincidence that the escalation at the tri-junction coincided with the Indian Prime Minister\u2019s visit to the United States. India supports the US and other countries in reaffirming the freedom of navigation in international waters, which includes the South China Sea. Along with this, the \u2018MALABAR Naval exercise\u2019 between India, Japan, and the USA is also a matter of worry for China.\nIssue of Tibet and Dalai Lama: The fact that Tibet\u2019s spiritual leader Dalai Lama lives in India is a tension area in India-China relations. The recent visit of the Dalai Lama to Arunachal Pradesh has been a matter of conflict between the two sides.\nIssue of Masood Azhar: India\u2019s bid to get Jaish-e-Mohammad chief Masood Azhar to be declared as a UN-designated terrorist has been blocked by China again and again. China is the only country among the 15 members UNSC to have opposed the ban. China is of the view that India is trying to pursue political gains in the name of counter-terrorism.\n\nRead:\u00a0China-Tibet issue\n\nWay forward\n\nFrom the recent incidents, although the possibility of an India-China armed conflict cannot be ruled out, any kind of military conflict is not in the interest of any country. The need of the hour is realizing that our \u2018strategic partnership\u2019 could serve us both and help see Asia emerge as the core of the world economy. This dream of the \u2018India-China Millennium of Exceptional Synergies\u2019 that the Prime Minister envisions, however, needs magnanimity and willingness on the part of both nations.\n\nEfforts to resolve the India-China border disputes have been ongoing for decades through diplomatic negotiations. Various rounds of border talks and agreements have been held to manage tensions and prevent escalations. However, a final resolution of the border disputes remains elusive, and the situation along the Line of Actual Control can be tense and prone to periodic flare-ups.\n\nBoth India and China recognize the importance of maintaining peace and stability along their border, and diplomatic channels remain open to seek peaceful resolutions to the disputes.\n\nRelated Posts:\n\nSecurity Challenges and Their Management in Border Areas\nCross-Border Insolvency\nIndia\u2019s Connectivity Projects\nCarbon Border Adjustment Mechanism (CBAM)\nRedrawal of National Boundaries\n\nContributors: Deepak Kaushik and Shuja Shabir"

of industrial property which refers to the geographical indication referring to a country or to a place situated therein as being the country or place of origin of that product.\nTypically, such a name conveys an assurance of quality and distinctiveness which is essentially attributable to the fact of its origin in that defined geographical locality, region or country.\nUnder Articles 1 (2) and 10 of the Paris Convention for the Protection of Industrial Property, geographical indications are covered as an element of IPRs.\nThey are also covered under Articles 22 to 24 of the Trade Related Aspects of Intellectual Property Rights (TRIPS) Agreement, which was part of the Agreements concluding the Uruguay Round of GATT negotiations.\nProponents of GIs regard them as strong tools for protecting their national property rights. Opponents, however, consider GIs as barriers to trade.\n\nCompiled by: Yuvaalex and Ujwala Pullela"

            "[CONTENT]": "Scientists have discovered a naturally existing next-generation genomic design method, called the bridge recombinase mechanism. Read here to learn more about it.\n\nGene editing technologies are powerful tools that allow scientists to make precise modifications to DNA, enabling advancements in fields such as medicine, agriculture, and biotechnology.\n\nBridge Recombinase Mechanism which exists naturally and has now been discovered, enhances the human ability to edit genomes beyond the capabilities and scope of CRISPR.\n\nIt utilises mobile genetic elements or \u201cjumping genes\u201d, which cut and paste themselves into genomes and are present in all forms of life, performing on-the-go DNA manipulation through all living beings.\n\nTable of Contents\n\nBridge Recombinase Mechanism\nWhat are jumping genes?\nMechanism of Action of Bridge Recombinase Mechanism\nBiological Importance of Bridge Recombinase Mechanism\nExamples of Bridge Recombinases\nDifferent gene editing technologies\nConclusion\nBridge Recombinase Mechanism\n\nBridge recombinase is a term used to describe a particular type of recombinase enzyme involved in genetic recombination, a fundamental process where DNA strands are broken and rejoined to introduce new combinations of genetic material.\n\nThis mechanism plays a critical role in genetic diversity, DNA repair, and the evolution of genomes.\n\nThe recent discovery has been highlighted by two Nature studies\u2013\n\n\ud83d\udc49 Which year are YOU targeting for success in the IAS/IPS/IFS Exam? \ud83d\ude80\n\n(1) \u21d2 UPSC 2025: Prelims cum Mains\n\n(2) \u21d2 UPSC 2026: Prelims cum Mains\n\n(3) \u21d2 UPSC 2027 Prelims cum Mains\n\nTip: Know more about ClearIAS Courses (Online/Offline)\n\nIS110 is a jumping gene that acts as a bridge between bits of unconnected DNA and exists naturally in humans. The RNA bridge can also be programmed.\nWhat are jumping genes?\n\nJumping genes, also known as transposable elements or transposons, are sequences of DNA that can move or \u201cjump\u201d to different positions within the genome of a single cell.\n\nThis ability to move from one location to another within the genome can have significant implications for gene function and genome evolution.\n\nTypes of Transposable Elements:\n\nClass I Transposons (Retrotransposons):\nMechanism: Copy and paste\nProcess: Transpose via an RNA intermediate. They are transcribed into RNA, which is then reverse-transcribed into DNA and inserted back into the genome.\nExample: Long Interspersed Nuclear Elements (LINEs), Short Interspersed Nuclear Elements (SINEs)\nClass II Transposons (DNA Transposons):\nMechanism: Cut and paste\nProcess: Transpose directly as DNA. They are excised from their original position and inserted into a new location within the genome.\nExample: Activator/Dissociation (Ac/Ds) elements in maize\n\nExample: Maize (Corn)\n\nThe discovery of transposons is credited to Barbara McClintock, who observed their behaviour in maize (corn) in the 1940s.\nHer work demonstrated that certain genetic elements could move around within the genome, causing changes in the colouration of maize kernels.\nMechanism of Action of Bridge Recombinase Mechanism\n\nThe bridge recombinase mechanism can be described in several steps:\n\nRecognition and Binding: The recombinase enzyme recognizes specific DNA sequences known as recombination sites. These sites are typically palindromic or have specific structural features that are identified by the recombinase.\nStrand Cleavage: Once the recombinase binds to the recombination sites, it introduces single-strand or double-strand breaks in the DNA. This cleavage is usually staggered, creating overhangs or blunt ends.\nStrand Exchange: The recombinase then facilitates the exchange of DNA strands between two different DNA molecules or within the same molecule. This exchange involves the pairing of homologous or similar sequences from the two DNA molecules.\nBridge Formation: In the context of bridge recombinase, a \u201cbridge\u201d is formed where the recombinase holds the cleaved DNA ends nearby, facilitating the exchange and rejoining of strands.\nStrand Rejoining: The recombinase then catalyzes the rejoining of the DNA strands, completing the recombination process. This rejoining can result in crossover (where segments of DNA are swapped between molecules) or non-crossover products (where sequences are merely rearranged within a molecule).\nBiological Importance of Bridge Recombinase Mechanism\nGenetic Diversity: By introducing new combinations of genetic material, bridge recombinase mechanisms contribute to genetic diversity within populations, which is essential for evolution and adaptation.\nDNA Repair: Recombination mechanisms, including those mediated by bridge recombinase, are crucial for repairing DNA damage, especially double-strand breaks. This repair mechanism maintains genomic stability.\nImmune System: In vertebrates, recombinases like RAG1 and RAG2 are involved in V(D)J recombination, a process that generates the diversity of antibodies and T-cell receptors, which are vital for the adaptive immune response.\nExamples of Bridge Recombinases\nRAG1 and RAG2: These enzymes are involved in V(D)J recombination, crucial for generating the diverse repertoire of antibodies and T-cell receptors in the immune system.\nCre Recombinase: Derived from bacteriophage P1, Cre recombinase is widely used in genetic engineering to induce site-specific recombination between loxP sites in DNA.\nFLP Recombinase: Derived from the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae, FLP recombinase mediates recombination between FRT sites and is also commonly used in genetic manipulation.\nDifferent gene editing technologies\n\nHere are some of the most prominent gene editing technologies:\n\nCRISPR-Cas9\n\nCRISPR-Cas9 is the most widely used gene-editing technology due to its efficiency, precision, and ease of use.\n\nMechanism: Uses a guide RNA to target a specific DNA sequence, and the Cas9 enzyme to create double-strand breaks in the DNA, allowing for modifications.\nApplications: Used for gene knockout, gene insertion, and correction of genetic mutations in research, medicine, and agriculture.\nAdvantages: High specificity, versatility, and cost-effectiveness.\nLimitations: Potential off-target effects and ethical concerns regarding germline editing.\nTALENs (Transcription Activator-Like Effector Nucleases)\n\nTALENs are proteins engineered to bind to specific DNA sequences and create double-strand breaks.\n\nMechanism: Composed of a DNA-binding domain and a nuclease domain, TALENs recognize specific DNA sequences and induce targeted breaks.\nApplications: Used for gene disruption, correction, and regulation in various organisms.\nAdvantages: High specificity and versatility in targeting different DNA sequences.\nLimitations: More complex and time-consuming to design and produce compared to CRISPR-Cas9.\nZFNs (Zinc Finger Nucleases)\n\nZFNs are synthetic proteins that combine a zinc finger DNA-binding domain with a nuclease domain to create targeted DNA breaks.\n\nMechanism: Zinc fingers bind to specific DNA sequences, and the nuclease domain induces double-strand breaks at these sites.\nApplications: Used in gene therapy, functional genomics, and the creation of genetically modified organisms.\nAdvantages: High specificity in targeting DNA sequences.\nLimitations: Designing and engineering ZFNs is labour-intensive and expensive.\nBase Editing\n\nBase editing allows for direct, irreversible conversion of one DNA base pair to another without creating double-strand breaks.\n\nMechanism: Uses a modified CRISPR-Cas9 enzyme coupled with a deaminase enzyme to convert specific DNA bases (e.g., C to T or A to G).\nApplications: Correcting point mutations and studying genetic diseases at the base level.\nAdvantages: High precision and reduced risk of unintended mutations.\nLimitations: Limited to certain types of base conversions and potential off-target effects.\nPrime Editing\n\nPrime editing is a versatile technology that allows for targeted insertions, deletions, and base conversions without double-strand breaks.\n\nMechanism: Combines a modified Cas9 enzyme with a reverse transcriptase and a guide RNA to introduce specific edits directly into the DNA.\nApplications: Wide range of genetic modifications, including correcting mutations and introducing precise genetic changes.\nAdvantages: High precision, versatility, and reduced off-target effects.\nLimitations: Requires optimization for different targets and may have limitations in efficiency.\nRNA Editing\n\nRNA editing involves the modification of RNA sequences after transcription, allowing for changes in gene expression without altering the underlying DNA.\n\nMechanism: Uses enzymes like ADAR (adenosine deaminase acting on RNA) to edit specific RNA bases.\nApplications: Potential treatments for genetic diseases, regulation of gene expression, and studying RNA functions.\nAdvantages: Reversible and does not involve permanent changes to the genome.\nLimitations: Currently less efficient and specific compared to DNA editing technologies.\nConclusion\n\nEach gene editing technology has its strengths and limitations, and the choice of which to use depends on the specific application and the desired outcome.\n\nAdvances in these technologies continue to expand their potential uses in medicine, agriculture, and beyond, while ongoing research aims to improve their precision, efficiency, and safety.\n\n-Article by Swathi Satish"

However, remittances rebounded as economies recovered.\nChallenges in Remittance inflows\nHigh Transaction Costs: The cost of sending remittances can be high, especially through formal channels. Efforts are being made to reduce these costs.\nRegulatory Barriers: Different countries have varying regulations, which can complicate the remittance process and increase costs.\nInformal Channels: A significant portion of remittances is still sent through informal channels, which can be unreliable and lack transparency.\nEconomic Dependence: Over-reliance on remittances can make recipient countries vulnerable to economic changes in the source countries.\nIn the news\n\nThe World Bank\u2019s latest Migration and Development Brief highlights that global remittance flows to low- and middle-income countries (LMICs) have shown resilience despite various economic challenges.\n\nIn 2023, remittances to LMICs grew by 0.7%, reaching an estimated $656 billion.\nThis growth, though modest, underscores the importance of remittances as a crucial source of external finance for developing countries, surpassing both foreign direct investment (FDI) and official development assistance (ODA).\nThe top recipient countries of remittances in 2023 include India ($125 billion), Mexico ($67 billion), China ($50 billion), the Philippines ($40 billion), and Egypt ($24 billion).\nThese funds play a significant role in supporting the economies of these countries, particularly in times of financial instability and inflationary pressures.\nRemittances to regions like South Asia grew by 7.2%, while other regions saw varying growth rates.\nHowever, regions such as the Middle East and North Africa experienced declines in remittance inflows due to economic and political factors.\n\nLooking forward, the growth of remittances to LMICs is expected to continue, albeit at a slower pace, with a projected increase of 3.1% in 2024.\n\nThis projection considers the ongoing global economic slowdown and potential declines in real incomes for migrants due to inflation and other economic challenges.\n\nFactors Affecting Remittance inflows to India\n\nStrong Economic Conditions\n\nDeveloped Economies: High-skilled Indian migrants in the US, UK, and Singapore benefit from strong labour markets and lower inflation. This results in higher disposable incomes and, consequently, increased remittances.\nEmployment Growth in Europe: Post-pandemic recovery in Europe, with high employment growth and reduced inflation, has contributed to increased remittance flows globally.\n\nDiversified Migrant Pool\n\nGCC Countries: A significant portion of India\u2019s migrant population resides in the GCC, providing a buffer against economic downturns in any single region. The UAE accounts for 18% of India\u2019s remittance flows, while Saudi Arabia, Kuwait, Oman, and Qatar collectively account for 11%.\nEconomic Conditions in GCC: High energy prices and controlled food price inflation in the GCC have positively impacted employment and incomes for Indian migrants, especially in less-skilled sectors.\n\nImproved Remittance Channels\n\nUnified Payment Interface (UPI): Initiatives like UPI enable real-time fund transfers, making remittances faster and more efficient. The National Payments Corporation of India (NPCI) has extended UPI usage to NRIs in several countries, including the US, UK, Singapore, Australia, Canada, and GCC countries.\n\nTop Sources of Remittances for India\n\nHigh-Income Countries: Approximately 36% of remittance flows come from high-skilled migrants in the US, UK, and Singapore. Tight labour markets and wage hikes in these countries have boosted remittances.\nGCC Countries: The UAE alone accounts for 18% of India\u2019s remittance flows, with other GCC countries collectively contributing 11%.\nHow to Increase Remittance Inflow in India?\nBoosting Financial Inclusion: With only 80% of Indians having bank accounts, expanding formal financial services, particularly in rural areas, can facilitate easier remittance transfers. This includes increasing the network of bank branches, ATMs, and digital platforms.\nReducing Remittance Costs: Encouraging competition among remittance service providers and promoting digital channels can lower transaction costs. Government incentives for using formal channels can further boost remittance inflows.\nEnhancing Remittance Infrastructure: Upgrading payment systems and leveraging technologies like blockchain can streamline the remittance process. The Reserve Bank of India\u2019s centralized payment systems, such as RTGS and NEFT, are steps toward this goal.\nTargeted Diaspora Engagement: Initiatives like Pravasi Bharatiya Divas and the Know India Programme can strengthen connections with the Indian diaspora. Offering attractive investment options and tax breaks, as suggested by the IMF, can incentivize higher remittance inflows.\nPromoting Economic Stability:\u00a0Implementing sound macroeconomic policies, improving the ease of doing business, and addressing corruption can enhance diaspora confidence, creating a more attractive environment for remittance flows.\n\nBy addressing these areas, India can further enhance its remittance inflows, contributing significantly to its economic growth and development.\n\nConclusion\n\nRemittance inflows play a vital role in the economies of many developing countries, providing crucial support to millions of households.\n\nBy improving financial access, reducing transaction costs, and supporting migrants, countries can maximize the benefits of remittances, fostering economic growth and improving social outcomes.\n\nRead:\u00a0Cross-border remittances\n\n-Article by Swathi Satish"

benefits.\n\nProduction of Bio-Bitumen\n\nBio bitumen can be produced through various processes, including:\n\nPyrolysis: Thermal decomposition of organic material at high temperatures in the absence of oxygen, producing bio-oil that can be further processed into bio bitumen.\nHydrothermal Liquefaction: Converting biomass into a liquid phase under high pressure and temperature, resulting in a bio-crude that can be refined into bio-bitumen.\nFermentation and Biochemical Processes: Using microorganisms to break down biomass into bio-oil, which is then processed into bio bitumen.\nBenefits of Bio-Bitumen in Road Construction\nEnvironmental Sustainability:\nReduction in Greenhouse Gases: Lower carbon footprint compared to traditional bitumen as it is derived from renewable sources.\nDecreased Dependency on Fossil Fuels: Reduces reliance on petroleum, promoting energy security and diversification of energy sources.\nWaste Utilization:\nAgricultural Residues: Utilizes crop residues, such as straw and husks, which are often left over after harvest.\nForestry Waste: Incorporates wood waste, sawdust, and other by-products from forestry operations.\nEconomic Benefits:\nLocal Production: Can be produced locally using regionally available biomass, reducing transportation costs and supporting local economies.\nCost-Effective: Potentially lower production costs as it uses waste materials that would otherwise be discarded.\nPerformance and Durability:\nComparable Properties: Bio bitumen can be engineered to meet or exceed the performance characteristics of traditional bitumen, such as durability, flexibility, and resistance to temperature variations.\nImproved Road Quality: This can contribute to better road quality and longevity, reducing maintenance costs over time.\nRole in Reducing Stubble Burning\nStubble Management:\nUtilization of Crop Residues: By converting agricultural residues, such as paddy straw and wheat straw, into bio bitumen, farmers have an alternative use for the biomass that would otherwise be burned.\nEconomic Incentives: Provides farmers with an economic incentive to collect and sell their crop residues instead of burning them, thereby reducing air pollution and health hazards associated with stubble burning.\nEnvironmental Impact:\nReduction in Air Pollution: Decreases the incidence of stubble burning, which significantly contributes to air pollution in many agricultural regions, especially in countries like India.\nImprovement in Soil Health: Prevents the degradation of soil quality that occurs due to the burning of crop residues, promoting sustainable agricultural practices.\nBitumen vs Asphalt vs Tar\n\nWhile bitumen, asphalt, and tar are all used in construction and industrial applications, they differ significantly in their source, composition, properties, and primary uses.\n\n\u00a0\n\t\nBitumen\n\t\nAsphalt\n\t\nTar\n\n\nSource and composition\n\t\nNaturally occurring or derived from crude oil.\n\t\nA mixture of bitumen and aggregates.\n\t\nDerived from the destructive distillation of organic materials like coal.\n\n\nPrimary uses\n\t\nBinder in asphalt, waterproofing, and sealing.\n\t\nRoad construction and paving.\n\n\u00a0\n\n\t\nSealant, protective coatings, and historically in road construction.\n\n\nDurability and performance\n\t\nProvides adhesive and waterproofing properties.\n\t\nHigh durability, flexibility, and water resistance.\n\n\u00a0\n\n\t\nGood adhesive and waterproofing properties, but are less commonly used due to health and environmental concerns.\n\n\nEnvironmental concerns\n\t\nSafer than tar but still has some environmental concerns.\n\t\nGenerally considered safe for use in construction, but dust and fumes can be an issue.\n\t\nContains harmful chemicals and is less commonly used due to health and environmental concerns.\nWhy in the news?\n\nIndia is looking to start large-scale production of bio-bitumen from biomass or agricultural waste, a move that would help reduce imports of the material used for asphalting of roads while also addressing the persistent issue of stubble burning.\n\nThe Central Road Research Institute (CRRI) will collaborate with the Indian Institute of Petroleum, Dehradun to construct a 1 km road stretch using bio-bitumen.\nThe success of this pilot study could lead to the commercialization and transfer of technology to private entities or the public sector for mass production of bio-bitumen which will be utilized for construction of the national highways.\nIndia currently imports about half of its annual requirement of bitumen and the target is to replace imports with bio-bitumen over the next 10 years.\nBitumen Production in India\nDomestic Production:\nIndia produces bitumen as a byproduct in its oil refineries.\nMajor Indian oil companies like Indian Oil Corporation (IOC), Bharat Petroleum Corporation Limited (BPCL), and Hindustan Petroleum Corporation Limited (HPCL) are key producers.\nQuality and Grades:\nIndia produces various grades of bitumen, including VG-10, VG-20, VG-30, and VG-40, which cater to different climatic and usage conditions.\n\nImport Burden:\n\nDemand vs. Supply:\nIndia\u2019s rapid infrastructure development has led to increased demand for bitumen.\nDomestic production falls short of meeting this demand, leading to significant imports.\nImport Statistics:\nIndia imports bitumen primarily from the Middle East, especially from countries like Iran, UAE, and Bahrain.\nThe annual import burden runs into hundreds of millions of dollars, affecting the country\u2019s trade balance.\nEconomic Impact:\nThe dependency on imports exposes India to price volatility in the global oil market.\nHigh import costs impact the overall cost of infrastructure projects, making them more expensive.\nConclusion\n\nBio-bitumen represents a promising advancement in sustainable construction materials. By offering an eco-friendly alternative to petroleum-based bitumen, it not only supports environmental sustainability but also addresses critical issues such as waste management and stubble burning.\n\nThe use of bio-bitumen in road construction can lead to better air quality, healthier ecosystems, and a reduction in the reliance on non-renewable resources. As research and development in this field continue, bio-bitumen has the potential to play a significant role in the future of green infrastructure.\n\nIndia\u2019s reliance on imported bitumen poses significant economic challenges, but the development of bio-bitumen presents a promising solution.\n\nBy leveraging renewable resources and investing in research and development, India can reduce its import burden and enhance the sustainability of its infrastructure projects.\n\nGovernment support, industry collaboration, and technological advancements will be crucial in realizing the potential of bio-bitumen as a viable alternative to traditional bitumen.\n\nRead: Road Infrastructure in India\n\n-Article by Swathi Satish"

It has effectively managed heavy vehicle traffic and optimized revenue collection.\nWhy in the news?\n\nThe National Highway Authority of India (NHAI) has invited expressions of interest for the implementation of a satellite-based electronic toll collection system.\n\nThe NHAI has said that it plans to implement the GNSS-based electronic toll collection system alongside RFID-based Fastags currently being used by vehicles.\nEach toll plaza will have two or more dedicated lanes for GNSS-ready vehicles, where barriers will remain open to ensure the free flow of vehicles.\nThe lanes will have advanced readers to identify GNSS vehicles, which will have an onboard tracking unit deployed on them that will send out signals to enable the calculation of distance and time of vehicles.\nThe payment system will be the same as the one being used for Fastag, where toll amounts will be debited directly through a vehicle owner\u2019s bank account.\nThe toll charger will send the calculated user fee to be charged to the vehicle owner through an SMS as well as a map that will show the path traversed by the vehicle.\nOn the issue of privacy, the EOI document states that the selected company will have to develop a suitable mechanism for data transfer from vehicle locating and tracking devices to the control centre and only authorised devices should be able to transfer data to the backend control centre.\nThe provider will also have to ensure that the security and privacy of data are maintained by the law and government guidelines.\nImplementation of the satellite-based tolling system\n\nImplementation will involve an On-Board Unit (OBU), or a tracking device, fitted inside a vehicle whose location can be mapped using GAGAN, the Indian satellite navigation system with an approximate accuracy of 10 metres.\n\nThe co-ordinates of the entire length of the country\u2019s national highways will have to be logged with the help of digital image processing, and software will be used to assign the toll rate on a particular highway, calculate the toll amount for a vehicle as per the distance travelled by it and then deduct it from a wallet linked to the OBU.\nThe system will additionally have gantries, or arches mounted with CCTV cameras, at various points on a highway for enforcement purposes.\nThese will capture an image of the vehicle\u2019s high-security registration plate and cross-verify if a road user is trying to trick the system by either removing the tracking device or travelling without an OBU onboard.\nFASTag vs Satellite-based tolling system\n\t\n\nFASTag\n\n\t\n\nGNSS-based tolling system\n\n\n\n\nTechnology\n\n\t\nUtilizes RFID (Radio Frequency Identification) technology.\nTags are scanned by RFID readers installed at toll plazas.\n\t\nUtilizes GNSS (e.g., GPS, GLONASS) for real-time vehicle tracking.\nCan incorporate additional sensors and communication modules for data transmission.\n\n\n\nInfrastructure\n\n\t\nRequires installation of RFID readers at toll plazas.\nToll plazas remain operational with barriers for vehicles without FASTag.\n\t\nRequires less physical infrastructure on roads.\nCentralized system for tracking and toll calculation based on vehicle movement.\n\n\n\nCost\n\n\t\nLower initial investment for users (cost of the tag).\nInfrastructure costs are moderate, mainly involving RFID readers and integration with payment systems.\n\t\nThe higher initial investment for equipping vehicles with GNSS devices.\nLower infrastructure costs due to minimal roadside equipment needs.\n\n\n\nOperation\n\n\t\nVehicles slow down or stop briefly for tag scanning at toll plazas.\nEffective for specific points of toll collection.\n\t\nContinuous tracking of vehicles allows for distance-based tolling.\nCan eliminate the need for toll plazas, enabling seamless travel.\n\n\n\nCoverage\n\n\t\nLimited to highways and roads equipped with RFID readers.\nNot suitable for distance-based tolling.\n\t\nWide-area coverage, including urban and rural roads, highways, and more.\nSuitable for complex tolling scenarios, such as congestion pricing.\n\n\n\nUser experience\n\n\t\nMinimizes congestion at toll plazas, reducing wait times.\nRequires users to ensure their FASTag account is adequately funded.\n\t\nProvides a seamless travel experience without stopping at toll points.\nUsers need to install GNSS devices in their vehicles and ensure data connectivity.\nGAGAN (GPS-Aided GEO Augmented Navigation)\n\nGAGAN is an acronym for GPS Aided GEO Augmented Navigation, which is a Satellite-Based Augmentation System (SBAS) implemented by the Indian government.\n\nGAGAN enhances the performance of the Global Positioning System (GPS) to meet the precision and reliability requirements for civil aviation and other applications.\nIt is a joint project by the Indian Space Research Organisation (ISRO) and the Airports Authority of India (AAI).\nEnhances the availability and continuity of GPS signals, ensuring consistent and reliable service across the region.\nCovers the entire Indian subcontinent and a significant portion of the Indian Ocean region, enhancing navigation capabilities over a vast area.\nSupports dual-frequency (L1 and L5) operations, which helps mitigate errors caused by ionospheric delays.\n\nComponents:\n\nGround Segment:\n\nReference Stations: A network of GPS reference stations (INRES \u2013 Indian Reference Stations) that collect GPS data.\nMaster Control Center: Processes the data collected from reference stations to compute corrections and integrity messages.\nUplink Stations: Send the processed information to geostationary satellites.\n\nSpace Segment:\n\nGeostationary Satellites: Three geostationary satellites (GSAT-8, GSAT-10, and GSAT-15) transmit correction signals and integrity information to users.\n\nUser Segment:\n\nGAGAN-Compatible Receivers: Users need to have compatible receivers to benefit from the enhanced accuracy and integrity provided by GAGAN.\nConclusion\n\nSatellite-based tolling systems offer a modern, efficient, and scalable solution for road usage charging. By leveraging GNSS technology, these systems provide numerous benefits, including reduced congestion, cost-effectiveness, and accurate billing.\n\nHowever, addressing privacy concerns, ensuring data security, and managing technical and regulatory challenges are crucial for successful implementation.\n\nAs countries seek to modernize their infrastructure and improve traffic management, satellite-based tolling represents a promising and forward-looking approach.\n\n-Article by Swathi Satish"

            "[CONTENT]": "Freedom of expression is a fundamental right enshrined in Article 19(1)(a) of the Indian Constitution. This right, however, is subject to reasonable restrictions under Article 19(2). The Supreme Court of India has played a pivotal role in interpreting and defining the scope and limitations of this right through various landmark judgements. Read here to learn more.\n\nFreedom of expression is the right of individuals to hold opinions and to seek, receive, and impart information and ideas through any media regardless of frontiers.\n\nThis fundamental right is enshrined in various international human rights instruments, including the Universal Declaration of Human Rights (Article 19) and the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights (ICCPR, Article 19).\n\nTable of Contents\n\nFreedom of Expression in India\nLegal Provisions and Judicial Interpretations\nChallenges and Issues\nSupreme Court Judgments\nWhy in the news?\nConclusion\nFreedom of Expression in India\n\nConstitutional Framework\n\nFreedom of expression is a fundamental right guaranteed by the Indian Constitution. It is enshrined in Article 19(1)(a), which states:\n\nArticle 19(1)(a): \u201cAll citizens shall have the right to freedom of speech and expression.\u201d\n\nThis right is considered essential for the functioning of a democratic society, allowing individuals to express their thoughts, ideas, and opinions freely.\n\n\ud83d\udc49 Which year are YOU targeting for success in the IAS/IPS/IFS Exam? \ud83d\ude80\n\n(1) \u21d2 UPSC 2025: Prelims cum Mains\n\n(2) \u21d2 UPSC 2026: Prelims cum Mains\n\n(3) \u21d2 UPSC 2027 Prelims cum Mains\n\nTip: Know more about ClearIAS Courses (Online/Offline)\n\nReasonable Restrictions\n\nWhile freedom of expression is a fundamental right, it is not absolute.\n\nArticle 19(2) of the Constitution permits the state to impose reasonable restrictions on this right in the interests of:\n\nSovereignty and Integrity of India\nSecurity of the State\nFriendly Relations with Foreign States\nPublic Order\nDecency or Morality\nContempt of Court\nDefamation\nIncitement to an Offence\n\nThese restrictions ensure that freedom of expression does not harm public order, morality, or the rights of others.\n\nLegal Provisions and Judicial Interpretations\nIndian Penal Code (IPC) (Bharatiya Nyaya Sanhita since 2023):\nSection 124A (Sedition): Punishes any act that brings or attempts to bring hatred or contempt, or excites or attempts to excite disaffection towards the government.\nSection 153A: Penalizes promoting enmity between different groups on grounds of religion, race, etc.\nSection 295A: Deals with deliberate and malicious acts intended to outrage religious feelings.\nInformation Technology Act, 2000:\nSection 66A: Previously penalized sending offensive messages through communication service, but was struck down by the Supreme Court in 2015 in the case of Shreya Singhal vs. Union of India.\nContempt of Courts Act, 1971:\nImposes restrictions on publications that can lower the authority of courts.\nJudicial Interpretations:\nThe judiciary has played a crucial role in balancing freedom of expression with the imposition of reasonable restrictions. Landmark judgments include:\nShreya Singhal vs. Union of India (2015): Struck down Section 66A of the IT Act as unconstitutional.\nRomesh Thappar vs. State of Madras (1950): Established that freedom of speech and expression is essential for the proper functioning of democracy.\nRangarajan vs. P. Jagjivan Ram (1989): Affirmed that freedom of expression cannot be suppressed unless it threatens public order.\nChallenges and Issues\nSedition Law (Section 124A of IPC): There have been numerous debates on whether the sedition law is being misused to suppress dissent and criticism against the government.\nInternet and Social Media Regulations: The government\u2019s attempts to regulate content on digital platforms have raised concerns about potential overreach and censorship.\nCensorship and Artistic Expression: Films, books, and artworks often face censorship or bans for allegedly hurting sentiments, raising concerns about stifling creativity and expression.\nHate Speech and Misinformation: Balancing freedom of expression with curbing hate speech and misinformation is a significant challenge in the digital age.\nSupreme Court Judgments\n\nThe Supreme Court has reiterated the importance of free speech in several judgments, emphasizing that dissent is a vital part of democracy.\n\nRomesh Thappar v. State of Madras (1950)\nRomesh Thappar\u2019s journal, \u201cCross Roads,\u201d was banned by the Madras government on the grounds of public safety.\nJudgement: The Supreme Court struck down the ban, asserting that freedom of speech and expression is essential for the functioning of a democracy.\nSignificance: This was one of the earliest cases to affirm that freedom of expression is a fundamental right and any restriction must be justified by the government.\nSakal Papers Ltd. v. Union of India (1962)\nThe government imposed restrictions on the number of pages newspapers could print and the prices they could charge.\nJudgement: The Supreme Court held that these restrictions violated the freedom of the press.\nSignificance: This case established that the freedom of the press is part of the broader right to freedom of speech and expression.\nBennett Coleman & Co. v. Union of India (1972)\nThe government imposed a newsprint control order that limited the quantity of newsprint supplied to newspapers.\nJudgement: The Supreme Court ruled that the order violated the freedom of the press.\nSignificance: The judgement emphasized that any regulation that curtails the press\u2019s freedom to circulate is an infringement on the fundamental right to freedom of expression.\nManeka Gandhi v. Union of India (1978)\nManeka Gandhi\u2019s passport was impounded without providing reasons, restricting her right to travel and express herself.\nJudgement: The Supreme Court expanded the interpretation of Article 21 (Right to Life and Personal Liberty) to include the right to travel abroad.\nSignificance: This case linked the right to freedom of expression with the broader concept of personal liberty, emphasizing that the procedure established by law must be fair and just.\nShreya Singhal v. Union of India (2015)\nThe validity of Section 66A of the Information Technology Act, of 2000, which allowed the arrest of individuals for posting \u201coffensive\u201d content online, was challenged.\nJudgement: The Supreme Court struck down Section 66A, deeming it unconstitutional.\nSignificance: This landmark judgement reaffirmed the importance of free speech in the digital age and underscored that vague and overly broad restrictions on speech are impermissible.\nS. Rangarajan v. P. Jagjivan Ram (1989)\nThe Tamil Nadu government banned the screening of a film on the grounds of public order.\nJudgement: The Supreme Court overturned the ban, stating that freedom of expression cannot be suppressed unless it threatens the foundation of the state.\nSignificance: This case underscored the importance of artistic freedom and the principle that mere anticipation of public disorder is not sufficient to suppress free speech.\nIndibily Creative Pvt Ltd v. State of West Bengal (2020)\nThe West Bengal Police obstructed the screening of the film \u201cBhobishyoter Bhoot\u201d without formal orders.\nJudgement: The Supreme Court ordered the state to ensure the film\u2019s unhindered screening and criticized the state\u2019s informal suppression of free speech.\nSignificance: The judgement reinforced that state actions cannot arbitrarily infringe on the freedom of expression and artistic creativity.\nWhy in the news?\n\nThe Karnataka government\u2019s decision to stop the release of the Hindi film, Hamare Baarah, for two weeks violates the freedom of expression in the name of upholding order and preventing communal tension.\n\nSuch a ban on public screening of films, independent of their merit, has no place in a democratic society.\nThe Bombay High Court, which initially stayed the release of Hamare Baarah, has lifted the ban, following the producer\u2019s offer to remove some controversial dialogues.\nIts observation that allowing an individual to stall the release of a certified film would encourage film producers to be held to ransom is consistent with judicial precedents.\nOnce it is certified by the Central Board of Film Certification, presumably after proper scrutiny of its suitability for public viewing, there ought to be no scope for a second opinion by a law enforcement authority.\nConclusion\n\nFreedom of expression in India is a fundamental right that is crucial for the functioning of democracy.\n\nWhile the Constitution provides for this right, it also allows for reasonable restrictions to ensure it does not harm public order or the rights of others.\n\nThe legal and judicial frameworks aim to balance these interests, but challenges remain, particularly with laws that can be perceived as tools for suppressing dissent.\n\nContinuous dialogue and judicial oversight are essential to uphold the spirit of freedom of expression in India.\n\n-Article by Swathi Satish"

This continuous unfolding includes reforms in the electoral system, such as in India.\n\nDebate and discussion over the issue of First-Past-The-Post (FPTP) versus Proportional Representation (PR) electoral systems have been ongoing for decades.\n\nThe issue regained momentum after the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) )-led National Democratic Alliance (NDA) won the 2024 general election.\n\nTable of Contents\n\nProportional Representation electoral system\nTypes of Proportional Representation\nFeatures of Proportional Representation\nAdvantages of Proportional Representation\nDisadvantages of Proportional Representation\nCountries Using Proportional Representation\nFirst-Past-The-Post (FPTP) Electoral System in India\nImplementation in India\nAdvantages of FPTP\nDisadvantages of FPTP\nImpact on Indian Politics\nCase Studies\nShould India change to Proportional representation?\nConclusion\nProportional Representation electoral system\n\nProportional Representation (PR) is an electoral system designed to ensure that the number of seats a political party or group wins in a legislature is proportionate to the number of votes it receives in an election.\n\nUnlike majoritarian systems, where the candidate with the most votes wins, PR aims to reflect the overall distribution of public support for each party within the legislative body.\n\n\ud83d\udc49 Which year are YOU targeting for success in the IAS/IPS/IFS Exam? \ud83d\ude80\n\n(1) \u21d2 UPSC 2025: Prelims cum Mains\n\n(2) \u21d2 UPSC 2026: Prelims cum Mains\n\n(3) \u21d2 UPSC 2027 Prelims cum Mains\n\nTip: Know more about ClearIAS Courses (Online/Offline)\n\nTypes of Proportional Representation\nList PR:\nVoters cast their ballots for a party, and parties receive seats in proportion to their share of the vote.\nClosed List: Parties determine the order of candidates on the list.\nOpen List: Voters can influence the order of candidates on the party list.\nSingle Transferable Vote (STV):\nVoters rank candidates in order of preference.\nCandidates must reach a specified quota of votes to be elected.\nSurplus votes from elected candidates and eliminated candidates\u2019 votes are transferred based on voter preferences.\nMixed-Member Proportional (MMP):\nCombines elements of PR and majoritarian systems.\nVoters have two votes: one for a party and one for a local candidate.\nTo ensure overall proportionality, the Seats are filled by constituency representatives and party lists.\nFeatures of Proportional Representation\nProportional Allocation: Seats in the legislature are allocated based on the proportion of votes each party receives.\nMulti-Member Districts: Electoral districts elect multiple representatives rather than just one, enabling a proportional distribution of seats.\nThresholds: Minimum percentage of votes a party must receive to gain representation. This prevents fragmentation by very small parties.\nAdvantages of Proportional Representation\nFair Representation: Ensures that all significant political groups receive representation proportional to their electoral support, leading to a more inclusive and representative legislature.\nReduced Wasted Votes: Fewer votes are wasted compared to winner-takes-all systems, as even smaller parties can gain seats if they meet the threshold.\nEncourages Multi-Party Systems: Facilitates the representation of a broader range of political parties, encouraging a pluralistic political landscape.\nCoalition Governments: Often results in coalition governments, which can promote consensus-building and more stable policy-making.\nDisadvantages of Proportional Representation\nComplexity: PR systems can be more complex for voters to understand and for electoral authorities to administer.\nCoalition Instability: Coalition governments, common under PR, can be unstable and prone to frequent changes or collapses.\nFringe Parties: Small or fringe parties may gain representation, potentially leading to fragmented legislatures and difficulty in forming effective governments.\nAccountability Issues: Voters may find it harder to hold individual representatives accountable, especially in systems with closed-party lists.\nCountries Using Proportional Representation\nGermany: Uses a Mixed-Member Proportional system combining direct constituency elections with proportional party list seats.\nSweden: Employs an open list PR system, allowing voters to influence the ranking of candidates on party lists.\nNew Zealand: Adopted a Mixed-Member Proportional system, providing voters with two votes: one for a party and one for a local candidate.\nNetherlands: Utilizes a pure List PR system with a low threshold, resulting in a highly proportional and multi-party legislature.\nFirst-Past-The-Post (FPTP) Electoral System in India\n\nThe First-Past-The-Post (FPTP) electoral system, also known as the plurality or simple majority system, is the electoral method used in India for both parliamentary and state assembly elections.\n\nIn this system, the candidate who receives the most votes in a constituency wins the election, regardless of whether they secure an absolute majority of the votes.\n\nFeatures of FPTP\n\nSingle-Member Constituencies: Each electoral district, or constituency, elects one representative to the legislative body.\nA plurality of Votes: The candidate with the highest number of votes in a constituency wins, even if they do not achieve an absolute majority.\nSimple Ballot: Voters select their preferred candidate, and the candidate with the most votes wins.\nDirect Representation: Each elected representative directly represents the interests of their specific constituency.\nImplementation in India\nLok Sabha (House of the People):\nIndia\u2019s lower house of Parliament, the Lok Sabha, consists of 543 elected members.\nEach member is elected from a single-member constituency using the FPTP system.\nState Legislative Assemblies:\nMembers of the Legislative Assemblies (MLAs) in each Indian state are also elected using the FPTP system.\nEach constituency within a state elects one representative.\nAdvantages of FPTP\nSimplicity: The system is easy for voters to understand and for electoral authorities to administer.\nClear Outcomes: Typically results in clear and decisive election outcomes, facilitating the formation of stable governments.\nStrong Representative-constituency Link: The direct election of representatives strengthens the accountability and connection between elected officials and their constituents.\nDiscourages Extremism: By favouring larger, broad-based parties, FPTP tends to marginalize extremist and fringe parties.\nDisadvantages of FPTP\nDisproportionate Representation: The system can result in a significant discrepancy between the percentage of votes received by a party and the percentage of seats they win. Smaller parties and minority groups may be underrepresented.\nWasted Votes: Votes cast for losing candidates do not contribute to the election outcome, potentially leading to a large number of wasted votes.\nEncourages Tactical Voting: Voters may feel compelled to vote for a candidate they perceive as having a better chance of winning, rather than their preferred candidate.\nRegional Imbalances: FPTP can exacerbate regional disparities, as parties with concentrated regional support can win many seats with fewer votes, while parties with widespread but thin support may win fewer seats.\nImpact on Indian Politics\nTwo-Party Dominance: FPTP has contributed to the dominance of major parties like the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) and the Indian National Congress (INC) in Indian politics.\nSmaller and regional parties often struggle to gain proportional representation.\nMajority Governments: The system often produces majority governments, which can govern more effectively without needing coalition support.\nRegional Parties: While FPTP can disadvantage smaller parties, it has also enabled the rise of strong regional parties in states where these parties have concentrated support.\nCase Studies\n2014 Lok Sabha Elections:\nThe BJP won 31% of the total vote but secured 282 out of 543 seats (52%), illustrating the disproportionality that can occur with FPTP.\nThe INC received 19% of the vote but only 44 seats, showing the challenges faced by even significant parties under this system.\n2017 Uttar Pradesh Legislative Assembly Elections:\nThe BJP secured 39.7% of the vote but won 312 out of 403 seats (77%), while the Samajwadi Party and Bahujan Samaj Party, despite significant vote shares, won far fewer seats.\nShould India change to Proportional representation?\n\nThe First-Past-The-Post (FPTP) electoral system in India plays a critical role in shaping the country\u2019s political landscape.\n\nIts simplicity and tendency to produce stable governments are significant advantages.\nHowever, the system also has notable drawbacks, such as disproportional representation and the potential for wasted votes.\nUnderstanding these dynamics is essential for evaluating the effectiveness and fairness of India\u2019s electoral process and considering any potential reforms.\n\nProportional Representation (PR) systems offer a more equitable approach to translating votes into legislative seats, ensuring that a wide range of political voices is represented.\n\nWhile these systems have their complexities and potential drawbacks, such as coalition instability and the empowerment of smaller parties, their advantages in promoting fair representation and reducing wasted votes make them a popular choice in many democracies worldwide.\nBy providing a closer match between public support and legislative representation, PR systems aim to create more inclusive and responsive governance.\nConclusion\n\nChanging to a Proportional Representation system in India could enhance fairness and inclusivity in representation, reflecting the diverse political and social landscape more accurately.\n\nHowever, such a transition would also bring challenges, including potential political fragmentation, administrative complexities, and the risk of unstable coalition governments.\n\nRelated articles:\n\nAlternative voting methods in India\nElectoral reforms in India\nSimultaneous elections\nCoalition government\n\n-Article by Swathi Satish"

defects at birth, diseases, deficiencies, and developmental delays.\nFree treatment and management of identified conditions.\nWhy in the news?\n\nThe UN Children\u2019s Fund (UNICEF) released a new report that highlights alarming levels of child food poverty due to inequity, conflict, and climate crises.\n\nThe report warned that millions of children under five have difficulty accessing nutritious and diverse diets necessary for developmental growth and that food prices and living costs have hit record-high levels as countries continue to recover from the impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\nKey findings of the report:\n\nGlobally, one in four children are living in severe child food poverty in early childhood, amounting to 181 million children under 5 years of age.\nProgress towards ending severe child food poverty is slow, but some regions and countries are proving that progress is possible and is happening.\nSevere child food poverty is experienced by children belonging to poor and non-poor households, indicating that household income is not the only driver of severe child food poverty.\nChildren living in severe child food poverty are missing out on many nutrient-rich foods, while unhealthy foods are becoming entrenched in the diets of these children.\nThe global food and nutrition crisis and localized conflicts and climatic shocks are intensifying severe child food poverty, especially in fragile countries.\nSevere child food poverty is driving child undernutrition: the prevalence of severe child food poverty is three times higher in countries with a high prevalence of child stunting.\nConclusion\n\nChild food poverty is a critical issue that requires a multi-faceted approach involving government policies, community support, educational initiatives, and economic interventions.\n\nAddressing this issue is essential for ensuring the healthy development and well-being of children and breaking the cycle of poverty and food insecurity.\n\nThrough coordinated efforts, it is possible to significantly reduce child food poverty and its detrimental effects on society.\n\n-Article by Swathi Satish"

This involves agreeing on a common minimum program and sharing ministerial positions.\nCommon Minimum Programme (CMP):\nA CMP outlines the agreed policies and programs that coalition partners commit to implementing. It helps in managing ideological differences among coalition partners.\nPunchhi and Sarkaria Commission on Coalition governments\n\nBoth commissions provided recommendations relevant to coalition politics, which has become increasingly prominent in India\u2019s political landscape.\n\nSarkaria Commission (1983-1988)\n\nThe Sarkaria Commission was primarily tasked with reviewing the working of the existing arrangements between the Union and the states and recommending changes within the framework of the Constitution.\n\nWhile it did not specifically focus on coalition politics, many of its recommendations are relevant to ensuring stable and effective governance, which is crucial in coalition settings.\n\nKey Recommendations Relevant to Coalition Politics:\n\nGovernor\u2019s Role:\nThe Governor should act impartially and not be influenced by political considerations, especially in coalition scenarios.\nGovernors should be consulted by the Union government before their appointment, considering the views of the Chief Minister.\nGovernors should be eminent persons from outside the state who are not involved in active politics.\nPresident\u2019s Rule:\nPresident\u2019s Rule (Article 356) should be used sparingly and as a last resort. This is particularly important in coalition governments to avoid misuse for political gains.\nThe imposition of the President\u2019s Rule should be based on objective criteria, ensuring that a breakdown of constitutional machinery is evident.\nFormation of Government:\nIn cases of a hung assembly, the Governor should invite the leader of the largest pre-poll alliance or the single largest party claiming support to form the government.\nThe Governor should ensure that the new government enjoys majority support in the assembly through a floor test.\nCentre-State Relations:\nStrengthening the Inter-State Council for better coordination between the Centre and the states, which is critical when coalition partners are from different states and parties.\n\nPunchhi Commission (2007-2010)\n\nThe Punchhi Commission was established to look into the new issues of Centre-State relations in the context of socio-economic developments since the Sarkaria Commission\u2019s recommendations.\n\nKey Recommendations Relevant to Coalition Politics:\n\nGovernor\u2019s Role:\nThe Governor should be a detached figure without political ties to ensure unbiased decisions, especially crucial during coalition formations.\nThe process for appointing the Governor should involve consultations with the state Chief Minister to maintain a non-partisan stance.\nPresident\u2019s Rule:\nThe application of the President\u2019s Rule should be limited and subjected to judicial review to prevent its misuse, which can disrupt coalition governments.\nA floor test should be the rule to ascertain the majority of the ruling coalition.\nModel Code of Conduct:\nThe Model Code of Conduct should be given statutory backing to prevent coalition partners from misusing their power during elections.\nNational Integration Council (NIC):\nThe NIC should be revived and restructured to address the growing complexity of coalition politics and ensure national unity.\nInter-State Trade and Commerce:\nEstablish mechanisms to resolve disputes related to inter-state trade and commerce, which can become contentious in coalition arrangements with regional parties having divergent interests.\nCoalition Stability:\nEmphasized the need for stable coalitions and suggested mechanisms for improving coordination and policy consistency among coalition partners.\nAdvocated for the implementation of a Code of Conduct for coalition partners to ensure smooth functioning and adherence to agreed policies.\nFiscal Federalism:\nRecommended reforms to ensure better fiscal management and distribution of resources between the Centre and the states, which is crucial for the stability of coalition governments where partners may represent different states with varying fiscal needs.\nNotable Coalition Governments\nJanata Party Government (1977-1980):\nFormed by an alliance of parties like Janata Party, Bharatiya Lok Dal, and others.\nCollapsed due to internal conflicts and defections.\nPV Narasimha Rao government (1991-1996:\nIn 1991, when India was facing a foreign reserves crisis, Narasimha Rao\u2019s government brought about three big-ticket economic reforms \u2013 globalisation, liberalisation and privatisation.\nNational Front Government (1989-1990):\nLed by V.P.

            "[CONTENT]": "Gold loans in India are a popular form of secured loan where borrowers pledge their gold ornaments or coins to a lender in exchange for funds. These loans are regulated by the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) to ensure fair practices and protect both lenders and borrowers. Read here to learn more.\n\nGold loans are highly popular in India due to a combination of cultural, economic, and practical reasons.\n\nThe popularity of gold loans in India can be attributed to the cultural affinity for gold, economic benefits, ease of access, and practical advantages they offer.\n\nGold loans provide a quick, flexible, and cost-effective solution for financial needs, making them a preferred choice for many Indians.\n\nWith the backing of regulatory frameworks ensuring fair practices, gold loans continue to be a vital financial instrument in the Indian economy.\n\nTable of Contents\n\nWhy are gold loans popular in India?\nRBI Guidelines for Gold Loans\nBenefits of Gold Loans\nIn the news\nConclusion\nWhy are gold loans popular in India?\n\nGold holds immense cultural and religious significance in India. It is considered a symbol of wealth, prosperity, and security. Families often invest in gold for occasions like weddings, and festivals, and as a hedge against financial uncertainties.\n\n\ud83d\udc49 Which year are YOU targeting for success in the IAS/IPS/IFS Exam? \ud83d\ude80\n\n(1) \u21d2 UPSC 2025: Prelims cum Mains\n\n(2) \u21d2 UPSC 2026: Prelims cum Mains\n\n(3) \u21d2 UPSC 2027 Prelims cum Mains\n\nTip: Know more about ClearIAS Courses (Online/Offline)\n\nIndian households hold significant amounts of gold, often in the form of jewellery. This widespread ownership makes gold a readily available asset that can be used as collateral for loans.\n\nEconomic Factors\n\nEase of Access: Gold loans are easily accessible to a large segment of the population, including those who may not have access to formal banking services or have poor credit histories. This accessibility is crucial in a country where many people still operate outside the formal banking system.\nQuick Processing: The processing time for gold loans is generally very short. Borrowers can often receive the loan amount within a few hours, making it an ideal option for urgent financial needs.\nLow Interest Rates: Compared to unsecured loans, gold loans typically come with lower interest rates because they are secured by a valuable asset. This makes them an attractive option for borrowers looking for cost-effective credit.\nMinimal Documentation: Gold loans require minimal documentation compared to other types of loans. This simplicity in the application process makes it easier for people to avail themselves of these loans without the hassle of extensive paperwork.\nFlexible Repayment Options: Lenders offer flexible repayment options for gold loans, including bullet repayments, monthly instalments, and interest-only payments. This flexibility caters to different financial situations and preferences.\nNo Impact on Credit Score: Since gold loans are secured, lenders do not place significant emphasis on the borrower\u2019s credit score. This allows individuals with low or no credit history to access funds without affecting their creditworthiness.\nRisk Mitigation for Lenders: For lenders, gold loans are relatively low-risk because the loan is backed by a tangible and liquid asset. This security enables lenders to offer competitive interest rates and favourable terms.\nAsset Utilization: Gold loans allow individuals to leverage their idle gold assets without having to sell them. This means they can meet their financial needs while retaining ownership of their gold, which can be redeemed once the loan is repaid.\n\nGold loans are offered by a wide range of financial institutions, including banks, Non-Banking Financial Companies (NBFCs), and dedicated gold loan companies. This widespread availability ensures that people across various regions and income groups can access these loans.\n\nRBI Guidelines for Gold Loans\nLoan-to-Value (LTV) Ratio: The RBI has set a maximum LTV ratio for gold loans at 75%. This means that borrowers can get a loan amount up to 75% of the market value of the pledged gold.\nKYC and Documentation:\nLenders must follow strict Know Your Customer (KYC) norms. Borrowers are required to provide identity proof (such as an Aadhaar card, PAN card, or passport) and address proof (such as utility bills or rental agreements).\nProper documentation, including a loan agreement detailing the terms and conditions, must be provided to the borrower.\nInterest Rates and Charges:\nInterest rates on gold loans can vary among lenders but must be communicated to the borrower at the time of loan sanction.\nAdditional charges, such as processing fees, valuation fees, and prepayment penalties, should be transparent and agreed upon by both parties.\nValuation of Gold:\nThe valuation of the pledged gold must be done by certified and authorized valuers to ensure fair pricing.\nLenders must follow RBI-approved methods for gold valuation, typically based on the prevailing market rates of gold.\nStorage and Security:\nLenders are responsible for the safe custody of the pledged gold. The storage facilities must be secure and insured against theft, fire, and other risks.\nBorrowers must be informed about the storage conditions and insurance coverage.\nRepayment Terms:\nThe repayment schedule, including the tenure, EMI amounts, and interest rates, must be clearly defined in the loan agreement.\nBorrowers should have the option to prepay the loan, and any associated charges should be disclosed upfront.\nAuction of Gold:\nIf a borrower defaults on the loan, lenders have the right to auction the pledged gold to recover the outstanding amount.\nHowever, lenders must provide prior notice to the borrower before initiating the auction process. The auction must be conducted transparently, and any surplus amount after settling the loan and associated costs should be refunded to the borrower.\nLoan Tenure: Gold loans typically have shorter tenures ranging from a few months to a few years. The specific tenure should be agreed upon between the borrower and the lender.\nNBFCs and Banks: Both banks and Non-Banking Financial Companies (NBFCs) can offer gold loans. However, NBFCs dealing primarily in gold loans must follow additional RBI guidelines specific to NBFC operations.\nBenefits of Gold Loans\nQuick Processing: Gold loans are processed quickly, often within a few hours, due to the secured nature of the loan and the readily available collateral.\nLower Interest Rates: Compared to unsecured loans, gold loans generally have lower interest rates because they are backed by a valuable asset.\nFlexible Repayment Options: Borrowers can choose from various repayment options, including bullet repayment (interest paid periodically, principal at the end), EMI options, or paying interest upfront.\nNo Credit Score Requirement: Since gold loans are secured, lenders do not place significant emphasis on the borrower\u2019s credit score, making them accessible to individuals with low or no credit history.\nIn the news\n\n2024: The Reserve Bank of India (RBI) has asked gold loan lenders to stick to regulatory norms while lending in a bid to tighten its grip over Non-Banking Financial Companies (NBFCs).\n\nThe RBI has increased its scrutiny of NBFCs after it found certain NBFCs to be flouting regulatory norms.\nIn March 2024, the RBI banned IIFL Finance from issuing fresh gold loans after the firm was found violating lending norms.\nThe RBI stipulates lenders to comply with certain norms while lending money instead of gold.\nFor instance, lenders are not allowed to lend any amount of money that is greater than 75% of the value of the gold that is submitted as collateral by the borrower.\nThis is to ensure that banks have sufficient cushion to absorb any losses by selling the gold in case the borrower defaults on the loan.\nConclusion\n\nGold loans in India are governed by comprehensive RBI regulations to ensure transparency, fairness, and security for both lenders and borrowers.\n\nThese rules help in maintaining a standardized approach to gold loan processing, valuation, and repayment, thus protecting the interests of all parties involved.\n\nBorrowers considering a gold loan should be aware of these regulations and ensure they deal with reputable lenders who comply with RBI guidelines.\n\nRelated articles:\n\nGold monetization scheme\nDifferentiated banks\nGems and Jewellery Industry in India\n\n-Article by Swathi Satish"

            "[META]": "Last updated on May 31, 2024 by ClearIAS Team",
            "[CONTENT]": "Speciation is the evolutionary process by which populations evolve to become distinct species. It occurs when groups within a species become reproductively isolated and diverge genetically over time. This can result in the formation of new species with distinct characteristics that prevent interbreeding with the original population. Read here to learn more.\n\nSpeciation is how a new kind of plant or animal species is created. It occurs when a group within a species separates from other members of its species and develops its unique characteristics.\n\nThe demands of a different environment or the characteristics of the members of the new group will differentiate the new species from their ancestors.\n\nTable of Contents\n\nSpeciation\nTypes of Speciation\nSignificance of Speciation\nWhy in the news?\nConclusion\nSpeciation\n\nAn example of speciation is the Gal\u00e1pagos finch. Different species of these birds live on different islands in the Gal\u00e1pagos archipelago, located in the Pacific Ocean off South America.\n\nThe finches are isolated from one another by the ocean. Over millions of years, each species of finch developed a unique beak that is specially adapted to the kinds of food it eats.\nSome finches have large, blunt beaks that can crack the hard shells of nuts and seeds.\nOther finches have long, thin beaks that can probe into cactus flowers without the bird being poked by the cactus spines.\nStill, other finches have medium-sized beaks that can catch and grasp insects.\nBecause they are isolated, the birds don\u2019t breed with one another and have therefore developed into unique species with unique characteristics. This is called allopatric speciation.\nTypes of Speciation\n\nThere are five types: allopatric, peripatric, parapatric, sympatric and artificial.\n\n\ud83d\udc49 Which year are YOU targeting for success in the IAS/IPS/IFS Exam? \ud83d\ude80\n\n(1) \u21d2 UPSC 2025: Prelims cum Mains\n\n(2) \u21d2 UPSC 2026: Prelims cum Mains\n\n(3) \u21d2 UPSC 2027 Prelims cum Mains\n\nTip: Know more about ClearIAS Courses (Online/Offline)\n\nAllopatric:\nIt occurs when populations are geographically separated, preventing gene flow between them.\nProcess: Physical barriers such as mountains, rivers, or distances isolate populations. Over time, genetic drift, mutation, and natural selection cause the populations to diverge.\nExample: The formation of different species of Darwin\u2019s finches on the Gal\u00e1pagos Islands.\nSympatric:\nIt occurs without geographic isolation; populations diverge while living in the same area.\nProcess: This can be driven by factors such as ecological niche differentiation, behavioural isolation, or polyploidy in plants (an increase in the number of chromosome sets).\nExample: Cichlid fish in African lakes diversify based on different feeding strategies and habitats within the same lake.\nParapatric:\nIt occurs when populations are adjacent to each other, with limited interbreeding along a boundary zone.\nProcess: Gradual divergence occurs due to varying environmental conditions or selective pressures along the gradient. Hybrids in the overlap zone may be less fit, reinforcing isolation.\nExample: Grass species that adapt to different soil types along a contamination gradient near mines.\nPeripatric:\nA subtype of allopatric speciation where a small population at the edge of a larger one becomes isolated.\nProcess: The small, isolated population undergoes rapid genetic changes due to genetic drift and founder effects, leading to divergence from the main population.\nExample: The formation of new species on isolated islands from mainland populations.\nArtificial:\nIt is the creation of new species by people. This is achieved through lab experiments, where scientists mostly research insects like fruit flies.\nSignificance of Speciation\nBiodiversity: It is the fundamental process that generates biodiversity. The formation of new species increases the variety of life forms and contributes to the complexity of ecosystems.\nEvolutionary Adaptation: Through speciation, populations can adapt to new and changing environments. This evolutionary flexibility allows life to thrive in diverse habitats and under varying environmental conditions.\nEcological Niches: The emergence of new species often leads to the occupation of different ecological niches, promoting resource partitioning and reducing competition among species.\nConservation Biology: Understanding speciation helps in conservation efforts by identifying evolutionarily significant units (ESUs) that need protection. This ensures the preservation of genetic diversity and the potential for future speciation events.\nHuman Impacts: Human activities, such as habitat fragmentation and climate change, can influence speciation processes. Studying speciation helps predict and mitigate the impacts of these activities on biodiversity.\nScientific Research: Speciation is a central concept in evolutionary biology and helps scientists understand the mechanisms of evolution, the history of life on Earth, and the relationships among species.\nWhy in the news?\n\nResearchers at IIT Bombay discovered the role of environmental resources, genes and mating in species in the development of new species in the same area, challenging the traditional view that new species can develop only in distinct geographies.\n\nTraditionally, it is believed that speciation largely occurs when populations of a species are isolated from each other by geographical barriers such as mountains or bodies of water. This is called allopatric speciation.\nHowever, the new IIT Bombay research suggests that speciation can happen even when populations live in the same area without geographical barriers. This mode of speciation is called sympatric speciation.\nConclusion\n\nSpeciation is a crucial evolutionary process that leads to the formation of new species, contributing to the richness and diversity of life on Earth.\n\nUnderstanding the mechanisms and significance of speciation helps in appreciating the dynamic nature of biodiversity, guiding conservation efforts, and providing insights into evolutionary processes\n\nRelated articles:\n\nEcology and environment- important terminologies\nMass extinctions\n\n-Article by Swathi Satish"

No offspring are produced when they mate with wild females, reducing the population over time.\nExample: The RIDL (Release of Insects carrying a Dominant Lethal) technique used by Oxitec, which produces males that carry a self-limiting gene causing offspring to die before reaching maturity.\nGene Drive Systems:\nThis involves inserting genes that spread throughout the mosquito population, either reducing their ability to reproduce or making them resistant to pathogens.\nExample: The use of CRISPR-Cas9 technology to create gene drives that spread anti-malarial genes through Anopheles mosquito populations.\nPathogen Resistance:\nMosquitoes are genetically engineered to be resistant to the pathogens they transmit, thus breaking the cycle of transmission.\nExample: Engineering mosquitoes to carry symbiotic bacteria or fungi that inhibit the development of malaria parasites.\nBenefits of Genetically Modified Mosquitoes\n\nDisease Control:\n\nPotential to significantly reduce the incidence of mosquito-borne diseases, which cause millions of deaths and illnesses annually.\nDirectly targets the vectors of disease, which can be more efficient than treating diseases after they occur.\n\nEnvironmental Impact:\n\nThis could decrease the reliance on chemical insecticides, which can have harmful environmental effects and lead to resistance in mosquito populations.\nGenerally targets specific mosquito species without affecting other insects or wildlife.\n\nCost-Effective:\n\nOnce established, GM mosquito populations can provide a sustainable method of disease control, potentially reducing the costs associated with medical treatments and vector control programs.\nChallenges and Concerns\n\nEcological Impact:\n\nPotential effects on ecosystems if mosquito populations are significantly reduced or altered. Mosquitoes serve as food for other wildlife, and their reduction could impact those species.\nThe removal or reduction of certain mosquito species might disrupt local biodiversity.\n\nEthical and Social Issues:\n\nConcerns about releasing GM organisms into the wild and the potential long-term effects. Public education and engagement are crucial.\nStringent regulatory frameworks are required to ensure safety and efficacy, which can delay implementation.\n\nTechnical Challenges:\n\nEvolutionary resistance to gene drives can develop, potentially reducing the long-term effectiveness of the technique.\nEnsuring that GM mosquitoes do not spread beyond targeted areas can be challenging.\nWhy in the news?\n\n2024: Djibouti released GM mosquitoes to fight malaria.\n\nThe method targets female mosquitoes, which are predominantly responsible for malaria transmission.\nBy reducing the female mosquito population, scientists hope to significantly decrease the spread of the disease.\nMale mosquitoes do not bite and therefore cannot transmit malaria.\nThe release is part of the \u2018Djibouti Friendly Mosquito Programme\u2019 started two years ago to stop the spread of\u00a0Anopheles stephensi, an invasive species of mosquito.\nIt is a part of a pilot project by Oxitec Ltd, Djibouti government and Association Mutualis, a non-governmental organisation.\nIn 2012, when Anopheles Stephensi was first detected in Africa, Djibouti reported 27 cases of malaria. By 2020, the country\u2019s malaria caseload had crossed 73,000.\nThis highly invasive mosquito had migrated to Africa from South Asia and the Arabian Peninsula.\nAnopheles stephensi is well adapted to the urban environment which is particularly dangerous for Djibouti, where 70 per cent of the population lives in the capital city and is exposed to the malaria vector.\nThis is the first time a genetically engineered mosquito has been released in East Africa and the second time on the African continent.\nBurkina Faso in West Africa conducted the first-ever release of genetically modified mosquitoes in Africa in the village of Bana.\nExamples of GM Mosquito Projects\nOxitec\u2019s Aedes aegypti:\nProject: Release of genetically engineered Aedes aegypti mosquitoes in Brazil, the Cayman Islands, and other locations to combat dengue fever.\nOutcome: Field trials showed significant reductions in local mosquito populations.\nTarget Malaria:\nProject: Research consortium aiming to reduce malaria transmission in sub-Saharan Africa using gene drive technology.\nOutcome: Ongoing research with promising laboratory results.\nWolbachia-Infected Mosquitoes:\nProject: Introduction of Wolbachia bacteria into Aedes mosquitoes to prevent them from transmitting viruses.\nOutcome: Successful trials in several countries, led to reductions in dengue transmission.\nConclusion\n\nGenetically modified mosquitoes represent a promising frontier in the fight against mosquito-borne diseases.\n\nWhile they offer significant potential benefits in terms of disease control and environmental impact, careful consideration of ecological, ethical, and technical challenges is essential.\n\nOngoing research, robust regulatory frameworks, and public engagement will be crucial to the successful and responsible deployment of this technology.\n\nRelated articles:\n\nGenetically modified crops and regulations in India\nSynthetic biology\nRecombinant DNA technology\nGM Rubber\n\n-Article by Swathi Satish"

            "[CONTENT]": "Minilateralism, a form of diplomacy involving a small number of countries focusing on specific issues or interests, is increasingly shaping global diplomatic dynamics. Here\u2019s an analysis of how minilateralism is changing the dynamics of diplomacy.\n\nThis approach contrasts with multilateralism, which involves large, often global groups of nations, and bilateralism, which involves direct relations between two countries.\n\nMinilateralism offers several advantages and is reshaping how countries engage with one another on various issues.\n\nThe idea of minilaterals is not new: bilateralism, multilateralism and minilateralism have co-existed in global governance since 1945.\n\nTable of Contents\n\nMinilateralism\nCharacteristics of Minilateralism\nAdvantages of Minilateralism\nDisadvantages\nImpact on Global Diplomacy\nExamples of Minilateralism\nWhy in the news?\nConclusion\nMinilateralism\n\nInternational collaboration and global governance have strengthened as a result of the multilateral frameworks created after World War II.\n\nBut throughout the years, obstacles to decision-making, institutional inertia, and entrenched interests have hindered these global venues\u2019 capacity to act collectively.\n\n\ud83d\udc49 Which year are YOU targeting for success in the IAS/IPS/IFS Exam? \ud83d\ude80\n\n(1) \u21d2 UPSC 2025: Prelims cum Mains\n\n(2) \u21d2 UPSC 2026: Prelims cum Mains\n\n(3) \u21d2 UPSC 2027 Prelims cum Mains\n\nTip: Know more about ClearIAS Courses (Online/Offline)\n\nAs a result, minilaterals are now viewed as a different path for forming alliances and coalitions \u201cof the willing\u201d to address challenges of regional and international importance.\n\nThe rise of minilaterals is associated with stagnation in reforms, and the perceived failure of multilateral organisations to achieve global cooperation on the most pertinent issues facing the international community.\n\nThe frustration with multilateralism has emerged as these forums largely failed to fulfil the objectives they set out to achieve, be it the maintenance of international peace and security through the United Nations (UN), or the next round of trade negotiations within the World Trade Organization (WTO).\nThe COVID-19 pandemic has also highlighted the weaknesses of multilateralism; countries largely chose to go it alone or with preferred partners, rather than use multilateral platforms for coordinating efforts to respond to the pandemic\nCharacteristics of Minilateralism\n\nThe growth of minilaterals is thus often viewed as a solution to address the inefficiency of multilaterals.\n\nWhile minilaterals cannot replace multilaterals to achieve global cooperation, they can supplement the work of multilateral organisations by providing a platform for diplomacy, confidence-building, and cooperation.\nThis lies in the simplicity and ease that minilaterals are associated with, as opposed to the complex, long-drawn negotiations required in multilateral frameworks.\nMinilaterals involve a limited number of countries, typically less than ten, which allows for more focused and flexible discussions.\nIssue-Specific Focus: Targets specific areas of common interest, such as trade, security, climate change, or technological innovation.\nInformal Structures: Often operates through informal or semi-formal mechanisms, rather than the rigid structures of traditional multilateral institutions.\nAdvantages of Minilateralism\nRapid Decision-Making: Smaller groups can make decisions more quickly and adapt more readily to changing circumstances.\nFocused Agendas: Allows for in-depth discussions and targeted solutions on specific issues, avoiding the broad and often diluted agendas of larger groups.\nCommon Interests: Bring together countries with shared interests and priorities, fostering more effective cooperation and stronger commitments.\nTrust Building: Easier to build trust and mutual understanding in smaller, more manageable groups.\nExperimentation: Provides a platform for innovative approaches and pilot projects that can later be scaled up or shared with broader groups.\nTailored Agreements: Enables the creation of tailored agreements that suit the specific needs and capabilities of the member countries.\nAdaptability: Can evolve more easily to include new issues or members as circumstances change.\nComplementarity: Can complement broader multilateral efforts, addressing gaps or providing momentum for stalled negotiations in larger forums.\nDisadvantages\nForum shopping: Minilateralism, however, also carries the risk of diminishing responsibility in global governance, weakening important international bodies, and engaging in forum shopping.\nNon-binding goals: Rather than encouraging legally enforceable goal commitments, minilaterals encourage voluntary and non-binding ones.\nAn easier way for nations: Minilateral agreements are a desirable substitute for multilateral agreements for nations who are progressively demonstrating a preference for \u201csoft law\u201d arrangements that are simpler to establish.\nCompliance issues: But this also raises questions of responsibility and compliance, which can work against the goals of international collaboration and global governance.\nIneffective on state policy: The voluntary, non-binding and consensus-based nature of minilaterals may be less effective in shaping state policy, interests and behaviour.\nUndermining international organizations: Preference for minilaterals may also undermine the efficiency and legitimacy of international organisations. This will reduce the incentive for countries to engage with multilateral frameworks.\nImpact of bilateral relations: In 1999, the Trilateral Cooperation and Oversight Group (TCOG) was established between the US, Japan and South Korea in response to North Korea\u2019s intensifying nuclear programme. However, the minilateral floundered due to the historically strained ties between South Korea and Japan.\nLeadership changes: Change in political leadership may also influence the foreign policy priorities of a country, which may in turn affect a member\u2019s willingness to participate in a minilateral. An example is the failure of Quad 1.0.\nImpact on Global Diplomacy\n\nShift from Multilateralism:\n\nErosion of Large Institutions: Growing frustration with the inefficiency and slow pace of traditional multilateral institutions like the United Nations or the World Trade Organization has led to a shift towards more nimble minilateral formats.\nSelective Engagement: Countries are increasingly selective in their diplomatic engagements, choosing to focus their efforts where they see the most potential for concrete outcomes.\n\nRegional Focus:\n\nRegional Cooperation: Minilateralism often emphasizes regional issues and cooperation, leading to the formation of regional groups such as the Quadrilateral Security Dialogue (Quad) involving the US, Japan, India, and Australia, which focuses on security issues in the Indo-Pacific region.\n\nSectoral Initiatives:\n\nSpecific Sectors: Minilateral initiatives often focus on specific sectors, such as climate change (e.g., the Climate Vulnerable Forum), technology (e.g., the D10 group of democracies focusing on digital and technological governance), or trade (e.g., the Comprehensive and Progressive Agreement for Trans-Pacific Partnership).\n\nEnhanced Bilateral Relationships:\n\nStrengthening Ties: By working closely in minilateral settings, countries can strengthen their bilateral relationships, creating a network of strong ties that can be leveraged in broader diplomatic efforts.\n\nPower Dynamics:\n\nInfluence of Middle Powers: Minilateralism allows middle powers to exert greater influence on specific issues, which might be diluted in larger multilateral settings dominated by great powers.\nBalancing Power: Smaller groups can balance the influence of major powers, ensuring that their voices and interests are represented.\nExamples of Minilateralism\nQuad (Quadrilateral Security Dialogue):\u00a0Involving the US, Japan, India, and Australia, focusing on security and strategic issues in the Indo-Pacific region.\nAUKUS:\u00a0A trilateral security pact between Australia, the United Kingdom, and the United States, focusing on military and technological cooperation.\nMekong-Ganga Cooperation:\u00a0An initiative involving India and several Southeast Asian countries focusing on cultural and economic cooperation in the Mekong region.\nClimate Vulnerable Forum:\u00a0A partnership of countries highly vulnerable to climate change, working together to address climate issues and advocate for stronger global action.\nWhy in the news?\n\nAmid escalating tensions in the South China Sea and growing concerns over Taiwan, the US is actively bolstering its regional defence strategy to counter China\u2019s increasing threats and ambitions in the Indo-Pacific.\n\nThis initiative has led to the formation of a new strategic alliance dubbed the \u201cSquad,\u201d consisting of the United States, Japan, Australia, and the Philippines.\nConclusion\n\nMinilateralism is reshaping the landscape of international diplomacy by providing a flexible, efficient, and focused approach to addressing global issues.\n\nIt enables countries to form strategic alliances based on common interests, facilitating more effective and timely responses to emerging challenges.\n\nAs global dynamics continue to evolve, minilateralism is likely to play an increasingly prominent role in the diplomatic strategies of nations, complementing traditional multilateral efforts and providing a valuable tool for addressing the complex issues of the 21st century.\n\nRead:\u00a0Bilateral, regional and global groupings and agreements involving India and/or affecting India\u2019s interests\n\n-Article by Swathi Satish"

            "[CONTENT]": "India\u2019s trade deficit is a complex issue influenced by various factors, including global market conditions, domestic economic policies, and consumer behaviour. Read here to learn more.\n\nA nation\u2019s trade deficit occurs when the value of its imports of goods and services exceeds the value of its exports over a specific period.\n\nIn other words, a country experiences a trade deficit when it buys more from other countries than it sells to them. This is also referred to as a negative balance of trade.\n\nWhile a trade deficit can pose challenges, strategic measures to boost exports, reduce import dependence, and diversify the economy can help manage and mitigate its impacts.\n\nContinuous monitoring and adaptive economic policies are crucial to maintaining a healthy balance of trade and ensuring sustainable economic growth.\n\nTable of Contents\n\nIndia\u2019s trade deficit\nMajor Contributors to India\u2019s Trade Deficit\nCauses of India\u2019s Trade Deficit\nKey Points about Trade Deficits\nImplications of trade deficit\nConclusion\nIndia\u2019s trade deficit\n\nAccording to official data, India has recorded a trade deficit, the difference between imports and exports, with nine of its top 10 trading partners, including China, Russia, Singapore, and Korea, in 2023-24.\n\n\ud83d\udc49 Which year are YOU targeting for success in the IAS/IPS/IFS Exam? \ud83d\ude80\n\n(1) \u21d2 UPSC 2025: Prelims cum Mains\n\n(2) \u21d2 UPSC 2026: Prelims cum Mains\n\n(3) \u21d2 UPSC 2027 Prelims cum Mains\n\nTip: Know more about ClearIAS Courses (Online/Offline)\n\nThe data also showed that the deficit with China, Russia, Korea, and Hong Kong increased in the last fiscal compared to 2022-23, while the trade gap with the UAE, Saudi Arabia, Russia, Indonesia, and Iraq narrowed.\nChina has emerged as India\u2019s largest trading partner with $118.4 billion of two-way commerce in 2023-24, edging past the U.S.\nIndia has a free trade agreement with four top trading partners \u2014 Singapore, the UAE, Korea and Indonesia (as part of the Asian bloc).\nFor the fiscal year 2022-23, India\u2019s trade deficit was around $270 billion, a substantial increase from previous years. This was driven by a surge in imports, particularly crude oil and gold, and relatively stagnant export growth.\nMajor Contributors to India\u2019s Trade Deficit\n\nCrude Oil and Petroleum Products:\n\nDependence on Imports: India heavily depends on imported crude oil to meet its energy needs, accounting for a significant portion of its total import bill.\nPrice Volatility: Global oil price fluctuations can dramatically affect the trade deficit.\n\nGold:\n\nCultural and Economic Factors: Gold is a major import due to its cultural significance and use as an investment, leading to substantial import expenditure.\nInvestment Demand: High demand for gold as a hedge against inflation and currency depreciation increases imports.\n\nElectronics and Machinery:\n\nTechnological Needs: India imports a large quantity of electronic goods and machinery to support its growing technology and manufacturing sectors.\nConsumer Demand: Rising middle-class incomes drive demand for imported consumer electronics.\n\nChemicals and Fertilizers:\n\nAgricultural Requirements: The agricultural sector\u2019s dependence on imported fertilizers contributes to the trade deficit.\nIndustrial Uses: Chemicals are essential for various industrial processes, leading to substantial imports.\nCauses of India\u2019s Trade Deficit\nHigh Import Dependence:\nEnergy Needs: Heavy reliance on imported crude oil and coal.\nConsumer Goods: Rising demand for imported consumer electronics, machinery, and luxury goods.\nExport Constraints:\nLimited Product Diversification: Dependence on a narrow range of export commodities.\nGlobal Market Access: Trade barriers and competition in global markets can limit export growth.\nEconomic Growth:\nHigh Domestic Consumption: Rapid economic growth and urbanization increase demand for imported goods.\nCurrency Valuation:\nRupee Depreciation: A weaker rupee can make imports more expensive, worsening the trade deficit.\nKey Points about Trade Deficits\nCalculation of Trade Deficit:\nFormula: Trade Deficit = Value of Imports \u2013 Value of Exports\nIf the result is positive, it indicates a trade surplus. If negative, it indicates a trade deficit.\nComponents of Trade:\nGoods: Physical products such as electronics, automobiles, and clothing.\nServices: Non-physical items such as banking, insurance, tourism, and software services.\nImpact on the Economy:\nShort-Term Benefits: Access to a variety of foreign goods and services, potential stimulation of domestic consumption, and maintaining lower prices for consumers.\nLong-Term Concerns: Potential devaluation of the nation\u2019s currency, increased national debt if financed by borrowing, and negative impact on domestic industries leading to job losses.\nFinancing Trade Deficits:\nTrade deficits are often financed by borrowing from foreign lenders or by foreign investments in domestic assets such as stocks, bonds, or real estate.\nCauses of Trade Deficits:\nEconomic Growth: A strong economy with high consumer demand often leads to higher imports.\nCurrency Value: An overvalued currency can make exports more expensive and imports cheaper.\nStructural Factors: Dependence on foreign goods, lack of competitive domestic industries, or trade policies.\nPolicy Responses:\nGovernments may implement tariffs, quotas, or other trade barriers to reduce imports.\nCurrency devaluation makes exports cheaper and imports more expensive.\nEncouraging domestic industries and production to reduce reliance on imports.\nImplications of trade deficit\n\nTrade deficits, where a country\u2019s imports exceed its exports, can have significant implications for a nation\u2019s economy. Here are some key implications of having a trade deficit:\n\nImpact on Currency Value\n\nDepreciation: Persistent trade deficits can lead to the depreciation of the country\u2019s currency. This occurs because the demand for foreign currencies increases to pay for imports, while the demand for domestic currency decreases.\nExchange Rate Volatility: Increased volatility in exchange rates can result from the ongoing imbalance between exports and imports, making the currency less stable.\n\nForeign Debt Accumulation\n\nBorrowing: To finance a trade deficit, a country might need to borrow from foreign lenders, leading to an accumulation of foreign debt.\nInterest Payments: Servicing this debt can become burdensome, especially if the country\u2019s currency depreciates, increasing the cost of debt repayments.\n\nImpact on Domestic Industries\n\nCompetition: Increased imports can put pressure on domestic industries by exposing them to greater foreign competition. This can lead to the decline of industries that are unable to compete on price or quality.\nJob Losses: If domestic industries shrink due to competition from imports, it can lead to job losses in those sectors, impacting employment levels.\n\nEffect on Economic Growth\n\nGrowth Impact: While trade deficits can indicate a strong consumer demand and can be sustainable if they fund productive investments, chronic deficits may suggest underlying structural economic issues, potentially slowing long-term economic growth.\nConsumption vs. Investment: If a trade deficit results from high consumption rather than investment in productive capacity, it may not contribute to sustainable economic growth.\n\nForeign Investment\n\nAttraction of Capital: A trade deficit can attract foreign investment to balance the deficit. While this can be beneficial in the short term, reliance on foreign investment can make the economy vulnerable to external shocks and investor sentiment changes.\nOwnership Concerns: Increased foreign ownership of domestic assets can raise concerns about national control over key industries and resources.\n\nInflationary Pressures\n\nImported Inflation: A depreciating currency can make imports more expensive, leading to imported inflation. This can increase the cost of living and reduce the purchasing power of consumers.\nWage Pressures: As prices for imported goods rise, domestic wage pressures might increase as workers seek higher pay to maintain their standard of living.\n\nPolicy Responses\n\nMonetary Policy: Central banks might adjust interest rates to influence the trade balance. For example, raising interest rates could strengthen the currency and make imports cheaper, but it could also slow down economic growth.\nFiscal Policy: Governments might implement policies to boost exports and reduce imports, such as subsidies for domestic industries, tariffs on imports, or trade agreements to open new markets for exports.\n\nDependence on Foreign Economies\n\nEconomic Vulnerability: A country with a significant trade deficit may become dependent on the economic health of its trading partners. Economic downturns in key supplier or buyer countries can disproportionately affect the deficit country.\nPolitical and Economic Leverage: Countries that finance the trade deficit through borrowing from foreign nations may find themselves subject to political and economic pressures from their creditors.\n\nBalance of Payments Issues\n\nCurrent Account Deficit: A trade deficit contributes to a current account deficit, which can signal imbalances in the economy that need to be corrected to ensure long-term sustainability.\nCapital Account Adjustments: To offset a current account deficit, a country must attract capital inflows, such as foreign direct investment (FDI) or portfolio investment, which can have varying degrees of stability and risk.\nConclusion\n\nWhile trade deficits are not inherently negative and can be sustainable under certain conditions (such as when financed by foreign investment in productive assets), persistent and large deficits can indicate underlying economic issues and lead to significant economic and policy challenges.\n\nManaging a trade deficit effectively requires a balanced approach that promotes economic growth, supports domestic industries, and ensures financial stability.\n\nRelated articles:\n\nForeign trade in India\nPrimary deficit\nDepreciation of Indian rupee\n\n-Article by Swathi Satish"

It is based on scientific criteria for performing evidence-based analyses of the risk of ecosystem collapse, including changes in geographical distribution and the degradation of the key elements of ecosystems.\n\nKey Features and Objectives:\n\nAssessment Criteria:\nThe RLE uses specific criteria to assess ecosystems, similar to the Red List of Threatened Species. These criteria are based on:\nThe decline in distribution.\nDegradation of the abiotic environment.\nDisruption of biotic processes and interactions.\nQuantitative estimates of the risk of ecosystem collapse.\nCategories of Risk:\nThe RLE categorizes ecosystems into different levels of risk:\nCollapsed (CO): The ecosystem has undergone a complete loss of its defining features.\nCritically Endangered (CR): Extremely high risk of collapse.\nEndangered (EN): Very high risk of collapse.\nVulnerable (VU): High risk of collapse.\nNear Threatened (NT): Close to qualifying for a threatened category.\nLeast Concern (LC): No immediate risk of collapse.\nData Deficient (DD): Inadequate information to assess the risk of collapse.\nGlobal and Regional Assessments:\nThe RLE can be applied at both global and regional scales, allowing for detailed and context-specific conservation strategies.\nEcosystem Services:\nBy assessing ecosystems, the RLE also indirectly evaluates the services they provide, such as water purification, climate regulation, and biodiversity support. This emphasizes the importance of ecosystems not only for biodiversity but also for human well-being.\nScientific and Policy Tool:\nThe RLE serves as a critical tool for scientists, conservationists, policymakers, and land managers. It helps prioritize actions, allocate resources efficiently, and develop policies to mitigate risks.\nImplementation and Impact\nGuidance for Conservation:\nThe RLE provides valuable insights into ecosystem health, guiding conservation actions and policy decisions to protect and restore ecosystems at risk of collapse.\nAwareness and Education:\nBy highlighting ecosystems at risk, the RLE raises awareness about the importance of ecosystems and the need for sustainable practices.\nIntegration with Other Conservation Efforts:\nThe RLE complements other conservation initiatives like the Red List of Threatened Species, facilitating a more holistic approach to biodiversity conservation.\nExamples of Ecosystems Assessed\nForests: Various types of forests, including tropical rainforests, temperate forests, and boreal forests, have been assessed for their risk levels.\nWetlands: These critical ecosystems, which provide water filtration and flood control, are evaluated for threats like drainage, pollution, and climate change.\nCoral Reefs: Vital for marine biodiversity, coral reefs face threats from warming oceans, acidification, and overfishing.\nGrasslands and Savannas: These ecosystems, important for their biodiversity and role in carbon sequestration, are assessed for threats from agricultural expansion and overgrazing.\nWhy in the news?\n\nFor the first time, an ecosystem group has been assessed entirely across the planet using the IUCN Red List of Ecosystems \u2013 a global standard for measuring the health of ecosystems.\n\n\ud83d\udc49 Which year are YOU targeting for success in the IAS/IPS/IFS Exam? \ud83d\ude80\n\n(1) \u21d2 UPSC 2025: Prelims cum Mains\n\n(2) \u21d2 UPSC 2026: Prelims cum Mains\n\n(3) \u21d2 UPSC 2027 Prelims cum Mains\n\nTip: Know more about ClearIAS Courses (Online/Offline)\n\nThe findings show that 50% of the mangrove ecosystems assessed are at risk of collapse (classed as either Vulnerable, Endangered or Critically Endangered).\nAccording to the assessment, nearly 20% (19.6%) of the assessed mangroves are at high risk, classed as either Endangered or Critically Endangered, reflecting these areas are at severe risk of collapse.\nMangroves are threatened by deforestation, development, pollution, and dam construction, but the risk to these ecosystems is increasing due to sea-level rise and the increased frequency of severe storms associated with climate change. Climate change threatens one-third (33%) of the mangrove ecosystems assessed.\nThis study classified the world\u2019s mangrove ecosystems into 36 different regions called provinces (delineated areas where mangroves exist indicated in the below map) and assessed the threats and risk of collapse in each region.\nIUCN Global Mangrove assessment\n\nAccording to the assessment, without significant changes by 2050, climate change and sea level rise will result in the loss of:\n\n1.8 billion tonnes of carbon stored (17% of the total current carbon stored in mangroves), currently valued at a minimum of $13 billion at market prices in voluntary carbon markets and representing a cost to society equal to $336 billion based on the social cost of carbon.\nprotection for 2.1 million lives exposed to coastal flooding (14.5% of current lives exposed) and $36 billion worth in protection to properties (35.7% of current property values protected)\n17 million days of fishing effort per year (14% of current fishing effort is supported by mangroves).\n\nThe assessment finds that maintaining mangrove ecosystems across the globe will be key for mitigating the impacts of climate change, with healthy mangroves able to better cope with sea level rise and offering inland protection from the impacts of hurricanes, typhoons and cyclones.\n\nPreserving existing mangrove forests, and restoring lost areas, for example, will increase their resilience.\nMaintaining sediment flows, and allowing space for mangroves to expand inland, helps mangroves cope with sea level rise\nIUCN lists Tamil Nadu mangroves \u2018critically endangered\u2019\n\nMangroves along the South India Coasts, especially the east coast covering Tamil Nadu, are critically endangered, according to The IUCN\u2019s first global mangrove assessment.\n\nAccording to the study, the mangrove ecosystems are spread across 36 regions in 44 countries with critically endangered ecosystems in South India, Sri Lanka, Maldives, and the North Atlantic (part of North America).\nOn the other hand, West India (covering the west coast) and Pakistan region have been categorised as vulnerable and the Bay of Bengal region, which comprises West Bengal and Bangladesh, has been categorised as least concern.\nConclusion\n\nThe IUCN Red List of Ecosystems is a vital tool in global conservation efforts, offering a standardized approach to identifying and mitigating risks to ecosystems.\n\nBy doing so, it plays a crucial role in safeguarding biodiversity and ensuring the sustainability of the planet\u2019s natural resources for future generations.\n\nMangrove ecosystems are exceptional in their ability to provide essential services to people, including coastal disaster risk reduction, carbon storage and sequestration, and support for fisheries.\n\nTheir loss stands to be disastrous for nature and people across the globe. That is why this assessment is so important.\n\nThe Red List of Ecosystems provides clear pathways on how we can reverse mangrove loss and protect these delicate ecosystems for the future, helping, in turn, to safeguard biodiversity, tackle the effects of climate change and support the realisation of the Global Biodiversity Framework\n\nRelated articles\n\nIUCN classification\nKunming declaration\nCoP 15 of the Convention on Biological Diversity\n\n-Article by Swathi Satish"

It has become the Aralkum Desert, a significant new source of sand and dust storms.\nHealth Effects: Sand and dust storms pose serious health risks, particularly through respiratory problems and diseases like asthma, bronchitis, and silicosis. The fine dust particles can carry pathogens and pollutants, exacerbating their impact.\nEnvironmental Consequences: These storms can lead to soil loss and degradation, impact water quality by depositing sediments in water bodies, and affect the growth and productivity of crops.\nClimate Effects: Dust particles can influence climate patterns by affecting the earth\u2019s radiation balance. They can provide surfaces for chemical reactions to occur, influence cloud formation, and potentially impact precipitation patterns.\nEconomic Impacts: Dust storms can disrupt transportation, reduce crop yields, damage electronics and machinery, and increase the cost of cleaning and maintenance of infrastructure.\nManagement and Mitigation\nVegetation Management: Planting vegetation and creating green belts can significantly reduce soil erosion and dust storm occurrences.\nSustainable Agricultural Practices: Techniques such as no-till farming, cover cropping, and the use of windbreaks can help stabilize the soil.\nLand Restoration: Efforts to restore land with native plant species and to reclaim degraded lands are crucial.\nEarly Warning Systems: Developing and improving forecasting and early warning systems can help mitigate the impact of sand and dust storms by providing timely information.\nWhy in the news?\n\n2024: Delhi and Mumbai saw massive dust storms causing harm to life and property.\n\nIndian Meteorological Department warned of heavy rainfall, thunderstorms and lightning in the cities.\nNorthwest India experiences convective dust storms locally known as \u201caandhi\u201d.\nThe frequency is maximum over Rajasthan followed by Haryana, Punjab and Western Uttar Pradesh.\nSand and dust storms in the Indian Subcontinent\n\nIn the Indian subcontinent, these storms are primarily observed in the northwestern parts, particularly in the states of Rajasthan, Gujarat, Punjab, and Haryana. They are also prevalent in parts of Pakistan and Afghanistan.\n\nCauses of Sand and Dust Storms in the Indian Subcontinent:\n\nArid Conditions: The Thar Desert in Rajasthan, which is a primary source of dust, contributes significantly to the dust load in the atmosphere, especially during the pre-monsoon and monsoon months.\nLand Degradation: Overgrazing, deforestation, and unsustainable agricultural practices contribute to land degradation, increasing the vulnerability of the soil to erosion by wind.\nMeteorological Factors: The pre-monsoon period (April-June) often sees high temperatures and low humidity levels, which dry out the soil, making it more susceptible to wind erosion. The passage of western disturbances across the region and the intense heating of the land during the summer months can also create conditions conducive to dust storms.\nSeasonal Winds: The local wind dynamics, including the gusty winds during the pre-monsoon season, play a significant role in triggering these storms.\nConclusion\n\nInternational cooperation is also vital, as dust and sand storms often affect multiple countries and regions.\n\nCollaborative efforts in research, monitoring, and sharing of data are essential for developing effective strategies to prevent and manage these phenomena.\n\nThe UN recommends the strengthening of risk governance of sand and dust storms and increased investment and financing in sand and dust storm risk reduction and impact mitigation measures in agriculture along with developing national capacity and raising awareness of sand and dust storms.\n\nRelated articles:\n\nErosion and Deposition: Action of wind and waves\nSeasons in India\nHarmattan winds\n\n-Article by Swathi Satish"

What obstacles exist for putting these strategies into practice, particularly in developing nations like India? Which international efforts are some of them? Read here to learn more.\n\nCarbon is found in several minerals and all living things. It is essential to all life on Earth and is involved in many different activities, such as respiration, photosynthesis, and the carbon cycle.\n\nCultivating land, rearing cattle, and/or crops for food, fuel, fibre, and other resources is known as farming.\n\nIt includes a broad variety of tasks, such as managing animals, planting and harvesting crops, and upkeep of agricultural infrastructure.\n\nTable of Contents\n\nCarbon farming\nTechniques Used in Carbon Farming\nBenefits of Carbon Farming\nChallenges\nCarbon farming around the world\nHow can India use carbon farming?\nConclusion\nPrevious years questions\nCarbon farming\n\nCarbon farming is an agricultural method aimed at absorbing carbon dioxide from the atmosphere and storing it in the soil and vegetation.\n\nThis practice is part of a broader strategy known as carbon sequestration, which is critical for mitigating the impact of climate change.\nCarbon farming involves implementing agricultural techniques that maximize carbon uptake in soil, thus reducing greenhouse gas concentrations and enhancing soil health.\n\nThe practice of carbon farming integrates two fundamental ideas:\n\n\ud83d\udc49 Which year are YOU targeting for success in the IAS/IPS/IFS Exam? \ud83d\ude80\n\n(1) \u21d2 UPSC 2025: Prelims cum Mains\n\n(2) \u21d2 UPSC 2026: Prelims cum Mains\n\n(3) \u21d2 UPSC 2027 Prelims cum Mains\n\nTip: Know more about ClearIAS Courses (Online/Offline)\n\nmitigating climate change through increased carbon storage in agricultural landscapes decreased greenhouse gas emissions, and\nrestoring ecosystem health through the application of regenerative agricultural practices that improve fertility and soil health.\nTechniques Used in Carbon Farming\n\nSeveral techniques can be employed in carbon farming to increase soil carbon storage, including:\n\nCover Cropping: Planting cover crops like legumes, grasses, or greens in between regular crop cycles to cover the soil. Cover crops help improve soil structure, reduce erosion, and increase soil organic matter, which enhances carbon storage.\nReduced Tillage/No-Till Farming: Minimizing soil disturbance by reducing or eliminating tilling. Tilling can disrupt soil structure and release stored carbon into the atmosphere, whereas no-till practices help retain carbon in the soil.\nAgroforestry: Integrating trees and shrubs into agricultural landscapes. Trees are highly effective at capturing and storing carbon dioxide through photosynthesis and help improve the soil\u2019s carbon content.\nRotational Grazing: Rotating livestock through different pastures to allow for vegetation regrowth. This method promotes healthier grasslands, which can store more carbon.\nOrganic Amendments: Adding compost, manure, or biochar to the soil can increase soil organic carbon levels. These amendments enhance soil fertility and structure, leading to improved carbon sequestration.\nCrop Rotation: Changing the types of crops grown in a sequence to include deep-rooted plants that can sequester more carbon underground.\nBenefits of Carbon Farming\n\nClimate Change Mitigation: By sequestering carbon in soils and vegetation, carbon farming helps lower atmospheric CO2 levels, directly addressing climate change.\nSoil Health: Carbon-rich soils are generally more fertile and better able to retain water and nutrients, which can improve crop yields and reduce the need for chemical fertilizers.\nBiodiversity: Practices such as agroforestry and diversified cropping can increase the variety of habitats available on agricultural lands, supporting greater biodiversity.\nEconomic Benefits: Improved soil health can lead to higher yields and lower costs over time. Additionally, carbon farming can potentially generate income through carbon credits.\nChallenges\n\nWhile carbon farming holds great promise, there are challenges:\n\nMeasurement and Verification: Accurately measuring the amount of carbon sequestered and maintaining it over time can be complex and costly.\nInitial Investment: Transitioning to carbon farming practices often requires upfront investment, which can be a barrier for smallholders or economically disadvantaged farmers.\nPolicy and Market Support: Effective carbon farming often depends on supportive policies, market mechanisms for carbon credits, and technical assistance to be viable and sustainable.\nCarbon farming around the world\n\nSeveral countries and regions have developed carbon farming schemes to incentivize these practices among farmers and landowners. Here\u2019s an overview of some notable carbon farming initiatives around the globe:\n\nEuropean Union (EU)\n\nCommon Agricultural Policy (CAP): The EU has integrated climate action into its CAP, encouraging farmers to adopt practices that contribute to carbon sequestration, such as cover cropping and reduced tillage. The EU also funds research and development in carbon farming.\nCarbon Farming Initiative: Launched as part of the European Green Deal, this initiative focuses on creating a standard for carbon farming, integrating scientific knowledge, and establishing a certification process for carbon removals.\n\nUnited States\n\nUSDA Conservation Programs: The U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) offers various programs under the Farm Bill that support carbon farming, such as the Conservation Stewardship Program (CSP) and the Environmental Quality Incentives Program (EQIP). These programs provide financial and technical assistance to farmers adopting sustainable agricultural practices.\nCarbon Markets: Several private and state-level carbon markets exist, where farmers can earn carbon credits for practices that sequester carbon. These credits can then be sold to companies and organizations looking to offset their carbon emissions.\n\nAustralia\n\nEmissions Reduction Fund (ERF): This government initiative provides incentives for farmers and land managers to adopt practices that reduce greenhouse gas emissions and enhance carbon storage. Participants can earn carbon credits that can be sold on the carbon market.\n\nCanada\n\nAlberta\u2019s Carbon Offset System: Alberta was one of the first jurisdictions in North America to implement a carbon market that includes protocols for agricultural carbon offsets. Farmers can generate credits by changing tillage practices, managing nitrogen more effectively, or by conserving grasslands.\n\nNew Zealand\n\nPermanent Forest Sink Initiative: This initiative allows landowners to receive carbon credits for establishing permanent forests on marginal lands. It encourages the sequestration of carbon through reforestation and afforestation.\n\nChina\n\nGrain for Green Program: While not exclusively a carbon farming program, this large-scale ecological project encourages farmers to convert degraded cropland into forest or grassland, which indirectly contributes to carbon sequestration.\n\nGlobal Initiatives\n\n4 per 1000 Initiative: Launched during the COP21 in Paris, this global platform aims to increase soil organic matter and carbon sequestration through sustainable farming practices. The goal is to improve food security and combat climate change by increasing soil carbon stocks by 0.4% per year.\nHow can India use carbon farming?\n\nIndia, with its vast agricultural landscape and diverse climatic regions, holds significant potential for carbon farming.\n\nBy implementing carbon farming practices, India can not only contribute to global climate mitigation efforts but also improve soil health, enhance agricultural productivity, and increase farmer incomes.\n\nImproving Soil Health\nPractices such as cover cropping, reduced tillage, and crop rotation can significantly increase soil organic matter.\nThis not only sequesters carbon but also improves soil structure, fertility, and water retention, leading to more resilient agricultural systems.\nAgroforestry\nIntegrating trees into crop systems and pasturelands offers the dual benefit of enhancing carbon sequestration above and below the ground while providing additional income sources through timber, fruit, and other tree products.\nAgroforestry can be particularly effective in regions like the Western Ghats, the Northeast, and along the river basins of India.\nReforestation and Afforestation\nInitiatives to plant trees on non-arable land, degraded lands, or community forests can capture atmospheric carbon effectively.\nThis approach can be tied to national initiatives like the Green India Mission, which aims to increase forest cover and ecosystem services.\nBiomass Management\nProper management of agricultural residues and livestock manure through composting or conversion to biochar can turn waste into a resource that both enriches soil organic carbon and reduces methane emissions from decomposing biomass.\nImproved Grazing Practices\nControlled grazing systems can prevent overgrazing, encourage plant growth, and lead to more carbon being stored in the soil of pasturelands.\nThis is particularly relevant in areas like Rajasthan and Gujarat, where pastoralism is a key part of rural livelihoods.\nRice Cultivation Techniques\nImplementing alternative wetting and drying (AWD) in rice cultivation can reduce methane emissions and water usage while maintaining yield.\nThis practice has significant potential in major rice-growing states like West Bengal, Punjab, and Tamil Nadu.\nUse of Organic Fertilizers\nEncouraging the use of organic fertilizers over chemical ones can help enhance soil carbon content. Initiatives to promote the production and use of compost and other organic fertilizers can be critical.\nConclusion\n\nThe initiatives vary widely in scope and approach but commonly include financial incentives for carbon sequestration, technical support for adopting new practices, and frameworks for measuring and verifying carbon storage.\n\nAs climate change continues to be a critical global issue, the role of agriculture in carbon sequestration is likely to expand, prompting further development of carbon farming schemes across the world.\n\nOverall, carbon farming is a powerful tool in the arsenal against climate change, capable of transforming agricultural practices into part of the solution. By promoting such practices, there is potential not only to reduce the impact of agriculture on the environment but also to enhance its resilience to climate change.\n\nPrevious years questions\n\nQ.

Renters are being evicted by landlords in favour of turning properties into holiday lets, and house prices are escalating as a result.\nSkyrocketing prices, excessive queues, crowded beaches, exorbitant noise levels, damage at historical sites and the ramifications to nature, as people overwhelm or stray from official paths, are also negative impacts.\nFor visitors also, it can ruin the experience of sightseeing for those trapped in long queues, unable to visit museums, galleries and sites without booking, incurring escalating costs for basics like food, drink and hotels.\nThe UN World Tourism Organization (UNWTO) predicts that by 2030, the number of worldwide tourists, which peaked at 1.5 billion in 2019, will reach 1.8 billion, likely leading to greater pressure on already popular spots and more objection from locals.\nProtest against overtourism worldwide\n\nLike the residents of Hallsatt, many cities have gone up in protest against the overcrowding and lack of control by authorities worldwide.\n\nResidents in Venice fought long and hard for a ban on cruise ships, with protest flags often draped from windows.\nIn France, the Marseille Provence Cruise Club introduced a flow management system for cruise line passengers in 2020, easing congestion around the popular Notre-Dame-de-la-Garde Basilica.\nIn Orkney, Scotland, residents have been up in arms at the number of cruise ships docking on its shores.\n\nActions taken by cities:\n\nBarcelona increased its nightly levy in April 2023 \u2014 which was originally introduced in 2012 and varies depending on the type of accommodation.\nIn Amsterdam, the city council voted to ban cruise ships, while the mayor, commissioned a campaign of discouragement, asking young British men who planned to have a \u2018vacation from morals\u2019 to stay away.\nIn Rome, sitting at popular sites, such as the Trevi Fountain and the Spanish Steps, has been restricted by the authorities.\nAnd in Kenya\u2019s Maasai Mara, the Narok County governor has introduced on-the-spot fines for off-roading.\nStrategies to Overcome Overtourism\nTourism for SDGs\n\nCombating overtourism requires a mix of policy interventions, community involvement, and sustainable tourism practices:\n\nRegulating Visitor Numbers: Implementing a cap on the number of visitors allowed at sensitive sites each day can help manage the flow and impact of tourists. For example, limiting ticket sales for museums or historical sites.\nPromoting Off-Peak Tourism: Encouraging travel during off-peak seasons can help distribute visitor numbers more evenly throughout the year.\nDeveloping Alternative Attractions: Authorities and tourism boards can promote less-known sites to divert traffic away from over-visited areas. This approach also helps in the economic development of less popular areas.\nImproving Infrastructure: Enhancing transportation, waste management, and tourist facilities can help destinations cope better with high numbers of visitors.\nEncouraging Responsible Tourism: Educating tourists about the impact of their visits and promoting respectful behaviour towards local culture and environment can mitigate negative effects.\nLocal Regulations and Policies: Implementing policies that restrict or regulate accommodations through short-term rental platforms can reduce the pressure on local housing markets and infrastructure.\nCommunity Engagement: Involving local communities in tourism planning and decision-making ensures that the benefits of tourism are distributed fairly and that community needs are addressed.\nSustainable Tourism Certifications: Encouraging businesses to adopt sustainable practices and achieve certifications can help raise the overall standard of the tourism industry.\nTechnology and Data Usage: Using data analytics to monitor and predict tourist patterns can assist in making proactive adjustments to strategies dealing with tourist inflows.\nWhy in the news?\n\nOn April 25, 2024, Venice, a city in Italy, to control overtourism, introduced an entry fee for visitors who are coming in to visit the city.\n\nVenice introduced a novel program recently to levy a fee on day-trippers entering the historic Italian city, a pioneering move aimed at alleviating the pressure of mass tourism.\nDespite its status as one of the world\u2019s most loved cities, Venice is grappling with the overwhelming influx of visitors.\nWay forward\n\nDuring the Covid pandemic, tourism was one of the hardest-hit industries according to UNWTO, international tourist arrivals dropped 72% in 2020.\n\nHowever, traveller numbers have since been rapidly increasing, with double the number of people venturing abroad in the first three months of 2023 than in the same period in 2022.\n\nBy applying the strategies, destinations can manage their tourist populations more effectively, ensuring that tourism remains a positive force for the local economy and culture while minimizing environmental and social impacts.\n\nThis balanced approach is crucial for the long-term sustainability of tourism worldwide.\n\nRelated articles:\n\nEcotourism\nTourism sector\nCultural tourism in India\nSpace tourism\n\n-Article by Swathi Satish"

In that event, a poll is not necessary.\u201d\n\nSince Independence, this has happened on at least 35 occasions.\n\n\ud83d\udc49 Which year are YOU targeting for success in the IAS/IPS/IFS Exam? \ud83d\ude80\n\n(1) \u21d2 UPSC 2025: Prelims cum Mains\n\n(2) \u21d2 UPSC 2026: Prelims cum Mains\n\n(3) \u21d2 UPSC 2027 Prelims cum Mains\n\nTip: Know more about ClearIAS Courses (Online/Offline)\n\nIn 1951, during the very first general elections, five candidates were elected unopposed.\nSeven more candidates were elected unopposed to the Lok Sabha in 1951.\nThe last time a person was elected unopposed to the Lok Sabha was in Jammu and Kashmir\u2019s Srinagar back in 1989.\nWhen it comes to the bypolls, it happened when a candidate won unopposed from the Kannauj Lok Sabha seat in 2012.\nLegal Framework\nThe conduct of elections in India, including uncontested elections, is governed by the Representation of the People Act, 1951, and various rules set forth under the Constitution.\nSpecific procedures are outlined in these statutes to manage situations where elections are uncontested.\nArticle 329(b) of the Constitution read with the Representation of the People Act, 1951 provides that no election shall be called into question except by an election petition before the concerned High Court.\nOne of the grounds on which such an election petition can be filed is an improper rejection of nomination papers. Hence, the legal recourse available is to file an election petition in the Gujarat High Court.\nThe Representation of the People Act provides that High Courts shall endeavour to conclude such trials within six months, which has mostly not been followed in the past.\nSpeedy disposal of election petitions would be a step in the right direction.\nProcedure for Uncontested Election\nNomination Process: Candidates must file their nomination papers by the deadline specified by the Election Commission. The nomination papers must be duly filled and meet all required legal criteria.\nScrutiny of Nominations: After the nominations are filed, they are scrutinized by the Returning Officer to ensure that all required conditions are met, including the eligibility of the candidate and the correctness of the nomination form.\nWithdrawal of Candidature: After the nominations are scrutinized, there is a period during which candidates can withdraw their nominations. This is the final opportunity for candidates to retract their candidature without affecting the election process.\nDeclaration of Result: If, after the withdrawal period, only one candidate remains in the fray (i.e., all other candidates have either been disqualified during scrutiny or have withdrawn their nominations), the remaining candidate is declared elected unopposed. This declaration is made by the Returning Officer.\nRequirements for valid nominations\n\nAs per election nomination rules, a candidate endorsed by a recognised political party needs at least one voter from the constituency to propose their candidacy.\n\nBut if the candidate is Independent or nominated by an unrecognised political party, 10 voters from the constituency must sign the nomination paper.\n\nThese requirements are primarily outlined in the Representation of the People Act, 1951, and vary slightly depending on whether the election is for the Lok Sabha (the lower house of Parliament), the Rajya Sabha (the upper house of Parliament), or state legislatures.\n\nHere\u2019s a rundown of the general requirements for a valid nomination in India:\n\nEligibility of the Candidate\nCitizenship: The candidate must be a citizen of India.\nAge: Must be at least 25 years old for Lok Sabha or state legislative assembly elections, and at least 30 years old for Rajya Sabha elections.\nNo Disqualifications: The candidate must not be disqualified from voting or contesting in elections due to reasons such as being unsound-minded, an undischarged insolvent, a convicted criminal under certain conditions, or disqualified under any legislation.\nNomination Papers\nForm and Manner: Candidates must file their nomination papers in the prescribed format. This includes providing personal details, declaring assets and liabilities, and information about criminal antecedents (if any).\nNumber of Proposers: For Lok Sabha and state assembly elections, a candidate from a recognized political party needs only one proposer from his constituency, whereas an independent candidate needs ten proposers. For Rajya Sabha elections, the number of proposers and seconders required is also specified depending on the procedure.\nDeposit Fee\nSecurity Deposit: A candidate must deposit a security fee, which is forfeited if the candidate fails to secure a certain percentage of votes. The amount varies: for instance, as of the last updates, it\u2019s \u20b925,000 for general candidates and \u20b912,500 for SC/ST candidates for Lok Sabha elections.\nAffidavit\nLegal Declarations: Candidates are required to submit an affidavit declaring their criminal records, assets, liabilities, and educational qualifications. This ensures transparency and allows voters to make informed choices.\nSupporting Documents\nProof of Identity and Age: Candidates must provide adequate documents to prove their identity and age, such as a passport, PAN card, or Aadhaar card.\nOther Certifications: Depending on the nature of the election, additional certifications related to caste, residency, or other eligibility criteria might be needed.\nTime Frame\nDeadline: Nomination papers must be submitted by a specified deadline, failing which the nomination will not be considered valid.\nScrutiny and Withdrawal\nScrutiny of Nominations: After nominations are submitted, they are scrutinized by the Returning Officer to ensure all criteria are met. This may involve a formal hearing where objections can be raised against the nominations.\nWithdrawal Period: There is a period following the scrutiny during which candidates can withdraw their nomination.\nSignificance and Criticism\nAdministrative Efficiency: Uncontested elections save resources and administrative efforts since no voting process is required. This can be particularly advantageous in local elections or in regions with clear political dominance.\nDemocratic Concerns: Uncontested elections are often criticized for not truly reflecting democratic principles. They can sometimes be a result of political manipulation, where opposition parties are pressured or dissuaded from contesting. Moreover, voters are deprived of a choice, which is a fundamental aspect of democratic elections.\nPolitical Strategy: In some cases, parties might focus their resources strategically and decide not to contest certain unwinnable seats to concentrate on winnable ones. This can lead to uncontested elections in areas where a party holds a strong influence.\nWhy in the news?\n\nLok Sabha elections, 2024: On April 22, the ruling Bharatiya Janata Party opened its tally in the Lok Sabha when its nominee for the Surat constituency in the western State of Gujarat, Mukesh Dalal, was elected unopposed.\n\nThis followed the rejection of the nomination papers of other candidates and the withdrawal of other nominees.\nThis also means Gujarat\u2019s second-largest city will not go to the polls on May 7.\nWay forward\n\nUncontested elections can be particularly problematic in democratic countries like India, where vibrant and diverse political representation is crucial.\n\nStrengthening Political Participation:\n\nEncouraging Political Entry: Reduce barriers to entry for political participation. This can be done by lowering deposit amounts required for candidacy, simplifying the nomination process, and providing resources for potential candidates to understand and navigate the electoral process.\nCapacity Building: Conduct workshops and training programs for aspiring politicians on governance, policy-making, and election campaigning to enhance their effectiveness and readiness for public office.\n\nElectoral Reforms:\n\nProportional Representation: Introducing or expanding the use of proportional representation systems can encourage more parties and individuals to participate, knowing that they do not need to win a plurality in a single-member district.\nMulti-Member Constituencies: By having constituencies elect more than one representative, smaller parties and independents might have a better chance of winning seats, thus motivating more candidates to run.\n\nRules for Political Parties:\n\nPenalties for Non-Participation: Implement rules that penalize political parties if they leave constituencies uncontested, such as reduced access to public campaign funding or other benefits.\n\nCivic Engagement and Voter Education:\n\nVoter Awareness Campaigns: Increase voter awareness about the importance of contested elections and how they can demand better accountability from political parties.\nCivic Education: Incorporate comprehensive civic education in schools and universities to build a culture of political participation and informed voting from a young age.\n\nRegulatory Framework:\n\nTransparency and Accountability: Implement stringent regulations that require political parties to disclose their reasons for not contesting a seat, enhancing transparency.\nLegal Framework: Amend electoral laws to make it mandatory for political parties to contest a minimum percentage of seats to maintain their registration as a national or state party.\n\nEncouraging Independent and Minority Candidates:\n\nSupport Mechanisms: Establish platforms and support mechanisms that help independent candidates and representatives from minority communities to contest elections effectively.\nProtection Against Discrimination: Ensure robust legal protection against discrimination and violence toward candidates, particularly those from marginalized groups.\nConclusion\n\nUncontested elections are relatively rare in general elections in India due to the competitive nature of politics at the national level.\n\nHowever, they are more common in local elections and in certain states where one party may dominate.\n\nThe Election Commission continually monitors and updates the election process to ensure fairness and to mitigate issues associated with uncontested elections.\n\nPrevious year questions\nDiscuss the role of the Election Commission of India in light of the evolution of the Model Code of Conduct.

His work reshaped artistic styles and influenced cultural perceptions and visual representation in India. Read here to learn more about his life.\n\nRaja Ravi Varma (1848\u20131906) was a celebrated Indian painter and artist, widely regarded as one of the greatest painters in the history of Indian art.\n\nHis work is a unique blend of Indian traditions and the techniques of European academic art, and he is known for making Indian mythology accessible to a contemporary audience through his vibrant and realistic portrayals.\n\nTable of Contents\n\nEarly Life and Background\nTechniques and Influence\nBridging Indian Traditions with European Techniques\nWhy in the news?\nLegacy of Raja Ravi Varma\nEarly Life and Background\n\nBorn in the princely state of Travancore (in present-day Kerala, India) into an aristocratic family, Ravi Varma exhibited artistic talent from an early age.\n\nHis exposure to Western art was significantly enhanced when he encountered Dutch portraitists\u2019 works in the Travancore court.\n\nRavi Varma is best known for his depictions of scenes from the epics of the Mahabharata and Ramayana, as well as beautiful portrayals of sari-clad women, considered personifications of the Indian idea of female beauty.\nHis ability to fuse Indian tradition with European technique allowed him to craft canvases that resonated both emotionally and culturally with a wide range of audiences.\nTechniques and Influence\nMohini\n\nRavi Varma\u2019s approach to painting involved the use of oil paints, which was an adaptation of European methods, a novelty in Indian art at the time.\n\n\ud83d\udc49 Which year are YOU targeting for success in the IAS/IPS/IFS Exam? \ud83d\ude80\n\n(1) \u21d2 UPSC 2025: Prelims cum Mains\n\n(2) \u21d2 UPSC 2026: Prelims cum Mains\n\n(3) \u21d2 UPSC 2027 Prelims cum Mains\n\nTip: Know more about ClearIAS Courses (Online/Offline)\n\nHe was known for his detailed depiction of Indian costumes, jewellery, and life, which he rendered with a realism that helped popularize his work.\nHis portraits of royals and dignitaries also won him widespread acclaim and patronage.\nOne of Ravi Varma\u2019s significant contributions to Indian culture was the mass reproduction of his paintings.\nHe started a lithographic press in Mumbai, which produced prints of his paintings that were distributed widely, making them accessible to a broader audience.\nThis not only democratized art by making it affordable but also played a key role in shaping the visual imagination of the Indian populace.\nHis works influenced not just art but also the nascent Indian cinema and later, fashion.\nMany images of gods and goddesses that are now popular in Indian households are based on his depictions.\nHis portrayal of Indian deities and scenes from Hindu mythology have defined and shaped visual representation in various forms of media in India.\n\nFamous works: Damayanti Talking to a Swan, Shakuntala Looking for Dushyanta, Nair Lady Adorning Her Hair, and Shantanu and Matsyagandha.\n\nAwards and Honours: In 1904, the British colonial government awarded Varma with the Kaiser-i-Hind Gold Medal.\n\nIn 2013, a crater on the planet Mercury was named in his honour.\nBridging Indian Traditions with European Techniques\nThe milkmaid\n\nRavi Varma was among the first Indian artists to master the European oil painting technique, which he adeptly combined with Indian aesthetic themes and subjects.\n\nThis fusion created a new visual style that appealed to both Indian and European audiences, thereby creating a unique bridge between Eastern and Western art forms.\nHis ability to blend the two helped elevate Indian art to international standards and recognition.\n\nRealism in Indian Art\n\nBefore Ravi Varma, Indian art was predominantly characterized by its abstract and symbolic nature with a strong focus on spiritual and mythological themes presented in a non-realistic manner.\nRavi Varma introduced realism into Indian art, making his characters relatable and scenes from life and mythology vividly real.\nThis approach not only revolutionized Indian painting but also helped in chronicling the life and times of his era through art.\n\nDemocratizing Art\n\nRavi Varma\u2019s decision to start a lithographic press was revolutionary. By making affordable reproductions of his work, he democratized art in India, making it accessible to the common man.\nThis was a significant shift from the previous eras where art was largely confined to the palaces and the elite.\nHis prints, depicting gods and goddesses in very human-like forms, found a place in ordinary homes, influencing personal and cultural ideas about religion and spirituality.\n\nStandardizing Iconography\n\nRavi Varma\u2019s portrayals of Hindu deities have become canonical over time, influencing not only the field of art but also religious practices and the iconography of gods and goddesses in calendars, posters, and later, in films and television.\nHis depiction of Saraswati, Lakshmi, and other deities has become a standard, often replicated and revered across households in India.\n\nImpact on Narrative Art\n\nHis style of narrative realism and his focus on dramatic representation in paintings influenced the emerging genres of Indian cinema and theatre.\nThe visual style of early Indian cinema, particularly the way scenes were set and characters were dressed, owes much to Ravi Varma\u2019s depiction of epic tales and classical aesthetics.\nWhy in the news?\n\nAmidst celebrations marking the 176th birth anniversary of renowned artist Raja Ravi Varma (29th April 1848), the unveiling of the first true copy of his iconic painting \u201cIndulekha\u201d took place at Kilimanoor Palace, Travancore, the artist\u2019s birthplace.\n\nIndulekha, a portrayal of the protagonist from O. Chandu Menon\u2019s seminal Malayalam novel, holds cultural and literary significance as a symbol of early modern literature in the region.\nPublished in 1889, it was the first major novel in the Malayalam language. It was a landmark in the history of Malayalam literature and initiated the novel as a new flourishing genre.\nLegacy of Raja Ravi Varma\n\nRavi Varma laid the groundwork for future Indian artists to explore and innovate with new styles and mediums.\n\nArtists like Abanindranath Tagore and others who followed were inspired to adapt and evolve his synthesis of East and West, tradition and modernity.\n\nDespite his demise in 1906, Raja Ravi Varma\u2019s legacy endures. His work continues to be exhibited and celebrated, with his originals being highly prized collectables in the art market.\n\nVarious awards and cultural organizations have been named after him to honour his contributions to Indian art.\n\nRaja Ravi Varma remains a seminal figure in Indian art, bridging the gap between traditional Indian and Western artistic disciplines, and his work serves as a cornerstone in the development of modern Indian art.\n\nRelated articles:\n\nIndian Paintings\nIndian Folk Paintings\nRock Paintings\n\n-Article by Swathi Satish"

Read here to learn more.\n\nThis approach serves multiple objectives, including stabilizing prices, ensuring food security, supporting agricultural sectors, and providing a buffer against market volatility.\n\nThe concept is particularly relevant in discussions related to global trade and the World Trade Organization (WTO), where it can be a contentious issue due to its implications for international trade and market distortions.\n\nTable of Contents\n\nWhy Public Stockholding?\nTypes of food PSH programmes\nObjectives of Public Stockholding\nCriticisms\nExamples of Public Stockholding Programs\nWTO and Public Stockholding\nWhy in the news?\nImpact of Public stockholding on markets\nWhy Public Stockholding?\n\nPublic food stockholding (PSH) refers to the procurement, storage and release of food stocks by governments through state-owned enterprises or other public agencies.\n\nStocks can comprise both domestically procured and imported food.\nUsually, cereals (less perishable) are prevalent in national diets.\nCountries frequently exposed to shocks are generally more likely to keep stocks\n\nPublic Stockholding or Public Food Stockholding historically received attention during food crises.\n\nVery low levels of world food stocks, primarily cereals, pose a serious threat to consumption levels and make the world too dependent on the vagaries of weather.\nLow stocks are strongly associated with price spikes and volatility. Ample stocks can provide a cushion against supply and demand shocks.\nLow stocks are a necessary but not sufficient condition for such shocks to produce a spike.\nStockholding is a vital part of the solution to food insecurity in the LDCs and would serve as a crucial means to limit price volatility.\nTypes of food PSH programmes\nEMERGENCY STOCKS\u00a0to reduce the vulnerability of consumers to supply disruptions or food price shocks in emergencies.\nBUFFER STOCKS\u00a0to stabilize prices within the domestic market to avoid excessive volatility (the policy focus is on both consumers and producers).\nSTOCKS FOR DOMESTIC FOOD DISTRIBUTION / AID\u00a0to promote physical and economic access to adequate quantities of food for certain target population groups.\nObjectives of Public Stockholding\nPrice Stabilization: Governments buy commodities when prices are low and sell them when prices are high, helping to stabilize market prices and protect both producers and consumers from price volatility.\nFood Security: Maintaining stocks of essential food items ensures availability during times of shortage, such as crop failures, natural disasters, or economic crises.\nSupport for Farmers: Purchasing commodities at predetermined prices provides financial stability for farmers, encouraging production and aiding in rural development.\nMarket Regulation: Through strategic releases of stock, governments can influence market supply and demand dynamics to prevent extreme price fluctuations.\nCriticisms\nTrade Distortions: Public stockholding can lead to market distortions if domestic prices are kept artificially high or low. This can affect global markets, particularly if a significant exporter or importer adopts such policies.\nWTO Regulations: The WTO generally has rules against trade-distorting subsidies, including those involved in public stockholding. However, developing countries argue that such policies are crucial for food security and rural development, leading to ongoing negotiations for more flexible terms under the WTO\u2019s Agreement on Agriculture.\nFinancial and Operational Costs: Establishing and maintaining public stockpiles can be financially demanding. It involves costs related to purchasing, storing, and managing the stocks, which can be substantial.\nRisk of Decay and Mismanagement: Physical storage of commodities carries risks of decay, damage, or loss due to poor management or natural disasters. Additionally, stockpiling systems can be prone to corruption and inefficiency.\nExamples of Public Stockholding Programs\n\n\ud83d\udc49 Which year are YOU targeting for success in the IAS/IPS/IFS Exam? \ud83d\ude80\n\n(1) \u21d2 UPSC 2025: Prelims cum Mains\n\n(2) \u21d2 UPSC 2026: Prelims cum Mains\n\n(3) \u21d2 UPSC 2027 Prelims cum Mains\n\nTip: Know more about ClearIAS Courses (Online/Offline)\n\nIndia\u2019s Food Corporation of India (FCI): FCI manages the public distribution system for grains and operates under a mandate to stabilize prices and ensure food security through the procurement and distribution of wheat and rice.\nThe United States\u2019 Strategic Petroleum Reserve (SPR): This is a stockpile of petroleum maintained by the U.S. Department of Energy as an emergency supply to safeguard against disruptions in oil supplies.\nChina\u2019s State Reserves: China manages extensive reserves of various commodities, including grains, pork, and cotton, to stabilize prices and ensure supply security.\nWTO and Public Stockholding\n\nThe issue of public stockholding for food security purposes is a hot topic in WTO negotiations.\n\nDeveloping countries, led by nations like India, have sought amendments to WTO rules that would allow them to hold larger quantities of food stock without facing the usual restrictions related to trade-distorting subsidies.\nThe Bali Ministerial Decision of 2013 allowed for interim solutions, but a permanent solution has been sought in subsequent WTO discussions.\nPublic stockholding continues to be an essential strategy for many countries, balancing the need for economic stability and food security against the complexities of global trade rules and market dynamics.\nWhy in the news?\n\nIndia is trying to restart work at the WTO on the long-pending permanent solution for public stockholding subsidies, for the smooth running of programmes such as the MSP.\n\nThe 2024 Ministerial Conference in Abu Dhabi failed to deliver results, but some countries, including Brazil and the US, are trying to defer the matter as well.\nIn a Committee on Agriculture (CoA) meeting at the WTO headquarters in Geneva, New Delhi insisted that members should revisit the joint proposal made by the G33-African Group-ACP Group on public stockholding.\nThe Bali interim solution on public stockholding offers India and other developing nations a peace clause that allows them to breach the WTO-prescribed agriculture subsidy limit (10 per cent of the value of production) without the risk of legal action from other members.\nImpact of Public stockholding on markets\n\nDomestic impacts:\n\nProducers:\n\nGuaranteed and remunerative outlets can provide a stable market and support farm incomes.\nOver-reliance on institutional markets can crowd out private investment.\n\nConsumers:\n\nAn important form of social protection for the most vulnerable.\nProduction may be skewed towards procured commodities, to the detriment of efforts to promote dietary diversification.\n\nGovernment:\n\nPracticable way of supporting producers and consumers.\nHigh fiscal costs due to the scale of operations, implementation challenges (particularly targeting beneficiaries)\n\nInternational impacts:\n\nForeign producers:\n\nImport demand is reduced in countries holding large stocks, thereby reducing market opportunities for producers in other countries.\nIf, in countries holding huge stockpiles, stock release decisions are unpredictable, this can influence price levels and volatility.\n\nForeign consumers:\n\nAmple stocks can provide confidence in the availability of supplies to deal with exogenous shocks.\nUncertainty about the availability of stocks held by large consuming countries in the event of exogenous shocks affecting global markets.\n\nGiven the possible international impacts, PSH therefore remains a difficult area of agricultural negotiations.\n\nRelated articles:\n\nWTO, Trade Facilitation Agreement and Indian Stand\nFood security in India\nAgri-Food Policies for SWAB\n\n-Article by Swathi Satish"

It was also seen as a measure to raise revenue for the government.\n\nAbolishment (1985):\n\nThe tax was abolished in 1985 during the government of Prime Minister Rajiv Gandhi. The reasons for the abolition included:\n\nAdministrative and enforcement challenges, lead to high costs and low efficiency.\nThe tax was perceived as encouraging capital flight and discouraging investment, as wealthy individuals sought ways to avoid the tax through various means.\nIt was also seen as contributing to tax evasion and encouraging the undervaluation of assets.\n\nImpact:\n\nThe abolition was welcomed by many as it was believed to encourage wealth creation and remove a layer of taxation that was deemed unfair by some, particularly those who viewed it as double taxation since the assets had often already been taxed during the lifetime of the deceased.\nRevival Attempts and Current Debates\n\nEconomic Arguments for Revival:\n\nIn recent years, there have been calls from various quarters, including economists and policymakers, to reintroduce inheritance tax in India.\n\nThe arguments for its revival often include:\n\nAddressing the rising wealth inequality in India.\nGenerating additional revenue for the government to fund social welfare programs.\nAligning with global practices, many countries, including the United States and the United Kingdom, have some form of estate or inheritance tax.\n\nPolitical and Public Response:\n\nThe idea of reintroducing an inheritance tax is politically sensitive and has received mixed reactions.\nThe notion of reintroducing an inheritance tax has been circulating within political spheres for over a decade.\nCritics argue that it could lead to capital flight, reduce incentives for savings and investment, and encourage tax evasion.\n\nProposals and Discussions:\n\nDiscussions about the revival of inheritance tax often suggest modernizing the framework to prevent evasion, perhaps with lower rates and higher exemption thresholds than were previously in place.\nProposals have varied, but there is no concrete legislative action as of now. The topic remains a point of debate among policymakers, particularly in the context of discussions about fiscal policy and economic reforms aimed at achieving greater social equity.\nWhy in the news?\n\nInheritance tax a duty on property inherited by a person \u2013 has become a polarising topic in the 2024 Lok Sabha campaign, with both Congress and BJP accusing the other of reviving it.\n\nInheritance tax in other nations\n\nInheritance taxes are widespread in nations like the UK, Japan, France, and Finland.\n\nWith a striking 40 per cent rate, the US holds one of the highest inheritance tax rates.\nJapan tops the list with a 55 per cent rate, followed by South Korea at 50 per cent and France at 45 per cent.\n\nUnited States\n\nThe United States imposes a federal estate tax on the transfer of the estate of deceased persons.\nThe maximum tax rate is 40%. Some states also impose their own estate or inheritance taxes.\nAs of 2023, inheritance taxes are scarce, imposed only within Iowa, Kentucky, Maryland, Nebraska, New Jersey, and Pennsylvania.\nThe taxation amount depends on factors like the inheritance\u2019s value, the beneficiary\u2019s relationship to the deceased, and the local legislation.\nAdditionally, the state where the deceased lived or owned property may also impose an inheritance tax.\n\nUnited Kingdom\n\nIn the UK, inheritance tax is charged at 40% on estates above the threshold of \u00a3325,000.\nHowever, there are exemptions such as if you leave everything above the threshold to a spouse, civil partner, a charity, or a community amateur sports club, where the estate is tax-free.\nAdditionally, there is a residence nil rate band when a residence is passed on to direct descendants.\n\nJapan\n\nJapan has one of the highest inheritance tax rates in the world.\nThe rates range from 10% to 55%, with the amount of tax levied depending on the relationship of the heir to the deceased and the value of the inheritance.\n\nFrance\n\nFrance\u2019s inheritance laws are quite stringent, with tax rates based on the relationship to the deceased.\nDirect descendants and spouses pay rates from 5% to 45%, while distant relatives or non-relatives can pay much higher rates.\n\nGermany\n\nGermany charges inheritance tax on a scale based on the relationship to the deceased and the value of the inheritance.\nTax rates range from 7% to 50%, with spouses and children typically enjoying higher allowances and lower rates.\nConclusion\n\nThe history of inheritance tax in India reflects broader economic and social policies and priorities. While it was originally instituted as a tool for wealth redistribution, its abolition was aimed at stimulating economic growth and investment.\n\nThe current debates about its potential revival hinge on balancing economic growth with social equity, demonstrating the complex interplay between fiscal policy and societal values in India.\n\nRelated articles:\n\nTypes of taxes in India\nTax transparency\nCorporate tax\nTax buoyancy\nRetrospective taxation\n\n-Article by Swathi Satish"

This day was observed by the Labour Kisan Party of Hindustan.\n\nOn this day, communist leader Malayapuram Singaravelu Chettiar asked the government that 1st May should be considered as a national holiday to symbolise the efforts and work of the workers.\nThis day is also known as Kamgar Divas, Kamgar Din and Antarrashtriya Shramik Divas in India.\nSignificance of Labour Day\n\nLabour Day serves as a reminder of the worker rights struggles, where ordinary men and women stood up against their employers to demand fair pay, reasonable hours, and safer working conditions.\n\nThe holiday celebrates the progress achieved through these movements, including the establishment of the eight-hour workday, improved labour conditions, and the creation of labour laws that promote equality and fairness.\n\nConstitutional provisions for labour rights in India\n\nIndian constitution provides numerous safeguards for the protection of labour rights. These safeguards are in the form of fundamental rights and the Directive principle of State policy.\n\nArticle 14 commands the State to treat any person equally before the law.\nArticle (19) (1) (c) grants citizens the right to form associations or unions.\nArticle 21 promises the protection of life and personal liberty.\nArticle 23 prohibits forced labour.\nArticle 24 prohibits employment of children below the age of fourteen years.\nArticle 39(a) provides that the State shall secure to its citizens equal right to an adequate means of livelihood.\nArticle 41 provides that within the limits of its economic capacity, the State shall secure the Right to work and education.\nArticle 42 instructs the State to make provisions for securing just and humane conditions of work and for maternity relief.\nArticle 43 orders the State to secure a living wage, decent conditions of work and social and cultural opportunities for all workers through legislation or economic organisation.\nArticle 43A provides for the participation of workers in the Management of Industries through legislation.\nHealth impact of climate change on labourers\n\nClimate change creates a cocktail of serious health hazards for 70 per cent of the world\u2019s workers\n\nThe health consequences of climate change can include cancer, cardiovascular disease, respiratory illnesses, kidney dysfunction and mental health conditions.\nExisting occupational safety and health (OSH) protections are struggling to keep up with the resulting risks, according to a new report by the International Labour Organization (ILO).\n\nThe report,\u00a0Ensuring Safety and Health at Work in a Changing Climate, says that climate change is already having a serious impact on the safety and health of workers in all regions of the world.\n\nThe ILO estimates that more than 2.4 billion workers (out of a global workforce of 3.4 billion) are likely to be exposed to excessive heat at some point during their work, according to the most recent figures available (2020).\nWhen calculated as a share of the global workforce, the proportion has increased from 65.5 per cent to 70.9 per cent since 2000.\nIn addition, the report estimates that 18,970 lives and 2.09 million disability-adjusted life years are lost annually due to the 22.87 million occupational injuries, which are attributable to excessive heat.\nThis is not to mention the 26.2 million people worldwide living with chronic kidney disease linked to workplace heat stress (2020 figures).\n\nThe report notes that numerous health conditions in workers have been linked to climate change, including cancer, cardiovascular disease, respiratory illnesses, kidney dysfunction and mental health conditions.

This is where desalination comes in.\nWhat is Desalination?\n\nDesalination is the process of removing salt and other minerals from saline water (seawater or brackish water) to produce fresh water that is suitable for human consumption, agriculture, and industrial uses.\n\nThe primary goal of desalination is to make saltwater, which is abundant on Earth, usable for purposes that require fresh water, which is comparatively scarce.\n\nIn most desalination processes, for every litre of potable water produced, about 1.5 litres of liquid polluted with chlorine and copper are created.\nThis wastewater (\u201cconcentrate\u201d) is twice as saline as ocean water. If not properly diluted and dispersed, it may form a dense plume of toxic brine which can degrade coastal and marine ecosystems unless treated.\nIncreased salinity and temperature can cause a decrease in the dissolved oxygen content and contribute to the formation of \u201cdead zones\u201d, where very few marine animals can live.\nUnconventional water resources, such as those resulting from desalination, are key to supporting Sustainable Development Goal 6 (to ensure the availability and sustainable management of water and sanitation for all).\nSeawater desalination can extend water supplies beyond what is available from the hydrological cycle, but innovation in brine management and disposal is required.\nResearch suggests there are also economic opportunities associated with brine, such as commercial salt, metal recovery and the use of brine in fish production systems.\nThe last decade has seen increased academic interest in recovering resources from brine, according to one\u00a0study. Seawater contains various minerals, some of which are rare and expensive to mine on land. While extracting materials from brine is possible, its high cost restricts commercialization.\nKey Desalination Technologies\nReverse Osmosis (RO): This is the most common and energy-efficient method. It involves forcing saltwater through a semi-permeable membrane that blocks salts and other impurities, allowing only water to pass through. RO is widely used due to its effectiveness in removing salts and other chemical contaminants.\nThermal Desalination: This category includes methods like Multi-Stage Flash (MSF) and Multi-Effect Distillation (MED). These processes involve heating seawater to create steam, which is then condensed to produce fresh water, leaving salts and other impurities behind.\nElectrodialysis (ED): This method uses a series of membranes and an electrical current to separate positive and negative ions, including salt, from water. It is particularly effective for treating brackish water.\nDesalination can Help Tackle Water Scarcity\nSupplementing Freshwater Supplies: In regions where freshwater resources are scarce, desalination provides a consistent and reliable source of water that is independent of climate variability.\nSupporting Growing Populations: As populations increase, especially in arid regions or small island nations, desalination offers a way to support the growing demand for drinking water and sanitation needs.\nAgricultural Use: Desalinated water can be used for irrigation in areas where freshwater is too precious to be used for agriculture, thus helping in food production and the alleviation of food scarcity.\nIndustrial Applications: Many industries require high-quality, consistent water supply. Desalination can provide this, especially in areas where industrial growth is limited by water scarcity.\nChallenges\nHigh Costs: Desalination is energy-intensive and can be expensive, both in terms of initial capital outlay and operational costs. This makes it less accessible for poorer regions without the necessary financial resources.\nEnvironmental Impact: The desalination process produces brine (highly concentrated salt water), which must be carefully managed to avoid damaging marine ecosystems. Additionally, the energy consumption required for desalination can contribute to greenhouse gas emissions unless renewable energy sources are used.\nEnergy Requirements: The process is traditionally reliant on large amounts of electricity and/or thermal energy, making it not only costly but also a significant contributor to carbon emissions unless powered by renewable energy sources.\nInnovations for clean drinking water\n\nSeveral innovative desalination systems are being developed to try and reduce the energy required to operate them and related emissions.\n\nWave-powered desalination\n\nOneka, a wave-powered desalination technology, is one such innovation. Floating buoys tethered to the ocean floor use wave power to drive a pump that forces seawater through filters and reverse osmosis membranes.\nThe fresh water is then piped ashore again powered solely by the natural motion of waves, explains Canadian desalination company Oneka Technologies.\nThe system has several advantages over large-scale shore-based desalination plants that are mostly powered by combusting fossil fuels, but it does require high waves to work.\n\nSolar-low-cost water purification\n\nSolar power has been used to convert saltwater into fresh drinking water, by researchers from King\u2019s College in London in collaboration with MIT and the Helmholtz Institute of Renewable Energy Systems.\nA set of specialized membranes channel salt ions into a stream of brine, leaving fresh drinkable water. The system adjusts to variable sunlight without compromising the volume of drinking water produced.\nThe process is 20% cheaper than traditional desalination methods, which could boost efforts to provide drinking water in developing countries, the researchers say.\nWhy in the news?\n\nIn a few years, Chennai is set to emerge as the desalination capital of India, with three operational plants in Minjur and Nemmeli and Southeast Asia\u2019s largest plant, with a capacity to treat 400 million litres of seawater a day, coming up at Perur.\n\nExperts suggest a multi-pronged approach towards water resilience, along with desalination.\nWay Forward\n\nA natural resources crisis like water scarcity is listed in the\u00a0World Economic Forum\u2019s\u00a0Global Risks Report 2024, as one of the top 10 threats facing the world in the next decade.\n\nTo make desalination a more viable option for addressing global water scarcity, advances in technology are focusing on reducing energy consumption and mitigating environmental impacts.\n\nInnovations include the development of more efficient membranes for reverse osmosis, the use of renewable energy sources like solar or wind to power plants, and improved brine management techniques to lessen ecological footprints.\n\nAs these technologies improve and become more cost-effective, desalination is likely to play an increasingly important role in global water management strategies, especially in regions severely affected by water scarcity.\n\nRelated articles:\n\nWater crisis in India\nBengaluru water crisis\nGroundwater depletion and contamination\n\n-Article by Swathi Satish"

Promoting sustainable development through optimal trade practices.\nProtecting and Preserving the Environment: The preamble of the agreement acknowledges the need to protect the environment while promoting economic development.\nKey Features of the Marrakesh Agreement\n\nEstablishment of the WTO\n\nThe Marrakesh Agreement established the WTO as the global international organization dealing with the rules of trade between nations.\nThe WTO encompasses a larger set of previous agreements under GATT, expanding the scope from just trade in goods to include trade in services (General Agreement on Trade in Services, or GATS) and intellectual property (Agreement on Trade-Related Aspects of Intellectual Property Rights, or TRIPS).\n\nDispute Settlement\n\nOne of the groundbreaking features of the WTO under the Marrakesh Agreement is its mechanism for dispute resolution.\nThe Dispute Settlement Understanding (DSU) provides a detailed process for resolving trade disagreements between countries, which is legally binding and enforceable.\n\nTrade Policy Review Mechanism\n\nThis mechanism was institutionalized under the WTO to ensure transparency of trade policies across countries.\nIt involves a periodic review of national trade policies to ensure compliance with WTO rules and norms.\nImpact of the Marrakesh Agreement\n\nTrade Liberalization\n\nSince its inception, the Marrakesh Agreement has contributed to a significant reduction in tariffs and other trade barriers.\nThis has facilitated increased trade flows, integration into the global economy, and economic growth, particularly for developing countries willing to open their markets.\n\nEconomic Development\n\nBy providing more predictable trading terms, the agreement has helped countries attract investment and improve their economic standing globally.\nThe rules-based trading system helps to reduce the risk associated with international trade.\n\nCriticism and Challenges\n\nThe WTO and the Marrakesh Agreement have faced criticism for favouring wealthier nations due to their greater negotiating power and for promoting policies that sometimes conflict with the economic interests and developmental needs of poorer countries.\nIssues such as agricultural subsidies remain highly contentious.\n\nEnvironmental and Social Concerns\n\nThere are ongoing debates about the impact of liberalized trade on the environment and social structures.\nCritics argue that trade liberalization can lead to environmental degradation and worsen working conditions in industries moved to

These can include:\n\nIncentivizing the use of cover crops to reduce erosion and soil degradation.\nPromoting conservation tillage practices that minimize soil disturbance.\nSubsidizing organic farming practices that enhance soil organic matter and biodiversity.\nEstablishing soil health monitoring programs to provide farmers with data for better soil management.\n\nIn India, the policy of subsidizing key fertilizers, particularly nitrogenous (N), phosphatic (P), and potassic (K) fertilizers, was initiated in the 1970s when the green revolution was still unfolding.\n\nGiven the negative externalities caused by the urea subsidy on the environment, a few alternatives to rationalise it could be:\n\nSwitch to direct cash transfer into the accounts of farmers based on per hectare of gross cropped area, and free up the prices of these fertilisers.\nThis would bring down the wide imbalance between prices of N (urea), P and K fertilisers and would incentivise farmers to use more balanced doses of N, P and K.\nAnother alternative could be to bring urea under the Nutrient Based Subsidy Scheme (NBS), with a flat rate subsidy on N, P and K. This would raise the urea prices significantly.\nThe soluble fertilisers, nano fertilisers, and also biofertilisers, could brought at par.\nWater Management\n\nIndia is categorized as a water-stressed nation due to its declining per capita water availability.\n\nCentral Water Commission estimates that 78 per cent of water withdrawals in the country are for agricultural purposes.\nThe widespread adoption of tube-well irrigation, primarily fueled by increased electricity availability for agriculture, has been the driving force behind the reduction in canal irrigation.\nThe issues of depleting and deteriorating groundwater and its quality observed in the agricultural sector can be largely attributed to longstanding policies of subsidies for agricultural inputs, such as power and fertilizers, as well as price support mechanisms like Minimum Support Price (MSP) for crops like paddy and wheat, and Fair and Remunerative Price (FRP) for sugarcane.\n\nWater scarcity and pollution are major challenges in agriculture. Effective water management policies ensure the availability and quality of water for agricultural uses while preserving aquatic ecosystems. Policies could involve:\n\nImplementing efficient irrigation technologies like drip or sprinkler systems to reduce water wastage.\nRegulating the use of fertilizers and pesticides to prevent water contamination.\nSupporting rainwater harvesting and water recycling practices to improve water availability.\nEstablishing water user associations to manage local water resources collaboratively and sustainably.\n\nThere is a need for transforming the agriculture sector policies in line with SDG 6.4, to \u201cIncrease Water-Use Efficiency and Ensure Freshwater Supplies\u201d.\n\nReducing the area under rice cultivation by at least one million hectares in states like Punjab and Haryana, where 99 per cent of rice fields rely on flood irrigation methods and redirect rice cultivation to eastern India.\nImplementing Direct Income Support on a per-hectare basis offers a promising solution to address the policies of free power supply, coupled with deregulating power tariffs to reflect market dynamics and implementing universal metering.\nWater-saving irrigation technologies like micro-irrigation (such as drip and sprinkler systems) promoted under the Government of India\u2019s Pradhan Mantri Krishi Sinchayee Yojna are imperative as a precursor to sustainable agricultural intensification.\nClimate change\n\nAgriculture can contribute to air pollution through the release of particulates, chemicals, and greenhouse gases. Policies to improve air quality may include:\n\nRegulating and monitoring ammonia and methane emissions from livestock operations.\nPromoting agroforestry and integrated pest management (IPM) to reduce the need for synthetic inputs.\nEncouraging renewable energy sources in agricultural practices, reducing reliance on fossil fuels.\nCarbon farming incentives that reward practices reducing carbon emissions or enhancing carbon sequestration.\n\nOver the period 1950-2018, average temperatures in the country have increased by 0.70 C while the summer monsoon precipitation (June to September) over India has declined by around 6 per cent from 1951 to 2015, with notable decreases over the Indo-Gangetic Plains and the Western Ghats.\n\nThe agriculture sector is affected most adversely by climate change impact but at the same time, it also adds to the climate crisis.\nThe sector contributed about 13.44 per cent of the total Greenhouse Gas (GHG) emissions in India in 2019.\n\nIf India moves quickly to low-carbon agriculture, the country can at least partially mitigate the damage.\n\nBy shifting from price subsidy to income subsidy for direct cash transfer to farmers on per hectare basis, farmers can purchase the fertilizers as per their requirement (including micronutrient fertilizers) and choice (that include bio-inputs, vermicompost etc.).\nPremium minimum support price (MSP) for low-carbon crops.\nThe country\u2019s agriculture contributes to 13 per cent of the world\u2019s agriculture emissions and thus has significant scope for trading carbon under a carbon trading system, where one carbon credit unit is equivalent to one tonne of carbon dioxide emissions.\nBiodiversity Preservation\n\nAgriculture subsidies can impact negatively on biodiversity, directly (e.g. when diverse cropping pattern is converted to mono-cropping) and indirectly (e.g. climate change, which then impacts biodiversity).\n\nImpacts can be immediate (e.g. land change, crop change, biomass burning), arise over time (e.g. pollution, eutrophication, leaching etc.) and sometimes can be felt acutely by future generations (e.g. climate change).\nOverall net impacts may be less clearly negative where the incentive creates both positive and negative impacts (e.g. food subsidy achieving food security objectives but encouraging mono-cropping of wheat rice cultivation through assured procurement of MSP).\n\nBiodiversity is crucial for sustainable agriculture and ecosystem resilience. Policies to protect biodiversity in agricultural landscapes might encompass:\n\nProtecting and restoring habitats within agricultural lands, such as hedgerows, buffer strips, and wetlands.\nSupporting diversified and rotational cropping systems that mimic natural ecosystems.\nFunding for biodiversity-friendly practices such as wildlife corridors and pollinator support initiatives.\nLegal frameworks that protect endangered species and regulate the introduction of invasive species.\n\nInstead of further incentivizing biodiversity harmful subsidies, India should assess options to repurpose subsidy policies to neutralize their effects on biodiversity which is also critical to the resource mobilization needed to implement the Kunming-Montreal Global Biodiversity Framework (GBF).\n\nAgro-biodiversity services need to be valued and mechanisms for green credits or biodiversity credits need to be developed so that producers can get incentives for opting for crops and practices that favour agrobiodiversity.\nCross-Cutting Policies\n\nSome policies can simultaneously address multiple aspects of SWAB, such as:\n\nAgro-ecological zoning to guide land use based on environmental sensitivity and suitability.\nEducation and extension services to disseminate knowledge on sustainable practices.\nIntegration of SWAB goals into national agricultural policies and international agreements.\nPublic-private partnerships to leverage resources and expertise from different sectors.\nWhy in the news?\n\nICRIER released a report on Agri-Food Trends and Analytics which sheds light on the influence of agri-food policies on India\u2019s agricultural production and emphasizes on synergy of SWAB for sustainable food systems.\n\nConclusion\n\nEffective implementation of these policies requires robust monitoring and enforcement mechanisms, stakeholder engagement, and adequate funding.\n\nFurthermore, adaptive management approaches are crucial to respond to changing environmental conditions and scientific advancements.\n\nAdopting these agri-food policies not only helps protect soil, water, air, and biodiversity but also contributes to the resilience of food systems against climate change and other global challenges. This approach ensures long-term sustainability, aligning with global sustainability goals and commitments.\n\nRelated articles:\n\nSustainable agri-food systems\nAgriculture export policy\nFood security in India\nGreen agriculture\nNational Pest Surveillance System (NPSS)\n\n-Article by Swathi Satish"

It believes in deconstructing the narrative in which the oppression of women and exploitation of nature is justified.\n\nThis term was first coined by French feminist Fran\u00e7oise d\u2018Eaubonne in 1974.\nLe f\u00e9minismeou la mort (Feminism or Death) was the book that she published in the same year and used the term ecofeminism in the book for the first time.\nShe explored a special connection between women and nature.\nEcofeminism draws heavily from the basic tenets of feminism which include gender equality and a basic disregard of the patrilineal system that justifies the oppression of women.\nWhy is ecofeminism relevant today?\n\nEcofeminism is particularly relevant today for several reasons.\n\nClimate Change and Environmental Justice\n\nAs climate change becomes a more pressing global issue, ecofeminism highlights the disproportionate impact environmental degradation has on women, especially in developing countries where women often bear the primary responsibility for securing water, food, and fuel.\nBy emphasizing women\u2019s roles and knowledge in natural resource management, ecofeminism advocates for women\u2019s involvement in climate change mitigation and adaptation strategies. This inclusion is essential for effective environmental action and social justice.\n\nIntegrative Approach to Activism\n\nEcofeminism provides a comprehensive framework that integrates the fight against gender inequality with the pursuit of environmental sustainability.\nIt suggests that social justice issues (like gender, race, and class inequalities) are deeply intertwined with environmental issues, advocating for a holistic approach to solving these problems.\nThis perspective is increasingly adopted by movements and organizations that see the benefits of addressing human rights and environmental conservation simultaneously.\n\nCultural Critique\n\nEcofeminism critiques dominant cultural norms that value exploitation and control, which manifest in both environmental destruction and patriarchal structures.\nIt challenges traditional norms about power and encourages a shift towards more cooperative, respectful interactions with nature and each other.\nIn today\u2019s cultural climate, where there is a significant reevaluation of power structures and roles, ecofeminism\u2019s critique helps to frame discussions about more sustainable and equitable alternatives.\n\nSustainable Development\n\nWith the global push towards sustainable development, ecofeminism\u2019s emphasis on more ethical, sustainable ways of living that respect both human and environmental boundaries is increasingly relevant.\nEcofeminists argue for development strategies that do not exploit natural resources or marginalized communities, influencing policies and practices around sustainable agriculture, conservation, and renewable energy deployment.\n\nIntersectionality\n\nEcofeminism is inherently intersectional, acknowledging how different systems of oppression intersect and impact women and the environment.\nThis approach aligns with contemporary movements that recognize the need for a multi-faceted approach to activism and policy-making that considers various axes of identity and their impact on individuals\u2019 experiences with environmental issues.\n\nGlobal and Local Impact\n\nEcofeminism is relevant on both a global and a local scale. Globally, it calls for international cooperation on environmental issues that respect and incorporate women\u2019s voices and needs.\nLocally, it empowers communities to engage in grassroots activism that supports both environmental conservation and women\u2019s rights, leading to more resilient and adaptive communities.\nEcofeminism and the Chipko Movement\n\nEcofeminism and the Chipko Movement are closely linked, with the latter often cited as a pivotal example of ecofeminism in action.\n\nThe Chipko Movement, which originated in the early 1970s in the Himalayan region of Uttarakhand (then part of Uttar Pradesh), India, is one of the most celebrated environmental movements in the world and is particularly noted for the vital role played by rural women.\n\nThe Chipko Movement began as a form of direct action to prevent the cutting down of trees.\nIt was initiated by villagers who feared that deforestation would destroy their traditional forest rights and their livelihoods.\nThe name \u201cChipko,\u201d which means \u201cto embrace\u201d or \u201cto cling,\u201d refers to the protestors\u2019 tactic of hugging trees to prevent loggers from cutting them down.\nWomen at the Forefront: The involvement of women was a distinctive feature of the Chipko Movement.\nWomen, being primarily responsible for household chores such as fetching water, collecting firewood, and ensuring food security through agriculture, were directly impacted by deforestation.\nTheir participation highlighted the dependence of rural women on forest resources and their role in conservation.\nThe intersection of gender and climate crisis\n\nThe intersection of gender and the climate crisis is a significant aspect of contemporary discussions on climate change and sustainability.\n\nWomen often face the brunt of climate impacts, particularly in developing regions where they primarily manage household resources and agriculture.\nThe ecofeminist movement highlights the critical link between the exploitation of nature and the oppression of women, arguing for a more holistic approach to addressing both environmental and gender injustices.\nIt emphasizes sustainable practices and egalitarian systems that respect both the environment and women\u2019s rights.\n\nVulnerability to Climate Impacts\n\nWomen and girls, especially in poorer regions, tend to be disproportionately affected by the impacts of climate change due to social, economic, and political inequalities. For example:\n\nResource Scarcity: In many societies, women are responsible for collecting water and firewood, tasks that become more arduous and time-consuming as resources become scarcer due to droughts, deforestation, and other environmental changes.\nAgricultural Production: Women constitute a large percentage of the agricultural workforce in many developing countries but often have less access to resources like land, credit, and technology. Climate change exacerbates these inequalities, as changing weather patterns affect crop yields and food security.\n\nHealth Risks\n\nWomen face specific health risks from the climate crisis, particularly in maternal and reproductive health.\nIncreased temperatures and natural disasters can compromise healthcare facilities, reduce access to healthcare, and increase risks of diseases such as malaria, which is particularly dangerous for pregnant women.\n\nEconomic Disparities\n\nEconomic opportunities for women are often closely tied to natural resources, which are increasingly jeopardized by climate change.\nAdditionally, women generally have lower income levels and fewer economic opportunities, making it harder for them to recover from climate-induced economic disruptions.\n\nAdaptive Capacities\n\nWhile women are vulnerable to climate change, they also play crucial roles in building community resilience.\nTheir knowledge and skills in resource management and sustainable practices are invaluable in adapting to environmental changes.\nEmpowering women through education, resources, and leadership opportunities enhances their capacity to manage climate impacts effectively.\nConclusion\n\nEcofeminism\u2019s relevance today lies in its unique ability to link the degradation of the environment with systemic inequalities, providing a comprehensive and inclusive framework for understanding and addressing some of the most pressing challenges of our time.\n\nBy fostering an ethical, sustainable, and equitable approach to both human and environmental relationships, ecofeminism contributes significantly to contemporary social, political, and environmental discourses.\n\nRelated articles:\n\nWomen and Climate Change\nClimate change management and agriculture-what can women do?\n\n-Article by Swathi Satish"

These particles can carry contagious agents such as viruses and bacteria, capable of transmitting respiratory diseases to others. Read here to learn more.\n\nUnderstanding the characteristics and behaviour of these particles is critical for controlling the spread of respiratory infections, including common illnesses like the flu and the common cold, as well as more severe diseases such as tuberculosis, COVID-19, and measles.\n\nTable of Contents\n\nTransmission of pathogens through the air\nCharacteristics of Infectious Respiratory Particles\nControl Measures\nWhy in the news?\nConclusion\nTransmission of pathogens through the air\n\nFollowing consultation with public health agencies and experts, the World Health Organization (WHO) published a global technical consultation report introducing updated terminology for pathogens that are transmitted through the air.\n\nThe extensive consultation resulted in the introduction of the following common descriptors to characterize the transmission of pathogens through the air (under typical circumstances):\n\nIndividuals infected with a respiratory pathogen can generate and expel infectious particles containing the pathogen, through their mouth or nose by breathing, talking, singing, spitting, coughing or sneezing.\nThese particles should be\u00a0described with the term \u2018infectious respiratory particles or IRPs.\nIRPs exist on a continuous spectrum of sizes, and no single cut-off points should be applied to distinguish smaller from larger particles.\nThis facilitates moving away from the dichotomy of previously used terms: \u2018aerosols\u2019 (generally smaller particles) and \u2018droplets\u2019 (generally larger particles).\n\nThe descriptor \u2018through the air\u2019 can be used in a general way to characterize an infectious disease where the main mode of transmission involves the pathogen travelling through the air or being suspended in the air.\n\nUnder the umbrella of \u2018through the air transmission\u2019, two descriptors can be used:\n\n\ud83d\udc49 Which year are YOU targeting for success in the IAS/IPS/IFS Exam? \ud83d\ude80\n\n(1) \u21d2 UPSC 2025: Prelims cum Mains\n\n(2) \u21d2 UPSC 2026: Prelims cum Mains\n\n(3) \u21d2 UPSC 2027 Prelims cum Mains\n\nTip: Know more about ClearIAS Courses (Online/Offline)\n\nAirborne transmission or inhalation,\u00a0for cases when IRPs are expelled into the air and inhaled by another person.\nAirborne transmission or inhalation can occur at a short or long distance from the infectious person and distance depends on various factors (airflow, humidity, temperature, ventilation etc).\nIRPs can theoretically enter the body at any point along the human respiratory tract, but preferred sites of entry may be pathogen-specific.\nDirect deposition,\u00a0for cases when IRPs are expelled into the air from an infectious person, and are then directly deposited on the exposed mouth, nose or eyes of another person nearby, then entering the human respiratory system and potentially causing infection.\nCharacteristics of Infectious Respiratory Particles\n\nSize: Respiratory particles vary widely in size, generally categorized into:\nLarge Droplets: Typically larger than 5 micrometres in diameter. These droplets are heavy enough to quickly fall to the ground or surfaces within seconds to minutes, typically within a range of up to 6 feet (about 2 meters) from the source.\nAerosols (Droplet Nuclei): These are smaller particles, usually less than 5 micrometres in diameter. Due to their small size, aerosols can remain suspended in the air for hours and travel long distances with airflow.\nComposition: The particles consist of saliva or respiratory secretions, and can contain a variety of pathogens depending on the illness of the carrier.\nInfectivity: The ability of these particles to cause infection depends on factors such as the type and amount of pathogen they carry, the susceptibility of the person exposed to them, and environmental conditions (e.g., humidity, temperature).\n\nTransmission:\n\nDirect Transmission: This occurs when respiratory droplets from an infected person directly reach the mucous membranes (eyes, nose, mouth) of a nearby person. This is common during close contact.\nAirborne Transmission: Involves the inhalation of aerosols containing infectious agents, which can occur over longer distances and times than droplet transmission.\nFomite Transmission: Although not as common as direct respiratory transmission, infectious particles can settle on surfaces where they can survive for varying periods. Other individuals can acquire the pathogens by touching these contaminated surfaces and then touching their face.\nControl Measures\nVentilation: Improving indoor ventilation can reduce the concentration of airborne particles, thereby reducing the risk of airborne transmission.\nMasks and Respirators: Wearing masks or respirators can significantly reduce the emission and inhalation of infectious particles.\nPhysical Distancing: Maintaining distance from others reduces the risk of direct droplet transmission.\nHand Hygiene: Regularly washing hands can minimize the risk of touching surfaces contaminated with infectious particles.\nSurface Cleaning and Disinfection: Regularly disinfecting surfaces in high-touch areas helps reduce fomite transmission.\nWhy in the news?\n\nPathogens that transmit through the air will be described by the term \u2019infectious respiratory particles\u2019 or IRPs, according to the World Health Organization (WHO).\n\nThe world health body has thus ended the lack of a common terminology to describe the transmission of these pathogens, which was particularly challenging during the global COVID-19 pandemic.\nThe pathogens covered include those that cause respiratory infections, e.g. COVID-19, influenza, measles, Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS), severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), and tuberculosis, among others.\nThe announcement came following wide-ranging consultations across multiple steps in 2021-2023.\nThe publication, entitled \u201cGlobal Technical Consultation Report on proposed terminology for pathogens that transmit through the air\u201d, is the result of an extensive, multi-year, collaborative effort and reflects shared agreement on terminology between WHO, experts and four major public health agencies: Africa Centres for Disease Control and Prevention; Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention; European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control; and United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.\nThis agreement underlines the collective commitment of public health agencies to move forward together on this matter.\nConclusion\n\nUnderstanding the dynamics of infectious respiratory particles is crucial in managing outbreaks of respiratory diseases.\n\nPublic health policies, especially in the context of pandemics like COVID-19, heavily rely on insights about particle behaviour to formulate guidelines on mask usage, social distancing, and other preventive measures.\n\nEffective management of these particles through engineering controls (like ventilation), administrative controls (like occupancy limits), and personal protective equipment is vital in preventing the spread of infections in community settings.\n\nRelated articles:\n\nDiseases caused by microorganisms\nFungal diseases\nMicrobiome\nMicrobes in Human Welfare\n\n-Article by Swathi Satish"

They often provide innovative methodologies and supplement government efforts, particularly in urban areas.\nChallenges in ECCE in India\nAccess and Quality: Despite extensive coverage, disparities exist in access to quality ECCE, especially for vulnerable groups in rural areas, urban slums, and among different socioeconomic backgrounds.\nTraining and Resources: There is a varying quality of training and resources available to ECCE providers, which affects the standard of care and education across regions.\nInfrastructure: Many Anganwadi and pre-primary centres lack adequate infrastructure, which impacts the delivery of ECCE services.\nCoordination: Fragmented administration and the lack of a coherent integration between various departments (health, education, women and child development) often lead to inefficiencies in implementing ECCE programs.\nGlobal ECCE\n\nUNESCO regards ECCE as a fundamental and integral part of the education system and a solid foundation on which to build lifelong education, lives and careers.\n\nAll of its work in this area is aligned with target 4.2 of Sustainable Development Goal 4 which aims to \u2018By 2030, ensure that all girls and boys have access to quality early childhood development, care and pre-primary education so that they are ready for primary education.\u2019\nTo further advance this target, UNESCO established a new Global Partnership Strategy to bridge the gap and ensure that quality ECCE, early primary school years, and family education, are available for all children.\nWhy in the news?\n\nNational Framework of Early Childhood Stimulation 2024 lays down month-by-month activities to be conducted by parents, Anganwadi staff and ASHA workers for children from birth to the age of three.\n\nThe framework document has been finalised by an internal committee comprising representatives from the Ministry of Women and Child Development, the Ministry of Health and Family Welfare, the Department of School Education and Literacy, the Ministry of Education, the National Council of Educational Research and Training, the Institute of Home Economics, the Delhi University and civil society organisations.\nNavchetana \u2013 National Framework for Early Childhood Stimulation (ECS)\n\nThe framework document aims to fill the conceptual and practical gaps in understanding and implementing care and stimulation from birth until the first three years of a child\u2019s growth.\n\nChildhood Stimulation: Stimulation activities involve intentional efforts to activate the child\u2019s early development.\nNeed of ECS: At this age baby\u2019s brain is twice as active as an adult\u2019s brain and patterns of thinking and responding are established. At birth, only 25% of the eventual brain is formed, while 75% develops in the first 3 years of a child\u2019s life.\n\nKey highlights of the ECS Framework:\n\nObjective: To empower caregivers and Anganwadi Workers for holistic early stimulation, through responsive caregiving and opportunities for early learning, for optimal development of children.\nThe document emphasizes two of the five components of the nurturing care framework: \u2018responsive caregiving and \u2018creating opportunities for early learning\u2019.\nThe nurturing care framework for Early Childhood Development was provided by WHO in 2018.\nEntails 36 sets of activities for children from months 0 to 36 for holistic stimulation of the child\u2019s cognitive socio-emotional, language, physical, and creative development.\nConclusion\n\nThe government, along with various stakeholders, is making concerted efforts to overcome these challenges.\n\nThe focus is on upgrading the curriculum, improving infrastructure, training the workforce, and better integrating health and nutritional aspects with educational content.\n\nThe goal is to ensure a comprehensive approach to early childhood development that can effectively lay the foundation for future learning and the well-being of every child in India.\n\nContinued investments in ECCE are seen as essential for harnessing India\u2019s demographic dividend and promoting sustainable economic growth by contributing to the development of a well-rounded, healthy, and educated future workforce.\n\nRelated articles:\n\nEducation in India\nPoshan bhi padhai bhi\n\n-Article by Swathi Satish"

Developed in collaboration with the US, Arrow-2 can intercept ballistic missiles within the atmosphere.\nArrow-3 has the capability of intercepting missiles outside the Earth\u2019s atmosphere and it was employed to intercept long-range missiles launched by the Houthi militia in Yemen. The Houthis are believed to be backed by Iran.\nThe David\u2019s Sling (or Stunner) is Israel\u2019s medium-range air defence system, which can intercept cruise missiles, ballistic missiles, and aircraft. With a range of 300 kilometres, it also has an advanced phased-array radar for easier detection.\nThe Iron Dome is Israel\u2019s indigenous short-range air defence system. According to the manufacturer Rafel, it was first employed in combat interception in April 2011.\nThe US-made Patriot PAC-2 and PAC-3\u00a0are air defence systems that can intercept a range of missiles and target aircraft and drones. Counted as among the oldest air defence systems, they were employed during the First Gulf War in 1991 for intercepting Scud missiles launched by Iraq.\nThe F-16 and F-35 fighter jets\u00a0play a major role in air defence, being equipped with air-to-air missiles.\nComponents of the Iron Dome System\nDetection and Tracking Radar: The system includes a radar unit developed by ELTA Systems, a subsidiary of Israel Aerospace Industries. This radar detects the launch of rockets and tracks their trajectory.\nBattle Management and Weapon Control (BMC): The BMC is the system\u2019s command and control centre, developed by mPrest Systems for Rafael. It analyzes data from the radar to evaluate if the incoming rocket poses a threat to populated areas or critical assets. If interception is deemed necessary, the BMC calculates the optimal timing and interception method.\nMissile Firing Unit (MFU): The MFU launches Tamir interceptor missiles, which are designed to detonate the incoming rocket or artillery shell in the air, minimizing damage and casualties on the ground.\nKey Features and Capabilities\nSelective Engagement: One of the unique features of the Iron Dome is its ability to calculate the trajectories of incoming threats in real-time. This allows it to determine whether a projectile is headed for a populated area or will land in an uninhabited zone. The system engages only those targets that pose a risk, which conserves interceptors and reduces operational costs.\nHigh Success Rate: The Iron Dome boasts a very high interception success rate, reportedly intercepting over 90% of projectiles that pose a threat to populated areas. This effectiveness is crucial given the dense civilian populations in many areas of Israel.\nRapid Deployment: The system is mobile and can be deployed rapidly to various locations as needed. Its flexibility allows the Israeli Defense Forces (IDF) to adjust defences as threats evolve.\nMulti-Threat Defense: While primarily designed to counter rockets and artillery, the Iron Dome has also been adapted to intercept aircraft, drones, and other aerial threats.\nOperational Use\nCourtesy: Indian Express\n\nThe Iron Dome has been operational since 2011 and has been used extensively to protect Israeli civilian areas from rocket fire from the Gaza Strip.\n\nDuring periods of intense conflict, such as the Gaza War in 2014 and more recent escalations in 2021, the system has intercepted thousands of incoming threats, significantly reducing casualties and property damage.\n\nA naval version of the Iron Dome to protect ships and sea-based assets was deployed in 2017.\n\nThe system quickly determines whether a rocket is on course to hit a populated area; if not, the rocket is ignored and allowed to land harmlessly.\n\nIsrael is also developing the Iron Beam to intercept incoming threats with laser technology. It is yet to be fully operational.\n\nCriticisms\nCost: The cost of intercepting a rocket is considerably higher than the cost of rockets it intercepts. Each Tamir interceptor missile costs approximately $40,000 to $50,000.\nPsychological Impact: While the system reduces physical harm, the psychological impact on populations within rocket range remains significant.\nNot Foolproof: Despite its high success rate, the system is not 100% effective. The volume of rocket fire can overwhelm it, and some projectiles do get through their defences.\nWhy in the news?\n\nIran-Israel tensions: Israel used a multi-layered defence shield to block Iran\u2019s mass drone and missile attack on Israeli territory overnight. Its defensive array includes short-range Iron Dome and long-range Arrow-2 and Arrow-3 missiles.\n\nThe Israeli Defence Force (IDF) said the Iranian attack was thwarted and only a few missiles landed in its territory, causing minimal damage to an airbase in southern Israel and injuring a child.\nIran had launched the attack in retaliation to an Israeli strike on its consulate in Damascus, Syria, earlier this month, killing several Iranian military commanders.\nThe IDF added that the Israeli air defence system intercepted 99 per cent of the incoming projectiles from Iran.\nThe United States, the United Kingdom, France and other Middle Eastern allies also helped defend Israel.\nConclusion\n\nIsrael continues to invest in improving the Iron Dome, including enhancing its capabilities against a wider array of threats and integrating it with other missile defence systems such as David\u2019s Sling and the Arrow system.\n\nInternational interest in the Iron Dome has also grown, with several countries considering adopting the system or components of it for their own defence needs.\n\nThe Iron Dome remains a critical element of Israel\u2019s national defence strategy and a significant technological achievement in the realm of missile defence systems.\n\nRelated articles:\n\nIndian missile systems\nIndia\u2019s ballistic missile system\nS-400 air defence system\n\n-Article by Swathi Satish"

            "[CONTENT]": "The Arctic plastic crisis is the growing concern over the accumulation of plastic debris in the Arctic region, which has significant and deleterious effects on the local environment, wildlife, and potentially human health. Read here to learn more.\n\nDespite its remote location and sparse human population, the Arctic is increasingly affected by global pollution, with plastics playing a particularly troubling role.\n\nDamage to the Arctic from the fossil fuel/petrochemical industry includes threats from chemicals, plastics, and climate.\n\nThese have combined to poison the lands, waters, and traditional foods of Arctic Indigenous Peoples, with ongoing health effects that threaten their cultures and communities.\n\nTable of Contents\n\nArctic plastic crisis\nSources of Plastic Pollution in the Arctic\nImpacts of Plastic Pollution\nImpact on indigenous communities\nMitigation and Response Strategies\nWhy in the news?\nConclusion\nArctic plastic crisis\n\nThe production and use of fossil fuels are the starting point for the problems faced by the Arctic related to plastics, chemicals, and climate change.\n\nPlastics are made from fossil fuels and chemicals (mostly petrochemicals, chemicals derived from fossil fuels).\nMore than 16,000 chemicals are used in plastics: 25% are known to be toxic and 66% lack hazard information. Chemicals and plastics are a global health and environmental crisis.\n\nThe Arctic is a hemispheric sink for chemicals and plastics that are transported on atmospheric and oceanic currents from lower latitudes through a process known as global distillation or the \u201cgrasshopper effect.\u201d\n\n\ud83d\udc49 Which year are YOU targeting for success in the IAS/IPS/IFS Exam? \ud83d\ude80\n\n(1) \u21d2 UPSC 2025: Prelims cum Mains\n\n(2) \u21d2 UPSC 2026: Prelims cum Mains\n\n(3) \u21d2 UPSC 2027 Prelims cum Mains\n\nTip: Know more about ClearIAS Courses (Online/Offline)\n\nEvidence shows that climate warming exacerbates the threats to the Arctic from chemicals and plastics and accelerates the rate at which these materials move and accumulate there.\nAs much of the economy begins shifting from fossil fuels to electrification, the industry is seeking to maintain and grow its operations by focusing on increasing plastics and chemical production.\nSeveral large oil corporations that operate in Alaska produce petrochemicals, and industry projections suggest that oil and gas used for petrochemicals will increase from less than 20% today to as much as 50% by 2050.\nThe industry\u2019s plan to increase fossil fuel operations in the Arctic is tied to their intent to focus on producing more plastics and chemicals, regardless of the harmful impacts on Arctic Peoples or the climate.\nSources of Plastic Pollution in the Arctic\n\nLong-Range Transport: Plastic debris reaches the Arctic through ocean currents, rivers, and atmospheric transport. The Gulf Stream, for example, is a significant conveyor of water and associated plastic waste from more populated areas to the Arctic Ocean.\nLocal Sources: Activities such as shipping, fishing, and military operations in or near the Arctic also contribute directly to the accumulation of plastics. Local communities contribute as well, though to a lesser extent, due to limited infrastructure for waste management in these remote areas.\nMicroplastics from the Atmosphere: Recent studies suggest that microplastics can be transported through atmospheric pathways, deposited by snow and rain, adding another layer of complexity to the problem.\nImpacts of Plastic Pollution\nWildlife: Marine and terrestrial animals can ingest or become entangled in plastic debris, leading to injury, impaired movement and feeding, and often death. Species at risk include seabirds, marine mammals like seals and whales, and polar bears.\nEcosystems: Plastics can absorb and transport chemical pollutants, introducing them into the food web. When ingested by organisms, these toxins can bioaccumulate up the food chain, affecting overall ecosystem health and resilience.\nHuman Health: Indigenous communities in the Arctic depend heavily on marine and terrestrial wildlife for subsistence. The contamination of these food sources with plastics and associated pollutants poses significant dietary and health risks.\nImpact on indigenous communities\n\nThere is a long history of resource exploitation and colonization of Arctic Indigenous Peoples\u2019 lands and waters, including by the fossil fuel/petrochemical industry.\n\nMore than 13 million people from over 40 ethnic groups inhabit the circumpolar north region and are at risk from plastics, chemicals, and climate change.\nRapid warming of the Arctic is forcing climate-induced community displacement and threatening food security.\nIndigenous Peoples are being pushed out of their traditional lands and losing access to traditional foods, sacred places, and other cultural practices due to the interlinking consequences of chemicals, plastics, and fossil fuels.\nMany of the multinational oil and gas corporations active in Alaska have long track records of environmental violations.\nAir pollution in the Arctic from their operations and their oil spills and releases of hazardous substances harm the environment and threaten Arctic Peoples\u2019 health, yet the costs of this damage have never been calculated.\nMitigation and Response Strategies\nGlobal Cooperation: Addressing plastic pollution in the Arctic requires international collaboration. Initiatives like the Arctic Council work to formulate policies that mitigate pollution, but global action to reduce plastic production and improve waste management is essential.\nResearch and Monitoring: Increased research efforts to better understand the sources, transport mechanisms, and impacts of plastics in the Arctic are crucial. Developing standardized methods for monitoring plastic pollution will help track progress and guide mitigation strategies.\nLocal Actions: Enhancing waste management infrastructures in Arctic communities and reducing local sources of plastic leakage into the environment can have immediate benefits. Education and community engagement are also vital to changing local practices.\nInnovative Solutions: Exploring new materials that are less harmful to the environment and investing in technologies for cleaning up existing plastic pollution can also contribute to long-term solutions.\nWhy in the news?\n\nA new report The Arctic\u2019s Plastic Crisis: Toxic Threats to Health, Human Rights, and Indigenous Lands from the Petrochemical Industry was launched by Alaska Community Action on Toxics (ACAT) and the International Pollutants Elimination Network (IPEN) on April 15, 2024.\n\nThe timing of the report is crucial as the negotiations for a Global Plastic Treaty will begin in Ottawa, Canada on April 23, 2024.\n\nThe report offers recommendations for a regenerative economy and a Just Transition, underlined by the principle that a healthy economy and a clean environment should co-exist.\n\nThe process for achieving a just transition should be a fair one that does not cost workers or community residents their health, environment, jobs, or economic assets. The report further recommends:\n\nEnding government subsidies to the fossil fuel and petrochemical industries and supporting clean, renewable energy and a toxics-free materials economy.\nStopping fossil fuel and petrochemical industry expansion and accelerating the shift to a clean, renewable energy future.\nAdopting policies and practices as defined in the Louisville Charter for Safer Chemicals and eliminating the production, use, and disposal of toxic chemicals and plastics.\nIntegrating the principles of the Just Transition framework.\nStrengthening and ensuring strong implementation of the international Stockholm Convention on Persistent Organic Pollutants (POPs Treaty) and instituting an effective, legally binding global Plastics Treaty.\nConclusion\n\nThe Arctic plastic crisis is a stark example of how global activities impact even the most remote regions.\n\nThe persistence and potential for long-term environmental harm posed by plastics demand comprehensive solutions that address both the symptoms and the sources of the problem.\n\nImplementing robust international policies, combined with local efforts and continued scientific research, is essential for protecting the Arctic\u2019s unique and vulnerable environment from ongoing plastic contamination.\n\nRelated articles:\n\nMicroplastics\nPlastic pollution\nEnvironmental racism\nPlastic overshoot day\n\n-Article by Swathi Satish"

            "[CONTENT]": "Marine cold waves, similar to their terrestrial counterparts, refer to sudden drops in sea temperatures that can have significant impacts on marine ecosystems, weather patterns, and local economies dependent on marine conditions. Read here to learn more.\n\nThe effects and causes of ocean warming are well documented. Still, events of marine cold waves are less frequently discussed than marine heatwaves but are equally important due to their potential ecological impacts.\n\nWhen surface temperatures plummet rapidly by 10 degrees Celsius or more over a day or two and persist for several days to weeks- the area is said to be experiencing a cold wave, opposite to the more familiar marine heatwaves.\n\nTable of Contents\n\nMarine cold waves\nImpacts of Marine Cold Waves\nResearch and Monitoring\nWhy in the news?\nHow climate change will impact marine ecosystems?\nWay forward\nConclusion\nMarine cold waves\n\nA marine cold wave occurs when sea temperatures drop sharply and remain significantly below the average for a prolonged period.\n\nVarious factors can trigger these events:\n\nUpwelling: Cold, deep ocean waters rise to the surface, usually driven by wind patterns that push surface waters away from the coast, allowing colder water from below to replace it. This is common along the western coasts of continents, such as the western coasts of North and South America.\nChanges in Ocean Currents: Shifts in ocean currents can bring colder water from higher latitudes or deeper ocean layers to typically warmer areas.\nAtmospheric Conditions: Prolonged periods of cloud cover, especially in tropical regions, can reduce solar heating of the surface water. Additionally, cold air outbreaks associated with polar or Arctic air masses moving over warmer ocean regions can also cool surface waters rapidly.\nImpacts of Marine Cold Waves\nEcological Effects: Sudden temperature drops can stress marine wildlife. Tropical species, which are typically less tolerant of temperature fluctuations, can experience high mortality rates during cold snaps. Coral bleaching events, often associated with high temperatures, can also occur due to cold stress.\nFisheries: Cold waves can lead to shifts in fish distributions and behaviours, impacting commercial fisheries and local fishing communities. Some species may move to deeper waters or different regions seeking optimal temperatures, affecting catch rates and economic returns.\nMarine Vegetation: Seagrass beds and kelp forests might be adversely affected by cold temperatures. These ecosystems are crucial as they provide habitat, nursery grounds, and food for various marine species.\nResearch and Monitoring\n\nIn March 2021, the beaches of South Africa saw several large marine organisms washed up on the sands. Giant bat-winged manta rays, Hulking bull sharks, Pufferfish, and about 260 animals from 81 species died.\n\n\ud83d\udc49 Which year are YOU targeting for success in the IAS/IPS/IFS Exam? \ud83d\ude80\n\n(1) \u21d2 UPSC 2025: Prelims cum Mains\n\n(2) \u21d2 UPSC 2026: Prelims cum Mains\n\n(3) \u21d2 UPSC 2027 Prelims cum Mains\n\nTip: Know more about ClearIAS Courses (Online/Offline)\n\nTo investigate the ramifications for marine fauna, the researchers tagged and studied bull sharks.\nBull sharks are a highly migratory, tropical species that only tend to travel to upwelling regions during the warmer months. With the onset of winter, they migrate back to warm, tropical waters.\nBeing mobile, they should have been able to avoid the local, cold temperatures, yet they perished.\nThe study showed that bull sharks actively avoid areas of upwelling during their seasonal migrations up and down the coast, even when upwelling isn\u2019t too intense.\nBut if marine cold waves continue to become more sudden and intense, fleeing or hiding may no longer be enough even for these megafaunas.\nFor example, in the event in South Africa that caused the death of manta rays and bull sharks water temperatures dropped from 21 degrees Celsius to 11.8 degrees Celsius in under 24 hours while the overall event lasted seven days.\n\nResearchers now say that in some parts of the world, incidents like the 2021 cold spell appear to be getting more common as currents change, with potentially lethal consequences for marine life.\n\nWhy in the news?\n\nA new study published in the journal, Nature Climate Change, has attempted to examine the effects of extreme marine cold waves in the oceans, which have not been very well researched before.\n\nResearchers from Australia, France, the UK and South Africa analysed the deaths of 260 marine organisms belonging to over 80 species affected in a single event off the South African coast in 2021, which, they discovered, was an extremely intense cold wave in the waters.\nThe researchers further discovered that these extreme cold waves increased in intensity between 1981 and 2022.\nThis is particularly dangerous for migratory marine megafauna species like bull sharks, which are operating dangerously close to their long-term thermal limits, the study explains, increasing their vulnerability to sudden and extreme temperature changes in the ocean.\nHow climate change will impact marine ecosystems?\n\nAs global temperatures rise, marine species migrate towards the poles, seeking water temperatures that match their historical living conditions.\n\nHowever, these migrations make them vulnerable to atypical cold events caused by sudden shifts in ocean currents or atmospheric conditions.\n\nThese cold snaps can be deadly for species not adapted to such fluctuations.\nTropical and subtropical species are particularly at risk because they are physiologically less capable of coping with rapid decreases in temperature.\nFor example, the bull sharks and whale sharks mentioned may face increased mortality or disruption in their migratory patterns when encountering these cold events.\nWhile the overarching trend is global warming, localized or short-term deviations such as marine cold waves highlight the nonlinear and unpredictable nature of climate change.\nThese anomalies can lead to unexpected ecological consequences, making it difficult for species to adapt quickly.\n\nThe complexity of climate change impacts, as evidenced by the dual threats of warming and cold snaps, underscores the need for robust, adaptive environmental policies.\n\nThese policies should aim to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and also enhance the resilience of marine ecosystems to withstand both predictable and unexpected changes.\n\nWay forward\n\nThe study of marine cold waves is crucial for understanding the full spectrum of climate variability and its impact on the marine environment.\n\nImproved monitoring through satellite technology, buoy networks, and oceanographic research helps predict and mitigate the effects of these temperature anomalies.\nThis research is essential for developing strategies to manage fisheries and conserve marine ecosystems in the face of sudden climatic changes.\nConclusion\n\nMarine cold waves are an important aspect of oceanic climatic phenomena that deserve more attention, especially in the context of global climate change.\n\nWhile much focus has been on warming trends and heatwaves, understanding the occurrence and effects of cold spells is equally important for comprehensive climate models and effective marine resource management.\n\nThe research suggests that if cold upwellings become more frequent and intense, sub-tropical and tropical marine megafauna will be pushed to the edge of their thermal limits.\n\nThe authors surmise that such cold upwellings can lead to contracts in megafauna habitat among mobile marine animals resulting in large-scale ecosystem changes in the oceans.\n\nRelated articles:\n\nMovements of ocean water\nEl Nino and La Nina\nOcean currents\n\n-Article by Swathi Satish"

Over time, heat and pressure increase as layers build up.\nCatagenesis: At depths and temperatures higher than those of diagenesis, the organic material transforms into kerogen, and then into liquid and gaseous hydrocarbons.\nMigration: Hydrocarbons migrate from the source rock to more porous reservoir rocks through tiny pore spaces or cracks, driven by the pressure gradient.\nTrapping: Hydrocarbons are trapped by non-porous rocks (cap rocks) that prevent them from reaching the surface, forming oil and gas reservoirs.\nTypes of Hydrocarbons\n\nThey can be classified into several types based on their structure and bonding:\n\nAlkanes (Saturated):\nStructure: Consists of single bonds between carbon atoms.\nGeneral Formula: Cn\u200bH2n+2\u200b\nExamples: Methane (CH4) and ethane (C2H6).\nProperties: Non-reactive; used primarily as fuels.\nAlkenes (Unsaturated with Double Bonds):\nStructure: Contain at least one double bond between carbon atoms.\nGeneral Formula: Cn\u200bH2n\u200b\nExamples: Ethylene (C2H4) and propylene (C3H6).\nProperties: More reactive than alkanes due to the double bond; used in chemical synthesis and as a precursor for plastics.\nAlkynes (Unsaturated with Triple Bonds):\nStructure: Contain at least one triple bond between carbon atoms.\nGeneral Formula: Cn\u200bH2n\u22122\u200b\nExamples: Acetylene (C2H2).\nProperties: Extremely reactive; used in welding (oxy-acetylene torches) and as a chemical building block.\nAromatic Hydrocarbons (Arenes):\nStructure: Contain rings of carbon atoms with alternating double bonds (aromatic rings).\nExamples: Benzene (C6H6) and toluene (C7H8).\nProperties: Stable due to their aromatic rings; used in the manufacture of dyes, detergents, and explosives.\nHydrocarbon extraction\n\nHydrocarbon extraction is a complex process that involves multiple steps from the geological formation of hydrocarbons to their extraction and usage.\n\nUnderstanding this process is crucial for evaluating both the technical challenges and environmental impacts associated with hydrocarbons, particularly fossil fuels like oil and natural gas.\n\nExtraction Methods\n\nThe extraction varies depending on their state (liquid or gas) and location:\n\nDrilling: The most common method involves drilling a well into the earth to reach the reservoir rock containing oil or gas.\nOnshore drilling typically occurs on land.\nOffshore drilling involves drilling wells on ocean floors, which can be technically challenging and more expensive.\nFracking (Hydraulic Fracturing): This method is used particularly for extracting shale gas and tight oil. It involves injecting high-pressure fluid into the reservoir to fracture the rock and release the hydrocarbons.\nEnhanced Oil Recovery (EOR): Techniques like injecting steam, CO2, or chemicals to increase the amount of oil that can be extracted from a well.\nEnvironmental Impact\n\nThe extraction and use of hydrocarbons have significant environmental implications:\n\nAir Pollution: Combustion of fossil fuels releases pollutants such as nitrogen oxides, sulfur dioxide, particulate matter, and volatile organic compounds into the atmosphere.\nWater Contamination: Hydraulic fracturing can lead to contamination of groundwater if chemicals used in the process seep into freshwater aquifers. Spills and leaks during drilling and transportation also pose risks to water bodies.\nHabitat Disruption: Both onshore and offshore drilling can disrupt local ecosystems. Onshore, the construction of access roads, installation of equipment, and land clearing can fragment habitats and displace wildlife. Offshore, drilling can disturb marine life through noise, pollution, and physical barriers.\nClimate Change: They are major sources of carbon dioxide when burned, contributing to global warming. Methane, a potent greenhouse gas, can also leak from oil and natural gas systems.\nSeismic Activity: Processes like hydraulic fracturing have been linked to an increase in seismic activity (induced earthquakes) due to the alteration of stresses in the earth\u2019s crust.\nHydrocarbon sector in India\n\nIn January 2024, India signed a MoU with Guyana on cooperation in the hydrocarbon sector. The proposed MoU covers:\n\nthe complete value chain of the hydrocarbon sector including sourcing of crude oil from Guyana,\nparticipation of Indian companies in the Exploration and Production (E&P) sector of Guyana,\ncooperation in the areas of crude Oil refining,\ncapacity building,\nStrengthening bilateral trade,\ncollaboration in the natural gas sector, collaboration in developing regulatory policy framework in the oil & gas sector in Guyana;\nCooperation in the area of clean energy including biofuels as well as the renewables sector including solar energy etc.\n\nConventional hydrocarbons\n\nIndia has 26 sedimentary basins covering an area of 3.36 million square kilometres.\nThe sedimentary basins of India, on land and offshore up to the 400m isobath, have an aerial extent of about 2.04 million sq. km.\nIn the deepwater beyond the 400m isobath, the sedimentary area has been estimated to be about 1.32 million square kilometres.\n\nUnconventional hydrocarbons\n\nCoal Bed Methane (CBM) Resources: The estimated CBM resources are of the order of 2,600 billion Cubic Metres (BCM) or 91.8 trillion Cubic Feet (TCF) spread over 11 States in the country.\nShale Gas/Oil Resources: It is estimated that several sedimentary basins (Gangetic Plain, Gujarat, Rajasthan, Andhra Pradesh and other coastal areas) in India, including the hydrocarbon-bearing ones \u2013 Cambay, Assam-Arakan and Damodar have substantial estimates of shale gas and oil.\nGas hydrates: In India, Gas hydrate research and exploratory activities are being steered by the Ministry of Petroleum & Natural Gas under the National Gas Hydrate Program (NGHP). The presence of Gas Hydrate is established in Krishna Godavari, Mahanadi, Gulf of Mannar and Andaman Basin.\nConclusion\n\nGiven these environmental impacts, there is increasing pressure to transition to more sustainable energy sources and improve the environmental safety measures of hydrocarbon extraction processes.\n\nThis includes stricter regulations, better management practices, and the development of technology to minimize ecological damage.\n\nRelated articles:\n\nSedimentary basins of India\nOil and gas industry in India\nNeduvasal Hydrocarbon Project\n\n-Article by Swathi Satish"

They are stationary relative to a point on Earth, making them ideal for television broadcasts, weather forecasting, and telecommunications.\nMedium Earth Orbit (MEO): Located between 2,000 and 35,786 kilometres above the Earth, these satellites are typically used for navigation systems like the Global Positioning System (GPS).\nLow Earth Orbit (LEO): Orbiting between 160 and 2,000 kilometres above the Earth, LEO satellites are primarily used for data communication such as email, video conferencing, and quickly updating scientific data.\nAdvantages of Satellite Communication\nWide Coverage: Satellites can cover a large portion of the Earth, making them effective for broadcasting across vast areas where laying cables is impractical.\nMobility: Satellite communication enables mobile data and voice services in remote or mobile environments, such as ships at sea, vehicles in remote areas, and handheld GPS devices.\nDisaster Recovery: Satellites play a critical role in emergency communications when terrestrial networks are unavailable due to natural or human-made disasters.\nBroadcast and Multicast Capabilities: Satellites are particularly effective for TV and radio broadcasting, enabling one-to-many communications efficiently.\nDisadvantages of Satellite Communication\nCost: Launching satellites and building and maintaining ground stations is very costly. The technology and infrastructure required are also complex.\nPropagation Delay: Because of the long distance between satellites and the Earth, there is a noticeable delay (approximately 240 milliseconds for a round trip to a GEO satellite), which can affect communication efficiency, particularly for voice and real-time data.\nInterference and Physical Obstructions: Satellite signals can be interfered with by buildings, trees, and other obstacles, particularly for lower orbit satellites.\nVulnerability to Space Weather and Debris: Satellites can be damaged by space weather like solar flares or collisions with space debris.\nIndian Communication satellites\nINSAT Series\n\nThe Indian National Satellite System (INSAT) is one of the largest domestic communication satellite systems in the Asia-Pacific region.\n\nEstablished in 1983 with the commissioning of INSAT-1B, it initiated a major revolution in India\u2019s communications sector and sustained the same later.\nThe INSAT system with more than 200 transponders in the C, Extended C and Ku-bands provides services to telecommunications, television broadcasting, satellite newsgathering, societal applications, weather forecasting, disaster warning and Search and Rescue operations.\nBroadcasting: Television and radio broadcasting, are especially important for reaching India\u2019s rural and remote areas.\nTelecommunications: Facilitating telecommunication networks, including teleconferences and tele-education networks.\nMeteorological Services: Providing vital weather forecasting and surveillance services.\nDisaster Management: Offering critical communication capabilities during disasters and emergencies.\nGSAT Series\n\nThe GSAT (Geo-Stationary Satellite) series is an extension of the INSAT series that focuses specifically on communication capabilities.\n\nThese satellites are placed in geostationary orbit and are used to support telecommunication, television broadcasting, satellite newsgathering, societal applications, weather forecasting, disaster warning, and search and rescue operations.\n\nGSAT-15: Launched in November 2015, GSAT-15 is designed to provide telecommunications services, DTH television services, digital satellite news gathering, and tiny aperture terminal (VSAT) communications across India.\nGSAT-29: Launched in November 2018, this high-throughput communication satellite aims to meet the communication requirements of users in remote areas of India.\nGSAT-30: Launched in January 2020 as a replacement for INSAT-4A, this satellite is intended to provide high-quality television, telecommunications, and broadcasting services.\nNAVIC\n\nWhile primarily a navigation system, the Navigation with Indian Constellation (NAVIC) also has implications for communications, particularly in enhancing the capabilities of mobile devices and communications in rural areas.\n\nFuture Projects\n\nISRO continues to expand its capabilities with new projects such as:\n\nGSAT-20: Planned as a high-throughput satellite, it is expected to provide significant improvements to internet services across India, particularly benefiting rural and remote areas with limited connectivity.\nLegal provisions in India\nUnder Telecommunications Act, 2023 satellite communication companies can get spectrum without auction for point-to-point communications.\nThe Department of Telecommunication (DoT) issues Global Mobile Personal Communications by Satellite (GMPCS) Licenses for satellite telephony.\nEarlier, Bharati Group and Reliance Group were issued GMPCS licenses.\nWhy in the news?\n\nChinese scientists have developed the world\u2019s first satellite capable of enabling smartphone calls directly, without the need for ground-based infrastructure like cellular towers.\n\nThe satellite is named \u2018Tiantong,\u2019 which means \u201cconnecting with heaven\u201d.\nThe initiative draws inspiration from the biblical story of the Tower of Babel, aiming to bridge communication gaps rather than create them.\nThe Tiantong-1 satellite series, which began with its first launch on August 6, 2016, now includes three satellites in a geosynchronous orbit at 36,000km, covering the entire Asia-Pacific region.\nIn September 2023, Huawei Technologies launched the world\u2019s first smartphone that supported satellite calls by directly connecting to the Tiantong satellites.\nTiantong-1 Satellite series\n\nThe Tiantong-1 (TT-1) satellite series is an initiative by China to develop and deploy a system of communication satellites, aimed at establishing a mobile satellite communication network.\n\nThis series is part of China\u2019s broader effort to enhance its capabilities in satellite communications, expanding its reach both domestically and internationally.\n\nDevelopment and Purpose: The Tiantong-1 satellites are developed by the China Academy of Space Technology (CAST), a subsidiary of the state-owned China Aerospace Science and Technology Corporation (CASC).\nThe system is designed to provide stable, reliable mobile communication services such as voice, short messages, and data transmission across China and neighbouring regions.\nOperational Use: The TT-1 satellite system primarily serves commercial purposes, focusing on providing communication services to mobile users in remote and rural areas, as well as supporting communication requirements during emergency or rescue missions.\nIt is an integral component of China\u2019s strategy to boost its technological infrastructure in areas that are traditionally underserved by terrestrial communication networks.\n\nLaunches and Configuration:\n\nThe first satellite in the series, TT-1 01, was launched on August 6, 2016, aboard a Long March 3B rocket from the Xichang Satellite Launch Center.\nIt operates in a geostationary orbit, providing stable coverage over China and surrounding areas.\nSubsequent Satellites: Following the initial launch, additional satellites, including Tiantong-1 02 and Tiantong-1 03, have been launched to expand and enhance the network\u2019s coverage and capacity.\nThese launches help ensure redundancy, improved network reliability, and expanded coverage potentially including other parts of Asia, the Middle East, and Africa.\n\nSatellite Features:\n\nThe TT-1 satellites are equipped with transponders that operate in the S-band spectrum.\nThe use of the S-band allows for efficient mobile communication, which is less prone to interference and signal attenuation caused by atmospheric conditions, thus ensuring more reliable communication services.\nAlongside the satellite network, the Tiantong-1 system relies on a series of ground stations spread across China.\nThese stations manage the satellite operations, handle the communication traffic, and ensure the integration of the satellite network with terrestrial communication networks.\n\nStrategic Importance:\n\nThe Tiantong-1 satellite series is a significant part of China\u2019s ambitions in space and communication technology sectors.\n\nIt complements other satellite communication systems and navigation systems like BeiDou (China\u2019s alternative to the Global Positioning System) by providing strategic communication capabilities.\nIt also plays a role in China\u2019s \u201cOne Belt, One Road\u201d initiative by potentially offering communication services along the Silk Road Economic Belt and the 21st-century Maritime Silk Road.\nCurrent Trends\nThe satellite communication field is evolving with advancements in satellite technology, such as the deployment of large constellations of small satellites in LEO to improve internet connectivity globally (projects like SpaceX\u2019s Starlink).\nThere\u2019s also growing interest in using more advanced materials and propulsion technologies to reduce costs and extend the operational life of satellites.\nConclusion\n\nSatellite communication remains a crucial technology for global connectivity, especially in underserved or difficult-to-reach areas, despite the emergence of alternative technologies like fibre optics.\n\nAs technology advances, the effectiveness, affordability, and applications of satellite communication are expected to expand significantly.\n\nChina plans to continue expanding its satellite communication capabilities, potentially adding more satellites to the Tiantong-1 series.\n\nThis expansion aims to enhance global coverage, increase capacity, and improve the quality of communication services, making China a significant player in the global satellite communication market.\n\nThe Tiantong-1 satellite series represents a critical step in China\u2019s broader space strategy, which includes enhancing national security, technological prowess, and international cooperation and competition in the increasingly strategic space and satellite sectors.\n\nRelated articles:\n\nIndian space program\nSpace economy\nPrivatisation of the Indian Space sector\nZero orbital debris\nSatellite-Based Tolling System\n\n-Article by Swathi Satish"

            "[CONTENT]": "Iran-Israel relations have been markedly hostile, with no formal diplomatic ties and a history fraught with conflict, rhetoric, and proxy wars. This hostility can be traced through several phases from the establishment of Israel in 1948, the Iranian Revolution in 1979, and the subsequent developments to the present day. Read here to know more.\n\nThere are four main periods in the history of Iran-Israel relations: the tumultuous 1947-1953 period, the friendly Pahlavi dynasty period 1953-1979, the deteriorating 1979-1990 period after the Iranian Revolution, and the current open hostilities that have continued since the Gulf War ended in 1991.\n\n13 nations, including Iran, voted against the United Nations Partition Plan for the British Mandate of Palestine in 1947. It was Iran that voted against Israel\u2019s UN admittance two years later as well.\n\nTable of Contents\n\nIran-Israel Relations: Historical Background\nContinued Tensions and Conflict\nInternational Diplomacy and Alliances\nWhy in the news?\nIran\u2019s relations with other middle-eastern nations\nCurrent State and Future Prospects\nIran-Israel Relations: Historical Background\n\nPre-1979 Iranian Revolution:\n\nEarly Relations: Post-1948, Iran was among the Muslim-majority countries that did not recognize the state of Israel. However, the practical realities of geopolitical and strategic interests led to a somewhat covert relationship between the two.\nIran was the second Muslim-majority country to recognize Israel as a sovereign state after Turkey.\nThe Pahlavi Dynasty: Under the rule of Mohammad Reza Shah Pahlavi, Iran and Israel had secret but substantive diplomatic, economic, and military ties. Iran supplied Israel with oil, while Israel helped Iran with agricultural development, military hardware, and intelligence.\nStrategic Alliance: During this time, both countries saw benefits in collaboration, mainly as a counterbalance to Arab nationalist movements and the influence of the Soviet Union in the Middle East.\n\nPost-1979 Iranian Revolution:\n\nThe Shah\u2019s overthrow and the Islamic Republic\u2019s establishment under Ayatollah Khomeini marked a dramatic shift. Khomeini vehemently opposed Western influence in the Middle East and viewed Israel as a \u201clittle Satan\u201d allied with the \u201cGreat Satan,\u201d the United States.\nIran severed all diplomatic ties with Israel and has since been a staunch supporter of Palestinian militant groups, including Hamas in Gaza and Hezbollah in Lebanon, both of which are committed to Israel\u2019s destruction.\nContinued Tensions and Conflict\n\nIdeological Opposition:\n\n\ud83d\udc49 Which year are YOU targeting for success in the IAS/IPS/IFS Exam? \ud83d\ude80\n\n(1) \u21d2 UPSC 2025: Prelims cum Mains\n\n(2) \u21d2 UPSC 2026: Prelims cum Mains\n\n(3) \u21d2 UPSC 2027 Prelims cum Mains\n\nTip: Know more about ClearIAS Courses (Online/Offline)\n\nIran\u2019s government is committed to an ideology that sees Israel as an illegitimate state. Iranian rhetoric frequently includes predictions of Israel\u2019s demise and support for any party opposing Israel.\n\nNuclear Issues:\n\nOne of the greatest points of contention has been Iran\u2019s nuclear program. Israel perceives a nuclear-armed Iran as an existential threat and has repeatedly stated its position that it will take any necessary action, including military strikes, to prevent Iran from developing a nuclear weapon.\nAccusations and international sanctions have further complicated relations, with Israel being a vocal advocate for tough sanctions against Iran in international forums.\n\nProxy Wars and Regional Influence:\n\nBoth countries have engaged in what is often termed a \u201cshadow war,\u201d where both states conduct covert operations against each other, including cyberattacks, assassinations of nuclear scientists, and strikes on military bases in Syria where Iranian forces are stationed.\nIsrael consistently targets Iranian positions in Syria, aiming to prevent Iranian military entrenchment and the transfer of advanced weapons to Hezbollah.\nInternational Diplomacy and Alliances\nIran\u2019s relationships with countries hostile to Israel, like Syria and, to a lesser extent, Russia, in addition to its support for proxy groups, are part of its broader strategy to increase its influence in the Middle East and counter Israel.\nMeanwhile, Israel has built alliances with other nations concerned about Iran, notably forming tacit ties with some Gulf Arab states, culminating in the Abraham Accords, which, while primarily normalizing Israeli relations with the UAE and Bahrain, also signify a strategic realignment in the region against Iran.\nWhy in the news?\nHow the Iron Dome works.\n\nIran launched a missile attack on Israel as part of its retaliation to a suspected Israeli air strike on its consulate in Damascus on April 1, 2024.\n\nThe U.S., Canada and the U.N. have condemned the Iranian air attack on Israel, with America reaffirming its \u201cironclad commitment\u201d to the Jewish nation and vowing to convene a meeting of the G-7 leaders on April 14, 2024, to develop a coordinated response to the brazen assault.\nIndia said it is seriously concerned over escalating hostilities between Israel and Iran, and called for immediate de-escalation of the situation.\n\nRead:\u00a0Iron dome: Israeli Air Defence system\n\nIran\u2019s relations with other middle-eastern nations\n\nIran\u2019s relations with Middle Eastern countries are complex and characterized by a blend of ideological, sectarian, and geopolitical factors.\n\nThese relationships range from deeply antagonistic to cautiously cooperative, influencing regional security, politics, and economic interactions.\n\nSaudi Arabia\n\nIran and Saudi Arabia have been regional rivals for decades, with their competition often described as a proxy war between the predominantly Shia Iran and Sunni-majority Saudi Arabia. The rivalry is deeply rooted in ideological, religious, and geopolitical differences, influencing conflicts in Syria, Yemen, and elsewhere.\nRelations have been particularly tense due to accusations of Iran supporting Shia militias throughout the Arab world and Saudi Arabia\u2019s support of Sunni counterparts. However, recent efforts, notably since 2021, show a potential thawing, with both nations engaging in diplomatic talks to reduce tensions.\n\nIraq\n\nIran has a significant influence in Iraq, especially following the U.S. invasion in 2003. Iran supports several Shia militias and political parties in Iraq, leveraging historical, religious, and cultural ties.\nThe relationship is sometimes strained by internal Iraqi politics and the challenge of balancing U.S. and Iranian interests, but Iran remains a crucial player in Iraqi affairs.\n\nSyria\n\nIran is a staunch ally of Bashar al-Assad\u2019s regime in Syria. It has provided substantial military support, including advisers, ground troops, and economic aid, to help Assad maintain power during the Syrian civil war.\nThis involvement is motivated by strategic interests, including maintaining a corridor of influence from Iran to the Mediterranean and supporting Hezbollah in Lebanon.\n\nLebanon\n\nIn Lebanon, Iran\u2019s main proxy is Hezbollah, a Shia Islamist political party and militant group. Iran\u2019s support for Hezbollah includes financial, political, and military backing.\nThis relationship has entrenched Iran\u2019s influence in Lebanese politics and has been a major point of contention with Israel and Sunni Arab states.\n\nYemen\n\nIran is alleged to support the Houthi rebels in Yemen, though the extent of this support is a subject of international debate. The conflict is often seen as another arena of the Saudi-Iran proxy conflict.\nSome view Iran\u2019s involvement as part of its broader strategy to expand its influence across the region, particularly at the expense of Saudi Arabia.\n\nTurkey\n\nRelations with Turkey are complex, given that both countries have significant regional ambitions. However, their economic ties are strong, with significant trade, especially in natural gas and oil.\nPolitically, they have had differences, particularly over the conflict in Syria and the issue of Kurdish independence. Yet, they often find common ground on issues like opposition to Kurdish independence and managing the flow of refugees.\n\nUnited Arab Emirates\n\nRelations with the UAE have been historically strained due to territorial disputes and Iran\u2019s broader regional policies. However, economic ties have remained robust, with Dubai serving as an important hub for Iranian business.\nRecent years have seen a slight improvement in diplomatic relations, particularly as part of broader regional dialogues.\n\nQatar\n\nIran has relatively good relations with Qatar, especially following the blockade by Saudi Arabia, UAE, Bahrain, and Egypt in 2017. Qatar shares a massive natural gas field with Iran and has coordinated with Tehran on exploitation strategies.\nCurrent State and Future Prospects\n\nAs of now, there is no indication of normalization of relations between Iran and Israel. Both countries continue to view each other with deep suspicion and hostility.\n\nThe prospect of future conflicts, either directly or via proxies, remains high, and any significant change would likely require a profound transformation in regional politics or the internal politics of either country.\n\nRelated article:\n\nIsrael-Palestine conflict\nIndia-Iran relations\nIndia\u2019s stand on the Israel-Palestine conflict\nIran nuclear deal\nChabahar Port\n\n-Article by Swathi Satish"

            "[META]": "Last updated on April 13, 2024 by ClearIAS Team",
            "[CONTENT]": "India\u2019s demographic dividend refers to the economic growth potential that can result from shifts in a country\u2019s age structure. This occurs mainly when the working-age population (15 to 64 years old) is larger than the non-working-age share of the population (under 15 and over 64 years old). This scenario provides a unique and potentially powerful boost to the economy, assuming it can be properly harnessed. Read here to learn more.\n\nThe demographic dividend is important for any country because it offers a potential economic boost facilitated by changes in the age structure of the population.\n\nThis demographic transition can yield powerful economic and social benefits if effectively managed and harnessed.\n\nA large working-age population can lead to increased production, consumption, and overall economic growth.\n\nIndia can position itself as a global hub for various industries due to its large English-speaking population and relatively lower labour costs.\n\nTable of

Mains\n\nTip: Know more about ClearIAS Courses (Online/Offline)\n\nDecrease in the fertility rate: As a country develops, its fertility rate tends to decline.\nChange in age structure: With fewer children per family, the youth dependency ratio (number of people 0-14 to those 15-64) decreases.\nIncrease in working-age population: A larger proportion of the population is in the working-age group, reducing the dependency ratio and potentially boosting the economy if jobs and effective policies are in place.\nIncrease in elderly population: Eventually, the working population ages, increasing the old-age dependency ratio, which can impact the demographic dividend.\nWhy the demographic dividend is critical for a country\u2019s development?\n\nThe demographic dividend provides a unique and potentially powerful boost to the economy, assuming it can be properly harnessed.\n\nIncreased Labour Force\n\nA primary benefit of the demographic dividend is the expansion of the working-age population relative to dependents (children and elderly).\nWith more people in the labour force and fewer dependents to support, a country can experience increased productivity and economic growth, assuming there are sufficient jobs to employ this growing workforce.\n\nEconomic Growth and GDP Increase\n\nWith a larger segment of the population working, there is a higher aggregate output which boosts the Gross Domestic Product (GDP).\nAdditionally, this productive workforce generates higher income, which can lead to increased consumption and investment, further stimulating economic growth.\n\nSavings Rate\n\nA younger working population tends to save more, especially in preparation for retirement.\nHigher savings rates within a country can lead to increased available capital for investment in economic projects and infrastructure, contributing to further economic development.\n\nHuman Capital Development\n\nA demographic dividend provides the impetus for governments to invest in education and health, enhancing human capital.\nWell-educated and healthy individuals contribute more effectively to productivity, innovation, and entrepreneurship within the economy.\n\nTechnological Advancement and Innovation\n\nA younger population is often more receptive to adopting new technologies and innovating existing ones.\nThis receptiveness can lead to faster technological advancements and heightened productivity, positioning a country as a competitive player in the global market.\n\nSocial and Economic Stability\n\nA well-employed working-age population contributes to social and economic stability.\nEmployment reduces vulnerability to social vices, economic crises, and political instability, fostering a more stable and secure society.\n\nGlobal Competitiveness\n\nCountries that successfully capitalize on their demographic dividend can enhance their competitiveness on the global stage.\nA productive, vibrant, and technologically adept workforce can attract foreign investment, boost exports, and enhance international economic relations.\n\nReduction in Poverty\n\nEconomic growth spurred by a demographic dividend can significantly reduce poverty.\nIncreased employment opportunities and higher wages enable more people to afford better living standards, healthcare, and education, contributing to overall economic and social well-being.\nIndia\u2019s Demographic Scenario\n\nIndia is considered to be in the midst of its demographic dividend phase, which began in 2005-2006 and is expected to continue until 2055-2056.\n\nThe country has a large and growing youth population, which theoretically provides a vast labour pool for industries and services.\n\nKey statistics and insights include:\n\nYouth population: India has one of the youngest populations in an ageing world, with a median age of 28 years, compared to 38 in China and the US, and 45 in Western Europe.\nWorkforce potential: India adds approximately 12 million people to its workforce every year.\nTotal fertility rate (TFR): The government\u2019s projected Total Fertility Rate (TFR) for the period 2021-2025 (1.94) and 2031-2035 (1.73) is higher than estimates from The Lancet study (1.29) and NFHS 5 data.\nThis suggests that India\u2019s population may stabilise below 1.7 billion earlier than 2065.\n\nPopulation growth in India has been slowing in recent decades from an annual growth rate of 2.5 per cent during 1971-81 to an estimated 1.3 per cent as of 2011-16.\n\nAll major states have witnessed a marked deceleration in population growth during this period; the slowdown in states with historically high population growth such as Bihar, Uttar Pradesh, Rajasthan and Haryana is particularly noteworthy.\nPopulation is now growing below 1 per cent in the southern states as well as West Bengal, Punjab, Maharashtra, Odisha, Assam and Himachal Pradesh.\nChallenges\nEmployment: Creating enough quality jobs is a significant challenge. The Indian economy needs to grow robustly and inclusively to employ its growing workforce adequately.\nEducation and skill development: Providing quality education and vocational training to equip its youth with the necessary skills to be employable in a rapidly changing global economy.\nHealthcare: Ensuring that the population remains healthy and productive through improved healthcare infrastructure and services.\nSocial and infrastructure services: Developing sufficient infrastructure, such as urban housing, transportation, and sanitation, to support its growing population.\nPolicy Implications\n\nTo harness the demographic dividend effectively, India needs to implement several strategic policies:\n\nEducation and Training: Policies that promote not just universal education but also focus on higher education and skill development tailored to meet the needs of various sectors.\nJob Creation: Economic reforms that encourage investment and job creation across sectors, including manufacturing, services, and agriculture.\nHealthcare Investment: Strengthening healthcare services to improve the quality of life and productivity of the workforce.\nInclusive Growth: Ensuring that the benefits of economic growth are widely distributed to include all regions and communities, especially marginalized groups.\nIs India going through a demographic transition?\n\nYes, India is currently experiencing a demographic transition.\n\nThis transition refers to the shift from high birth and death rates to low birth and death rates, resulting in changes to the age structure of the population that can potentially lead to economic and social benefits.\n\nDeclining Fertility Rates\n\nIndia has seen a significant decline in its fertility rate over the last few decades.\nFrom an average of about 5.9 children per woman in the 1950s, the fertility rate has dropped to about 2.0 children per woman as of recent estimates, which is around the replacement level fertility rate of 2.1.\nThis decline is due to a variety of factors, including increased educational opportunities for women, improved access to healthcare, and more widespread use of contraceptives.\n\nDeclining Mortality Rates\n\nAdvancements in healthcare, improved sanitation, better access to clean drinking water, and increased public health initiatives have contributed to a decline in mortality rates, particularly infant and child mortality rates.\nLife expectancy in India has also increased as a result, with people living longer than ever before.\n\nChange in Age Structure\n\nThe decline in both fertility and mortality rates has begun to alter the age structure of India\u2019s population.\nThere is a growing proportion of the population within the working-age group (15-64 years), which is larger than the non-working-age groups (children under 15 and adults over 64).\nThis shift creates a potential demographic dividend, where economic benefits can arise from having a larger workforce supporting fewer dependents.\n\nUrbanization\n\nIndia has also been undergoing rapid urbanization. More people are moving to cities in search of better job opportunities, education, and healthcare.\nUrban areas tend to have lower fertility rates than rural areas, further influencing the demographic transition.\n\nSocioeconomic Changes\n\nEconomic growth, increased educational attainment, and greater gender equality have also played significant roles in India\u2019s demographic transition.\nThese factors influence family size preferences, economic activities, and overall population dynamics.\n\nThe demographic transition presents both opportunities and challenges for India:\n\nOpportunity for Economic Growth: The increasing share of working-age individuals provides an opportunity for substantial economic growth if they can be effectively integrated into the workforce.\nChallenge of Employment: The key challenge is creating enough quality jobs to employ this growing workforce, which requires robust economic policies, investment in infrastructure, and fostering industries that can absorb large numbers of workers.\nNeed for Investment in Healthcare and Education: To maximize the potential of its demographic dividend, India needs to invest heavily in healthcare and education to ensure a healthy, skilled workforce ready to meet the demands of a modern economy.\nWhy in the news?\n\nThe World Bank has warned that the South Asia region including India was not making use of its demographic dividend as the pace of job creation in the region fell well short of the growth in the working-age population, even as it projected a strong 6.0-6.1% growth for 2024-25 for the region in its South Asia regional update, Jobs for Resilience.\n\nBetween 2000-2022, India\u2019s employment ratio fell by more than in any other South Asian country except Nepal.\nIndia\u2019s robust economic expansion has, however, kept the region\u2019s output growth stronger than in other emerging markets and developing economies.\nThe weak employment trends in the region were concentrated in non-agricultural sectors, the World Bank said, reflecting challenges in the institutional and economic climate, which had stifled the growth of businesses.\nAmong its recommendations to encourage the growth of employment were supporting the participation of women in the economy, increasing access to finance, increasing openness to trade, easing financial sector regulations and improving education.\nConclusion\n\nIndia\u2019s demographic dividend presents a significant opportunity, but it also poses substantial challenges.\n\nThe extent to which India can benefit from this demographic shift depends on how effectively it can implement policies that address employment, education, healthcare, and inequality.\n\nIf successful, the demographic dividend could significantly boost India\u2019s economic performance over the coming decades.\n\nIndia\u2019s demographic transition is a critical phase in its development trajectory. Effective management of this transition through policy and governance will determine how well India can capitalize on its demographic dividend to achieve sustained economic growth and development.\n\nAlso read:\u00a0China\u2019s Population Decline\n\n-Article by Swathi Satish"

Plastics that are not designed for circular use must be phased out, it added.\nIndia was among the few countries in 2019 to propose a global ban on single-use plastics. The idea was later widened, and the world agreed in March 2022 to draw up a global treaty on plastic pollution by 2024.\nThe\u00a0UN Plastic Treaty\u00a0represents a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity to spark global action against plastic pollution. But to achieve this, the treaty must be adequately scoped, negotiated, ratified and enforced with high ambition.\n\nThe success of these efforts requires cooperation among governments, industries, and individuals to enact and support measures that reduce plastic consumption and increase recycling and reuse.\n\nWhy in the news?\n\nIndia is among the twelve countries responsible for 60 percent of the planet\u2019s mismanaged plastic waste though the fast-developing South Asian nation\u2019s per capita plastic waste production is among the lowest in the world, according to a new report.\n\nThe Plastic Overshoot Day report by Swiss non-profit EA Earth Action also said global plastic waste generation has risen by 7.11 per cent since 2021.\nThe world is estimated to have generated 220 million tons of plastic waste this year, 70 million tons of which will end up polluting the environment.\nTwelve countries are responsible for 60 per cent of the world\u2019s mismanaged plastic waste: China, India, Russia, Brazil, Mexico, Vietnam, Iran, Indonesia, Egypt, Pakistan, the United States and Turkey.\nThough the report classifies India as a \u201clow-waste-producing\u201d polluter due to its low per capita plastic waste production (8 kg per capita per year), it said the country\u2019s expected mismanaged waste in 2024 will be 7.4 million tons, which is \u201cvery high\u201d.\nEarth overshoot day\n\nEarth Overshoot Day marks the date when humanity\u2019s demand for ecological resources and services in a given year exceeds what Earth can regenerate in that year.\n\nThis deficit is maintained by liquidating stocks of ecological resources and accumulating waste, primarily carbon dioxide in the atmosphere.\nThe date of Earth Overshoot Day is announced each year on June 5.\nThe event is hosted and calculated by Global Footprint Network, an international research organization that provides decision-makers with a menu of tools to help the human economy operate within Earth\u2019s ecological limits.\n\nTo determine the date of Earth Overshoot Day for each year, Global Footprint Network calculates the number of days of that year that Earth\u2019s biocapacity suffices to provide for humanity\u2019s Ecological Footprint. The remainder of the year corresponds to a global overshoot.\n\nEarth Overshoot Day is computed by dividing the planet\u2019s biocapacity (the amount of ecological resources Earth can generate that year), by humanity\u2019s Ecological Footprint (humanity\u2019s demand for that year), and multiplying by 365, the number of days in a year:\n\n(Earth\u2019s Biocapacity / Humanity\u2019s Ecological Footprint) x 365 = Earth Overshoot Day\n\nConclusion\n\nWhile Plastic Overshoot Day is not as widely recognized as Earth Overshoot Day, it serves a similar purpose in emphasizing the need for immediate action to address the ecological impacts of our current plastic consumption patterns.\n\nIt encourages a shift towards more sustainable practices and technologies that reduce our plastic footprint and protect the environment for future generations.\n\nRelated articles:\n\n\u00a0Microplastics\nPlastic waste management\n\n-Article by Swathi Satish"

This may involve multiple channels like SMS, radio, TV, and internet-based communications to ensure broad coverage.\nResponse Capability: Preparedness and emergency response plans that are well-practised and can be activated swiftly once a warning is issued. This includes training for emergency responders and public awareness campaigns.\nChallenges\n\nDespite the urgent need, only half of the countries worldwide report having adequate multi-hazard early warning systems.\n\nAnd even fewer have regulatory frameworks that connect early warnings to emergency and response plans. There also are big gaps in the global observing system required to generate forecasts.\n\nAccuracy and Timeliness: Balancing the need for timely warnings with the risk of false alarms, can lead to complacency among the population.\nReach and Accessibility: Ensuring that warnings reach all segments of the population, including vulnerable groups like the elderly, disabled, or those in remote areas.\nIntegration and Coordination: Coordinating between different agencies and sectors to ensure a unified and effective response.\n\nClimate, weather and water-related extremes have led to 15 times more deadly hazards for people in Africa, South Asia, South and Central America, and small island states.\n\nVulnerable, least-developed countries that have not contributed significantly to the climate crisis are bearing the brunt.\nOver the last 50 years, nearly 70 per cent of all deaths from climate-related disasters have occurred in the 46 poorest countries.\n\nLeveraging new technologies such as artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning for better prediction and analysis, and using advanced communication tools to disseminate warnings more effectively should be prioritised.\n\nEarly Warning for All\n\nEarly Warnings for All is a groundbreaking initiative to ensure that everyone on Earth is protected from hazardous weather, water, or climate events through life-saving early warning systems by the end of 2027.\n\nAs part of the UN Secretary-General\u2019s Acceleration Agenda, the Early Warnings for All initiative is a key contribution to delivering climate justice to those at the frontlines of the climate crisis.\nIt aligns with the priorities of the Paris Agreement and supports key provisions of the Sendai Framework for Disaster Risk Reduction, particularly Target G on the availability and accessibility of multi-hazard early warning systems.\nIt also contributes to delivering the targets of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development on poverty, hunger, health, water, clean energy, climate action and sustainable cities.\n\nFour pillars:\n\nDisaster risk knowledge and management:\u00a0Ensuring all countries have access to reliable, understandable and relevant risk information, science and expertise (led by\u00a0UNDRR).\nDetection, observation, monitoring, analysis, and forecasting:\u00a0Ensuring all countries have robust forecast and monitoring systems (both soft and hardware infrastructure) and enabling policies to support optimization and sustainability of hazard monitoring and early warning systems (led by\u00a0WMO).\nWarning dissemination and communication:\u00a0Using a people-centred approach to ensure that early warnings are effectively and timely disseminated to reach everyone, especially those most at risk (led by ITU).\nPreparedness and response capabilities:\u00a0Ensuring local governments, communities and individuals at risk know and means to take pre-emptive early actions to prepare for and respond to incoming disasters upon receiving warnings (led by IFRC).\n\nThe Early Warnings for All initiative brings together the broader UN system, governments, civil society and development partners across the public and private sectors to enhance collaboration and accelerated action to address gaps and deliver people-centred, end-to-end multi-hazard early warning systems that leave no one behind.\n\nWhy in the news?\n\nIndia is helping Nepal, Maldives, Sri Lanka, Bangladesh and Mauritius develop early warning systems to reduce the loss of life and property due to extreme weather events.\n\nIndia\u2019s efforts are part of the \u2018Early Warnings for All\u2019 initiative announced by the United Nations in 2022.\nConclusion\n\nEarly warning systems are a fundamental component of modern disaster risk management strategies, reflecting an understanding that preparedness and prevention are far more cost-effective than disaster response and recovery.\n\nTheir effectiveness critically depends on the integration of technologies, human factors, and organizational frameworks.\n\nEarly warning systems have proven to be a cost-effective and reliable solution to protect lives and livelihoods from natural hazards such as floods, heatwaves, storms and tsunamis.\n\nWith 95 per cent of the world\u2019s population having access to mobile broadband networks and nearly 75 per cent owning a mobile phone, mobile networks have become powerful communication channels that can effectively target those in at-risk areas.\n\nRelated articles:\n\nDisaster and disaster management\nNatural hazards and disaster\nDisaster Management Act 2005\n\n-Article by Swathi Satish"

This includes designing launchers and satellites to minimize the release of debris.\nPost-Mission Disposal: Ensuring that satellites and upper stages of rockets are deorbited at the end of their operational life. For geostationary satellites, this often means moving them to a \u201cgraveyard orbit,\u201d while low Earth orbit (LEO) satellites can be deorbited to burn up in the Earth\u2019s atmosphere.\nPassivation: Emptying fuel tanks and releasing energy stored in batteries or other components to prevent explosions that could create additional debris.\n\nActive Debris Removal (ADR):\n\nRobotic Systems: Developing and deploying robotic systems or satellites equipped with nets, harpoons, or robotic arms to capture and deorbit large debris objects.\nLaser Systems: Investigating the use of ground-based or space-based lasers to alter the trajectory of debris, lowering their orbit to hasten atmospheric re-entry and burn-up.\nElectrodynamic Tethers: Exploring the use of electrodynamic tethers attached to debris to accelerate its deorbit by interacting with the Earth\u2019s magnetic field.\n\nInternational Collaboration and Regulation:\n\nGlobal Standards: Promoting international cooperation to establish and enforce global standards for satellite design, operation, and end-of-life disposal to prevent the creation of new debris.\nSpace Traffic Management: Developing comprehensive space traffic management systems to track and manage the movements of satellites and debris, reducing the risk of collisions.\nLegal and Economic Incentives: Implementing legal frameworks and economic incentives, such as levies or insurance schemes, to encourage adherence to best practices in debris mitigation and support efforts for active debris removal.\nChallenges to Achieving Zero Orbital Debris\nTechnical and Financial: The development and deployment of effective debris removal technologies are technically challenging and expensive. There is also the question of who should bear the cost, especially for removing debris that has been in orbit for decades.\nLegal and Political: Space is governed by international treaties and agreements that were not designed with debris removal in mind. Establishing a legal framework for active debris removal poses significant challenges, including liability issues in case of accidents.\nInternational Cooperation: Given the global nature of space activities and space debris, international cooperation is essential. However, geopolitical tensions can hinder collaborative efforts to address the problem.\nGlobal efforts\n\nEuropean Space agency\n\nAs part of the Zero Debris approach, ESA has updated its debris mitigation requirements and standards that will govern how the Agency\u2019s missions are designed, built, flown and disposed of, but also setting the rules for any company or institution that works with ESA on its missions.\n\nA study put forward eight recommendations to reach Zero Debris by 2030, which form the foundation of the recently published \u2018ESA Space Debris Mitigation Requirements\u2019.\n\n1) Guarantee successful disposal\n\nEnsuring the safe disposal of space objects is of utmost importance. \u2018Self disposal\u2019 through atmospheric reentry or orbiting to a safe altitude should be verified in advance of a mission\u2019s launch, with a probability of success higher than a certain minimum threshold (currently set at 90%).\n\n2) Improve orbital clearance\n\nBy reducing the time an object is in orbit, the smaller the chance that it will collide with another object and create further debris.\n\n3) Avoid in-orbit collisions\n\nCollision avoidance \u2013 manoeuvring a satellite out of the way of potential collision \u2013 is now a regular part of flying missions in low-Earth orbit. It comes at a cost as fuel is required and instruments are often turned off, meaning data is lost.\n\n4) Avoid internal break-ups\n\nEnhanced health monitoring and robust passivation techniques should be implemented to prevent satellites from breaking up from within, caused by system explosions from leftover fuel or energy from solar panels.\n\n5) Prevent the intentional release of space debris\n\nRecommendations emphasise that the intentional release of any \u2018Mission Related Object\u2019 \u2013 such as protective covers, lens caps, or rocket fairings \u2013 should be avoided to prevent further debris growth.\n\n6) Improve on-ground casualty risk assessment\n\nStandardised tools and methodologies should be developed for assessing the casualty risk, on the ground, of reentering objects, as well as for verifying assessments of how a mission will demise.\n\n7) Guarantee Dark and Quiet skies\n\nMeasures should be identified and implemented to minimise the impact of space objects on optical and infrared astronomy, as well as radio astronomy, to maintain dark and quiet skies.\n\n8) Beyond the protected regions\n\nOther orbits, such as those used by\u00a0Global Navigation Satellite System\u00a0(GNSS) constellations and lunar orbits, should also be considered and protected to ensure their long-term sustainability.\nAdapted Zero Debris recommendations should be formulated and applied beyond low-Earth orbit and Geostationary orbit.\n\nNASA\n\nThe NASA Orbital Debris Program officially began in 1979 in the Space Sciences Branch at the Johnson Space Center (JSC) in Houston, Texas.\nThe program looks for ways to create less orbital debris and designs equipment to track and remove the debris already in space.\nWhy in the news?\n\nPSLV accomplishes zero orbital debris mission:\n\nAnother milestone was achieved by ISRO on March 21, 2024, when the PSLV Orbital Experimental Module-3 (POEM-3) met its fiery end through a re-entry into the Earth\u2019s atmosphere.\nThe PSLV-C58/XPoSat mission has practically left zero debris in orbit.\nAfter it completed the primary mission of injecting all satellites into their target orbits, the fourth stage of the PSLV was transformed into the POEM-3.\nIt was subsequently de-orbited from 650 kilometres to 350 kilometres, rendering it more susceptible to being pulled towards the earth and burning up in the atmosphere.\nIt \u201cpassivated the stage,\u201d meaning dumped its fuel, to avoid an explosion that could have flung small pieces of debris into orbit.\n\nMay 2024: Twelve nations\u00a0have signed the\u00a0Zero Debris Charter\u00a0at the\u00a0European Space Agency (ESA) /EU Space Council,\u00a0solidifying their commitment to the long-term sustainability of human activities in Earth orbit.\n\nUnveiled at the\u00a0ESA Space Summit\u00a0in Seville in November 2023, the Zero Debris Charter aims\u00a0to achieve debris-neutrality in space by 2030.\nWay forward\n\nISRO will continue its commitment to providing a cost-effective orbital experiment platform.\n\nThe growing menace due to space debris, especially with multiple small satellite constellations coming up, poses a significant threat to space activities, including satellite launches, human spaceflight, and space exploration missions.\nISRO, being a responsible space agency, is committed to mitigating this threat through the development and implementation of advanced debris tracking systems, space-object deorbiting technologies, and responsible satellite deployment practices, thus safeguarding orbital environments for present and future space endeavours.\nConclusion\n\nAchieving zero orbital debris is a complex but essential goal for ensuring the long-term sustainability of space activities.\n\nIt requires a multifaceted approach combining technology, international law, and global cooperation.\n\nWhile the challenges are significant, the increasing recognition of the risks posed by space debris is driving efforts to find effective solutions.\n\n-Article by Swathi Satish"

The voters are not allowed to take it home as it is later used to verify votes cast in five randomly selected polling booths.\nThis system is designed to build trust in the voting process by giving voters the ability to physically verify their electronic votes, reassuring both voters and political parties about the integrity of the election.\nWhy did the Election Commission introduce VVPATs?\n\nNote: Subscribe to the ClearIAS YouTube Channel to learn more.\n\n\ud83d\udc49 Which year are YOU targeting for success in the IAS/IPS/IFS Exam? \ud83d\ude80\n\n(1) \u21d2 UPSC 2025: Prelims cum Mains\n\n(2) \u21d2 UPSC 2026: Prelims cum Mains\n\n(3) \u21d2 UPSC 2027 Prelims cum Mains\n\nTip: Know more about ClearIAS Courses (Online/Offline)\n\nThe concept of the Voter Verified Paper Audit Trail machine was initially proposed in 2010 during a meeting between the Election Commission of India (ECI) and political parties. The aim was to enhance transparency in the EVM-based polling process.\n\nFollowing prototype preparation, field trials of the VVPAT system were conducted in Ladakh, Thiruvananthapuram, Cherrapunjee, East Delhi, and Jaisalmer in July 2011.\nThese field trials led to the approval of the Voter Verified Paper Audit Trail by an expert committee of the ECI in February 2013.\nThe Legal Framework\n\nIn 2013, the Conduct of Elections Rules, 1961 were amended to allow for a printer with a drop box to be attached to the EVM.\n\nThe Voter Verifiable Paper Audit Trail machine was first used in all 21 polling stations of the Noksen Assembly constituency of Nagaland in 2013.\nThis led to its phased introduction decided by the ECI, with 100% adoption by June 2017 and the 2019 Lok Sabha elections became the first general election to have 100% of EVMs being attached to VVPATs.\nSupreme Court Interventions Related to VVPATs\n\nThe use of Voter Verifiable Paper Audit Trails in Indian elections has been the subject of several legal cases:\n\nSubramanian Swamy vs Election Commission of India: In this case, the Supreme Court ruled that a paper trail for votes was essential for free and fair elections. The court ordered the government to provide funding to roll out VVPATs across the country.\nChandrababu Naidu vs Election Commission of India: In 2019, a political leader named Chandrababu Naidu filed a petition asking the Supreme Court to order the counting of VVPAT slips from at least 50% of polling stations.\n\nHowever, the Election Commission argued that counting VVPAT slips from such a large sample would delay the election results by 5-6 days.\n\nThe EC also pointed to a study by the Indian Statistical Institute which found that counting VVPAT slips from just 479 randomly selected polling stations nationwide would ensure over 99% accuracy.\nUltimately, the Supreme Court sided with the EC but ordered them to increase the sample size from 1 VVPAT station per constituency to 5 stations per constituency.\nAdvantages of the VVPAT System\n\nThe incorporation of Voter Verified Paper Audit Trail in elections has several advantages:\n\nEnhancing Transparency: The paper slips generated by the VVPAT machines can be accessed by polling officials, providing a physical record that can be cross-checked against the EVM tallies in case of any disputes or allegations of fraud. This level of verification is essential in ensuring the fairness and accuracy of election results.\nStrengthening Public Trust: The VVPAT system offers voters a visual confirmation of their choice, which can help to allay concerns about the reliability of EVMs and strengthen public confidence in the democratic process.\nVerifying Election Results: In the event of any discrepancies or allegations of tampering, the VVPAT slips can be used to verify the accuracy of the EVM results, providing a physical record that can be used to resolve disputes.\nChallenges\n\nDespite the advantages, it has also faced its share of challenges and concerns:\n\nTechnical Malfunctions: One of the primary concerns with VVPAT machines is the possibility of technical malfunctions, such as inaccurate printing or no printing at all. These technical issues can undermine the reliability of the system and raise doubts about the accuracy of the electoral process.\nVerification of Paper Trails: The process of verifying the paper trails generated by the VVPAT system has been a subject of debate, with questions arising about the practical feasibility and scalability of this process.\nVoter Confidence: The recent revelations about the identification of over 6.5 lakh defective VVPAT machines, more than a third of the number used in the 2019 Lok Sabha election, have further eroded the public\u2019s confidence in the electoral process. The lack of transparency and accountability on the part of the ECI has led to questions about the fairness and accuracy of past elections.\nThe Way Forward\n\nTo address these challenges and strengthen the Voter Verifiable Paper Audit Trail system, the ECI and the government must take the following steps:\n\nRegular Maintenance and Testing:\n\nEstablish a robust system of routine maintenance and testing to identify and address any defects in the VVPAT machines promptly.\nEnsure that the maintenance and testing procedures are transparent and accountable, with clear protocols and procedures in place.\n\nIncreased Transparency:\n\nProvide more information to political parties and the public about the functioning of the VVPAT system and the process of verification.\nImprove communication and coordination with all stakeholders, including political parties, to address concerns and build trust in the electoral process.\n\nEnsuring Accountability:\n\nEstablish clear guidelines and procedures for addressing issues related to VVPAT machine malfunctions, and ensure that they are followed consistently.\n\nContinuous Improvement and Innovation:\n\nEncourage ongoing research and development in the field of electronic voting, to explore new technologies and innovations that can further enhance the accuracy, security, and transparency of the electoral process.\nCollaborate with leading research institutions and technology experts to stay abreast of the latest advancements and incorporate them into the VVPAT system.\nConclusion\n\nThe Voter Verified Paper Audit Trail (VVPAT) system is an important component of India\u2019s electoral landscape, serving as a testament to the ECI\u2019s commitment to transparency and the safeguarding of the fundamental right to a free and fair election.\n\nThe VVPAT system represents a significant milestone in India\u2019s democratic journey, offering a tangible way to verify the accuracy of votes and enhance public trust in the electoral process.\n\nBy addressing the challenges and continuously improving the VVPAT system, the ECI can play a vital role in solidifying India\u2019s position as a global leader in democratic practices and inspiring other nations to follow suit.\n\nArticle Written By: Priti Raj"

            "[CONTENT]": "Bilateral Investment Treaties (BITs) are agreements between two countries that establish the terms and conditions for private investment by nationals and companies of one country in the other country. Read here to learn more.\n\nIndia, like many other nations, has entered into BITs with various countries to encourage and protect foreign investments, stimulate economic growth, and reduce investment risks by providing a stable and predictable legal framework for investors.\n\nTable of Contents\n\nBilateral Investment Treaties (BITs)\nEvolution of Bilateral Investment Treaties\nEvolution of Indian Bilateral Investment Treaties (BITs)\nIndia\u2019s New Model Bilateral Investment Treaty (BIT), 2016\nWhy in the news?\nCriticism\nWay forward\nConclusion\nBilateral Investment Treaties (BITs)\n\nBilateral Investment Treaties (BITs) are agreements between two countries that establish the legal framework for investment by investors from one country in the territory of the other.\n\nThese treaties are pivotal in the international investment landscape, providing protection to foreign investors against unfair treatment and ensuring a level of predictability and security for cross-border investments.\nBITs are integral to encouraging foreign direct investment (FDI), fostering economic growth, and developing international economic relationships.\n\nKey Features of BITs:\n\nInvestment Protection: Bilateral Investment Treaties typically offer protections against expropriation without compensation, guarantee fair and equitable treatment, provide for the free transfer of funds related to the investment, and protect against arbitrary or discriminatory measures by the host state.\nMost-Favoured-Nation (MFN) Clause: This clause ensures that investors from the treaty-signing countries receive treatment at least as favourable as the host country\u2019s treatment of investments from any third country. It aims to prevent discrimination between foreign investors.\nNational Treatment: BITs often include a national treatment clause, which guarantees that foreign investors will be treated no less favourably than the host country treats its domestic investors in like circumstances. This promotes a non-discriminatory investment environment.\nDispute Settlement Mechanisms: Bilateral Investment Treaties provide for the resolution of disputes between investors and states (Investor-State Dispute Settlement, ISDS) and between the states themselves (State-State Dispute Settlement). ISDS allows investors to directly sue countries for alleged treaty breaches, typically through international arbitration.\nPre-Establishment and Post-Establishment Protections: Some BITs cover pre-establishment rights, offering protections from the moment an investment is contemplated, while others focus on post-establishment, protecting investors after their investments have been made.\nEvolution of Bilateral Investment Treaties\n\nOver the years, the scope and nature of Bilateral Investment Treaties have evolved. Initial BITs were often quite broad in their protections, reflecting a strong emphasis on investor protection.\n\nHowever, in recent years, there has been a shift towards more balanced treaties that consider the host state\u2019s right to regulate in the public interest, particularly in areas such as environmental protection, labour rights, and public health.\nThis shift has been partly driven by criticism of BITs, especially concerning ISDS mechanisms.\nCritics argue that ISDS can undermine national sovereignty by allowing foreign investors to bypass domestic courts and challenge government policies in international arbitration.\nThere is also concern about the transparency of the arbitration process and the potential for large financial awards against states, which could deter them from enacting policies in the public interest.\n\nIn response to these criticisms, newer BITs and model BITs proposed by various countries incorporate several reforms, such as:\n\n\ud83d\udc49 Which year are YOU targeting for success in the IAS/IPS/IFS Exam? \ud83d\ude80\n\n(1) \u21d2 UPSC 2025: Prelims cum Mains\n\n(2) \u21d2 UPSC 2026: Prelims cum Mains\n\n(3) \u21d2 UPSC 2027 Prelims cum Mains\n\nTip: Know more about ClearIAS Courses (Online/Offline)\n\nMore explicit carve-outs to preserve policy space for health, environment, and social regulations.\nImproved transparency in arbitration proceedings, including provisions for public hearings and the publication of documents.\nEnhanced roles for domestic courts, encouraging the exhaustion of local remedies before resorting to ISDS.\nProvisions for expedited review of frivolous claims to discourage baseless lawsuits.\nConsideration of sustainable development goals, integrating environmental and social considerations into the investment framework.\nEvolution of Indian Bilateral Investment Treaties (BITs)\n\nIndia\u2019s approach to BITs has evolved significantly over the years, especially in response to its economic liberalization in the 1990s and subsequent experiences with international investment arbitration.\n\nInitially, India pursued Bilateral Investment Treaties aggressively to attract foreign direct investment (FDI), signing its first BIT with the United Kingdom in 1994. Over the next two decades, India entered into more than 80 BITs with countries around the world.\nHowever, a series of international arbitration cases against India, initiated by foreign investors under various BITs, led to a reevaluation of its BIT strategy.\nA notable case was brought by Vodafone International Holdings B.V. against the Indian government, which raised concerns within India about the implications of its existing BIT framework on its sovereign right to regulate investments for legitimate public welfare objectives.\nIndia\u2019s New Model Bilateral Investment Treaty (BIT), 2016\n\nIn response to these concerns and challenges, India released a new Model Bilateral Investment Treaty in 2016.\n\nThis model treaty represents a significant shift from India\u2019s earlier BITs, aiming to balance investor protections with the government\u2019s ability to regulate in the public interest.\n\nKey features of the 2016 Model BIT include:\n\nNarrower Definition of Investment: The new model provides a more restrictive definition of what constitutes an investment, focusing on characteristics such as the commitment of capital and the expectation of gain or profit.\nExclusion of Most-Favored-Nation (MFN) Clause: Unlike many traditional Bilateral Investment Treaties, the new model does not include an MFN clause, which obligates countries to extend to each other any more favourable treatment given to investors from any third country.\nLimited Fair and Equitable Treatment (FET): The model specifies limited conditions under which investors can claim fair and equitable treatment, focusing on the denial of justice under due process.\nExclusion of Taxation Measures: The model excludes taxation measures from the scope of the BIT, responding to disputes that have arisen from tax-related measures in the past.\nPre-establishment Commitments Subject to Negotiation: The model does not automatically allow for the pre-establishment rights of investors (i.e., market access or the right to invest) but leaves these to be negotiated between the parties.\nInvestor-State Dispute Settlement (ISDS) Reforms: The model introduces a more stringent process for resolving disputes between investors and the state, including requirements for exhaustion of local remedies and a time frame within which claims must be brought.\nWhy in the news?\n\nThe Prime Minister\u2019s Office has directed the commerce ministry to review the existing model text of bilateral investment treaties (BIT) to enhance the ease of doing business.\n\nCurrently, only seven countries have accepted this model, with many developed nations expressing concerns, particularly regarding dispute resolution provisions.\nThese pacts are important as India has earlier lost two international arbitration cases against British telecom giant Vodafone and Cairn Energy plc of the UK over the retrospective levy of taxes.\nCriticism\n\nIndia\u2019s new Model BIT reflects a growing trend among nations to reassess their investment treaty policies in light of experiences with international investment arbitration.\n\nWhile it aims to protect the government\u2019s regulatory space, some critics argue that the model may be too restrictive and could potentially deter foreign investors due to perceived reduced protections and increased risks.\n\nWay forward\nUsing a Hybrid Definition: A hybrid definition of investment that combines elements of an asset-based and enterprise-based definition is necessary in light of foreign investors\u2019 aversion to risk.\nSuch a definition would guarantee that direct and indirect investments are protected under the Bilateral Investment Treaties while maintaining a negative list (to exclude those particular categories or sectors that the Parties believe appropriate) and also allowing room for exclusions for regulatory reasons by the State.\nAdhering to International Norms: India may consider amending the standard of treatment clause to incorporate the customary norm of protection of just and equitable treatment and bring it into compliance with international standards.\nAdditionally, the Model BIT\u2019s open-ended phrases need to be clarified thus reducing the disputes and BIT claims.\nConclusion\n\nCountries continue to negotiate, revise, and sometimes terminate Bilateral Investment Treaties as they seek to find an optimal balance between attracting foreign investment and preserving their regulatory autonomy.\n\nThe landscape of international investment law is, therefore, in a state of flux, reflecting broader debates about globalization, sovereignty, and economic justice.\n\nIndia has been actively renegotiating its existing Bilateral Investment Treaties based on the new model and has also served termination notices for several of its old BITs that it found inconsistent with its revised investment policy framework.\n\nThe impact of these changes on India\u2019s investment climate remains a subject of ongoing debate and analysis, balancing the need for foreign investment with the necessity of preserving the regulatory autonomy needed to achieve public policy objectives.\n\nRelated articles:\n\nIndia\u2019s Free

The measles vaccine is one of the most potent vaccines in our armamentarium today. But this is not the case with most other vaccines. One needs to take several boosters for a long protection. Why is this the case? Read here to learn more.\n\nThe perceived low durability of some contemporary vaccines, particularly those developed for rapidly evolving pathogens like the influenza virus and SARS-CoV-2 (the virus responsible for COVID-19), can be attributed to several factors.\n\nUnderstanding these factors requires a grasp of both the biological nature of the pathogens and the technological and immunological challenges of vaccine development.\n\nWhat variables make vaccine-induced immune responses last?

This high mutation rate can lead to the emergence of new variants that partially escape the immunity provided by existing vaccines, necessitating periodic vaccine updates or booster shots.\nAntigenic Drift and Shift: Influenza viruses undergo both antigenic drift (minor changes in virus proteins due to mutations) and antigenic shift (major changes due to the reassortment of viral genes). These processes can create new virus strains against which the population has little to no pre-existing immunity, making previous vaccines less effective.\nImmune System Response\nPrimary vs. Memory Response: Vaccines mimic infection, prompting the immune system to mount a response and create memory cells for future protection.\nHowever, the strength and longevity of the immune memory can vary based on the vaccine, the pathogen, and the individual\u2019s immune system. Some vaccines elicit strong, long-lasting immunity, while others may provide more transient protection.\nVariability in Immune Responses: Individuals can respond differently to the same vaccine due to factors like age, genetic background, and underlying health conditions.\nFor instance, older adults often have a weaker response to vaccines because of immunosenescence, the gradual deterioration of the immune system associated with ageing.\nVaccine Design and Technology\nLive Attenuated vs. Inactivated Vaccines: Live attenuated vaccines, which use a weakened form of the virus, typically offer longer-lasting immunity than inactivated vaccines, which use killed virus particles. However, live vaccines are unsuitable for all individuals, particularly those with weakened immune systems.\nSubunit, Recombinant, Polysaccharide, and Conjugate Vaccines: These vaccines use specific pieces of the pathogen (e.g., its protein, sugar, or capsid) to elicit an immune response. While they are safer and can be finely tailored to target key aspects of the pathogen, their induced immunity might not be as robust or long-lasting without boosters.\nHerd Immunity and Epidemiological Factors\nHerd Immunity Thresholds: The effectiveness of a vaccine in a population also depends on reaching certain herd immunity thresholds, which vary from pathogen to pathogen. Lower vaccine durability can mean that these thresholds are harder to maintain over time without booster vaccination campaigns.\nPublic Health Infrastructure and Vaccine Uptake: The distribution and administration of vaccines, along with public willingness to receive them (and booster doses as recommended), significantly impact the overall effectiveness of vaccination programs.\nWhy in the news?\n\nThe Hindu recently published a review of 34 currently licensed vaccines for the duration of their protective immunity.\n\nIt was found that only five vaccines provide long-lasting protection spanning more than 20 years and only three provide lifelong protection.\nOf these 34 vaccines, 15 provide 5-20 years of protection, whereas a similar number of other shots offer short-term protection that lasts around five years or less.\nHow can we improve the durability of vaccine-induced protection?\n\nDespite the vaccines\u2019 225-year success in controlling infectious disease, improving quality of life, increasing life expectancy, and generating substantial economic benefits, it is ironic that we are still learning how the best vaccines work and how to improve vaccine design to improve protective efficacy.\n\nMost of the current vaccines have been empirically developed. Vaccine durability assessment is also a \u2018wait-and-see\u2019 method due to ignorance of immunological memory mechanisms and challenges in measuring cellular components that induce long-lasting immune protection.\nRecent advancements are beginning to reduce our knowledge gaps in underlying mechanisms of vaccine-mediated protection and long-term immunity.\nWe may induce more effective and long-lasting immunity with fewer dosages by exploiting these nuances and optimizing immune response linkages.\nNatural infection-induced immunity is usually more persistent than vaccine-induced protection. Exploring this disparity is one approach to developing more durable protection vaccines.\nWay forward\n\nIn response to these challenges, research continues to evolve, aiming to develop vaccines that are not only rapidly deployable but also induce longer-lasting immunity.\n\nThis includes exploring novel vaccine platforms (like mRNA vaccines), adjuvants that enhance immune responses, and universal vaccines targeting conserved pathogen components to provide broad protection against multiple strains or even different viruses.\n\nConclusion\n\nUnderstanding the durability of vaccine protection is complex and influenced by the interplay of pathogen biology, host immune responses, vaccine technology, and public health strategies.\n\nContinuous research and surveillance are essential to adapt vaccination strategies to changing pathogen landscapes.\n\nRelated articles:\n\nTypbar Typhoid vaccine\nNasal vaccine for Covid\nGlobal Alliance for Vaccines and Immunisation (GAVI)\nUniversal Immunisation Program in India\n\n-Article by Swathi Satish"

            "[CONTENT]": "India is deploying atomic clocks across the country to synchronize all digital devices with Indian Standard Time. Read further below.\n\nIn a major move to enhance its timekeeping infrastructure and national defence capabilities, India is deploying its network of atomic clocks across the country.\n\nThis initiative aims to synchronize all digital devices with the Indian Standard Time (IST), ensuring uniformity and boosting national security.\n\nThe deployment of these highly accurate atomic clocks is being spearheaded by the National Physical Laboratory (NPL) under the Ministry of Science and Technology and the Ministry of Consumer Affairs.\n\nBy June this year, new atomic clocks will be installed in Bhubaneswar, Jaipur, and Hyderabad, complementing the existing ones in Faridabad and Ahmedabad.\n\nTable of Contents\n\nWhat are Atomic Clocks?\nWorking of Atomic Clocks\nWhy is India Developing its Atomic Clocks?\nEnsuring Uniformity and Seamless Synchronization\nConclusion\nWhat are Atomic Clocks?\n\nAtomic clocks are known for their exceptional accuracy and are considered the most precise timekeeping devices in the world.\n\nIt was invented in 1955 by Louise Essen.\nThese clocks function by utilizing the specific resonance frequencies of atoms, typically cesium or rubidium.\nThe extreme precision of atomic clocks is mind-boggling \u2013 they lose just one second in approximately 100 million years.\nCurrently, India has operational atomic clocks in Ahmedabad and Faridabad, maintained by the CSIR-National Physical Laboratories (CSIR-NPL).\nThe most commonly used types of atomic clocks are the cesium atomic beam, the hydrogen maser, and the rubidium gas cell.\nWhile the cesium clock offers high accuracy and good long-term stability, the hydrogen maser has the best stability for periods of up to a few hours.\nWorking of Atomic Clocks\n\nThe functioning of atomic clocks is governed by microwave electromagnetic radiation (ER).\n\n\ud83d\udc49 Which year are YOU targeting for success in the IAS/IPS/IFS Exam? \ud83d\ude80\n\n(1) \u21d2 UPSC 2025: Prelims cum Mains\n\n(2) \u21d2 UPSC 2026: Prelims cum Mains\n\n(3) \u21d2 UPSC 2027 Prelims cum Mains\n\nTip: Know more about ClearIAS Courses (Online/Offline)\n\nMaintaining the precise frequency of this radiation is important to induce quantum transitions in cesium or rubidium atoms.\nWhen the radiation is maintained at a specific frequency, it triggers the quantum transition (energy change) in the atoms.\nThese quantum transitions are then observed and maintained in a feedback loop, and the waves generated in these transitions are counted to arrive at the value of a second.\n\nCesium Atomic Clocks:\n\nThese clocks measure the frequency of transitions between two energy levels of cesium-133 atoms.\nBy definition, a second is the duration of 9,192,631,770 cycles of radiation corresponding to the transition between two energy levels of a cesium-133 atom at rest at a temperature of 0 Kelvin.\nCesium clocks use a beam of cesium atoms. The atoms are excited by microwaves, and the frequency of the microwave source is tuned until it matches the natural frequency of the atoms.\nThe accuracy of cesium beam atomic clocks can reach about one second in 100 million years.\n\nRubidium Atomic Clocks:\n\nThese are another type of atomic clock, using rubidium atoms instead of cesium.\nRubidium clocks are generally less accurate than the best cesium clocks but are more compact, require less power, and are used in many applications, including telecommunications and as the onboard timekeeping devices in GPS satellites.\n\nHydrogen Maser Clocks:\n\nHydrogen maser clocks operate using hydrogen atoms. They offer very high short-term stability and are used in scientific research, including space missions and in the measurement of the Earth\u2019s rotation.\n\nOptical Lattice Clocks:\n\nA newer generation of atomic clocks uses atoms cooled to extremely low temperatures and trapped in an optical lattice\u2014a grid formed by intersecting laser beams.\nThese clocks operate at optical frequencies, which are much higher than the microwave frequencies used in cesium and rubidium clocks, potentially allowing for even greater accuracy.\nWhy is India Developing its Atomic Clocks?\n\nThe initiative to develop indigenous atomic clocks was sparked by the denial of Global Positioning System (GPS) information during the Kargil War in 1999.\n\nThis event highlighted the need for India to have independent timekeeping capabilities for national defence, cybersecurity, and critical infrastructure operations.\nIndia is working to connect its atomic clocks via optical cables to bolster security against potential disruptions during emergencies or wartime, complementing satellite-based time dissemination.\nThis move aims to reduce reliance on foreign atomic clocks, especially for critical infrastructure like the Indian Regional Navigation Satellite System (IRNSS), also known as NavIC.\nDeveloping indigenous atomic clocks allows India to have complete control over its navigation systems, which is vital for both national security and technological independence.\nMost software operating modules, such as Windows and Android, rely on US-based Network Time Protocol (NTP) servers for timekeeping.\nBy establishing its atomic clock network, India can assert greater control over its digital infrastructure and reduce vulnerabilities to potential disruptions or manipulation from external sources.\nCurrently, only four countries \u2013 the United States, the United Kingdom, Japan, and South Korea \u2013 have developed their atomic clocks.\nEnsuring Uniformity and Seamless Synchronization\n\nIST was adopted on September 1, 1947, with only one time zone for the entire country.\n\nIt is calculated from the 82.5 degrees East longitude, near Mirzapur (Allahabad, UP), and is 5.5 hours ahead of Greenwich Mean Time (GMT).\nThe deployment of atomic clocks across India will play an important role in ensuring the seamless synchronization of all digital devices with the country\u2019s official time standard.\n\nThis will have far-reaching implications for various sectors, including:\n\nTelecommunications: It will enable precise synchronization of signals across telecommunication networks, ensuring optimal performance and reliability.\nFinancial Transactions: The accurate timekeeping provided by the atomic clock will be essential for secure and reliable financial transactions, including stock trading and online banking.\nScientific Research: It will support advanced scientific research and experiments that require extremely precise timekeeping, such as in the fields of astrophysics, quantum computing, and gravitational wave detection.\nNational Defence: Accurate timekeeping is crucial for the effective operation of India\u2019s defence systems, including satellite-based navigation, communication, and surveillance.\nTransportation: It will play a vital role in the synchronization of transportation systems, such as air traffic control, railway signalling, and maritime navigation.\nConclusion\n\nBy establishing this nationwide network of atomic clocks, India is taking a significant stride towards strengthening its technological capabilities, enhancing national security, and ensuring the seamless synchronization of its digital ecosystem.\n\nThis initiative represents a major step forward in India\u2019s quest for self-reliance and technological sovereignty in the 21st century.\n\nArticle Written By: Priti Raj"

Common applications include:\n\n\ud83d\udc49 Which year are YOU targeting for success in the IAS/IPS/IFS Exam? \ud83d\ude80\n\n(1) \u21d2 UPSC 2025: Prelims cum Mains\n\n(2) \u21d2 UPSC 2026: Prelims cum Mains\n\n(3) \u21d2 UPSC 2027 Prelims cum Mains\n\nTip: Know more about ClearIAS Courses (Online/Offline)\n\nNon-stick cookware (e.g., Teflon)\nWater-repellent clothing\nStain-resistant fabrics and carpets\nFood packaging (e.g., microwave popcorn bags, fast-food wrappers)\nFirefighting foams (especially those used at airports and military bases)\nCosmetics and personal care products (e.g., shampoo, dental floss)\nEnvironmental and Health Concerns\n\nThe persistence of forever chemicals in the environment and their ability to accumulate in the human body have raised significant health and ecological concerns.\n\nStudies have linked exposure to certain PFAS compounds to a range of health issues, including:\n\nIncreased cholesterol levels\nChanges in liver enzymes\nDecreased vaccine response in children\nIncreased risk of high blood pressure or preeclampsia in pregnant women\nChanges in birth weight\nIncreased risk of kidney or testicular cancer\n\nBecause of their persistence, PFAS can travel long distances in water and air, leading to widespread contamination of soil, groundwater, and surface water.\n\nThis contamination can affect drinking water supplies, agricultural products, and wildlife.\n\nRemediation Efforts\n\nRemoving PFAS (per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances) from the environment, particularly from water supplies, is challenging due to their chemical stability and resistance to degradation.\n\nHowever, several technologies have been developed and are in use for treating water contaminated with PFAS.\nThese methods vary in their effectiveness, cost, and practicality depending on the specific PFAS compounds present and the context of the contamination.\n\nKey methods include:\n\nGranular Activated Carbon (GAC) Filtration\nActivated carbon filters work by adsorbing PFAS compounds onto the surface of the carbon granules as water passes through the filter.\nPros: Effective for removing a wide range of PFAS compounds; widely used due to its simplicity and effectiveness.\nCons: Requires regular replacement of the carbon media; less effective for shorter-chain PFAS compounds.\nIon Exchange Resins\nWater passes through a bed of resin beads that have sites for ion exchange. PFAS compounds are attracted to and held by these sites, removing them from the water.\nPros: Can be more effective than GAC for some PFAS compounds; resin can sometimes be regenerated and reused.\nCons: Resin beds also need maintenance and eventual replacement; potential for PFAS to break through if the resin becomes saturated.\nHigh-Pressure Membranes\nReverse osmosis (RO) and nanofiltration (NF) are the most common types used for PFAS removal.\nThese processes use a semi-permeable membrane to remove PFAS molecules from water by size exclusion as water is forced through the membrane under high pressure.\nPros: Highly effective for removing a wide range of PFAS compounds, including shorter-chain PFAS.\nCons: High energy and maintenance costs; generates a concentrated stream that must be treated or disposed of.\nAdvanced Oxidation Processes (AOPs)\n\u00a0AOPs use strong oxidants, often combined with UV light, to break down PFAS compounds into less harmful substances.\nPros: Can potentially destroy PFAS molecules rather than just removing them from water.\nCons: High operational costs; effectiveness varies based on the PFAS compound and water chemistry; may produce harmful byproducts.\nRegulatory Actions\n\nIn response to growing concerns about the health and environmental risks of PFAS, governments and international bodies have begun to take action. These actions include:\n\nThe United States Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) issued advisories and took steps toward regulating PFAS in drinking water, as well as researching their effects and remediation methods.\nThe European Union restricted the use of certain PFAS chemicals and set limits for PFAS in drinking water.\nCompanies faced lawsuits and increased pressure to phase out the use of PFAS in products and to take responsibility for environmental contamination.\nPFASs and Stockholm convention\n\nThe Stockholm Convention on Persistent Organic Pollutants was adopted by the Conference of Plenipotentiaries on 22 May 2001 in Stockholm, Sweden.\n\nThe Convention entered into force on 17 May 2004.\nPFHxS, PFOA and PFOS are the three subgroups of PFASs currently listed under the Stockholm Convention as industrial POPs.\n\nPerfluorooctane sulfonic acid (PFOS)\n\nPFOS listed in Annex B (restriction) since 2009 is both intentionally produced and an unintended degradation product of related anthropogenic chemicals.\nThe current intentional use of PFOS is widespread and includes electric and electronic parts, such as fire-fighting foam, photo imaging, hydraulic fluids, and textiles.\nPFOS is still produced in several countries. Its acceptable uses include as an active ingredient in insect bait to control leaf-cutting ants, in closed-loops systems in metal plating and as fire-fighting foam.\n\nPerfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA)\n\nPerfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA) is listed in Annex A (elimination) since 2019. PFOA are used widely to produce non-stick kitchenware and food processing equipment.\nThe unintentional formation of PFOA is created from inadequate incineration at moderate temperatures of municipal solid waste within inappropriate or open burning facilities.\n\nIn 2019, at the Second session of the International Conference on Chemicals Management (ICCM2), SAICM stakeholders identified managing PFASs and the transition to safer alternatives as an issue of concern.\n\nThe 10th meeting of the Conference of the Parties in 2022 listed perfluorohexane sulfonic acid (PFHxS) as widely used in fire-fighting foam, carpets, and non-stick cookware.\n\nPerfluorocarboxylic acids (PFCAs)\n\nPerfluorocarboxylic acids (PFCAs) are used in various applications, including coating products, fabric/carpet protectors, textile impregnation agents and firefighting foams a candidate POPs proposed for listing under the Stockholm Convention.\nWhy in the news?\n\nNumerous articles about PFAS being found in various environments and products are being published.\n\nPotentially toxic chemicals called PFAS (perfluoroalkyl and poly-fluoroalkyl substances) are found in surface and groundwaters around the world at levels much higher than many international regulators allow, a new study found.\nMany popular US bandage brands contain alarming levels of toxic PFAS \u201cforever chemicals\u201d, new research suggests, raising questions about the products\u2019 safety.\nA recent study by IIT Madras reveals the pervasive presence of \u2018forever chemicals\u2019, pre- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS) \u2013 in Buckingham Canal, Adyar River and Chembarambakkam Lake.\nPFAS in Chennai Lakes\n\nThe study findings revealed high levels of PFAS in groundwater samples from Chennai.\n\nWhile groundwater samples were collected from in and around the Perungudi dumpsite, surface-level samples were taken from different points along the Buckingham Canal, Adyar River, and Chembarambakkam Lake.\nSamples from a water treatment plant (WTP) near the lake were also tested. All the samples were quantified for eight target PFAS.\nIt was also found that the concentrations of all eight target PFAS increased in the treated water of the water treatment plant, compared to the raw water.\nThe study notes that this is likely due to unidentified precursors that transform into more stable PFAS end products during treatment.\n\nIndustrial emissions, untreated domestic wastewater discharge, and open dump sites have been suspected to be significant sources of contamination, highlighting the need for further investigation to assess the extent of PFAS contamination in Chennai fully.\n\nConclusion\n\nThe issue of \u201cforever chemicals\u201d is a complex environmental and public health challenge that requires coordinated action from governments, industry, and communities.\n\nWhile the properties of PFAS have led to valuable technological developments, their persistent nature poses risks that necessitate careful management, regulation, and efforts to find safer alternatives.\n\nRelated articles:\n\nEndocrine-disrupting chemicals (EDCs)\nGroundwater contamination in India\nArsenic contamination in India\n\n-Articles by Swathi Satish"

Read more below.\n\nThe Supreme Court passed its judgment in a case titled M K Ranjitsinh & Ors versus Union of India & Ors.\n\nThe case was\u00a0regarding the protection of two critically endangered bird species on the\u00a0IUCN Red List\u00a0\u2013 the great Indian bustard (GIB) and the lesser florican.\n\nBoth the bird species are listed under Part III of Schedule I of the Wild Life (Protection) Act, 1972.\n\nTable of Contents\n\nSC Judgment on Climate Change\nExpanding the Scope of the Right to Life\nIncorporating International Law Principles\nImposing Duties on the Government\nAddressing Intergenerational Equity\nPossible Implications of the Judgment\nThe Great Indian Bustard\nProtection status of The Great Indian Bustard\nConclusion\nSC Judgment on Climate Change\n\nThe Supreme Court has extended the ambit of Articles 14 and 21 of the fundamental right and ruled that people have the right to be free from the adverse effects of climate change.\n\nArticles 14 and 21 of the Indian Constitution guarantee fundamental rights to equality and life respectively.\nIn a very recent event, the right to a clean environment was also considered a fundamental right under the Right to Life of Article 21.\nThe court also highlighted the interconnection between climate change and various human rights, including the right to health, indigenous rights, gender equality, and the right to development.\nExpanding the Scope of the Right to Life\nThe Supreme Court, in its judgment, noted that the right to life under Article 21 must be interpreted progressively to include the right to a clean and healthy environment, which is essential for the enjoyment of other fundamental rights.\nJustice S. Ravindra Bhat stated that the \u201cright to life\u201d must be understood to include the \u201cright to a healthy environment, free from the adverse effects of climate change.\u201d\nThis interpretation expands the traditional understanding of the right to life, recognizing the intrinsic link between human well-being and the state of the environment.\nIncorporating International Law Principles\nThe Supreme Court\u2019s judgment draws heavily from international law principles, particularly the concept of the \u201cright to a healthy environment\u201d recognized by various international treaties and declarations.\nThe Court relied on the Stockholm Declaration (1972), the Rio Declaration (1992), and the Paris Agreement (2015) to establish the global consensus on the human right to a healthy environment.\nBy incorporating these international frameworks, the judgment strengthens the legal foundation for the recognition of this right in the Indian context.\nImposing Duties on the Government\n\nThe Supreme Court\u2019s ruling not only recognizes the right to a healthy environment but also imposes specific duties on the government to take necessary actions to protect this right.\n\nThe judgment mandates the central and state governments to:\n\n\ud83d\udc49 Which year are YOU targeting for success in the IAS/IPS/IFS Exam? \ud83d\ude80\n\n(1) \u21d2 UPSC 2025: Prelims cum Mains\n\n(2) \u21d2 UPSC 2026: Prelims cum Mains\n\n(3) \u21d2 UPSC 2027 Prelims cum Mains\n\nTip: Know more about ClearIAS Courses (Online/Offline)\n\nFormulate and implement a comprehensive climate change policy that addresses mitigation, adaptation, and loss and damage.\nEnsure that the policy is aligned with India\u2019s international commitments under the Paris Agreement.\nEstablish a robust monitoring and evaluation mechanism to regularly assess the progress and effectiveness of climate actions.\nProvide adequate financial resources and technological support to facilitate the implementation of the climate policy.\nAddressing Intergenerational Equity\nThe judgment recognizes the intergenerational nature of the climate crisis, acknowledging that the current generation has a responsibility to protect the environment for future generations.\nThe Court emphasizes that the right to a healthy environment is not limited to the present but extends to future generations, who have an equal claim to a livable planet.\nThis principle of intergenerational equity is an essential aspect of the judgment, as it establishes a long-term, sustainable approach to climate action.\nPossible Implications of the Judgment\n\nThe Supreme Court\u2019s landmark judgment on the right against the adverse effects of climate change has far-reaching implications for India\u2019s climate policy and governance.\n\nThe judgment opens the door for increased climate litigation in India, as individuals and civil society organizations can now challenge the government\u2019s climate policies and measures through Public Interest Litigation (PIL). This can lead to more robust judicial oversight and pressure on the government to strengthen its climate actions.\nThe Court\u2019s directive to the government to formulate a comprehensive climate change policy, aligned with international commitments, can drive the development of a more holistic and ambitious climate action plan.\nThis has the potential to accelerate India\u2019s transition towards a low-carbon economy and build resilience against the impacts of climate change.\nThe recognition of the right to a healthy environment also has implications for addressing the disproportionate impact of climate change on marginalized and vulnerable communities.\n\nHowever, the implementation of this landmark judgment also presents significant challenges.\n\nTranslating the Court\u2019s directives into effective and measurable climate actions will require strong political will, robust institutional frameworks, and sustained public engagement.\nCoordinating climate policy across different levels of government (central, state, and local) and ensuring adequate financial and technological resources for implementation will be crucial for the successful realization of the right to a healthy environment.\nThe Great Indian Bustard\n\nThe Great Indian Bustard (Ardeotis nigriceps) is the state bird of Rajasthan.\n\nThe Great Indian Bustard is an important species that represents the health of grassland habitats in India.\nThis means that if the GIB is doing well, it\u2019s a sign that the grasslands it lives in are also in good condition.\nThe GIB is mostly found in the Indian states of Rajasthan and Gujarat. There are also small populations in a few other states like Maharashtra, Karnataka, and Andhra Pradesh.\n\nA judgement was pronounced in open court, constituting an expert committee to examine the problem faced by the bird species whose natural habitat and flight routes collide with power transmission lines in Gujarat and Rajasthan.\n\nProtection status of The Great Indian Bustard\n\nThe Great Indian Bustard has special protection status:\n\nIt is listed as Critically Endangered on the IUCN Red List.\nIt is included in Appendix I of the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species (CITES), which means trade in this species is strictly prohibited.\nIt is also listed in Appendix I of the Convention on Migratory Species (CMS).\nIn India, it is protected under Schedule I of the Wildlife (Protection) Act, 1972, which provides the highest level of protection.\nConclusion\n\nThe Supreme Court\u2019s judgment on the right against the adverse effects of climate change as a fundamental right under Article 21 has the potential to be a transformative moment in India\u2019s climate governance.\n\nBy elevating environmental protection to the realm of constitutional rights, the Court has paved the way for a more accountable, inclusive, and sustainable approach to addressing the climate crisis.\n\nThis landmark decision not only strengthens the legal framework for climate action but also empowers citizens to participate actively in the process of shaping India\u2019s climate future.\n\nRelated articles:\n\nRight to be forgotten\nRight to health\nRight to disconnect\n\nArticle Written By: Priti Raj"

Advocates work to establish and fund these support mechanisms.\nProgress for intersex rights\n\nIt\u2019s estimated that up to 1.7 per cent of the population is born with intersex traits, according to UN data.\n\nWorking with civil society and intersex rights defenders, UN Human Rights has led several initiatives to promote the visibility and rights of intersex people and issued a Technical Note in 2023 for States and other stakeholders on UN recommendations on the rights of intersex people and good practices in their implementation.\nThe intersex rights movement has made significant strides in recent years. Some countries and regions have enacted laws and guidelines to protect intersex individuals, especially concerning non-consensual medical procedures.\nAwareness has increased through the advocacy work of intersex individuals and organizations, as well as through inclusive education policies in some places.\nLegal recognition of non-binary or third genders in identification documents has been achieved in several jurisdictions, benefiting some intersex individuals.\nWhy in the news?\n\nIn a landmark vote, the Human Rights Council on April 4, 2024, adopted a resolution calling on Member States to enhance efforts to combat discrimination, violence and harmful practices against intersex people, the first of its kind for the United Nations.\n\nThe resolution also calls on Member States to address the root causes, such as stereotypes, spread of misconceptions and inaccurate information, stigma and taboo, and to work to fulfil the enjoyment of the highest attainable standard of physical and mental health for persons with innate variations in sex characteristics.\nTwenty-four countries voted in favour, twenty-three abstained and none voted against the resolution, which was spearheaded by Finland, South Africa, Chile and Australia.\nChallenges\n\nDespite progress, many challenges remain.\n\nLegal, medical, and social recognition and understanding of intersex people\u2019s rights vary widely around the world.\nIn many places, there is still a significant lack of legal protections, and non-consensual medical interventions continue.\nSocial stigma and discrimination persist, impacting the mental and physical health of intersex individuals.\n\nHuman rights abuses against intersex people include, but are not limited to:\n\ninfanticide\nforced and coercive medical interventions\ndiscrimination in education, sports, employment and other services\nlack of access to justice and remedies, and legal recognition\nWay forward\n\nIt\u2019s crucial to approach discussions about intersex conditions with sensitivity and respect for the individuals who have these variations.\n\nEach person\u2019s experience is unique, and not everyone with an intersex condition will identify as part of the intersex community.\nSome may identify with the gender assigned to them at birth, while others may not.\nThe most important aspect is to respect each individual\u2019s self-identification, privacy, and right to make decisions about their own body and how they navigate the world.\n\nTo ensure the physical integrity of intersex persons, States should:\n\nProhibit medically unnecessary surgery and procedures on the sex characteristics of intersex children.\nEnsure that human rights violations against intersex people are investigated and alleged perpetrators prosecuted.\nEnsure that intersex people and their families receive adequate counselling and support, including from peers.\nEnsure that intersex people and organizations are consulted and participate in the development of research, legislation and policies that impact their rights.\nProvide health care personnel with training on the health needs and human rights of intersex people and the appropriate advice and care to give to parents and intersex children, being respectful of the intersex person\u2019s autonomy, physical integrity and sex characteristics\nConclusion\n\nIntersex rights are a crucial aspect of human rights, advocating for the dignity, autonomy, and recognition of intersex individuals.\n\nThrough education, legal reforms, and shifts in medical practices, the movement aims to protect intersex people from discrimination and unnecessary medical procedures, ensuring their right to live freely and authentically.\n\nContinuing to push for these changes is essential for creating a more inclusive and respectful society for everyone, regardless of their sex characteristics.\n\nAlso read:\n\nLGBTQIA+ Community\nTransgender Rights\nGender Justice\n\n-Article by Swathi Satish"

as follows:\n\nWith a budgetary outlay of \u20b919,744 crore (approximately $2.5 billion), India\u2019s production capacity is expected to reach 5 million metric tons (MMT) per annum.\nThis is anticipated to contribute to a reduction in India\u2019s dependence on the import of fossil fuels.\nThe achievement of the mission\u2019s targets is expected to result in a cumulative reduction of \u20b91 lakh crore ($12.5 billion) worth of fossil fuel imports by 2030.\nThe mission is likely to leverage over \u20b98 lakh crore ($100 billion) in total investments and create more than 6 lakh (600,000) new jobs.\nGreen Hydrogen Consumption Obligations\nTo drive the adoption of green hydrogen, the Ministry of New and Renewable Energy (MNRE) has proposed the introduction of green hydrogen consumption obligations for specific industries, such as fertilizers and petroleum refineries.\nThese obligations will require these sectors to blend a certain percentage of green hydrogen into their overall hydrogen consumption, similar to the renewable purchase obligations (RPOs) for electricity distribution companies.\nGreen Hydrogen Hubs\nThe MNRE has identified regions across India that have the potential to support large-scale production and/or utilization of green hydrogen.\nThese regions will be developed as \u201cgreen hydrogen hubs,\u201d providing the necessary infrastructure, resources, and ecosystem to facilitate the growth of the industry.\nPilot Projects for Green Hydrogen in Transport\nThe MNRE has announced a scheme to implement pilot projects for the use of green hydrogen in the transportation sector.\nThe objectives of this scheme include validating the technical feasibility and economic viability of it as a transportation fuel, as well as demonstrating the safe operation of hydrogen-powered vehicles and refuelling stations.\n\nRead:\u00a0Green Energy Partnerships of India\n\nAdvantages\n\nIt has several advantages, a few prominent among them are:\n\nReduction of Greenhouse Gas Emissions\nThe primary advantage is its potential to significantly reduce greenhouse gas emissions.\nBy replacing fossil fuels in various sectors, such as transportation, industry, and power generation, the carbon footprint of these industries can be drastically reduced, contributing to the global effort to mitigate climate change.\nCreation of New Industries and Jobs\nThe development of the clean energy ecosystem can potentially create new industries and job opportunities.\nFrom the manufacturing of electrolyzers and fuel cells to the construction of production and distribution infrastructure, the industry has the potential to become a significant driver of economic growth and employment.\nDecarbonization of Hard-to-Abate Sectors\nIt presents a viable solution for decarbonizing sectors that have traditionally been challenging to decarbonize, such as heavy industry, aviation, and maritime transportation.\nIn these sectors, where the direct electrification of operations may not be feasible, it can serve as a clean alternative fuel, enabling a path to a low-carbon future.\nTechnological Advancements\nThe pursuit of this cleaner fuel can catalyze technological advancements in various fields, including materials science, energy storage, and process engineering.\nAs the industry matures, innovations in areas like more efficient electrolyzers, advanced hydrogen storage solutions, and optimized distribution networks can further enhance the viability and scalability of the fuel.\nChallenges in Implementation\n\nThere are several challenges in the implementation, a few prominent among them are:\n\nCost of Production and Utilization\nOne of the primary challenges facing the widespread adoption of new energy systems is the high cost of production compared to traditional, carbon-intensive hydrogen.\nThe capital-intensive nature of the electrolysis process and the need for specialized infrastructure contribute to the elevated costs.\nInfrastructure Development\nThe large-scale deployment of it necessitates the development of a robust infrastructure for production, storage, transportation, and distribution.\nThis includes the construction of electrolysis plants, hydrogen storage facilities, and dedicated distribution networks.\nEnergy Storage and Grid Integration\nThe intermittent nature of renewable energy sources, such as wind and solar, can pose challenges in maintaining a consistent supply of the energy source.\nSafety and Regulatory Frameworks\nHydrogen is a highly flammable gas, and its safe handling and storage require specialized protocols and regulations.\nThe Way Forward\n\nTo make it more affordable, the focus should be on developing more efficient and cost-effective electrolysis technologies, leveraging economies of scale, and implementing policy incentives such as tax credits and subsidies.\n\nSubstantial investments are needed to build a comprehensive infrastructure for its production, storage, transportation, and distribution.\n\nGovernments, private companies, and public-private partnerships should collaborate to develop the necessary infrastructure, including hydrogen production plants, storage facilities, and dedicated distribution networks.\n\nIntegrating production with renewable energy sources and developing advanced energy storage solutions, such as hydrogen storage technologies, will be essential to ensure a reliable and continuous supply of green hydrogen.\n\nAs hydrogen is a highly flammable gas, developing comprehensive safety standards, training programs for personnel and robust regulatory frameworks will be important to build trust in the green hydrogen ecosystem.\n\nConclusion\n\nGreen hydrogen holds immense promise in the global search for clean and sustainable energy solutions.\n\nIndia\u2019s proactive initiatives, such as the National Green Hydrogen Mission and the development of green hydrogen hubs, demonstrate the country\u2019s commitment to positioning itself as a global leader in this emerging field.\n\nHowever, to realize the full potential of green hydrogen, India must address the challenges of high production costs, infrastructure development, energy storage, safety regulations, and stakeholder coordination.\n\nBy overcoming these obstacles and capitalizing on the numerous advantages of green hydrogen, India can unlock a future where clean energy fuels economic growth, enhances energy security and contributes significantly to the global fight against climate change.\n\nArticle Written By: Priti Raj"

Read here to learn more.\n\nThe \u2018living will\u2019 is a form of advance care planning that guides healthcare providers and family members about the types of medical treatment the person would or would not want to be used to keep them alive, as well as other decisions, like pain management or organ donation.\n\nIn India, passive euthanasia was legalised in 2018, and the \u201cright to die with dignity\u201d is part of the fundamental \u201cRight to Life\u201d under Article 21 of the Constitution.\n\nHowever, the procedure for advance directives has been seen as time-consuming in India hence the execution has been lagging.\n\nTable of Contents\n\nLiving Wills\nImportance of Living Wills\nCreating a Living Will in India\nWhy in the news?\nChanges brought in 2023\nConclusion\nLiving Wills\n\nA living will, also known as an advance directive is a legal document that specifies the type of medical care that an individual does or does not want in the event they are unable to communicate their wishes.\n\nTreatment Preferences: Living will typically address a variety of treatments that might be considered in different scenarios, including resuscitation, mechanical ventilation, tube feeding, dialysis, and palliative care.\nConditions Covered: They often specify the conditions under which the wishes apply, such as terminal illness, permanent unconsciousness, or severe brain damage where recovery to a meaningful quality of life is not expected.\nValues and Goals: Beyond specific treatments, the advance directive can articulate a person\u2019s values and goals for care, helping guide decisions in situations not specifically mentioned in the document.\nLegality: The legal status and specific regulations surrounding the advance directive vary by jurisdiction. Most regions have specific laws that govern the creation and use of such wills, including requirements for witnesses or notarization.\nDifference from Other Directives: The advance directives are distinct from other types of advance directives like health care power of attorney (or proxy) documents, which appoint someone else (a health care agent) to make medical decisions on the person\u2019s behalf. Often, individuals will have both types of documents to cover different aspects of their care preferences.\nImportance of Living Wills\nAutonomy: They ensure a person\u2019s treatment preferences are respected, even when they can\u2019t speak for themselves, maintaining their autonomy over end-of-life care.\nClarity: They provide clear instructions to healthcare providers and relieve family members from the burden of making difficult decisions during emotional times.\nConflict Prevention: By clearly stating wishes in advance, they can help prevent conflicts among family members and between family members and medical providers about the course of treatment.\nCreating a Living Will in India\n\nThe law in India currently states that a \u2018living will\u2019 should be signed in the presence of two attesting witnesses and affirmed by a notary or gazetted officer\u00a0(according to the 2023 SC judgement).\n\n\ud83d\udc49 Which year are YOU targeting for success in the IAS/IPS/IFS Exam? \ud83d\ude80\n\n(1) \u21d2 UPSC 2025: Prelims cum Mains\n\n(2) \u21d2 UPSC 2026: Prelims cum Mains\n\n(3) \u21d2 UPSC 2027 Prelims cum Mains\n\nTip: Know more about ClearIAS Courses (Online/Offline)\n\nIn case the executor, that is, the person for whom the will is made- becomes terminally ill, a doctor overseeing treatment is mandated to constitute a board of three experts.\nThree doctors, including a treating physician and two other doctors with five years of experience in the speciality, will comprise the primary board of doctors.\nPrimary/secondary board to decide within 48 hours on withdrawal of further treatment.\nThe hospital must immediately constitute a secondary board of medical experts.\nWhile anyone over age 16 can make a living will in India, registering such a will has proven to be a laborious task.\nWhy in the news?\n\n2024: In early March, 30 people in Thrissur in Kerala executed living wills.\n\nLiving wills have been legal since 2018 when the Supreme Court of India created a process to allow terminally ill patients, with no hope of a cure, to withhold or withdraw treatment and die with dignity.\nSince patients may not be able to communicate their wishes for a variety of reasons, including being unconscious or suffering from dementia, living will allow them to make choices about future medical care.\nSix years after the judgment, however, the Court\u2019s process is unavailable in most of India.\nOfficials remain unlikely to implement the procedure without direct orders and guidance from State governments.\n\n2023: When the Court created the process for living will, it was complex and arduous to implement.\n\nAs the Court worried that \u201cunscrupulous persons who wish to inherit or otherwise grab the property of the patient\u201d might abuse the process, it created elaborate bureaucratic procedures as safeguards.\nThe particular requirement that living wills must be countersigned by a judicial magistrate became cumbersome.\n\nHence, only a few living wills were executed in the first five years after the judgment.\n\nIn January 2023, the Court recognised that requiring a judge to countersign each living will impair the objective of its judgment, and streamlined the procedure.\nChanges brought in 2023\n\nChanges in 2023\n\n\t\n\nEarlier provisions\n\n\n\nAn attestation by a notary or a Gazetted officer is sufficient for a living will.\nIt will be a part of the national health record which can be accessed by Indian hospitals\nThree doctors, including a treating physician and two other doctors with five years of experience in the speciality, will comprise the primary board of doctors.\nPrimary/secondary board to decide within 48 hours on withdrawal of further treatment.\nThe hospital must immediately constitute a secondary board of medical experts.\n\t\nA judicial magistrate needed to attest or countersign a living will.\nIt was kept in the custody of the district court concerned.\nThe primary board of doctors needs at least four experts from general medicine, cardiology, neurology, nephrology, psychiatry or oncology with an overall standing of at least 20 years.\nThe 2018 judgment did not specify any outer limit on withdrawal of treatment.\nThe district collector had to constitute the second board of medical experts.\nConclusion\n\nLiving wills are a crucial component of healthcare planning, ensuring that individuals have a say in their medical treatment throughout their entire lives, even in situations when they cannot express their wishes verbally.\n\nRelated articles:\n\nEthics of Euthanasia\nRight to be forgotten\nRight to health\nRight to disconnect\n\n-Article by Swathi Satish"

            "[CONTENT]": "Tornadoes are one of the most powerful and dynamic weather phenomena on Earth. How are they different from cyclones? Read here to learn more.\n\nTornadoes are known for their potential to cause significant destruction in a very short amount of time, including damage to structures, landscapes, and in severe cases, loss of life.\n\nThey are defined as violently rotating columns of air that are in contact with both the surface of the Earth and a cumulonimbus cloud or, in rare cases, the base of a cumulus cloud.\n\nTable of Contents\n\nTornado Formation\nWeather Conditions\nComposition\nImpact\nTornado vs cyclone\nWhy in the news?\nTornado in India\nConclusion\nTornado Formation\n\nThese extreme storms typically form from severe thunderstorms. The most common environment for the development of tornadoes includes a combination of:\n\nMoisture in the lower atmosphere: Provides the fuel for thunderstorms.\nInstability: Warm, moist air near the surface overlaid by cooler, drier air aloft. This instability allows the warm air to rise swiftly.\nWind shear: A change in wind speed and/or direction with height. This can create a horizontal spinning effect in the lower atmosphere that can be turned vertically by rising air within the thunderstorm, leading to the development of a tornado.\n\nThe precise mechanism often involves a complex interaction between a supercell (a long-lived thunderstorm with a deep, persistently rotating updraft) and the environment, leading to the formation of a tornado beneath the storm\u2019s updraft.\n\n\ud83d\udc49 Which year are YOU targeting for success in the IAS/IPS/IFS Exam? \ud83d\ude80\n\n(1) \u21d2 UPSC 2025: Prelims cum Mains\n\n(2) \u21d2 UPSC 2026: Prelims cum Mains\n\n(3) \u21d2 UPSC 2027 Prelims cum Mains\n\nTip: Know more about ClearIAS Courses (Online/Offline)\n\nWeather Conditions\nThey are more likely to occur in conditions where warm, moist air is present near the surface with cooler, drier air above.\nThis setup is commonly found in the central United States, particularly in an area known as \u201cTornado Alley,\u201d during the spring and early summer when these conditions are most prevalent.\nHowever, these extreme storms can occur in a variety of weather conditions and have been observed on every continent except Antarctica.\nComposition\nThey are composed of air, water droplets, dust, and debris.\nThe visible funnel is primarily made of water droplets formed from condensation, along with dust and debris picked up from the ground.\nThe core of the storm is where the lowest pressure and highest wind speeds are found, and it\u2019s here that the most significant damage occurs.\nImpact\n\nThe impact of these extreme storms can range from minor damage to landscapes and structures to complete devastation, including loss of life.\n\nThe Enhanced Fujita Scale (EF Scale) is used in the United States to rate the intensity of tornadoes, based on the damage they cause, from EF0 (weakest) to EF5 (strongest).\n\nStructural Damage: They can destroy buildings, homes, bridges, and vehicles.\nVegetation: They can uproot trees, destroy crops, and significantly alter landscapes.\nEconomic: The economic impact can be profound, including the costs of rebuilding and the loss of businesses.\nHuman: Beyond physical injuries and fatalities, tornadoes can have a lasting psychological impact on survivors and communities.\nTornado vs cyclone\n\nTornadoes and cyclones are both types of atmospheric storms, but they differ significantly in their scale, formation, and the destruction they can cause.\n\n\u00a0\n\t\nTornado\n\t\nCyclone\n\n\nScale\n\t\nRelatively small diameter, usually less than one mile, and a short lifespan, typically lasting from a few minutes to an hour.\nCan produce the strongest winds on Earth, with speeds that can exceed 300 miles per hour in the most extreme cases.\n\t\nCyclones can span hundreds to thousands of miles in diameter and can last for days or weeks.\n\n\nFormation\n\t\nKey ingredients for formation include:\ninstability in the atmosphere (warm, moist air near the surface with cooler air aloft),\nsignificant wind shear (change in wind speed and/or direction with height),\na pre-existing boundary (like a cold front).\nThe most powerful ones typically emerge from supercell thunderstorms.\n\t\nTropical cyclones form over warm ocean waters near the equator, where warm, moist air rises and encounters cooler air aloft.\nThis process leads to condensation, the release of latent heat, and the development of a cyclonic circulation around a low-pressure centre.\nCyclones require sea surface temperatures of at least 26.5 degrees Celsius (about 80 degrees Fahrenheit) to form.\nThey cannot develop too close to the equator due to the lack of Coriolis force, which is necessary to initiate the cyclonic spin.\n\n\nImpact\n\t\nCan cause extreme localized damage, ripping apart buildings, hurling vehicles, and uprooting trees with their intense winds.\nThe path of destruction is typically narrow but can be devastating.\n\t\nCyclones can cause widespread damage over a large area through strong winds, heavy rainfall, storm surges, and flooding.\nThe impact of a cyclone can affect multiple countries or entire regions, leading to significant economic and human losses.\n\n\nPredictability\n\t\nThey can be unpredictable.\nWhile conditions conducive to the formation can be identified, predicting the exact time and location of a tornado\u2019s touchdown is challenging.\nWarnings are usually issued minutes before it strikes.\n\t\nCyclones are tracked from their formation to dissipation, allowing for days of warning before they make landfall.\nThis gives residents in the path of the storm time to prepare or evacuate.\nWhy in the news?\n\nOn March 31, 2024, a deadly tornado struck the Mainaguri area of the Jalpaiguri district of West Bengal for 10 minutes killing five people and injuring over 100.\n\nIn recent years, an increasing number of tornadoes have formed across India and caused destruction.\nA warming Bay of Bengal and land, along with anomalous wind patterns could be a reason behind this.\nIMD has warned of more tornadoes in northern Bengal in the future.\nTornado in India\n\nThese extreme storms are rare in India and have mostly been reported in the eastern states of West Bengal, Odisha and Jharkhand during the pre-monsoon period.\n\nBut there is evidence of some of them having formed in northwest India as well.\nA research paper published by India Meteorological Department (IMD) scientists in 2016 provides different records for possible tornadoes in eastern India.\nThe highest number was reported in a 1981 paper that documented 51 possible tornadoes across Bengal, out of which 18 killed 10 people or more.\nTwelve of these tornadoes occurred during 1838-1963 and 24 during 1968-81.\nThe paper also recorded 15 tornadoes during 1903-2012 in northwest India.\nTwelve of these took place during 1976-2010, which means their frequency could have increased in later years. Most of these tornadoes occurred in March and a few in April.\nIn India, there is no official monitoring of tornadoes.\nConclusion\n\nTornadoes are a testament to nature\u2019s power, capable of causing significant destruction in a very short period.\n\nUnderstanding their formation, the weather conditions under which they thrive, and their potential impacts is essential for preparedness and mitigation efforts, especially in regions where tornadoes are common.\n\nTornadoes are the most common in the United States, Argentina and Bangladesh.\n\nRelated articles:\n\nNatural hazards and disasters\nDisaster and Disaster management\nFronts: Types and significance\nCyclones in the Arabian Sea: Why are they uncommon?\n\n-Article by Swathi Satish"

This is typically achieved at extremely high temperatures (millions of degrees Celsius) and pressures, conditions that enable the nuclei to move fast enough and collide with sufficient force to fuse.\nEnergy Release: The mass of the resulting nucleus is slightly less than the total mass of the original nuclei. According to Einstein\u2019s equation E=mc2, the lost mass (m) is converted into energy (E), with c being the speed of light. This energy release is what makes nuclear fusion a potentially unparalleled source of power.\nFuel: The most practical fusion reactions for power on Earth involve isotopes of hydrogen-deuterium (D) and tritium (T). Deuterium can be extracted from seawater, making it abundantly available, while tritium is scarcer and typically bred from lithium in the fusion reactor itself.\nArtificial Sun Projects\nITER (International Thermonuclear Experimental Reactor): One of the most ambitious nuclear fusion projects, ITER, is an international consortium aiming to build the world\u2019s largest tokamak (a magnetic fusion device) in France. Its goal is to demonstrate the feasibility of fusion as a large-scale and carbon-free source of energy. India is also a member of this project.\nEAST (Experimental Advanced Superconducting Tokamak): Located in China, EAST is a tokamak that has been operational since 2006. It has made significant progress in sustaining long-term plasma fusion, achieving temperatures over 100 million degrees Celsius, which is crucial for fusion to occur.\nKSTAR (Korea Superconducting Tokamak Advanced Research): South Korea\u2019s KSTAR has made headlines for its ability to maintain high-temperature plasma for over 100 seconds, marking a significant step towards commercial fusion energy production.\nDEMO (DEMOnstration Power Plant): While still in the planning stage, DEMO aims to build on ITER\u2019s work to create a fusion power plant that can produce electricity continuously, proving the commercial viability of fusion energy.\nChallenges in Creating an Artificial Sun\nTemperature and Pressure: Achieving and maintaining the extreme temperatures (tens of millions of degrees Celsius) and pressure needed for hydrogen nuclei to fuse is a significant engineering and scientific challenge.\nPlasma Confinement: Controlling the hot plasma for long periods without it touching the reactor walls requires sophisticated magnetic confinement techniques, as in tokamaks, or inertial confinement, as explored in other experiments.\nMaterials: Developing materials that can withstand the extreme conditions inside a fusion reactor for long periods without degrading is another hurdle.\nNet Energy Gain: One of the biggest challenges is achieving a net energy gain, where the fusion process produces more energy than is consumed in initiating and sustaining it.\nWhy in the news?\n\nSouth Korean scientists have been able to produce heat of temperature 100 million Celsius for a record period of 48 seconds.\n\nThe Korea Institute of Fusion Energy\u2019s (KFE) Korea Superconducting Tokamak Advanced Research (KSTAR) fusion reactor reached temperatures seven times that of the Sun\u2019s core.\nThe temperature of the core of the Sun is 15 million degrees Celsius.\nThe ultimate aim of KSTAR is to sustain plasma temperatures of 100 million degrees for 300 seconds by 2026.\nThe International Thermonuclear Experimental Reactor in southern France has the world\u2019s biggest tokamak and what the scientists in South Korea achieve will help French scientists.\nWhat is a Tokamak?\nTokamak\n\nA tokamak is a device designed to harness the energy of fusion, a nuclear reaction where two light atomic nuclei combine to form a heavier nucleus, releasing a tremendous amount of energy in the process.\n\nThe tokamak is one of the most researched fusion reactor types, and its development is central to the field of fusion energy research.\nThe principle behind a tokamak is to use magnetic confinement to hold a plasma\u2014a hot, ionized gas in which the fusion reactions occur\u2014at the extremely high temperatures and pressures needed for fusion to take place.\n\nDesign and Operation:\n\nThe tokamak\u2019s design is essentially toroidal, or doughnut-shaped. It uses a combination of magnetic fields to confine the plasma:\n\nToroidal Field: Produced by magnets wrapped around the torus, this magnetic field goes around the doughnut shape in circles and keeps the plasma from touching the reactor walls.\nPoloidal Field: Created by a current driven through the plasma itself, this field helps to stabilize and shape the plasma. The combination of the toroidal and poloidal magnetic fields creates a twisted magnetic field structure that is more effective at confining the plasma.\n\nKey Components:\n\nVacuum Vessel: Contains the plasma and the magnetic fields.\nMagnetic Coils: Generate the magnetic fields necessary for the confinement and shaping of the plasma.\nDiverter: A component designed to remove waste material from the plasma without disrupting the fusion process.\nNeutral Beam Injection: This system injects neutral particles into the plasma to heat it and drive the current necessary for the poloidal field.\nConclusion\n\nThe successful development of nuclear fusion technology would revolutionize energy production, offering a clean, sustainable, and abundant source of power.\n\nIt could significantly reduce reliance on fossil fuels, combat climate change, and provide a long-term solution to the world\u2019s energy needs.\n\nHowever, despite decades of research and progress, practical, commercial fusion power remains a long-term goal, with several technical, financial, and material challenges yet to be overcome.\n\nRelated articles:\n\nNuclear energy\nLife cycle of a star\nSun: Structure, composition and features\n\n-Article by Swathi Satish"

            "[CONTENT]": "The swell waves, without providing any signs in the local winds, at times cause severe flooding events along the east and west coasts of India. The phenomenon often causes destruction along the coast, with fishermen losing fishing gear and vessels due to sudden coastal flooding. Read here to learn more about them.\n\nSwell Waves are Surface gravity waves on the ocean that are not growing or being sustained any longer by the wind.\n\nGenerated by the wind some distance away and now propagating freely across the ocean away from their area of generation, these waves can propagate in directions that differ from the direction of the wind, in contrast to a wind sea.\n\nKallakadal or Swell surges are flash flood events that take place without any prominent warnings or changes in local winds.\n\nTable of Contents\n\nSwell waves or Swell surge\nFormation of Swell Waves\nCharacteristics of Swell Waves\nImpact of Swell Waves\nSwell waves vs Wind waves\nWhy in the news?\nKallakadal\nConclusion\nSwell waves or Swell surge\n\nSwell waves, often simply referred to as swells, are a type of surface gravity wave that occurs in the open ocean and seas.\n\nUnlike waves generated by local winds (wind waves), swells are characterized by their smoother, more regular appearance and longer wavelengths.\nThey are generated by distant weather systems and can travel thousands of miles from their origin, retaining energy over vast distances.\nFormation of Swell Waves\nGeneration: Swells begin as wind waves, which are generated by the wind blowing over the surface of the ocean. The energy transferred from the wind to the water creates waves.\nGrowth: These waves can grow larger if the wind continues to blow steadily over a long distance (fetch) and a sufficient period.\nPropagation: Once the waves move out of the area influenced by the generating wind, they start to organize into sets of smoother, more uniform waves. The process of dispersion helps in sorting the waves according to their speed and wavelength, with longer waves moving faster and outpacing the shorter ones.\nSwell: The remaining organized, long-period waves that have travelled out of their generating area are known as swell waves. They can travel across entire ocean basins from their source to distant shores.\nCharacteristics of Swell Waves\nLong Wavelengths: Swells have longer wavelengths than wind waves, often ranging from 100 to 200 meters (330 to 660 feet), and sometimes even more.\nHigh Speeds: Their speed allows them to travel significant distances; swells can cross entire ocean basins.\nSmooth Appearance: Unlike choppy wind waves, swells have a smoother appearance with more rounded crests.\nEnergy: Despite losing some energy during their journey, swells retain a significant amount of energy, which can impact coastlines far from their origin.\nImpact of Swell Waves\nSurfing: Swells are essential for surfing, providing the consistent, large waves sought after by surfers. The quality of surf breaks is significantly influenced by the characteristics of incoming swells, such as their direction, period, and size.\nCoastal Erosion: Swell waves can contribute to coastal erosion, especially during storms when their energy is amplified.\nNavigation and Safety: For maritime navigation, understanding swells is crucial for the safety and efficiency of shipping and small craft operations.\nEnergy Generation: Swell waves are a focus of research for renewable energy generation, where their consistent nature could be harnessed to produce electricity.\nSwell waves vs Wind waves\nSwell vs Wave (Image courtesy: Marine Insight)\nWhy in the news?\n\nA low atmospheric pressure that formed in the South Atlantic Ocean on March 23 triggered swell waves, known as \u2018Kallakkadal\u2019 locally, along the coastal areas of Thiruvananthapuram, Kollam, Alappuzha and Thrissur districts.\n\n\ud83d\udc49 Which year are YOU targeting for success in the IAS/IPS/IFS Exam? \ud83d\ude80\n\n(1) \u21d2 UPSC 2025: Prelims cum Mains\n\n(2) \u21d2 UPSC 2026: Prelims cum Mains\n\n(3) \u21d2 UPSC 2027 Prelims cum Mains\n\nTip: Know more about ClearIAS Courses (Online/Offline)\n\nThe statement was issued by the Indian National Centre for Ocean Information Services (INCOIS), a Central government agency that issues weather warnings for fishermen in the country.\nAs a result of the low-pressure area formed over the Atlantic Ocean moving into the Indian Ocean, high swell waves in the range of 11 m were formed, which finally reached the coast of Kerala and Lakshadweep, said the Kerala State Disaster Management Authority (KSDMA).\nKallakadal\n\nThe term Kallakkadal, used by local fishermen, is a combination of two Malayalam words, including Kallan and Kadal.\n\nKallan means thief and Kadal means sea. In spoken language, these words were combined to mean ocean that arrives as a thief.\nThese events are typically the result of distant storms or changes in atmospheric pressure, which generate large, powerful swell waves that travel across the ocean and impact the coast.\nThe term has been brought into the spotlight due to such events causing unexpected flooding and damage along the coastal areas, even in the absence of local storm conditions.\n\nRogue waves, or freak waves as they are sometimes called, are massive and spontaneous ocean waves that can occur far out at sea or near coastlines.\n\nUnlike \u201ckallakadal,\u201d which is a regional term, rogue waves are a more broadly recognized phenomenon and have been observed and studied worldwide.\nThey are notoriously unpredictable and can be extremely dangerous to ships and coastal structures due to their immense size and power.\nThe phenomenon of \u201ckallakadal\u201d emphasizes the interconnectedness of global weather and ocean systems.\nSwells generated by distant meteorological events can travel vast distances across the ocean basins, affecting coastlines far from the source of the disturbance.\nThis highlights the importance of global ocean monitoring systems and the need for comprehensive coastal management practices that take into account not only local weather and sea conditions but also distant events that could potentially cause significant impacts.\nConclusion\n\nSwell waves play a significant role in the dynamics of the ocean and have profound impacts on human activities and the coastal environment. Their study is crucial in the fields of oceanography, marine planning, and coastal management.\n\nUnderstanding the dynamics of swell waves, including events like \u201ckallakadal,\u201d is crucial for coastal communities, especially in terms of preparedness and mitigation strategies to minimize damage from such unexpected natural events.\n\nRelated articles:\n\nMovements of ocean water\nRossby waves\nAtmospheric River\nUrban flooding\n\n-Article by Swathi Satish"

It allows the Union government to borrow upon the security of the Consolidated Fund of India.\nArticle 293: This article specifically deals with the borrowing powers of states. Key points include:\nState Governments\u2019 Borrowing Powers: States are allowed to borrow within the territory of India upon the security of the Consolidated Fund of the State. This power is subject to any limitations that Parliament might decide to impose.\nRestrictions on Borrowing by States Already Indebted to the Centre: If a state owes any money to the central government, it cannot raise any loan without the consent of the Government of India. This consent can be conditional, and the Centre has the power to impose specific conditions as it deems necessary.\nBorrowing from Foreign Sources: States are not allowed to raise any loan or give any guarantee outside India without the consent of the Government of India.\nFiscal Responsibility and Budget Management (FRBM) Act\nThe FRBM Act, enacted by the Parliament of India in 2003 and amended several times since further regulates the fiscal management practices of the central and state governments. It sets targets for the government to ensure fiscal discipline, reduce fiscal deficits, and manage public funds more efficiently.\nThe Act also places limits on the deficits that states can incur and their total outstanding liabilities. However, the central government can relax these limits, considering specific circumstances or state-specific fiscal reform measures.\nRole of the Central Government\nThe central government, through the Ministry of Finance and its associated bodies, monitors and regulates the borrowing activities of the states to ensure that their fiscal operations do not negatively impact the overall economic stability and fiscal policy of the country.\nIt also provides guidelines and, in some cases, financial assistance to states to encourage fiscal responsibility and efficient debt management.\nImpact of the Goods and Services Tax (GST)\nThe introduction of the GST in 2017, which subsumed a majority of state and central indirect taxes into a single tax, had implications for the fiscal autonomy of states, including aspects of their borrowing powers.\nThe central government promised to compensate states for any loss of revenue resulting from the implementation of GST. This factor also plays into the fiscal and borrowing dynamics between the central and state governments.\nWhy in the news?\n\nThe Supreme Court on April 3 2024 declined any interim relief to Kerala in its suit seeking that the Union government relax its borrowing restrictions to enable the State to borrow additional funds during the current fiscal year.\n\nIt also refused to keep operating two letters issued by the Union Finance Ministry in 2023 and certain amendments made to the Fiscal Responsibility and Budget Management (FRBM) Act, 2003, in 2018 that imposed borrowing cap restrictions on States.\nKerala moved the top Court in 2023 accusing the Union government of arbitrarily imposing a Net Borrowing Ceiling (NBC) on the State.\nThis NBC brought the state to the brink of a financial crisis as it could not no longer pay salaries and pensions or fulfil other essential financial commitments.\nNet borrowing Ceiling (NBC)\n\nThe net borrowing ceiling of states in India refers to the limit imposed on the amount of money that state governments can borrow in a financial year.\n\nThis ceiling is crucial for maintaining fiscal discipline and ensuring that states do not accumulate unsustainable levels of debt.\nThe framework for these ceilings is influenced by several factors, including recommendations from the Finance Commission, the Fiscal Responsibility and Budget Management (FRBM) Act, and specific guidelines issued by the central government, particularly the Ministry of Finance.\n\nBasis of the Net Borrowing Ceiling:\n\nFiscal Responsibility Legislation: Both the central and state governments in India are guided by the FRBM Act, which sets targets for fiscal deficits to ensure fiscal discipline. For states, the FRBM mandates a fiscal deficit limit of 3% of the Gross State Domestic Product (GSDP).\nFinance Commission Recommendations: The Finance Commission, which is constituted every five years, recommends how the central taxes are to be divided between the centre and the states and suggests measures to maintain fiscal stability. It also provides recommendations regarding the borrowing limits of states.\nCentral Government Guidelines: The central government, through the Department of Expenditure in the Ministry of Finance, sets the annual borrowing limits for each state based on a formula that considers the state\u2019s GSDP, existing debt levels, fiscal discipline, and other relevant factors. These limits can be revised in response to special circumstances, such as natural disasters or significant economic downturns.\n\nAdjustments and Flexibility:\n\nThe net borrowing ceiling can be adjusted to provide states with additional borrowing capacity under certain conditions:\n\nPerformance-Based Incentives: States demonstrating good fiscal performance, such as maintaining expenditure discipline while increasing revenue collection, can be allowed additional borrowing room. This is designed to incentivize states to improve their fiscal health.\nSpecific Conditions: During times of economic stress or for financing specific projects, the central government may relax the borrowing limits. For example, in response to the COVID-19 pandemic, the central government temporarily increased the borrowing limit for states.\nLinkage to Reforms: The central government has also linked additional borrowing permissions to the implementation of specific reforms, such as improvements in power sector performance, increasing urban local body revenues, or implementing business reform action plans.\nConclusion\n\nThe borrowing powers of states in India are primarily defined by the Constitution and further regulated by legislative acts such as the FRBM Act.\n\nWhile states can borrow within the framework set by these laws, their borrowing is subject to limitations and conditions, especially concerning debts owed to the central government and borrowing from external sources.\n\nThis structure ensures a balance between state autonomy in fiscal matters and the maintenance of national fiscal discipline and stability.\n\nRelated articles:\n\nFiscal federalism in India\nDevolution of powers and finances up to local levels\nFunctions and responsibilities of the Union and the states\n\n-Article by Swathi Satish"

That was the basis of the Sri Lankan claim on Katchatheevu.\n\nPresently, the Katchatheevu island is under Sri Lanka\u2019s sovereignty.\n\nSince 1921, the island was controlled by the British Ceylon (now Sri Lanka).\nThe Indian Government never controlled it.\nThe area had never been demarcated as it belonged to Indian Territory.\n\nIndian civilians are reportedly allowed onto the island, which is controlled by Sri Lanka, for just two days and a night every year. That is during the festival at St Antony\u2019s shrine, the only structure on the island.\n\nSt Antony is considered to be the patron deity of seafarers.\n\nWhat is the dispute about?\nThe dispute over Katchatheevu has been primarily centred on fishing rights and the access it grants to the fertile fishing grounds in the surrounding waters.\nFishermen from both countries have traditionally used these waters, leading to occasional conflicts and the arrest of fishermen by both nations\u2019 naval forces for allegedly crossing into each other\u2019s territorial waters.\nResolution attempts\n\nIn 1974, then Prime Minister of India, Indira Gandhi accepted Katchatheevu as a Sri Lankan area under the \u201cIndo-Sri Lankan Maritime Agreement\u201d aimed at resolving the maritime boundaries in the Palk Strait.\n\nThe agreement allowed Indian fishermen to fish around Katchatheevu and participate in the annual St. Anthony\u2019s festival on the island without needing a visa.\nA further agreement in 1976 attempted to demarcate the maritime boundaries more clearly, but it did not completely resolve the disputes over fishing rights and the detention of fishermen.\nIn 1976, the maritime boundary line in the Sethusamudram region between the two neighbours was divided, ending the Indian fishermen\u2019s visits to the island.\nThe agreement was never ratified by the Indian Parliament, and this has been a basis for the ongoing dispute over the island\u2019s ownership and the rights of Indian fishermen to fish in the surrounding waters.\n\nThe Indian government in February 2014 stated, \u201cNo territory belonging to India was ceded nor sovereignty relinquished since the area was in dispute and had never been demarcated.\u201d\n\nThe government added that the agreements did not require a constitutional amendment because no Indian territory was ceded.\n\nKachatheevu remains under Sri Lankan sovereignty following the 1974 agreement.\n\nHowever, the issue continues to be a point of contention, especially among the fishing communities of Tamil Nadu, India, and the Northern Province of Sri Lanka.\nIndian fishermen often allege that their rights to fish in traditional waters are being infringed upon, and there have been numerous incidents of arrest by Sri Lankan authorities, which in turn have led to diplomatic efforts between the two countries to resolve such issues.\nImportance of Katchatheevu\nFishing Rights: The waters around Katchatheevu are rich in marine life, making them highly valuable for fishermen from both countries.\nThe agreement allows Indian fishermen to fish in these waters and dry their nets on the island but does not allow them to practice fishing activities.\nThe island of Katchatheevu is 22 km from the southern coast of India and around 45 km southwest of Jaffna, which would have extended the maritime boundary and the Indian Exclusive Economic Zone by a decent number of nautical miles.\nThis would have given the fishermen an extended fishing area and prevented their arrest by the Lankan Navy.\nHowever, there have been numerous reports of arrests and confrontations between Sri Lankan authorities and Indian fishermen, who often accuse the Sri Lankan Navy of harassment and arrest for fishing in what they claim is their traditional waters.\nStrategic Location: Although uninhabited, Katchatheevu\u2019s strategic location in the Palk Strait makes it significant from a security and navigational perspective.\nThe island\u2019s importance increases as China looks to expand its footprint in the Indian Ocean Region and for thousands of Indian fishermen.\nWhy in the news?\n\nPrime Minister Narendra Modi on March 31, 2024, raised again the controversial matter of Katchatheevu, a few weeks ahead of the Lok Sabha poll in Tamil Nadu. Citing a report in a daily and posting it on \u201cX\u201d (formerly Twitter).\n\nEven though almost 50 years have elapsed since the signing of the original agreement in 1974, the matter comes back to the fore as political parties use it to attack their adversaries.\n\nKatchatheevu was in the limelight, in late February also as fishermen associations in Ramanathapuram district boycotted the annual two-day festival, as a mark of protest against the Sri Lankan Government\u2019s continuing arrests of Indian fishermen on charges of poaching.\n\nImplications of the dispute\n\nThe dispute over Kachatheevu is reflective of broader issues related to maritime boundaries, access to marine resources, and the rights of traditional communities.\n\nIt also highlights the challenges of managing bilateral relations in a region with complex historical ties and economic dependencies.\nWhile the island itself is small and uninhabited, the symbolism and practical implications of its status continue to influence India-Sri Lanka relations, particularly in the context of the rights and livelihoods of fishermen from both nations.\n\nThere have been calls from various quarters in India, particularly from Tamil Nadu, for the Indian government to renegotiate the terms of the agreement or to reclaim the island, citing the hardships faced by Indian fishermen and the strategic importance of the island.\n\nConclusion\n\nThe issue of Katchatheevu and the rights of fishermen has been a recurring topic in India-Sri Lanka relations, with both governments trying to address the issue through diplomatic channels and joint working mechanisms to avoid conflict and ensure the safety and rights of fishermen on both sides.\n\nThe Katchatheevu island dispute highlights the complex nature of maritime boundaries and the impact of geopolitical decisions on the livelihoods of local communities, necessitating a delicate balance between diplomatic negotiations and the protection of traditional rights and resources.\n\nRelated articles:\n\nIndia-China border dispute\nTeesta river dispute\nKalapani dispute\n\n-Article by Swathi Satish"

This raises concerns about the privacy of voter information and the potential for misuse of data in targeting or manipulating voters.\nAutomated Social Media Manipulation: AI can power bots that mimic human users on social media platforms, amplifying partisan content, inflaming social divisions, and even suppressing voter turnout through targeted campaigns of disinformation.\nBias and Fairness: AI systems are only as unbiased as the data they are trained on. There is a risk that these systems may inadvertently (or intentionally) perpetuate biases, leading to unfair targeting of certain demographics or skewing the electoral process in subtle ways.\nRegulatory and Ethical Challenges: The rapid development of AI technologies outpaces the formulation of regulations and ethical frameworks to govern their use in democratic processes. This lag creates vulnerabilities that could be exploited to undermine elections.\nDeep fake elections\n\nThe concept of \u201cdeepfake\u201d technology, which involves using artificial intelligence to create highly realistic and convincing fake videos, audio recordings, or images, poses a significant challenge to the integrity of elections.\n\nDeepfakes can manipulate voices, facial expressions, and actions of individuals, such as politicians, making them appear to say or do things they never did.\nAs this technology becomes more accessible and sophisticated, its potential impact on elections is a growing concern for democracies worldwide.\n\nPotential Impacts of Deepfakes on Elections\n\nMisinformation and Disinformation: Deepfakes can be used to create false narratives and misinformation that can quickly spread across social media platforms, misleading voters and potentially influencing their opinions and voting decisions.\nUndermining Trust: By casting doubt on the authenticity of legitimate audiovisual content, deepfakes can erode public trust in information sources, including news media, official statements, and even the candidates themselves. This erosion of trust can lead to a more polarized and sceptical electorate.\nTargeting Candidates: Political figures can be targeted with deepfakes to damage their reputation, affect their election campaigns, or undermine their credibility. Such attacks can be difficult to counter, especially when they spread widely and rapidly online.\nManipulating Public Opinion: Deepfakes can be used to create fake endorsements or statements from public figures, misleading the public about a candidate\u2019s views or positions, or fabricating controversial statements to incite backlash.\nChallenging Election Integrity: In the most extreme scenarios, deepfakes could be used to create false evidence of electoral fraud or misconduct, challenging the results of an election and leading to political instability.\nMitigating Risks\n\nTo navigate the challenges presented by AI in democratic processes, particularly elections, it is crucial to develop robust legal and ethical frameworks that govern the use of AI.\n\nTransparency in AI operations, coupled with strict data protection laws, can help mitigate risks related to privacy and data misuse.\nInvesting in the development and deployment of technologies capable of detecting deepfakes is crucial. This includes AI-driven solutions that analyze videos and audio for inconsistencies or signs of manipulation.\nAdditionally, public awareness campaigns about misinformation and digital literacy can empower voters to critically evaluate the information they encounter online.\nMedia outlets and social media platforms play a crucial role in preventing the spread of deepfakes. Implementing strict policies against deepfakes, including content verification processes and rapid response teams, can help mitigate their impact.\nInternational cooperation and dialogue among democracies are essential for sharing best practices and developing common standards to prevent the malicious use of AI in elections.\nTechnology companies and social media platforms also have a significant role to play in detecting and mitigating AI-driven threats to election integrity.\nOne possible solution to AI-fueled misinformation would be guidelines issued by the Election Commission of India through a model code of conduct.\nWhy in the news?\n\nIn a video posted online by the Aam Aadmi Party, Delhi Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal\u2019s wife read out a message from him one day after he was taken into custody by the Enforcement Directorate in connection with a liquor scandal.\n\nHowever, it was only one version of Kejriwal\u2019s letter that went viral; there was also an English translation produced by artificial intelligence of the politician\u2019s message sent to prison, as well as a Hindi translation.\nWith a series of elections to be held across the world in 2024, the potential of AI to disrupt democracies cannot be dismissed.\nProponents of AI also think that technology will significantly raise and elevate millions of people\u2019s standards of living. However, it is currently unknown if powerful AI may offer \u201cexistential risks\u201d and whether it will erode human values as many doomsayers claim.\n\nIn India, as of now, there doesn\u2019t exist a specific law that addresses just AI and deepfake technology and targets the individual who creates it.\n\nIn other news, the Communist Party of India (Marxist) has introduced an artificial intelligence (AI) anchor named \u2018Samata\u2019, meaning equality, ahead of the Lok Sabha elections in 2024.\n\nConclusion\n\nWhile AI presents certain risks to democratic processes, with thoughtful regulation, ethical use, and international collaboration, its positive potential can be harnessed to enhance democratic engagement and secure electoral processes against traditional and new threats.\n\nInternational cooperation might be necessary to establish standards and best practices for the ethical use of AGI in elections, ensuring that technology serves to support democratic values and institutions rather than destabilize them.\n\nRelated articles:\n\nAI and Ethics\nAI in Education\nFuture of Work and AI\nIndiaAI Mission\nElectoral Reforms in India\n\n-Article by Swathi Satish"

This not only aids in conserving forests and reducing waste but also in promoting more efficient electoral processes.\nPromoting Sustainable Practices: Green elections serve as a model for sustainability, encouraging political parties, candidates, and voters to adopt environmentally responsible behaviours.\nThis can have a ripple effect, influencing broader societal attitudes towards sustainability and encouraging more eco-friendly practices in other sectors.\nPublic Health: Reducing the environmental impact of elections can also have direct and indirect benefits for public health. For instance, minimizing the use of non-biodegradable materials and reducing air and noise pollution from campaign rallies can contribute to cleaner air and a quieter, more peaceful environment.\nEconomic Efficiency: Although there might be initial costs associated with transitioning to green elections, over time, these practices can lead to economic efficiencies.\nDigital campaigns, for example, can be more cost-effective than traditional methods. Moreover, reducing waste and the need for clean-up after elections can also save money for communities and governments.\nEnhancing Democratic Values: Green elections align with the democratic values of responsibility, inclusivity, and foresight. They reflect a commitment to ensuring that the electoral process not only respects the will of the people but also the health of the planet for current and future generations.\nInitiatives for Green Elections in India\nUse of Electronic Voting Machines (EVMs): India has been using EVMs for its national and state elections since 2004. EVMs significantly reduce the need for paper ballots, which not only saves a considerable amount of paper but also speeds up the counting process and reduces the chance of errors.\nDigital Campaigning: Political parties and candidates are increasingly leveraging digital platforms for campaigning to reduce the reliance on physical promotional materials such as banners, posters, and pamphlets. Social media, messaging apps, and digital advertisements are becoming key tools for reaching out to voters.\nEco-Friendly Materials: There is a growing trend among candidates and political parties to use eco-friendly materials for campaign paraphernalia. This includes cloth banners, biodegradable posters, and other promotional items made from sustainable materials.\nRegulation of Campaign Material: The Election Commission of India (ECI) has issued guidelines for political parties and candidates to minimize the use of plastics and other non-biodegradable materials in their campaign materials.\nNational Green Tribunal (NGT) Guidelines: The NGT has also been proactive in issuing directives aimed at reducing the environmental impact of election campaigns. This includes restrictions on the use of loudspeakers, the timing of rallies to reduce noise pollution, and guidelines on the disposal of campaign materials.\nVoter Awareness: The ECI has been actively promoting voter awareness regarding the environmental impact of elections. This includes encouraging voters to consider environmental policies and practices of parties and candidates as a criterion in their voting decisions.\nGreen Protocols: In some states, the ECI has introduced \u201cgreen protocols\u201d for conducting elections. This includes measures like banning plastic bottles in election meetings, promoting the use of electronic media for campaigning, and ensuring that materials used during the elections are recyclable or biodegradable.\nExamples of green elections in India\n\nKerala: During the 2019 general election, the Kerala State Election Commission took a proactive step by urging political parties to avoid single-use plastic materials during their campaigns.\n\nThe Kerala High Court imposed a ban on flex and non-biodegradable materials in electioneering.\nAs an alternative, wall graffiti and paper posters emerged, promoting a more sustainable approach.\nAdditionally, government bodies collaborated with the district administration in Thiruvananthapuram to ensure a green election, emphasizing eco-friendly practices.\nTraining sessions were also conducted in villages for election workers to raise awareness and promote environmentally conscious behaviour.\n\nGoa: In 2022, the Goa State Biodiversity Board took a significant step by introducing eco-friendly election booths for the Assembly elections.\n\nThese booths were constructed using biodegradable materials meticulously crafted by local traditional artisans from Sattari and Ponda.\nNot only are these materials environmentally friendly, but they also support local artisans.\nWhy in the news?\n\nIn 2023, the Election Commission of India (ECI) voiced its concern over the environmental risks associated with the use of non-biodegradable materials in elections.\n\nThe ECI has been urging \u2018parties and candidates to avoid the use of plastic/polythene for preparation of election material during an election campaign, since 1999\u2019.\nGiven that the conduct of every election results in an avoidable carbon footprint, there is a need for eco-friendly elections, which would be a boost to environmental stewardship alongside civic participation.\nSri Lanka and Estonia, for instance, have conducted environmentally conscious elections.\nAs India, the world\u2019s most populous democracy, gears up for the next general election, environmental considerations must be prioritised, paving the way for green elections.\n\nWith the 2024 general elections around the corner, the ECI is once again vocal about the environmental footprint of elections is often overlooked.\n\nChallenges\n\nWhile these initiatives represent significant progress toward greener elections, challenges remain.\n\nThe sheer scale of India\u2019s elections, combined with varying levels of awareness and commitment across regions and parties, means that fully implementing green practices is an ongoing process.\nIt is imperative to guarantee equitable access to modern technology for all voters. This calls for significant work in terms of educating voters about the new technologies and training election officials.\nAdopting cutting-edge technology and environmentally acceptable materials sometimes has large upfront expenses.\nIt is imperative to overcome public scepticism regarding security, privacy, and potential manipulation of electronic voting systems by implementing strong protection and transparency measures.\nIt is crucial to make sure voting systems are safe from online attacks. Any concession might damage electoral integrity and public confidence.\nWay forward\n\nThe move towards green elections in India is a reflection of a broader global recognition of the need to integrate environmental considerations into all aspects of governance and civic engagement.\n\nThe journey can begin by enacting appropriate legislation, with the Election Commission of India incorporating these methods in the Model Code of Conduct.\n\nAs technology advances and societal awareness increases, future election cycles in India will likely become increasingly sustainable.\n\nFuture directions may include enhancing the digital infrastructure to support more extensive online campaigning, further reducing the reliance on physical campaign materials, and developing more comprehensive guidelines and support for eco-friendly election practices.\n\nConclusion\n\nThe need for green elections emerges from an increasing global awareness of the environmental impacts associated with electoral processes and the broader necessity of integrating sustainability into all aspects of governance and societal activities.\n\nGreen elections aim to minimize the ecological footprint of electoral campaigns, voting processes, and related activities through the adoption of sustainable practices and technologies.\n\nRelated articles:\n\nSimultaneous Elections: Will this be good for India?\nCross-voting in Elections\nRemote voting for migrants\n\n-Article by Swathi Satish"

Due to its ability to absorb sunlight, black carbon is a potent climate-forcing agent with a significant impact on global warming.\nIts warming effects are felt immediately after emission and can be many times more powerful than carbon dioxide (CO2) on a mass basis in the short term, although black carbon remains in the atmosphere for only days to weeks, while CO2 persists for decades to centuries.\n\nThe main black carbon-emitting sectors are:\n\nHousehold Energy\nTransport\nIndustrial Production\nAgricultural Burning\nWaste Burning\nFossil Fuels\nWhy is Black Carbon Harmful for the Environment?\n\nClimate Change: Black carbon is a strong absorber of sunlight and contributes to global warming by heating the atmosphere. When deposited on snow and ice, it reduces albedo (the reflection of sunlight), causing further warming and accelerated melting.\nAir Quality and Health: As a component of PM2.5 (particulate matter with a diameter less than 2.5 micrometres), black carbon poses serious risks to human health, including respiratory and cardiovascular diseases, cancer, and even premature death.\nEcosystem Impact: The deposition of black carbon on plants can inhibit their ability to photosynthesize, affecting agricultural productivity and forest health.\nGlobal black carbon emissions\n\nIn Asia and Africa residential solid fuels contribute 60-80% of emissions, whereas in Europe and North America diesel engines contribute about 70% of emissions.\n\nBlack carbon emissions are declining thanks to improved practices in brick manufacturing, reduced open burning in the agriculture sector, improved fuel and vehicle standards, cleaner household energy, better access to finance and technology, and a global push for clean air.\nThey are expected to continue falling as improvements in efficiency and the electrification of cars and other vehicles continue.\nBlack Carbon Emissions in India\n\nIn India, the residential sector is a significant contributor to black carbon emissions, primarily due to the widespread use of traditional biomass (such as wood, crop residues, and dung) for cooking and heating.\n\nThis traditional practice, prevalent in rural areas, results in inefficient combustion and thus high emissions of black carbon.\nOther major sources include emissions from vehicles, industrial processes, and the burning of agricultural residues.\nGovernment initiatives\n\nThe Government has taken several measures to control black carbon emissions which inter-alia include the following:\n\nPradhan Mantri Ujjwala Yojana promotes the use of cleaner household cooking fuels.\nLeapfrogging from BS-IV to BS-VI norms for fuel and vehicles from 1st April 2020.\nThe network of metro rails for public transport has been enhanced and more cities are covered.\nIntroduction of cleaner / alternate fuels like gaseous fuel (CNG, LPG etc.), and ethanol blending.\nA new initiative, \u201cSustainable Alternative Towards Affordable Transportation (SATAT), has been launched to set up 5000 Compressed Bio-Gas (CBG) production plants and make CBG available in the market for use.\nUnder the Central Sector Scheme on \u2018Promotion of Agricultural Mechanization for in-situ management of Crop Residue in the States of Punjab, Haryana, Uttar Pradesh and NCT of Delhi\u2019, agricultural machines and equipment for in-situ crop residue management are promoted with 50% subsidy to the individual farmers and 80% subsidy for the establishment of Custom Hiring Centres.\nThe Central Government is implementing the National Clean Air Programme as a long-term, time-bound, national-level strategy to tackle the air pollution problem across the country in a comprehensive manner with targets to achieve a 40% reduction in particulate matter concentrations by 2025-26.\nCentral Pollution Control Board (CPCB) has identified 131 cities based on ambient air quality levels exceeding national ambient air quality standards, and cities with million plus population.\nCity-specific Clean Air Action Plans have been prepared and rolled out for implementation in these cities.\nThese plans define time-bound targets to control city-specific air-polluting sources (soil &road dust, vehicles, domestic fuel, municipal solid waste burning, construction material and industries, etc.).\nAnnual plans with micro detailing are also prepared for effective implementation of the city plans.\nFaster Adoption and Manufacturing of Electric Vehicles (FAME) phase-2 scheme has been rolled out.\nShifting of brick kilns to zig-zag technology for reduction of pollution. Industrial units shifting to piped natural gas.\nPradhan Mantri Ujjwala Yojana (PMUY) and Its Impact\n\nLaunched in May 2016, the Pradhan Mantri Ujjwala Yojana aims to protect the health of women and children by providing them with a clean cooking fuel \u2013 Liquefied Petroleum Gas (LPG), which is a significant step towards reducing the dependence on pollutive cooking fuels like wood, coal, dung cakes, etc.\n\nThe initiative\u2019s primary goals are to reduce health hazards associated with cooking based on fossil fuels and to prevent the degradation of air quality.\n\nImpact on Reducing Traditional Cooking Fuels:\n\nBy providing LPG connections to BPL (Below Poverty Line) families, the scheme has significantly reduced the reliance on traditional cooking fuels, thereby lowering the emissions of black carbon and other pollutants.\nThe introduction of clean cooking fuel has also helped in reducing the time spent on cooking and collecting fuel, directly benefiting women\u2019s and children\u2019s health and socio-economic status.\nAs of my last update in April 2023, PMUY has resulted in millions of new LPG connections across India, substantially lowering the use of biomass for cooking in rural households. This transition to LPG helps in mitigating the emission of black carbon, thus contributing positively to both local air quality and the global climate.\n\nWhile PMUY has made substantial strides in reducing the dependency on biomass and improving air quality, the full transition to clean fuels requires continued effort in addressing issues related to refill rates and ensuring sustainable access to LPG for all beneficiaries.\n\nWay forward\n\nEfforts to reduce black carbon emissions include transitioning to cleaner fuels and technologies in transportation, industry, and residential heating/cooking; improving emissions standards and enforcement; and promoting agricultural practices that reduce the need for open burning.\n\nInternational initiatives and collaborations, like the Climate and Clean Air Coalition (CCAC), aim to reduce black carbon and other short-lived climate pollutants (SLCPs) through targeted actions across sectors and countries.\n\nGiven its short atmospheric lifetime, reducing black carbon emissions presents an opportunity for rapid benefits for both climate and public health, making it a focus area for environmental policy and action worldwide.\n\nRelated articles:\n\nPhotochemical smog and Gothenburg protocol\nCarbon offset\nCarbon Capture, Utilization, and Storage (CCUS)\n\n-Article by Swathi Satish"

Membership can be voluntary or mandatory, depending on the sector and the nature of the SRO.\nRule-Making Authority: SROs have the authority to create rules, standards, and guidelines that their members are expected to follow. These rules often cover professional conduct, operational standards, ethical practices, and compliance with legal regulations.\nEnforcement Powers: SROs possess mechanisms to enforce compliance among their members. This can include conducting audits, reviewing member activities, imposing sanctions, and taking disciplinary actions against members who violate the rules.\nDispute Resolution: Many SROs provide platforms for resolving disputes between their members and between members and their clients or customers. They may offer arbitration and mediation services.\nConsumer Protection: By regulating industry practices and promoting ethical standards, SROs contribute to protecting the interests of consumers. They may also handle complaints and grievances from the public.\nSelf-regulatory organisations in India\n\nAn SRO shall be set up as a not-for-profit company registered under Section 8 of the Companies Act, 2013.\n\n\ud83d\udc49 Which year are YOU targeting for success in the IAS/IPS/IFS Exam? \ud83d\ude80\n\n(1) \u21d2 UPSC 2025: Prelims cum Mains\n\n(2) \u21d2 UPSC 2026: Prelims cum Mains\n\n(3) \u21d2 UPSC 2027 Prelims cum Mains\n\nTip: Know more about ClearIAS Courses (Online/Offline)\n\nIt should have adequate net worth, and sufficiently diversified shareholding and must represent the sector.\nSRO shall have sufficient authority derived from membership agreements along with strong governance mechanisms.\nIt shall develop standards for improving compliance culture and surveillance methods for sector monitoring.\n\nResponsibilities of self-regulatory organisations:\n\nTowards members: Promote best business practices, establish minimum conduct benchmarks, disseminate sector-specific information and dispute resolution/arbitration structure.\nTowards Regulator: Ensuring regulatory compliance, promoting sector development, fostering innovation and detecting early warning signals.\n\nGovernance framework:\n\nArticles of Association (AoA)/bylaws shall provide for the manner of functioning of the Governing Body and specify the functions of SRO.\nAt least one-third of the members of the Board of Directors including the Chairperson shall be independent.\nCompliance with relevant Acts, regulations, guidelines, directions or circulars issued by RBI.\nSRO regulators in the Financial Sector\nSecurities and Exchange Board of India (SEBI): While SEBI itself is a regulatory authority, it oversees several SROs within the securities and investment sector. For example, the Association of Mutual Funds in India (AMFI) functions under SEBI\u2019s guidelines to promote and protect the interests of mutual funds and their unit holders.\nInsurance Regulatory and Development Authority of India (IRDAI): IRDAI governs the insurance sector and has facilitated the establishment of SROs such as the Insurance Brokers Association of India (IBAI), which sets standards and ethical codes for insurance brokers.\nReserve Bank of India (RBI): In the banking and non-banking financial sector, the RBI has recognized bodies like the Fixed Income Money Market and Derivatives Association of India (FIMMDA) and the Finance Industry Development Council (FIDC) for NBFCs. These organizations play significant roles in standard-setting and self-regulation under the RBI\u2019s oversight.\nOther Sectors\nAdvertising Standards Council of India (ASCI): ASCI is a voluntary self-regulatory organization that promotes responsible advertising, ensuring that advertisements conform to its Code for Self-Regulation in Advertising. It deals with complaints about misleading, false, and offensive advertisements.\nIndian Broadcasting Foundation (IBF): The IBF deals with self-regulation of content broadcasted by its member television channels. It has set up the Broadcasting Content Complaints Council (BCCC) to review and adjudicate complaints against content.\nInternet and Mobile Association of India (IAMAI): The IAMAI represents the online and mobile value-added services industry. It has been instrumental in establishing best practice guidelines for various online services, including digital payments and content platforms.\nReal Estate (Regulation and Development) Act (RERA): While RERA is a regulatory act, it mandates the establishment of Real Estate Regulatory Authorities in each state, which can be seen as a move towards more structured self-regulation within the real estate sector. These authorities ensure transparency and protect the interests of homebuyers.\nWhy in the news?\n\nThe Reserve Bank of India has come up with a final omnibus framework for self-regulatory organisations mandating them to set up grievance redressal mechanisms for members and a non-discriminatory fee structure, among others.\n\nThe omnibus framework prescribes the broad objectives, functions, eligibility criteria and governance standards, which will be common for all SROs, irrespective of the sector.\nThe framework is the minimum requirement and the recognised SROs will be encouraged to develop their best practices.\nRBI also told SROs to frame a code of conduct for their members and to monitor adherence to the code.\nEach sector of the regulated entities (RE) including fintechs will have a separate SRO and with the finalisation of the framework, the RBI will receive applications from various entities seeking to get SRO status.\nChallenges and Criticisms\n\nWhile self-regulatory organisations play a critical role in regulating their respective sectors, they sometimes face criticism regarding their effectiveness, conflict of interest, and enforcement capabilities.\n\nThe balance between industry self-regulation and governmental oversight is a constant topic of debate.\nThe effectiveness of SROs often depends on their governance structures, the clarity of their regulatory mandates, and their enforcement powers.\nConclusion\n\nSelf-regulatory organisations in India form an essential part of the regulatory ecosystem, complementing statutory regulations and working towards the orderly development of their respective sectors.\n\nThey help bridge the gap between the industry and regulators, ensuring that industry standards evolve in line with best practices and public interest.\n\nRelated articles:\n\nNon-Governmental Organizations (NGOs)\nStatutory, Regulatory, and Various Quasi-judicial Bodies\n\n-Article by Swathi Satish"

Electoral bonds and electoral trusts represent two mechanisms in India designed to provide a level of transparency and regulation to the financing of political parties and electoral activities. Read here to learn more.\n\nBefore the controversial Electoral Bonds Scheme was introduced in 2018, an Electoral Trusts Scheme was introduced by the UPA government in 2013.\n\nWhile both serve the purpose of funnelling funds to political parties, they operate under different rules and structures.\n\nUnderstanding these mechanisms is crucial for grasping how political financing works in India and the efforts to make political funding more transparent and accountable.\n\nTable of Contents\n\nElectoral Bonds\nElectoral Trusts\nContributions to Electoral Trusts\nMechanism for Distribution of Funds\nElectoral bonds vs Electoral Trusts\nWhy in the news?\nConclusion\nElectoral Bonds\n\nIntroduced by the Government of India in 2018, electoral bonds are a financial instrument that individuals and companies can buy from specified branches of the State Bank of India (SBI) and donate to a political party of their choice.\n\nThese bonds are meant to be a more transparent alternative to cash donations, which have been criticized for their lack of traceability and potential for misuse.\n\nKey Features:\n\n\ud83d\udc49 Which year are YOU targeting for success in the IAS/IPS/IFS Exam? \ud83d\ude80\n\n(1) \u21d2 UPSC 2025: Prelims cum Mains\n\n(2) \u21d2 UPSC 2026: Prelims cum Mains\n\n(3) \u21d2 UPSC 2027 Prelims cum Mains\n\nTip: Know more about ClearIAS Courses (Online/Offline)\n\nAnonymity: The identities of the donors and the recipients (political parties) are kept anonymous, a feature that has been both praised for protecting donor privacy and criticized for the potential lack of transparency.\nBank Transactions: The transactions are made through the banking system, which adds a layer of scrutiny and record-keeping.\nUse Limitation: Political parties can only encash these bonds through a designated bank account with the Election Commission of India (ECI). The party must be registered and must have secured at least 1% of the votes in the most recent general election or Assembly election to be eligible to receive funds through electoral bonds.\n\nIn a landmark unanimous judgment, the Supreme Court in February 2024 struck down the electoral bonds scheme as unconstitutional and manifestly arbitrary.\n\nThe court pointed out the blanket anonymity it provides to political donors, as well as critical legal amendments allowing rich corporations to make unlimited political donations.\nA five-judge Bench headed by Chief Justice of India D.Y. Chandrachud held that the Union government\u2019s scheme, and preceding amendments made to the Representation of the People Act, the Companies Act, and the Income Tax Act, violated the voters\u2019 right to information about political funding under Article 19(1)(a) of the Constitution.\nElectoral Trusts\n\nElectoral trusts are not-for-profit companies established for the sole purpose of distributing contributions to political parties.\n\nIntroduced in 2013 by the Central Board of Direct Taxes (CBDT), these trusts are part of an effort to bring more transparency to political funding.\nUnlike electoral bonds, which are a financial instrument, electoral trusts operate as intermediary entities that collect funds from various sources and then distribute these funds to political parties.\n\nKey Features:\n\nTransparency and Disclosure: Electoral trusts are required to disclose their contributions to the Election Commission of India, making the source of funds and the recipients (political parties) public information. This requirement is seen as a step towards greater transparency in political funding.\nTax Benefits: Donations made through electoral trusts allow donors to receive tax deductions, providing an incentive for using this channel for political donations.\nRegulation: Electoral trusts are regulated under the Companies Act, 1956 and are subject to scrutiny by the Income Tax Department (Income Tax Act, 1961 and Income Tax Rules, 1962) and the Election Commission of India, ensuring a level of oversight.\nContributions to Electoral Trusts\n\nThey may receive contributions from:\n\nAn individual who is a citizen of India\nA company registered in India\nA firm or Hindu undivided family or an Association of persons or a body of individuals, resident in India.\n\nThey shall not accept contributions from:\n\nAn individual who is not a citizen of India or from any foreign entity whether incorporated or not;\nAny other electoral trust registered under the scheme.\nNo contribution shall be received in cash\n\nIt is also provided that the permanent account number of the contributor who is a resident and the passport number in the case of a citizen of India, who is not a resident, would be taken by the electoral rusts at the time of receiving any contribution.\n\nMechanism for Distribution of Funds\nFor administrative expenses, the Electoral Trusts are permitted to set aside a maximum of 5% of the total funds collected during a financial year.\nThe remaining 95% of the total income of the Trusts is required to be distributed to eligible political parties.\nParties registered under the Representation of the People Act, 1951 are eligible to receive the contributions.\nElectoral trusts are required to keep and maintain books of account including details of receipts, distribution and list of donors and receivers.\nElectoral bonds vs Electoral Trusts\n\t\n\nElectoral bonds\n\n\t\n\nElectoral trusts\n\n\n\nTransparency\n\t\nElectoral bonds maintain the anonymity of donors, raising concerns about the potential for undisclosed corporate influence on politics.\n\n\u00a0\n\n\t\nElectoral trusts offer more transparency in terms of the source of funds and the recipient parties, as their disclosures are public.\n\n\nRegulatory oversight\n\t\nElectoral bonds are primarily regulated by the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) and the State Bank of India (SBI), in addition to the Election Commission\u2019s guidelines.\n\t\nElectoral trusts are regulated under the Companies Act and overseen by the Election Commission and the Income Tax Department.\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\nPurpose\n\t\nElectoral bonds aim to encourage donations to political parties through a banking channel, offering anonymity to donors.\n\t\nElectoral trusts serve to aggregate donations from various sources and distribute them to political parties, with a focus on transparency and accountability.\nWhy in the news?\n\nFollowing the directive from the Supreme Court, the State Bank of India (SBI) released all details of the electoral bond scheme, except donors\u2019 bank account numbers and their Know Your Customer (KYC) details to the Election Commission (EC), which has now published it on its website.\n\nIn February 2024, the apex court deemed the \u2018Electoral Bonds Scheme, 2018\u2019 unconstitutional, stating that it violated voters\u2019 right to information about political funding and facilitated a quid pro quo culture.\nThe Supreme Court bench suggested reverting to an existing electoral trust mechanism that allows for pooling of sums of money from different entities and leaves it upon the trust\u2019s management to decide where the money goes, thus putting some distance between the political organisation and the donor.\nThe bench held that the objective of curbing black money in electoral financing can be achieved through electoral trusts.\nConclusion\n\nBoth electoral bonds and electoral trusts represent steps towards regulating and making political funding more systematic in India.\n\nHowever, the debate continues regarding their effectiveness in achieving transparency, reducing the influence of undisclosed money in politics, and ensuring a level playing field for all political entities.\n\nRelated articles:\n\nOne nation one vote\nElections in Rajya Sabha\nElections in Lok Sabha\nCross-Voting in Elections\n\n-Article by Swathi Satish"

The majority of the Palestinian deaths from Israel\u2019s bombardment over the past five months have been reported by Gaza\u2019s health officials to be women and children.\nOver 74,000 individuals have sustained injuries. Gaza lacks sufficient hospitals, doctors, medications, clean water, and other medical supplies to treat the injured.\nAlso, it has been reported that hunger and starvation are ravaging the Palestinian enclave as Israel\u2019s siege cuts off food supplies.\nEconomic Hardship\nUnemployment: Gaza faces one of the highest unemployment rates in the world, especially among its youth. The blockade severely restricts the movement of people and goods, limiting economic opportunities and business growth.\nPoverty: A significant portion of Gaza\u2019s population lives below the poverty line, struggling to meet basic needs such as food, clean water, and shelter.\nDisplacement: Numerous Israelis and Palestinians are being displaced from their homes due to the attacks on either side.\nHealth Crisis\nMedical Supplies and Facilities: The health system in Gaza is on the verge of collapse, often overwhelmed by the influx of casualties during conflicts and suffering from chronic shortages of medical supplies, equipment, and electricity.\nWater and Sanitation: Over 90% of the water in Gaza is unfit for drinking, contributing to health issues. The destruction of infrastructure and restrictions on imports of necessary materials hinder efforts to address water and sanitation problems.\nInfrastructure and Housing\nDestruction of Homes and Buildings: Repeated conflicts have resulted in the extensive destruction of homes, schools, hospitals, and vital infrastructure. Many families are displaced, living in temporary shelters or in homes that have not been rebuilt since the wars.\nElectricity Shortages: Gaza faces severe electricity shortages, with residents often having access to power for only a few hours a day. This affects every aspect of life, from healthcare to education and basic living conditions.\nEducation\nImpact on Children and Schools: The ongoing conflict and economic blockade have severely affected children\u2019s education.

It was later absorbed into the Roman Empire and became a prosperous city, known for its wealth and learning.\n\nIslamic Era\n\nEarly Islamic Period: Gaza was conquered by the Rashidun Caliphate in the 7th century CE, marking the beginning of Islamic rule.\nCrusades and Mamluk Rule: The city was contested during the Crusades, changing hands between Crusader and Muslim forces, until it was ultimately incorporated into the Mamluk Sultanate of Egypt in the 13th century.\nOttoman Empire: In 1516, Gaza became part of the Ottoman Empire, under which it remained until the early 20th century. Its importance declined due to changes in trade routes and regional conflicts.\n\nModern Period\n\nBritish Mandate: Post-World War I, Gaza came under British Mandate Palestine. The period was marked by growing tensions between Jewish and Arab communities over competing national aspirations.\n1948 Arab-Israeli War: Following the end of the British Mandate and the declaration of the State of Israel in 1948, Gaza was captured by Egypt in the ensuing conflict. It became home to many Palestinian refugees.\nSix-Day War and Israeli Occupation: In 1967, Israel captured Gaza during the Six-Day War. The area was then under Israeli military administration until 1994.\nPalestinian Authority and Hamas Control: The Oslo Accords in the 1990s led to the creation of the Palestinian Authority (PA), which took over some governance functions in Gaza.\nIn 2006, Hamas won legislative elections in the Palestinian territories and subsequently took control of Gaza in 2007, leading to a blockade by Israel and Egypt, with significant impacts on Gaza\u2019s economy and humanitarian conditions.\n\nThe recent history of Gaza has been marked by recurrent conflicts between Israel and Hamas, including significant escalations in 2008-2009, 2012, and 2014, and more skirmishes and protests in the following years.\n\nThe major offensive of 2023 has not yet ended.\n\nThese conflicts have resulted in high casualties and widespread destruction in Gaza, exacerbating the humanitarian situation.\nEfforts to reconcile the Palestinian Authority and Hamas, as well as international mediation attempts to address the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, have so far not resulted in a lasting peace.\nThe situation in Gaza remains one of the most challenging in the world, with political, humanitarian, and security issues deeply intertwined.\nWay forward\n\nThe international community has repeatedly expressed concern over the humanitarian situation in Gaza, calling for an end to the blockade, protection of civilian lives, and a sustainable resolution to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict.\n\nHowever, political solutions have remained elusive, and the situation in Gaza remains a stark example of how prolonged conflict and political impasse can lead to a severe humanitarian crisis.\n\nEfforts to alleviate the suffering in Gaza are ongoing, with various UN agencies, international NGOs, and some countries providing support.\n\nNonetheless, without a political resolution that addresses the root causes of the conflict, the humanitarian situation in Gaza is likely to remain critical.\n\nRelated articles:\n\nSyrian crisis\nRussia-Ukraine conflict\n\n-Article by Swathi Satish"

This remote and icy locale is chosen for its thick ice, which serves as an excellent medium for detecting the rare interactions of neutrinos.\nIce Detection Medium: The observatory utilizes the Antarctic ice, extending over a depth of about 1,450 to 2,450 meters below the surface, as a detection medium. This ice is exceptionally clear, allowing for the precise detection of light patterns generated by particle interactions.\nDigital Optical Modules (DOMs): IceCube consists of over 5,000 digital optical modules suspended in the ice along 86 strings. These DOMs detect Cherenkov radiation, which is light emitted when charged particles travel through the ice faster than light does in that medium.\n\nOperation and Detection:\n\nNeutrino Detection: IceCube detects neutrinos using cables (strings) of digital optical modules (DOMs), with a total of 5,160 DOMs embedded deep within the Antarctic ice.\nWhen neutrinos interact with molecules in the ice, charged particles are produced that then emit blue light while traveling through the ice, which is then registered and digitized by the individual DOMs.\nWide Energy Range: IceCube can detect neutrinos with energies ranging from about 10 GeV to beyond 1 PeV, covering neutrinos produced by cosmic rays in the atmosphere to the highest energy neutrinos thought to originate from the most cataclysmic cosmic events, like gamma-ray bursts, active galactic nuclei, or colliding neutron stars.\nScientific Contributions IceCube Neutrino Observatory\nNeutrino Astronomy: IceCube has opened a new window into the cosmos, contributing to the emerging field of neutrino astronomy. By detecting neutrinos from outer space, scientists can investigate the universe\u2019s most violent and energetic phenomena in ways not possible with traditional electromagnetic astronomy (using light).\nMultimessenger Astronomy: In concert with observations of electromagnetic waves (from radio to gamma rays), gravitational waves, and cosmic rays, neutrinos are part of the \u201cmultimessenger\u201d approach to astronomy. This approach provides a more complete picture of astrophysical processes and events.\nAstrophysical Discoveries: One of IceCube\u2019s notable achievements includes tracing high-energy neutrinos back to a blazar, a supermassive black hole shooting out a jet of particles at nearly the speed of light, marking the first-time high-energy neutrinos were linked directly to a known source outside our galaxy.\nWhat are Neutrinos?\n\nNeutrinos are some of the most fascinating particles in the universe, fundamental to our understanding of the cosmos yet elusive in nature.\n\nNeutrinos are subatomic particles that are neutral in charge (hence the \u201cneutr\u201d prefix) and have an incredibly tiny mass, even by particle physics standards.\nTypes: There are three types, or \u201cflavors,\u201d of neutrinos: electron neutrinos, muon neutrinos, and tau neutrinos. They are associated with their corresponding charged leptons (electron, muon, and tau, respectively).\nMass: Neutrinos have mass, but it\u2019s so small that it hasn\u2019t been directly measured- only differences in mass between the flavors have been determined.\nInteraction: They interact with other matter only via the weak nuclear force (one of the four fundamental forces of nature), making them extremely difficult to detect as they can pass through entire planets without being disturbed.\nWhy Are Neutrinos Important?\nSun and Supernovae: Neutrinos are produced in vast quantities during nuclear reactions in the sun and other stars, as well as in the explosive events of supernovae. Studying them can provide deep insights into these astrophysical processes.\nFundamental Physics: Their existence and properties are integral to our understanding of the Standard Model of particle physics, and their peculiar behavior (like oscillating between flavors) challenges and enriches our understanding of the universe.\nBig Bang and Cosmic Evolution: Neutrinos are relics from the early universe, present from the first second after the Big Bang. They influence the evolution of the cosmos, affecting the formation of large-scale structures like galaxies.\nHow Do Scientists Study Neutrinos?\nDetection: Given their reluctance to interact with matter, detecting neutrinos requires massive and sensitive detectors. These are often placed deep underground or underwater to shield them from cosmic rays and other background radiation. Detectors are filled with materials like water or heavy water, where neutrinos occasionally interact, producing detectable light signals.\nExperiments: There are several major neutrino observatories and experiments around the world, such as Super-Kamiokande in Japan, SNO (Sudbury Neutrino Observatory) in Canada, and IceCube at the South Pole. These experiments have provided critical insights, including the discovery of neutrino oscillation.\nNeutrino Astronomy: Scientists are also pursuing neutrino astronomy, which could open new windows into observing the universe. Unlike light, neutrinos can escape dense and energetic environments without being absorbed or scattered, carrying information from the heart of supernovae, the sun, and possibly even distant phenomena like neutron star collisions.\n\nThe study of neutrinos continues to be a vibrant field, offering potential breakthroughs in our understanding of particle physics, astrophysics, and cosmology.\n\nWhy in the news?\n\nRecently, the scientists at IceCube neutrino observatory at the Earth\u2019s South Pole have produced an image of the Milky Way not based on electromagnetic radiation \u2013 light \u2013 but on ghostly subatomic particles called neutrinos.\n\nThey detected high-energy neutrinos in pristine ice deep below Antarctica\u2019s surface, then traced their source back to locations in the Milky Way \u2013 the first time these particles have been observed arising from our galaxy.\nIndian Neutrino Observatory (INO)\n\nThe Indian Neutrino Observatory (INO) is a proposed research facility to study atmospheric neutrinos, part of India\u2019s efforts to advance in the field of particle physics research.\n\nThe INO\u2019s main feature is planned to be a massive underground laboratory housing a magnetized iron calorimeter (ICAL) detector, specifically designed to study neutrinos.\n\nObjectives of the Indian Neutrino Observatory:\n\nNeutrino Physics: The primary aim of the INO is to provide empirical data on neutrino oscillations, a phenomenon that could help answer fundamental questions about the nature of these elusive particles, their masses, and how they fit into the Standard Model of particle physics.\nMatter-Antimatter Asymmetry: Through its neutrino research, the INO aims to contribute to understanding why the observable universe is predominantly composed of matter rather than a mix of matter and antimatter.\nGeoneutrinos: The facility also plans to study geoneutrinos, which are neutrinos produced by the natural radioactive decay of elements within the Earth. This research could provide insights into the Earth\u2019s composition and heat generation mechanisms.\n\nThe ICAL Detector:\n\nThe proposed centerpiece of the Indian Neutrino Observatory is the Iron Calorimeter (ICAL) detector, distinguished by several key features:\n\nMassive Size: The ICAL is planned to be a large-scale detector, with a mass of about 50,000 tonnes, comprised of magnetized iron plates.\nMagnetization: The ICAL\u2019s magnetization would allow it to distinguish between neutrinos and antineutrinos by detecting the charge of the produced particles, which is crucial for studying neutrino oscillations.\nResolution and Coverage: The detector is designed to have a high resolution for detecting muon tracks produced by muon neutrinos interacting with the iron. This feature is essential for precise measurements of neutrino energies and trajectories.\nLocation and Challenges\nSite Selection: The Indian Neutrino Observatory was initially proposed to be built in the Bodi West Hills region in Theni district, Tamil Nadu, India. This location is chosen for its geological stability and the natural shielding provided by the surrounding rock, which reduces the background noise from cosmic rays.\nEnvironmental and Approval Challenges: The project has faced opposition and delays due to concerns about its potential environmental impact, including the effect on local ecosystems and water sources. Obtaining environmental clearances and addressing the concerns of local communities have been significant hurdles.\nScientific and Educational Goals: Beyond its research objectives, the INO project aims to stimulate high-level scientific research and education in India, providing training for students and researchers in advanced experimental techniques.\nCurrent scenario\n\nThe Indian Neutrino Observatory is undergoing a tumultuous phase as its proposed site is an ecologically sensitive zone.\n\nThe Tamil Nadu government is against the project being established in the western Ghats tiger corridor that links the Periyar Tiger Reserve along the Kerala and Tamil Nadu borders and the Mathikettan Shola National Park.\nThe geographical location is also peculiar as all the existing neutrino detectors (in other countries) are at latitudes larger than 35 degrees North or South. There is none close to the equator as yet.\nConclusion\n\nThe Antarctic Neutrino Observatory, which also includes the surface array IceTop and the dense infill array DeepCore, was designed as a multipurpose experiment.\n\nIceCube collaborators address several big questions in physics, like the nature of dark matter and the properties of the neutrino itself.\n\nIceCube also observes cosmic rays that interact with the Earth\u2019s atmosphere, which have revealed fascinating structures that are not presently understood.\n\nRelated articles:\n\nLIGO India\nGRAPES-3 experiment\nFast Radio Bursts\nHiggs Boson\nFermions and Bosons\n\n-Article by Swathi Satish"

            "[CONTENT]": "Women\u2019s Urban Employment Guarantee Act (WUEGA): Bridging the Urban Employment Gender Gap\n\nIn recent years, India has made significant attempts to promote gender equality and empower women across various spheres.\n\nHowever, the challenge of ensuring equitable employment opportunities for women, particularly in urban areas, remains a pressing concern.\n\nTo address this issue, a proposal for the Women\u2019s Urban Employment Guarantee Act (WUEGA) has been gaining traction, aiming to bridge the gap in employment opportunities between men and women in cities.\n\nTable of Contents\n\nThe Rationale Behind Women\u2019s Urban Employment Guarantee Act\nGender Disparities in Urban Employment\nUntapped Potential\nLimitations of Existing Schemes\nThe Core Objectives of the Women\u2019s Urban Employment Guarantee Act\nKey Features of the Proposed WUEGA\nPotential Challenges and Considerations\nThe Way Forward for Effective Enactment of WUEGA\nConclusion\nThe Rationale Behind Women\u2019s Urban Employment Guarantee Act\n\nThe Rationale behind the WUEGA is:\n\nGender Disparities in Urban Employment\nUrban areas often witness stark gender-based disparities in employment opportunities.\nAccording to the Periodic Labour Force Survey (PLFS), only 22.9% of urban women were employed in the last quarter of 2023, highlighting the urgent need for targeted interventions.\nThis low figure indicates a significant unmet demand for employment opportunities among urban women.\nUnemployment rates in urban areas, which measure the proportion of individuals actively seeking or willing to take up employment, are higher at 9% compared to 4% in rural areas.\nAmong the unemployed, a larger share of urban women are actively seeking employment opportunities compared to their rural counterparts.\nUntapped Potential\nAn estimated 10.18 crore women in urban areas, aged between 15 and 59, are currently out of the workforce, representing a vast untapped potential that could contribute significantly to economic growth and development.\nUrban areas have a higher proportion of women (nearly 25%) who have completed higher secondary education, in contrast to only 5% in rural areas.\nThe low employment rates for urban women, despite their higher educational attainment, suggest a waste of potential and untapped human resources.\nLimitations of Existing Schemes\nWhile urban employment schemes exist, they do not adequately address the specific challenges faced by women, such as childcare responsibilities, safety concerns, and social norms that discourage their participation in the workforce.\nThe Core Objectives of the Women\u2019s Urban Employment Guarantee Act\n\nThe objectives of WUEGA are:\n\nEmpowering Urban Women: WUEGA aims to empower urban women by providing them with guaranteed employment opportunities, enabling them to contribute to their households and communities while achieving economic independence.\nPromoting Gender Equality: By ensuring access to employment, WUEGA seeks to promote gender equality and address the disparities that exist in urban labor markets, aligning with the sustainable development goals of the United Nations.\nAddressing Childcare and Infrastructure Needs: A key focus of WUEGA is to create supportive infrastructure, such as childcare facilities at worksites, enabling women to participate in employment without compromising their caregiving responsibilities.\nSkill Development: WUEGA proposes incorporating training programs to bridge any skill gaps between available jobs and the qualifications of women in the applicant pool, enhancing their employability and career prospects.\nKey Features of the Proposed WUEGA\n\nKey features of the proposed Women\u2019s Urban Employment Guarantee Act (WUEGA) are:\n\n\ud83d\udc49 Which year are YOU targeting for success in the IAS/IPS/IFS Exam? \ud83d\ude80\n\n(1) \u21d2 UPSC 2025: Prelims cum Mains\n\n(2) \u21d2 UPSC 2026: Prelims cum Mains\n\n(3) \u21d2 UPSC 2027 Prelims cum Mains\n\nTip: Know more about ClearIAS Courses (Online/Offline)\n\nGuaranteed Employment: The act proposes guaranteeing urban women a minimum number of workdays per year, such as 150 days, ensuring a stable source of income.\nLocal Work Opportunities: WUEGA emphasizes creating work opportunities within a reasonable distance, such as 5 km, from a woman\u2019s residence, addressing mobility concerns and reducing commute time.\nWomen-Led Management: The proposal suggests that women should form a significant percentage, ideally 100%, of the program management staff under WUEGA, ensuring leadership and decision-making roles for women.\nSupportive Measures: Incentives such as automatic inclusion in welfare boards could be created to provide maternity entitlements, pensions, and access to emergency funds, fostering a supportive ecosystem for working women.\nPotential Challenges and Considerations\n\nChallenges related to the WUEGA are:\n\nFinancial Burden: Implementing WUEGA would require significant financial resources, with the wage component alone estimated to cost around 1.5% of GDP, assuming 150 days of work per year at \u20b9500 as daily wages. Adding material and administrative costs could increase the total cost to around 2% of GDP.\nJob Creation in Localities: Creating diverse work opportunities within a reasonable distance (e.g., 5 km radius) from women\u2019s residences, especially in densely populated urban areas, could be challenging and may require careful planning and consideration of local needs and infrastructure.\nSafety Concerns: Social norms, lack of safety, and hostile transportation options are identified as factors inhibiting urban women from entering the workforce. Addressing safety concerns during commutes and at worksites would be crucial.\nSkill Gaps: A recent study found that three out of five women in Delhi and Bengaluru reported not having adequate skills as a constraint to getting secure employment. Bridging skill gaps and providing necessary training would be essential for the success of WUEGA.\nCapacity Building: Ensuring at least 50% (ideally 100%) of the program management staff are women may be challenging initially, necessitating focused capacity-building initiatives.\nSocial Norms and Gender Stereotypes: Deep-rooted societal norms and gender stereotypes could pose resistance to women\u2019s increased participation in the urban workforce, requiring efforts to change attitudes and promote gender equality.\nThe Way Forward for Effective Enactment of WUEGA\n\nTo ensure the successful implementation of WUEGA, a comprehensive approach is necessary:\n\nCollecting Gender-Disaggregated Data: Gathering gender-specific data on employment trends, job preferences, education levels, and other relevant factors will provide valuable insights for policymakers and inform the design of WUEGA.\nAddressing Safety Concerns: Measures to enhance the safety and security of women in public spaces, including adequate lighting, surveillance systems, and increased police patrolling, should be implemented to mitigate safety concerns and encourage greater workforce participation.\nSupporting Women Entrepreneurs: Providing support and incentives for women entrepreneurs, such as access to financial resources, mentorship programs, and networking opportunities, can create alternative avenues for employment and economic empowerment.\nPartnerships and Collaboration: Forging partnerships with civil society organizations, community groups, private sector stakeholders, and international agencies can leverage their expertise, resources, and networks for the successful implementation of WUEGA.\nDesigning with a Gender Lens: WUEGA should be drafted as a comprehensive legislation, delineating the rights, privileges, and responsibilities of both the government and recipients, grounded in gender-disaggregated data and ensuring equal pay for equal work.\nAllocating Resources and Building Capacity: Adequate financial resources must be allocated for wages, infrastructure, and capacity-building initiatives, including training programs for government officials, program administrators, and beneficiaries.\nPhased Implementation: A phased approach, starting with pilot programs in select urban areas and gradually expanding, can help test the feasibility of WUEGA, identify challenges, and refine the implementation strategy.\nMonitoring and Evaluation: Robust monitoring and evaluation mechanisms should be established to track implementation progress, assess program effectiveness, and identify areas for improvement, with a focus on outcomes such as employment generation, income enhancement, and skill development.\nRaising Awareness and Changing Attitudes: Conducting awareness campaigns and sensitization programs is crucial to challenge gender stereotypes, promote gender equality, and change societal attitudes toward women\u2019s roles and capabilities in the workforce.\nConclusion\n\nThe proposed Women\u2019s Urban Employment Guarantee Act (WUEGA) has the potential to be a game-changer in addressing the gender disparities in urban employment opportunities in India.\n\nBy providing guaranteed employment, supportive infrastructure, and skill development initiatives, WUEGA can empower urban women, promote gender equality, and contribute to economic growth and development.\n\nHowever, the successful implementation of WUEGA will require a multi-faceted approach, including adequate resource allocation, capacity building, addressing safety concerns, and challenging deep-rooted social norms and gender stereotypes.\n\nIt will also necessitate collaboration among various stakeholders, including government agencies, civil society organizations, and the private sector.\n\nUltimately, WUEGA aligns with the constitutional principles of equality and social justice, and its enactment can be a significant step toward fulfilling India\u2019s ethical and legal obligations to promote gender equality and empowerment.\n\nBy harnessing the untapped potential of urban women, WUEGA can pave the way for a more inclusive and equitable society, where economic opportunities are accessible to all, regardless of gender.\n\nArticle Written By: Priti Raj"

            "[CONTENT]": "Biomining is a fascinating and environmentally friendly technique used to extract valuable metals from ores or waste materials through the use of microorganisms. Read here to learn more.\n\nBiomining offers a sustainable alternative to traditional mining methods, often involving extensive drilling, blasting, and processing with harsh chemicals.\n\nBiomining for solid waste management represents an innovative and eco-friendly approach to handling the increasing problem of waste accumulation, particularly in landfills.\n\nThis method leverages biological processes to recover valuable materials from solid waste, thereby reducing landfill mass, recovering resources, and minimizing the environmental impact of waste disposal.\n\nTable of Contents\n\nBiomining for metal ores\nAdvantages of Biomining\nChallenges\nBiomining in Solid Waste Management\nAdvantages of Biomining in Solid Waste Management\nChallenges\nBiomining in India\nWhy in the news?\nConclusion\nBiomining for metal ores\n\nBiomining relies on the natural abilities of certain bacteria and archaea, which can leach metals from ores.\n\nThese microorganisms produce chemicals, such as sulfuric acid, that dissolve metals, allowing them to be recovered from the solution.\n\n\ud83d\udc49 Which year are YOU targeting for success in the IAS/IPS/IFS Exam? \ud83d\ude80\n\n(1) \u21d2 UPSC 2025: Prelims cum Mains\n\n(2) \u21d2 UPSC 2026: Prelims cum Mains\n\n(3) \u21d2 UPSC 2027 Prelims cum Mains\n\nTip: Know more about ClearIAS Courses (Online/Offline)\n\nThe process can occur in two main forms:\n\nBioleaching: This is the most common form of biomining and involves the extraction of metals from their ores by using living organisms. Bioleaching is particularly useful for extracting copper, gold, and other metals found in sulfide minerals. As the bacteria feed on the sulfide minerals, they convert them into soluble forms, allowing the metal to be leached from the ore.\nBiosorption or Bioremediation: In this method, microorganisms or their by-products bind to and concentrate metals from dilute solutions. This technique is often used to recover precious metals from wastewater or clean up heavy metal pollution.\nAdvantages of Biomining\nEnvironmental Benefits: It is considered more environmentally friendly than traditional mining methods. It reduces the ecological footprint by minimizing land disruption, water usage, and chemical pollution.\nEconomic Efficiency: For low-grade ores, which are not economical to process using conventional methods, biomining offers a viable and cost-effective alternative.\nEnergy Efficiency: It requires less energy compared to traditional smelting and refining processes, contributing to lower carbon emissions.\nAccess to Difficult-to-Reach Ores: Microorganisms can extract metals from ores that are too deep underground or too poor in quality for conventional mining.\nChallenges\nRate of Metal Recovery: The process is generally slower than traditional mining methods, which can be a significant drawback for commercial operations.\nControl of Conditions: Maintaining the optimal conditions for microbial activity (such as temperature, pH, and nutrient supply) can be challenging, especially on a large scale.\nMetal Specificity: It is not suitable for all types of metals or ores. Research is ongoing to expand the range of metals that can be efficiently recovered through this method.\nBiomining in Solid Waste Management\nCourtesy: Down to Earth\n\nIn the context of solid waste management, biomining involves using microorganisms to break down organic and inorganic components of waste.\n\nThe process can help segregate and recover metals and other valuable materials from mixed solid wastes, including electronic waste (e-waste), municipal solid waste, and industrial by-products.\n\nKey Processes in Biomining for Waste Management:\n\nBioleaching: Similar to its application in metal ore processing, bioleaching in solid waste management involves using bacteria to dissolve metals from waste materials, making it easier to recover them. This process is particularly relevant for e-waste, which contains significant amounts of precious and base metals.\nComposting and Anaerobic Digestion: While not strictly biomining, these biological processes play a crucial role in the biodegradation of organic waste materials. They transform organic waste into stable, nutrient-rich compost or biogas, effectively reducing the waste volume and recovering energy resources.\nBiosorption: This process involves using dead or live microorganisms to adsorb and concentrate heavy metals from waste streams. It\u2019s particularly useful in treating wastewater or remediating soils contaminated with heavy metals.\nAdvantages of Biomining in Solid Waste Management\nResource Recovery: Biomining facilitates the recovery of metals and other valuable materials from waste, contributing to resource conservation and circular economy initiatives.\nReduction of Landfill Space: By recovering materials and converting organic waste into compost or biogas, biomining reduces the volume of waste destined for landfills, extending landfill lifetimes.\nEnvironmental Protection: It decreases the leaching of heavy metals and other contaminants into the environment, reducing pollution and protecting ecosystems.\nEnergy Production: Through processes like anaerobic digestion, biomining can convert organic waste into biogas, a renewable energy source.\nChallenges\nTechnological and Economic Hurdles: The initial setup cost for the facilities and the optimization of processes for specific types of waste can be significant. Economies of scale and technological advancements are critical for making biomining a cost-effective option.\nRegulatory and Social Acceptance: Implementing it on a large scale requires regulatory support and public acceptance. Concerns about potential odors, pollution, and the technology\u2019s novelty need to be addressed.\nResearch and Development: Continued research is necessary to enhance the efficiency of the processes, including the identification and engineering of microorganisms capable of processing a wider variety of wastes.\nBiomining in India\n\nAccording to the Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB) guidelines, \u201cBiomining is the scientific process of excavation, treatment, segregation and gainful utilization of aged municipal solid waste lying in dumpsites typically referred to as legacy waste.\u201d\n\nIt comprises 4 steps: excavation of legacy waste, stabilizing the waste using bioremediation, segregation of excavated waste, and then sustainable management and its safe disposal.\nThe Solid Waste Management Rules, 2016 now mandate bio-mine legacy waste instead of \u2018capping\u2019 which means covering the waste with soil.\nThese rules focus on the segregation of waste at the source, the responsibility of the manufacturer to dispose of sanitary and packaging wastes, and user fees for collection, disposal, and processing from the bulk generator.\nWhy in the news?\n\nThe Municipal Corporation of Delhi (MCD) launched the biomining project to clear its three oversaturated landfill sites in July 2019 on the direction of the National Green Tribunal.\n\nThe NGT had directed that legacy waste dumps are to be cleared within one year but substantial progress must be made and demonstrated within six months.\nBut the ongoing biomining project at two of the Capital\u2019s three landfill sites \u2013 Ghazipur and Bhalswa \u2013 are likely to miss the latest deadline of 2024 to clear the sites\nConclusion\n\nBiomining offers a promising solution to the challenges of solid waste management by enabling the recovery of valuable materials, reducing landfill use, and mitigating environmental impacts.\n\nAs technology advances and societal attitudes toward waste and recycling evolve, biomining could play a pivotal role in sustainable waste management strategies worldwide.\n\n-Article by Swathi Satish"

            "[CONTENT]": "The One Water approach, also known as Integrated Water Resource Management (IWRM), is a comprehensive and inclusive strategy aimed at managing water resources holistically and sustainably. Read here to learn more about it.\n\nThis approach recognizes that all water- whether it\u2019s drinking water, wastewater, stormwater, or greywater -has value and should be managed in a unified and coordinated manner across the entire water cycle.\n\nAccess to safe water, sanitation, and hygiene is the most basic human need for health and well-being. Billions of people will lack access to these basic services in 2030 unless progress quadruples.\n\nWater demand is rising owing to rapid population growth, urbanization, and increasing water needs from the agriculture, industry, and energy sectors.\n\nThe Bengaluru water crisis has divulged the dire condition of water crisis especially in the urban areas.\n\nTable of Contents\n\nOne water approach\nKey Principles of the One Water Approach\nBenefits\nConventional water management vs IWRM\nWhy IWRM?\nChallenges\nConclusion\nPrevious year question\nOne water approach\n\nThe One Water approach seeks to break down traditional silos between drinking water, wastewater, and stormwater sectors to foster collaboration, enhance efficiency, and achieve shared water-related goals.\n\n\ud83d\udc49 Which year are YOU targeting for success in the IAS/IPS/IFS Exam? \ud83d\ude80\n\n(1) \u21d2 UPSC 2025: Prelims cum Mains\n\n(2) \u21d2 UPSC 2026: Prelims cum Mains\n\n(3) \u21d2 UPSC 2027 Prelims cum Mains\n\nTip: Know more about ClearIAS Courses (Online/Offline)\n\nThe idea of \u201cOne Water\u201d holds that all water, no matter where it comes from, is valuable.\nFor the benefit of the environment and the economy, it entails managing that source in an integrated, inclusive, and sustainable way that involves the community, industry leaders, businesspeople, farmers, environmentalists, legislators, academics, and others.\nThe new method of managing water resources is commonly known as integrated water resources management (IWRM).\nIWRM is an \u201cintegrated planning and implementation approach to managing finite water resources for long-term resilience and reliability meeting both community and ecosystem needs\u201d, according to the research organization Water Research Foundation.\n\nIt is a multi-faceted collaborative technique that strives for greater coordination among various stakeholders and decision-makers with the following objectives:\n\nReliable, secure, clean water supplies\nAquifer recharge\nFlood protection\nMinimizing environmental pollution\nEfficient use and reuse of natural resources\nResiliency to climate\nLong-term sustainability\nEquity, affordability, and accessibility to safe drinking water\nEconomic growth and prosperity\nKey Principles of the One Water Approach\n\nHolistic Management: One Water promotes the management of all water resources as a single, interconnected system. This principle acknowledges the interdependence of surface water, groundwater, and alternative water sources.\nSustainability: The approach prioritizes long-term water resource sustainability, focusing on conservation, resource recovery, and the protection of natural water cycles.\nResilience: By diversifying water sources and implementing integrated management practices, One Water enhances the resilience of water systems to withstand droughts, floods, and other climate change impacts.\nCollaboration: One Water encourages collaboration across different sectors, disciplines, and communities to leverage knowledge, resources, and efforts for comprehensive water management.\nInnovation: This approach supports the adoption of innovative technologies and practices, such as advanced water treatment, water reuse, and green infrastructure, to optimize water management.\nEquity: One Water aims to ensure equitable access to water resources and benefits, addressing disparities and involving communities in decision-making processes.\nBenefits\nWater Reuse: Treating and reusing wastewater for non-potable purposes, such as irrigation, industrial processes, or replenishing aquifers, reduces the demand for freshwater.\nStormwater Management: Implementing green infrastructure, like rain gardens, permeable pavements, and green roofs, can capture and utilize stormwater, reducing runoff and pollution while recharging local aquifers.\nIntegrated Planning: Coordinating land use and water planning helps manage the impacts of urbanization on water resources and promotes sustainable development.\nResource Recovery: Extracting nutrients, energy, and other valuable products from wastewater contributes to economic efficiency and environmental sustainability.\nConventional water management vs IWRM\n\nIWRM is superior to the conventional water management approach in several ways:\n\nIn the conventional water management approach, drinking water, wastewater, and stormwater are managed separately, whereas in \u2018One Water\u2019, All the water systems, regardless of their source, are connected intentionally and managed meticulously for water, energy, and resource.\nWater is recycled and reused several times in IWRM, in contrast to a one-way route from supply to use, treatment, and disposal.\nStormwater is utilized as a valuable resource to fight against water scarcity, recharge groundwater, and support natural vegetation.\nThe water system includes green infrastructures and a mix of grey and green infrastructure that form a hybrid system as compared to grey infrastructure in conventional water management.\nThe interconnectedness of surface water, groundwater, stormwater, and wastewater is collectively recognized and managed by these separate but connected entities.\nActive collaborations with industry, agencies, policymakers, business leaders, and various stakeholders are a regular practice in the One Water approach, whereas collaboration is need-based in conventional water management systems.\nWhy IWRM?\n\nWater is a key driver of economic and social development while it also has a basic function in maintaining the integrity of the natural environment.\n\nHowever, water is only one of several vital natural resources and water issues mustn\u2019t be considered in isolation.\nManagers, whether in the government or private sectors, have to make difficult decisions on water allocation.\nMore and more they have to apportion diminishing supplies between ever-increasing demands.\nDrivers such as demographic and climatic changes further increase the stress on water resources.\nThe traditional fragmented approach is no longer viable and a more holistic approach to water management is essential.\nThis is the rationale for the Integrated Water Resources Management (IWRM) approach that has now been accepted internationally as the way forward for efficient, equitable, and sustainable development and management of the world\u2019s limited water resources and for coping with conflicting demands.\nChallenges\nImplementing the One Water approach involves overcoming regulatory, financial, and institutional barriers.\nTraditional water management systems are often entrenched in sector-specific regulations and practices, making integrated approaches challenging.\nFinancial constraints and the need for significant investments in infrastructure and technology also pose hurdles.\nAdditionally, fostering collaboration among diverse stakeholders with varying interests requires effective communication and engagement strategies.\nConclusion\n\nThe One Water approach offers a promising path toward sustainable and resilient water management by recognizing the intrinsic value of all water resources and promoting integrated, innovative, and equitable management practices.\n\nAs water scarcity and quality concerns intensify under the pressures of climate change and population growth, adopting the One Water framework becomes increasingly essential for ensuring water security for future generations.\n\nPrevious year question\n\nWhat are the benefits of

            "[CONTENT]": "The Bengaluru water crisis refers to the ongoing struggle of one of India\u2019s largest and fastest-growing cities, to provide a sustainable and reliable water supply to its residents. Read here to learn more.\n\nDespite its reputation as India\u2019s Silicon Valley, Bengaluru faces severe water scarcity issues, exacerbated by rapid urbanization, population growth, inefficient water management, and climate change.\n\nAs of now, India\u2019s IT hub is grappling with a severe water crisis attributed to a prolonged drought.\n\nTable of Contents\n\nBengaluru water crisis\nKey Factors Contributing to the Crisis\nImpact of Bengaluru water crisis\nSolutions and Efforts\nWhat is the state doing?\nWay forward\nPrevious year question\nBengaluru water crisis\n\nThe Cauvery River\u2019s water levels have significantly dropped as a result of insufficient rainfall, which hurts agricultural irrigation and the availability of drinking water.\n\nMoreover, the situation is made worse by the depletion of borewells, underscoring the urgent need for quick action.\n\nDeputy Chief Minister Shivakumar disclosed that out of the 14,781 borewells under the Bengaluru Metropolitan Region Development Authority (BMRDA) and Bengaluru Water Supply and Sewerage Board (BWSSB), 6,997 have ceased to yield water.\nAs per the Karnataka State Natural Disaster Management Centre (KSNDMC), the water levels in key Cauvery Basin reservoirs, including Harangi, Hemavathi, KRS, and Kabini, stand at a mere 39 percent of their total capacity as of February 28.\nKey Factors Contributing to the Crisis\n\n\ud83d\udc49 Which year are YOU targeting for success in the IAS/IPS/IFS Exam? \ud83d\ude80\n\n(1) \u21d2 UPSC 2025: Prelims cum Mains\n\n(2) \u21d2 UPSC 2026: Prelims cum Mains\n\n(3) \u21d2 UPSC 2027 Prelims cum Mains\n\nTip: Know more about ClearIAS Courses (Online/Offline)\n\nOver-dependence on Distant Sources: Bengaluru primarily relies on the Cauvery River for its water supply, which is located about 100 kilometers away. The dependence on a single, distant source puts the city at risk, especially during drought years.\nDepleting Groundwater Levels: Over-exploitation of groundwater through borewells is a common practice in both urban and peri-urban areas of Bengaluru. This unregulated extraction has led to a dramatic decrease in groundwater levels, making it unsustainable in the long term.\nRapid Urbanization: Unplanned urban sprawl has led to the loss of lakes, wetlands, and green spaces, which traditionally recharged the groundwater. Many lakes that exist are heavily polluted and encroached upon, reducing their effectiveness as water sources.\nInefficient Water Management: Leakage and inefficiency in the water distribution network result in significant water loss. Estimates suggest that around 40-50% of water is lost due to leaks and unauthorized connections.\nPollution of Water Bodies: Industrial and domestic wastewater has led to the pollution of the remaining water bodies, making the water unfit for consumption or even agricultural use.\nClimate Change: Altered rainfall patterns, with extended dry periods followed by heavy monsoon rains, challenge the existing water management infrastructure, making it difficult to capture and store water effectively.\nImpact of Bengaluru water crisis\nWater Shortages: Many residents, especially in the outskirts and higher elevations of the city, face acute water shortages, relying on expensive and irregularly supplied water tankers for their daily needs.\nQuality Concerns: The water crisis also raises concerns about water quality, as the scarcity of water leads to the use of contaminated sources, increasing the risk of waterborne diseases.\nEconomic Impact: The water crisis affects not just the quality of life but also the economic prospects of the city, threatening its status as a global IT hub.\nSolutions and Efforts\n\nEfforts to address the Bengaluru water crisis involve a multi-faceted approach, focusing on both supply-side and demand-side solutions:\n\nRainwater Harvesting: Encouraging rainwater harvesting in residential and commercial buildings can help replenish groundwater and reduce dependence on distant water sources.\nWastewater Treatment and Reuse: Expanding and upgrading wastewater treatment facilities to enable the reuse of water for non-potable purposes can relieve pressure on freshwater resources.\nLake Restoration: Reviving and restoring the city\u2019s lakes can help recharge groundwater, improve biodiversity, and create additional water reservoirs.\nLeakage Reduction: Investing in the modernization of the water distribution network to reduce leaks and unauthorized use can significantly improve water availability.\nPublic Awareness and Conservation Measures: Educating residents about water conservation techniques and implementing stricter regulations on water use can help reduce demand.\nManagement Frameworks: The Integrated Water Resource Management (IWRM) framework must be the main emphasis of groundwater planning and management. It encourages the coordinated management of resources related to water, land, and other relevant resources.\nWhat is the state doing?\nTo address this pressing issue, the state government has devised a plan involving the utilization of milk tankers from the Karnataka Milk Federation (KMF) to transport water to Bengaluru.\nAdditionally, the government intends to take control of private borewells within the city and its vicinity.\nPhase 5 of the Cauvery project aiming to provide 110 liters of drinking water daily to 12 lakh people is expected to be completed by May 2024. The water shortage issue in the 110 villages added to BBMP in 2008 will be solved once the Cauvery V Stage work is done.\nThe Phase-5 project will also include underground drainage works, which are scheduled to be finished by December 2024. This involves laying 228 km of drainage pipeline and building 13 sewage treatment plants capable of treating 100 Megalitres per day of sewage water.\nWay forward\n\nThe management and security of water supplies for the people of Bengaluru are made more difficult by disputes over water sharing between Karnataka and adjacent states, especially about rivers like the Cauvery.\n\nThe federal government and state governments are engaged in a power struggle over how to divide up and allocate monies intended to alleviate the drought situation in Karnataka.\n\nAddressing the Bengaluru water crisis requires concerted efforts from the government, private sector, civil society, and citizens to ensure sustainable water management practices that can support the city\u2019s growth without compromising its water security.\n\nPrevious year question\n\nQ.\u00a0What is water stress?

Read here to learn more.\n\nManaging and disposing of nuclear waste safely is one of the most critical challenges in the nuclear power industry due to its potentially harmful effects on humans and the environment if not handled properly.\n\nThe complexity of nuclear waste management is compounded by the fact that some forms of waste remain radioactive and hazardous for thousands to millions of years.\n\nTable of Contents\n\nNuclear waste\nTypes of Nuclear Waste\nManagement and Disposal\nManagement of Nuclear Waste in India\nWealth from waste\nChallenges and Concerns\nWhy in the news?\nConclusion\nNuclear waste\n\nAny activity related to the nuclear fuel cycle, that produces or uses radioactive materials generates radioactive waste.\n\nThe management of radiation-emitting radioactive material is a matter of concern and is what sets nuclear waste apart.\nPublic acceptance of nuclear energy largely depends on the public assurance of safe management of radioactive wastes.\nNot all nuclear wastes are particularly hazardous or difficult to manage as compared to other toxic industrial wastes.\n\nRadioactive wastes are generated during various operations of the nuclear fuel cycle as well as the production and use of radionuclides for various societal applications.\n\nActivities like mining and processing of uranium ore, fabrication of nuclear fuel, generation of power in nuclear reactors, processing of spent nuclear fuel, management of radioactive waste, production and use of radionuclides for various industrial and medical applications, research associated with radioactive material, etc. generate the different types of radioactive waste.\nRadioactive waste can be in gas, liquid, or solid form, and its level of radioactivity can vary.\nThe waste can remain radioactive for a few hours several months or even hundreds of thousands of years.\nThe most important and advantageous property of radioactive waste is\u00a0\u2018Its radioactive hazard potential reduces with time depending on the half-lives of a radionuclide present in the waste\u2019.\nSuch feature differentiates them significantly from conventional chemical or industrial waste, hazard potential or toxicity of which does not alter with time and remains constant till its transformation to another suitable form.\n\nDepending on the level and nature of radioactivity, radioactive wastes can be classified as exempt waste, Low & Intermediate level waste, and High-Level Waste.\n\n\ud83d\udc49 Which year are YOU targeting for success in the IAS/IPS/IFS Exam? \ud83d\ude80\n\n(1) \u21d2 UPSC 2025: Prelims cum Mains\n\n(2) \u21d2 UPSC 2026: Prelims cum Mains\n\n(3) \u21d2 UPSC 2027 Prelims cum Mains\n\nTip: Know more about ClearIAS Courses (Online/Offline)\n\nRead:\u00a0Nuclear energy\n\nTypes of Nuclear Waste\nHigh-level waste (HLW): This includes used (spent) reactor fuel and waste materials remaining after spent fuel is reprocessed. HLW contains many of the highly radioactive fission products and transuranic elements generated in the reactor core. It requires cooling and shielding.\nIntermediate-level waste (ILW): This waste contains higher amounts of radioactivity than low-level waste but does not generate enough heat to require cooling. ILW includes resins, chemical sludge, and metal nuclear fuel cladding, as well as contaminated materials from reactor decommissioning. It typically requires shielding during handling and transport.\nLow-level waste (LLW): LLW comprises items like paper, rags, tools, clothing, filters, etc., which have been used in areas of nuclear facilities where radioactive materials are produced. LLW can include some materials from hospitals and industries. It has lower levels of radioactivity and may sometimes be disposed of in near-surface disposal facilities.\nVery Low-Level Waste (VLLW): This waste is similar to LLW but with even lower levels of radioactivity. It can often be disposed of with regular municipal trash, following specific regulatory exemptions.\nManagement and Disposal\n\nUtmost emphasis is given to waste minimization and volume reduction in the choice of processes and technologies adopted in nuclear waste management plants.\n\nAs a waste management philosophy, no waste in any physical form is released/disposed to the environment unless the same is cleared, exempted, or excluded from regulations.\n\nTemporary Storage: Spent nuclear fuel is initially cooled in spent fuel pools near the reactor site. After cooling, it can be moved to dry cask storage, which is a more stable form of storage.\nReprocessing: Some countries reprocess spent nuclear fuel to extract usable materials (such as plutonium and uranium) for use in nuclear reactors again. This process reduces the volume of high-level waste but introduces complex chemical processes and potential proliferation risks.\nDeep Geological Disposal: The most widely agreed-upon method for the disposal of high-level nuclear waste is deep geological storage in stable geological formations several hundred meters or more below the surface. Finland, Sweden, and France are at the advanced stages of developing such facilities.\nTransmutation: Research is ongoing into methods to transmute long-lived radioactive elements in spent fuel into shorter-lived or stable elements. However, this technology is not yet commercially available and faces significant scientific and engineering challenges.\n\nIn consideration of the primary objective of protecting human health, the environment, and future generations, the overall philosophy for the safe management of radioactive wastes in India, is based on the concept of\n\nDelay and Delay\nDilute and Disperse\nConcentrate and Contain\nRecycle and Reuse\n\nEffective management involves segregation, characterization, handling, treatment, conditioning, and monitoring before final disposal.\n\nManagement of Nuclear Waste in India\n\nHigh levels of radioactive waste are generated during reprocessing of spent fuel. Most of the radioactive isotopes in high-level waste emit large amounts of radiation and have long half-lives.\n\nThe management of high-level waste in the Indian context is carried out in the following three stages:\n\nImmobilization of high-level liquid waste into inert vitrified borosilicate glasses through a process called \u2018vitrification\u2019.\nEngineered interim storage of the vitrified waste for passive cooling & surveillance over some time, qualifying it for subsequent disposal.\nDisposal of the vitrified waste in a deep geological repository.\n\nVitrification\n\nIndia is one of the few countries to have mastered the technology of vitrification.\n\nOver the years BARC has developed the technology for vitrification of HLW. India has a unique distinction of having an operating vitrification plant at Trombay, Tarapur, and Kalpakkam.\nThe vitrified product is encapsulated in suitable containers and overpacks and stored for dissipation of radioactive decay, heat, and surveillance for 15-20 years.\nWealth from waste\n\nHigh-level radioactive liquid waste contains various useful fission products such as 137Cs,\u00a090Sr,106Ru, etc., which have many industrial as well as medical applications.\n\nThe energy associated with these isotopes can be used for blood irradiation, food preservation, sewage treatment, therapeutic applications, brachytherapy, and various other industrial applications.\nSeparation and recovery of these useful isotopes from radioactive waste and their deployment for societal application make the waste a material of resource.\n\nRead:\u00a0Waste to wealth\n\nChallenges and Concerns\nLongevity: Radioactive waste can remain hazardous for periods far beyond human civilization\u2019s current lifespan, raising ethical questions about our responsibility to future generations.\nSecurity: There is a need to ensure that nuclear waste storage and disposal sites are secure from theft and cannot be used for malicious purposes.\nEnvironmental Impact: Potential leakage from waste storage facilities could contaminate water and soil, posing a risk to ecosystems and human health.\nEconomic Costs: The construction, maintenance, and monitoring of safe disposal facilities for nuclear waste entail significant financial investments.\nWhy in the news?\n\nRecently, India loaded the core of its long-delayed prototype fast breeder reactor (PFBR) vessel, bringing it to the cusp of stage II, powered by uranium and plutonium \u2013 of its three-stage nuclear programme.\n\nBy stage III, India hopes to be able to use its vast reserves of thorium to produce nuclear power and gain some energy independence. However, the large-scale use of nuclear power is accompanied by a difficult problem: waste management.\nConclusion\n\nNuclear waste management requires meticulous planning, robust engineering solutions, stringent regulatory frameworks, and international cooperation to address the challenges posed by the safe disposal of nuclear waste and to minimize its impact on the environment and human health.\n\n-Article by Swathi Satish"

India has for the first time publicly acknowledged to have successfully developed the MIRV technology that is possessed by major nuclear countries. Read here to learn more about the Mission and MIRV technology.\n\nThe Defence Research and Development Organisation (DRDO) conducted the first successful flight test of an indigenously developed Agni-5 missile with Multiple Independently Targetable Re-Entry Vehicle (MIRV) technology.\n\nThe flight test named Mission Divyastra was carried out from Dr APJ Abdul Kalam Island in Odisha.\n\nVarious Telemetry and radar stations tracked and monitored multiple re-entry vehicles. The Mission accomplished the designed parameters.\n\nTable of Contents\n\nMission Divyastra\nAgni-5 missile\nMultiple Independently targetable Reentry Vehicle (MIRV) technology\nStrategic Implications\nCountries with MIRV technology\nConclusion\nMission Divyastra\n\nThe successful launch of Mission Divyastra by DRDO is an important milestone in India\u2019s nuclear capability.\n\nThis is the first flight test of an indigenously developed 5,000-km range Agni-5 nuclear missile, equipped with Multiple Independently Targetable Re-entry Vehicle (MIRV) technology.\nIt aims to deliver multiple warheads at different locations or the same location in a single launch. The warheads could include decoys to deceive the enemy\u2019s ballistic missile program.\nAgni-5 missile\n\nAgni missiles have been in the arsenal of the Indian armed forces since the early 1990s. This latest variant of the Agni missile is equipped with MIRV technology.\n\n\ud83d\udc49 Which year are YOU targeting for success in the IAS/IPS/IFS Exam? \ud83d\ude80\n\n(1) \u21d2 UPSC 2025: Prelims cum Mains\n\n(2) \u21d2 UPSC 2026: Prelims cum Mains\n\n(3) \u21d2 UPSC 2027 Prelims cum Mains\n\nTip: Know more about ClearIAS Courses (Online/Offline)\n\nRange: The Agni-5 is capable of striking targets over 5,000 kilometers away, although some sources suggest the actual range might extend further, potentially up to 8,000 kilometers under certain configurations. This range places it firmly within the category of an ICBM.\nPayload: It is designed to carry a nuclear warhead, with a payload capacity of around 1,500 kilograms. The missile is also capable of carrying multiple independently targetable reentry vehicles (MIRVs), allowing it to hit several targets with a single launch.\nPropulsion: The missile features a three-stage solid-fueled engine, which contributes to its long range and reliability. The solid-fuel propulsion makes it more mobile and quicker to deploy compared to liquid-fueled missiles.\nMultiple Independently targetable Reentry Vehicle (MIRV) technology\n\nMultiple Independently Targetable Reentry Vehicle (MIRV) technology is a sophisticated ballistic missile design that enables a single missile to carry multiple nuclear warheads, each capable of being aimed to hit a different target.\n\nThis technology represents a significant advancement in missile capability and strategic nuclear deterrence, as it allows a single missile to effectively destroy several targets simultaneously.\n\nKey Features of MIRV Technology:\n\nMultiple Warheads: Unlike older ballistic missile designs that carry a single nuclear warhead, MIRV-equipped missiles can carry several warheads, each capable of striking different targets. This can include a mix of warheads intended for different purposes, such as counterforce (military targets) and countervalue (cities and civilian infrastructure) targets.\nIndependent Targeting: The \u201cindependently targetable\u201d aspect of MIRV technology means that each warhead can be directed toward a different target. After the missile reaches a certain point in its trajectory, the warheads can be individually guided to their specific targets over a broad area.\nPenetration Aids: MIRVs often include countermeasures designed to defeat missile defense systems, such as decoys or chaff that can confuse radar systems and make it difficult to intercept the incoming warheads.\nIncreased Deterrence: By carrying multiple warheads, a MIRV missile greatly increases a country\u2019s nuclear deterrent capability. Even if a few warheads are intercepted, the likelihood that several will penetrate defenses and reach their targets is much higher.\nEfficiency and Cost-Effectiveness: Deploying missiles with MIRV technology can be more cost-effective for a country\u2019s nuclear arsenal, as fewer missiles and launchers are needed to maintain a credible deterrent force.\nStrategic Implications\n\nMIRV technology has significant strategic implications for global security and nuclear deterrence policies.\n\nIt complicates arms control efforts because it increases the number of warheads that can be delivered, making it harder to track and limit the total number of nuclear weapons.\nThe deployment of MIRVs can lead to arms races, as adversaries may feel compelled to increase their own arsenals to maintain parity or counteract the threat.\nCountries with MIRV technology\n\nDuring the Cold War, both the United States and the Soviet Union developed and deployed MIRV technology as part of their strategic nuclear forces.\n\nThe introduction of MIRVs was a pivotal moment in nuclear strategy, leading to various arms control agreements, such as the Strategic Arms Limitation Talks (SALT) and the Strategic Arms Reduction Treaty (START), aimed at controlling and reducing the proliferation of nuclear weapons and delivery systems.\n\nOther countries with the technology are:\n\nChina: China has been modernizing its nuclear forces and is known to have deployed MIRV technology on missiles like the DF-41 (Dong Feng-41) ICBM. This development is part of China\u2019s efforts to ensure the credibility of its nuclear deterrent.\nFrance: France possesses MIRV technology, which is deployed on its SLBMs like the M51 missile, carried by its Triomphant-class ballistic missile submarines. This capability enhances the strategic deterrent posture of France.\nUnited Kingdom: The UK\u2019s strategic nuclear deterrent is based on Trident II (D5) SLBMs, which are equipped with MIRV technology. These missiles are deployed on the Royal Navy\u2019s Vanguard-class submarines.\nPakistan is also on the path of developing MIRV as it launched the Ababeel medium-range ballistic missile.\nConclusion\n\nIn the modern era, MIRV technology remains a crucial component of the strategic nuclear forces of several countries, underscoring the ongoing importance of nuclear deterrence and the complex challenges associated with nuclear disarmament and non-proliferation efforts.\n\nIndia has joined a select group of countries that have the MIRV technology. The Mission Divyastra test means India has managed to ace the technology for miniature warheads.\n\nThe development and deployment of the Agni-5 are crucial for India\u2019s strategic autonomy and its position as a regional and emerging global power. It contributes to the credibility of India\u2019s \u201cNo First Use\u201d nuclear policy by enhancing its second-strike capability. The Agni-5\u2019s development reflects India\u2019s advancements in missile technology and its ability to independently develop sophisticated strategic weapons systems.\n\nRelated articles:\n\nIndia\u2019s Nuclear Weapon Programme\nAgni (P) Prime\n\n-Article by Swathi Satish"

Below are key aspects of how the Internet facilitates drug trafficking and the challenges it presents.\n\nIn an annual report, the International Narcotics Control Board has highlighted the role of Internet in drug trafficking and drug use.\n\nThis digital evolution in drug trafficking poses complex challenges for law enforcement, regulatory authorities, and policymakers.\n\nBut, there are also opportunities to use the Internet for drug use prevention and treatment to safeguard people\u2019s health and welfare, the Board says.\n\nTable of Contents\n\nRole of internet in drug trafficking\nKey aspects of the role of Internet in drug trafficking\nChallenges for Law Enforcement\nEfforts to Combat Online Drug Trafficking\nGlobal scenario\nInternational Narcotics Control Board (INCB)\nConclusion\nRole of internet in drug trafficking\n\nIn its 2023 Annual Report on the Role of internet in drug trafficking, the International Narcotics Control Board:\n\nfinds that online drug trafficking has increased the availability of drugs on the illicit market;\nwarns that patient safety is at risk from illicit Internet pharmacies selling drugs without a prescription directly to the consumer;\nhighlights the daunting task facing law enforcement authorities to monitor and prosecute online drug activities;\nsees opportunities to use the Internet and social media for drug use prevention campaigns and to improve access to drug treatment services;\nencourages governments to use the full range of INCB tools and programs to assist in their efforts to counter exploitation of the Internet for drug trafficking; and\nvoices concern about the persistent regional disparities in the availability and consumption of licit drugs for the treatment of pain.\n\nThe increased availability of illicit drugs on the Internet, the exploitation by criminal groups of online platforms including social media, and the increased risk of overdose deaths due to the online presence of fentanyl and other synthetic opioids are some of the key challenges for drug control in the Internet era.\n\n\ud83d\udc49 Which year are YOU targeting for success in the IAS/IPS/IFS Exam? \ud83d\ude80\n\n(1) \u21d2 UPSC 2025: Prelims cum Mains\n\n(2) \u21d2 UPSC 2026: Prelims cum Mains\n\n(3) \u21d2 UPSC 2027 Prelims cum Mains\n\nTip: Know more about ClearIAS Courses (Online/Offline)\n\nUsing social media and other online platforms means drug traffickers can advertise their products to large global audiences.\nVarious conventional social media platforms are being used as local marketplaces and inappropriate content is widely accessible to children and adolescents.\n\nEncryption methods, anonymous browsing on the darknet, and cryptocurrencies are commonly used to avoid detection, posing difficulties in prosecuting online trafficking offenses.\n\nOffenders can move their activities to territories with less intensive law enforcement action or lighter sanctions or base themselves in countries where they can evade extradition.\nThe sheer scale of online activity is an added complication.\nIn one case in France, law enforcement authorities collected over 120 million text messages from 60,000 mobile phones.\nKey aspects of the role of Internet in drug trafficking\n\nAnonymity and Encryption\n\nThe Internet, particularly through encrypted platforms and the dark web, provides a layer of anonymity to both buyers and sellers.\nServices like Tor (The Onion Router) allow users to browse the Internet anonymously, making it challenging for law enforcement to trace their activities.\nThis anonymity shields traffickers from direct detection and apprehension.\n\nOnline Marketplaces\n\nThe dark web hosts numerous online marketplaces, akin to illicit versions of eBay or Amazon, where users can buy and sell drugs without revealing their identities.\nThese marketplaces often feature user ratings, reviews, product descriptions, and customer service.\nTransactions are typically conducted using cryptocurrencies, which further complicates efforts to trace the movement of funds.\n\nSocial Media and Messaging Apps\n\nDrug traffickers also leverage social media platforms and encrypted messaging apps to market and sell their products.\nThese platforms are used for direct sales through private messages or to redirect potential buyers to other encrypted sites for transaction completion.\nThe widespread use of these platforms makes it difficult for authorities to monitor and intercept illegal drug sales.\n\nMail and Delivery Services\n\nThe Internet has facilitated a direct-to-consumer model for drug trafficking.\nOnce a transaction is completed online, drugs are often shipped to consumers through regular postal and courier services, blending in with legal parcels and making detection more challenging.\nThis method has expanded the geographical reach of drug traffickers, allowing them to operate and distribute globally with minimal physical risk.\nChallenges for Law Enforcement\n\nThe use of the Internet for drug trafficking presents numerous challenges for law enforcement and regulatory bodies, including:\n\nCybersecurity: The need for advanced cybersecurity measures and technologies to penetrate encrypted platforms without compromising the privacy of ordinary citizens.\nInternational Cooperation: Drug trafficking operations often span multiple countries, necessitating international cooperation and coordination to track and dismantle them.\nLegal and Ethical Considerations: The balance between surveillance for preventing drug trafficking and the protection of individual privacy and civil liberties.\nAdaptability of Traffickers: Drug traffickers rapidly adapt to law enforcement tactics, continually finding new ways to exploit technology and evade detection.\n\nThe manufacturing, marketing, movement, and monetization industries are particularly vulnerable to being exploited by those trafficking in dangerous substances.\n\nIn many parts of the world, there is not enough affordable morphine available to meet medical needs.\nThere was an acute need for medicines containing internationally controlled substances in 2023 for people caught up in natural disasters and emergencies related to climate change and conflict.\nEfforts to Combat Online Drug Trafficking\n\nEfforts to combat online drug trafficking include international collaborations such as INTERPOL and the European Union\u2019s Europol, which work together to share intelligence, conduct joint operations, and dismantle online drug trafficking networks.\n\nAdditionally, many countries are investing in cybersecurity and developing specialized units to tackle cybercrime associated with drug trafficking.\n\nIn Afghanistan, illicit opium poppy cultivation and heroin production declined dramatically. Alternative livelihoods need to be offered to affected farmers who may not have other sources of income.\nGlobal scenario\nThe opioid crisis continues to have serious consequences in North America with the number of deaths that involved synthetic opioids other than methadone continuing to increase, reaching more than 70,000 in 2021.\nDrug trafficking organizations continue to expand their operations in the Amazon Basin into illegal mining, illegal logging, and wildlife trafficking.\nRecord levels of illicit coca bush cultivation were recorded in Colombia and Peru, rising by 13 percent and 18 percent respectively. Seizures of cocaine reached a record level in 2021 in West and Central Africa, a significant transit region for cocaine.\nSeveral European countries have continued to establish regulated markets for cannabis for non-medical purposes. These programs do not appear to be consistent with the drug control conventions.\nSouth Asia appears to be increasingly being targeted for the trafficking of methamphetamine illicitly manufactured in Afghanistan to Europe and Oceania.\nPacific island States have transformed from solely transit sites along drug trafficking routes to destination markets for synthetic drugs. This is posing significant challenges to communities and their public health systems.\nInternational Narcotics Control Board (INCB)\n\nThe International Narcotics Control Board (INCB) is an independent, quasi-judicial expert body established by the Single Convention on Narcotic Drugs of 1961. It is mandated by the United Nations to monitor and support governments\u2019 compliance with the three international drug control conventions:\n\nThe Single Convention on Narcotic Drugs of 1961, as amended by the 1972 Protocol,\nThe Convention on Psychotropic Substances of 1971,\nThe United Nations Convention against Illicit Traffic in Narcotic Drugs and Psychotropic Substances of 1988.\n\nThe INCB has several key functions:\n\nMonitoring and Promotion of Compliance: The INCB monitors governments\u2019 compliance with international drug control treaties, identifies and highlights areas where problems exist, and works with countries to address these issues. It publishes an annual report that provides a comprehensive analysis of the global drug situation, including recommendations to governments and international organizations.\nEnsuring the Availability of Narcotics and Psychotropics for Medical and Scientific Purposes: One of the core missions of the INCB is to ensure that adequate supplies of drugs are available for medical and scientific purposes while preventing their diversion into illicit channels. The Board supervises the estimates system for narcotic drugs and the assessment system for psychotropic substances.\nPrevention of Illegal Drug Manufacturing and Trafficking: The INCB endeavors to prevent the diversion of chemicals used in the illicit manufacture of drugs by monitoring the implementation of Article 12 of the 1988 Convention. It works closely with governments to improve their regulatory controls over substances frequently used in the manufacture of illicit drugs.\nInternational Cooperation: The Board facilitates international cooperation among governments, UN entities, and other relevant organizations to strengthen drug control efforts. This includes providing technical assistance and guidance on implementing the drug control treaties.\nQuasi-Judicial Functions: The INCB may also engage in confidential direct dialogues with governments to address compliance issues. In extreme cases, the Board has the authority to recommend measures, such as the reduction or suspension of the supply of drugs to countries that are not complying with the treaties, although such measures are considered a last resort.\nConclusion\n\nWhile the Internet has provided drug traffickers with new avenues for conducting their operations, it also offers opportunities for innovation in law enforcement and regulatory responses. The dynamic nature of online drug trafficking requires continual adaptation and collaboration across borders to effectively combat this global issue.\n\nINCB is encouraging voluntary cooperation between governments and online industries to tackle the misuse of legitimate e-commerce platforms for drug trafficking. Its initiatives such as the GRIDS program have led to drug seizures and arrests as well as criminal networks being dismantled.\n\nRelated articles:\n\nNarcotics Control Bureau\nNDPS Act, 1985\nLinkages of organized crimes with terrorism\n\n-Article by Swathi Satish"

At current benchmark prices, this will mean Rs 30,000 subsidy for 1 kW system, Rs 60,000 for 2 kW systems, and Rs 78,000 for 3 kW systems or higher.\nThe households will apply for subsidy through the National Portal and will be able to select a suitable vendor for installing rooftop solar. The National Portal will assist the households in their decision-making process by providing relevant information such as appropriate system sizes, benefits calculators, vendor ratings, etc.\nHouseholds will be able to access collateral-free low-interest loan products of around 7% at present for installation of residential RTS systems up to 3 kW.\n\nOther Features of the Scheme\n\nA Model Solar Village will be developed in each district of the country to act as a role model for adoption of rooftop solar in rural areas,\nUrban Local Bodies and Panchayati Raj Institutions shall also benefit from incentives for promoting RTS installations in their areas.\nThe scheme provides a component for payment security for renewable energy service company (RESCO) based models as well as a fund for innovative projects in RTS.\nOutcome and Impact\nThrough PM-Surya Ghar Muft Bijli Yojana, the households will be able to save electricity bills as well as earn additional income through the sale of surplus power to DISCOMs.\nA 3-kW system will be able to generate more than 300 units a month on average for a household.\nThe proposed scheme will result in the addition of 30 GW of solar capacity through rooftop solar in the residential sector, generating 1000 BUs of electricity and resulting in a reduction of 720 million tonnes of CO2equivalent emissions over the 25-year lifetime of rooftop systems.\nIt is estimated that the scheme will create around 17 lakh direct jobs in manufacturing, logistics, supply chain, sales, installation, O&M, and other services.\n\nThe free component is that it will reduce the electricity bill as the consumer will receive a payback that can range from 3-7 years. Whatever capital cost is invested by consumers will be recovered in three to five years.\n\nThrough a system of net metering, any solar power produced in a household and unused will flow back into the grid and will be offset in the household\u2019s electricity bill.\nDepending on consumption patterns, this could even mean consumers earning money, though the general experience, the world over, shows a reduction in bills.\n\nThe major difference from previous versions of the scheme is a doubling of the subsidy on rooftop solar (from an earlier \u20b914,500 per kW) and an anticipated improvement in service delivery.\n\nAlso, only solar panels made by Indian industry would be eligible for the subsidy, this would also lead to a boost in domestic manufacturing capacity.\n\nAvailing Benefits of PM-Surya Ghar Muft Bijli Yojana\n\nThe Government has launched a massive campaign since the launch of the PM-Surya Ghar Muft Bijli Yojana to raise awareness and generate applications from interested households.\n\nHouseholds can register themselves on https://pmsuryaghar.gov.in to avail of benefits under the scheme.\nHouseholds interested in availing of the scheme\u2019s benefits will have to fork out the balance amount and pay a minimum of \u20b920,000 depending on the power capacity of the installed system though this could be defrayed by a low-interest, collateral-free loan.\n\nThe initial plan was to fully subsidize the installation of 1-3 KW solar systems in one crore households, but the scheme will now only contribute up to 60% of the costs.\n\nCurrently, a rooftop solar system costs about \u20b950,000 per KW. A householder can either pay the balance or take a loan.\nA vendor will appraise the site and then install the system along with an inverter and a smart meter that can switch between grid and solar supply.\nOperation and maintenance costs of up to five years will be factored into the cost.\nRooftop solar electricity: How it works?\nSolar Panels: These are the most critical components. They are installed on rooftops and convert sunlight into direct current (DC) electricity. The number of panels installed depends on the available roof space, the energy needs of the building, and budget constraints.\nInverter: The DC electricity generated by the panels is not directly usable by most home appliances, which run on alternating current (AC). An inverter converts DC into AC, making the electricity suitable for household use.\nGrid Connection: Many rooftop solar systems are connected to the power grid. This allows for a two-way flow of electricity. When the system produces more power than needed, the excess can be fed back into the grid, often in exchange for credits (net metering). When the system underproduces, such as during nighttime, electricity can be drawn from the grid.\nBattery Storage (Optional): Some systems include battery storage to keep excess energy for use when solar production is low. This enhances energy independence but adds to the cost.\nWay forward\n\nThe potential impact of widespread rooftop solar electricity generation is significant. It can play a crucial role in achieving global renewable energy targets, reducing the strain on traditional power grids, and combating climate change.\n\nTechnological advancements and decreasing costs are making solar more accessible, promising a brighter, cleaner future for global energy production.\n\nIndia was to have installed 40 GW of rooftop solar by 2022 but has only managed about 12 GW so far. Only a quarter of these are in houses with the rest in commercial settings. The PM-Surya Ghar Muft Bijli Yojana with its target of one crore households will expedite the target achievement for India.\n\nRelated articles:\n\nSolar energy: the potential of India\nIndian Power sector\nSolar waste management\n\n-Article by Swathi Satish"

Here\u2019s an overview of abortion laws globally, illustrating the spectrum of restrictions and freedoms.\n\nThe French Parliament on March 4, 2024, overwhelmingly approved a bill to enshrine abortion as a constitutional right at a historic joint session at the Palace of Versailles.\n\nWith this, it has become the only country to explicitly guarantee a woman\u2019s right to terminate a pregnancy voluntarily.\n\nTable of Contents\n\nGlobal Abortion laws\nStatistics\nGlobal abortion laws: Comparisons\nGlobal Abortion Laws: Comparative Insights\nConclusion\nGlobal Abortion laws\n\nThe abortion laws are in the news especially since the rollback of abortion rights in the United States in recent times, especially the U.S. Supreme Court\u2019s decision to overturn the 50-year-old ruling in Roe v. Wade.\n\nRoe v Wade, a 1973 landmark decision gave women in America the right to have an abortion before the fetus is viable outside the womb-before the 24\u201328-week mark.\n\nEnsuring access to safe, quality abortion services is a prerequisite for women\u2019s empowerment and bodily autonomy.\n\nAccess to safe abortion has been established as a human right by numerous international frameworks,\n\n\ud83d\udc49 Which year are YOU targeting for success in the IAS/IPS/IFS Exam? \ud83d\ude80\n\n(1) \u21d2 UPSC 2025: Prelims cum Mains\n\n(2) \u21d2 UPSC 2026: Prelims cum Mains\n\n(3) \u21d2 UPSC 2027 Prelims cum Mains\n\nTip: Know more about ClearIAS Courses (Online/Offline)\n\nWhile abortion is not mentioned in the 17 Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), both SDG 3 (Health and well-being) and SDG 5 (Gender equality) have targets aiming to ensure (universal access to sexual and reproductive healthcare services) (target 3.7) and (universal access to sexual and reproductive health and reproductive rights) (target 5.6).\nAt the 1994 International Conference on Population and Development in Cairo, 179 governments signed a program of action that included a commitment to prevent unsafe abortion.\nIn 2015, the United Nations\u2019 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development expanded to call for universal access to services for reproductive health care.\nThe WHO first recognized unsafe abortion as a public health problem in 1967, and in 2003 it developed technical and policy guidelines that include a recommendation that states pass abortion laws to protect women\u2019s health.\n\nAccording to the Center for Reproductive Rights, 40% of women worldwide live in countries with restrictive abortion laws.\n\nThese restrictions have a significant impact on women\u2019s lives: each year, the World Health Organization estimates that 39,000 women and girls die from the consequences of unsafe abortions.\nHowever, even in countries where abortion is legal, barriers may still exist, such as high costs, waiting times, parental or marital consent requirements, and social stigma.\n\nThe issue of abortion remains highly political and controversial in many countries around the world.\n\nStatistics\n\nEach year, around seventy-three million abortions take place worldwide, according to the World Health Organization (WHO).\n\nThis translates to about thirty-nine abortions per one thousand women globally, a rate that has stayed roughly the same since 1990.\n\nThe rates have diverged between countries with fewer restrictions and those with more: Between 1990\u201394 and 2015\u201319, the average abortion rate in countries with generally legal abortion (excluding China and India) declined by 43 percent.\nBy contrast, in countries with severe restrictions on abortion, the average abortion rate increased by around 12 percent.\n\nThe safety of abortion procedures diverges widely between countries where abortion is generally legal and countries with high restrictions on abortion.\n\nAlmost 90 percent of abortions in countries with liberal abortion laws are considered safe, compared with just 25 percent of abortions in countries where abortion is banned.\nAccording to the WHO, approximately 5-13 percent of maternal deaths worldwide are due to complications from unsafe abortions, the vast majority of which occur in developing countries.\nGlobal abortion laws: Comparisons\n\nAlthough the legal status of abortion varies considerably by region, a large majority of countries permit abortion under at least some circumstances; globally, twenty-two countries ban abortion entirely.\n\nAround one hundred countries have some restrictions, typically permitting abortion only in limited situations, including for socioeconomic reasons, risks to a woman\u2019s physical or mental health, or the presence of fetal anomalies.\n\nUnited States: The Supreme Court\u2019s decision on June 24, 2022, to strike down Roe v. Wade, overturns almost fifty years of precedent that conferred a constitutional right to receive an abortion.\n\nRoe\u2019s reversal allows the thirteen states that have so-called trigger laws to either ban abortion automatically or by quick state action.\nWhile all of these state laws exempt abortions in cases of life-threatening pregnancies, many do not exempt pregnancies caused by rape or incest.\nRepublican lawmakers and anti-abortion advocates have praised the Supreme Court\u2019s decision, while Democratic lawmakers and abortion advocates have condemned it.\n\nHighly Restrictive Global Abortion Laws\n\nEl Salvador, Nicaragua, and Honduras: In these countries, abortion is illegal with no exceptions, even to save the life of the woman.\nPoland: Abortion is allowed only in cases of rape, incest, severe fetal abnormalities, or when the woman\u2019s life or health is at risk. The recent tightening of laws, especially regarding fetal abnormalities, has sparked significant protests.\n\nModerately Restrictive Global Abortion Laws\n\nIndia: Abortion law in India allows for termination up to 24 weeks of pregnancy for a broad range of conditions, including rape, incest, fetal abnormalities, and risk to the physical or mental health of the woman. Recent amendments propose to extend this to 24 weeks for certain categories of women.\nBrazil: Abortion is legal in cases of rape, a threat to the woman\u2019s life, or if the fetus is anencephalic (lacking a significant part of the brain and skull).\n\nLess Restrictive Global Abortion Laws\n\nGermany: Abortion is permitted in the first trimester after mandatory counseling and a three-day waiting period. It is also allowed later in pregnancy for serious medical reasons.\nChina: In 2021, China increased the limit to three children, and China\u2019s State Council issued guidelines on women\u2019s development that called to reduce \u201cnon\u2013medically necessary abortions.\u201d\nAfrican countries: In 2010, Kenya adopted a new constitution and expanded the grounds on which women could obtain an abortion to include emergency cases or those in which the health of the mother is at stake. In June 2019, a court extended the exceptions to include cases of rape.\nAs other former European colonies reevaluate their abortion statutes, many are expanding the grounds for abortion. For instance, Burkina Faso, Chad, Guinea, Mali, and Niger- nations whose restrictive abortion laws were holdovers from the 1810 Napoleonic Code imposed by France- have made abortion legal in cases of rape, incest, or fetal impairment.\n\nPermissive Global Abortion Laws\n\nCanada: Abortion is legal at all stages of pregnancy and is governed by the Canada Health Act. The decision is between the woman and her physician, with access varying by province.\nAustralia: Laws vary by state, but abortion is generally available on request during the first trimester and under certain conditions in the later stages of pregnancy.\nIreland: In 2018, the Irish parliament legalized the termination of pregnancy before twelve weeks, as well as in cases in which the health of the mother is at stake. Previously, Ireland had one of the most restrictive abortion laws in Europe, codified in a 1983 constitutional amendment that effectively banned the practice. The 2012 death of Savita Halappanavar after she was denied an emergency abortion reignited public debate and protest and prompted a countrywide referendum to overturn the amendment.\nZambia: Zambia is one of the few countries in Africa where abortion is permitted for economic and social reasons, but, despite having a liberal law, structural and cultural barriers make it difficult for Zambian women to obtain abortions.\n\nVery Permissive Global Abortion Laws\n\nSweden: Abortion is available on request up to 18 weeks of pregnancy, after which it can be performed for medical reasons.\nNetherlands: Abortion is available on request up to 24 weeks. Beyond that, it is available only if there are grave health risks to the woman or severe fetal abnormalities.\nFrance: In 2024, France became the first country to enshrine abortion rights in its constitution. Abortion rights had been decriminalized in 1975 in a controversial act that legalized the procedure up to the tenth week of pregnancy.\nGlobal Abortion Laws: Comparative Insights\nLegal Period for Abortion on Request: The gestational limit for abortion on request varies, with most countries allowing it up to 12-14 weeks. Some countries extend this period up to 18-24 weeks.\nGrounds Beyond Gestational Limits: In many countries, abortion beyond the general gestational limit is allowed under specific circumstances, such as risk to the woman\u2019s life or health, rape, incest, or fetal abnormalities.\nRegulatory Mechanisms: Countries with permissive laws often implement certain regulations, such as mandatory counseling, waiting periods, and parental consent for minors, to safeguard women\u2019s health and well-being.\nConclusion\n\nThe comparison of global abortion laws shows that various factors influence abortion laws and remain a contentious issue worldwide. The trend in some regions has been towards liberalization of laws to improve access to safe abortion services, while in others, restrictions remain tight, reflecting ongoing political, religious, and social debates.\n\nRelated article:\u00a0Reproductive rights of women\n\n-Article by Swathi Satish"

            "[META]": "Last updated on March 7, 2024 by ClearIAS Team",
            "[CONTENT]": "Economic espionage refers to the covert collection of trade secrets or proprietary information from a company or nation by another entity, with the intent of using it to gain a competitive edge. Read here to learn more.\n\nEconomic espionage is conducted not just for the advantage of individual companies, but often with the support or direct involvement of national governments, aiming to bolster their economic interests at the expense of foreign competitors.\n\nIn 2017, the Department of Legal Affairs and Legislative Department forwarded a reference to the law commission to examine the possibility of enacting a Trade Secrets and Economic Espionage Act.\n\nTable of Contents\n\nEconomic Espionage\nWhat are Trade secrets?\nWhy in the news?\nChallenges of economic espionage\nWay forward\nEconomic Espionage\n\nEconomic espionage refers to the act of stealing trade secrets, proprietary information, intellectual property (IP), or confidential business strategies from companies, governments, or institutions to use it to gain a competitive advantage, often for the benefit of another company or country.\n\nThis form of espionage is focused on commercial, rather than national security, interests and can involve a wide range of activities, including cyber hacking, surveillance, bribery, and infiltration by corporate spies.\n\nTargets and Tactics: The primary targets are trade secrets, confidential business plans, innovative technologies, manufacturing processes, and other forms of intellectual property. Tactics can range from cyber hacking and insider threats to surveillance and the exploitation of business relationships.\nLegal Framework: Various countries have enacted laws specifically aimed at combating economic espionage. For example, the United States has the Economic Espionage Act of 1996, which makes the theft or misappropriation of a trade secret a federal crime if the act benefits a foreign government, foreign instrumentality, or foreign agent.\nImpact on Businesses and National Security: The impact of economic espionage can be profound, affecting not just the competitive edge and financial standing of companies but also national security. In sectors like defense, energy, and telecommunications, the theft of proprietary technology can compromise a country\u2019s technological superiority and infrastructure resilience.\nInternational Relations and Trade: Economic espionage often strains relations between countries, leading to diplomatic conflicts and affecting international trade. Actions taken by governments against suspected espionage, such as sanctions, trade restrictions, or legal action, can have wide-ranging implications for global commerce and diplomacy.\nCyber Espionage: With the proliferation of digital technology, cyber espionage has become a predominant method for conducting economic espionage. Hackers can infiltrate company networks to steal data, often with sophisticated malware or through social engineering tactics. These cyber activities are increasingly linked to state actors, complicating the international cybersecurity landscape.\nCountermeasures: Companies and governments invest heavily in countermeasures to protect sensitive information. These include cybersecurity defenses, counterintelligence operations, and legal actions. There is also a growing emphasis on awareness and training to mitigate insider threats and safeguard against social engineering tactics.\nWhat are Trade secrets?\n\nTrade secrets are intellectual property rights on confidential information that may be sold or licensed. They derive their value from being kept secret.\n\n\ud83d\udc49 Which year are YOU targeting for success in the IAS/IPS/IFS Exam? \ud83d\ude80\n\n(1) \u21d2 UPSC 2025: Prelims cum Mains\n\n(2) \u21d2 UPSC 2026: Prelims cum Mains\n\n(3) \u21d2 UPSC 2027 Prelims cum Mains\n\nTip: Know more about ClearIAS Courses (Online/Offline)\n\nTrade secrets are considered a form of intellectual property (IP) and are protected without the necessity of registration, unlike patents, trademarks, and copyrights, which require formal registration for protection under intellectual property law.\n\nNot Generally Known or Readily Accessible: The information must not be generally known to or readily accessible by the public or others who can obtain economic value from its disclosure or use.\nEconomic Value: The secret must provide some sort of economic benefit to its holder, which derives from its secrecy.\nSubject to Reasonable Steps to Keep Secret: The holder of the trade secret must make reasonable efforts to maintain its secrecy. This can include measures such as non-disclosure agreements (NDAs), secure storage, and limited access.\n\nWhile trade secrets do not expire as long as the secrecy is maintained, protecting them can be challenging, especially in the digital age where information can be easily and quickly distributed. Additionally, if a trade secret is independently discovered, reverse-engineered, or becomes public through legal means (such as a published patent), protection is lost.\n\nWhy in the news?\n\nThe 22nd Law Commission recommended that new legislation be introduced to protect trade secrets with exceptions relating to whistleblower protection, compulsory licensing, government use, and public interest.\n\nCurrently, India lacks a specific law for the protection of trade secrets. Instead, they are safeguarded under the general laws governing contracts, common law, criminal law, and principles of breach of confidence and equity.\nThe 289th Law Commission Report, published on \u2018Trade Secrets and Economic Espionage\u2019, states that the reference to the commission arose after deliberations in the government, where the need for legislation on the subject was felt.\n\nThe Commission has looked at the Trade-Related Aspects of Intellectual Property Rights (TRIPS) Agreement and India\u2019s obligations arising from it.\n\nIt has also explored the development of laws relating to trade secrets and economic espionage in other jurisdictions like the UK, USA, EU, and Germany while proposing a draft Protection of Trade Secrets Bill, 2024.\nOn the subject of economic espionage, the report states that \u201ceven trade secrets held by the Government of India have been consistently targeted by foreign governments in acts of active and passive economic espionage\u201d, and hence, there is a need for a single statute to address \u201call issues related to trade secret leakages and economic espionage\u201d.\nChallenges of economic espionage\n\nThe increasingly interconnected and digital nature of the global economy presents both opportunities and vulnerabilities.\n\nAs companies and nations become more dependent on technology, the incentives and capabilities for economic espionage expand, making it a persistent and evolving threat.\n\nThe challenge lies in balancing economic openness and cooperation with the need for security and the protection of intellectual property.\n\nBusinesses and governments take several countermeasures to protect against economic espionage, including:\n\nImplementing robust cybersecurity measures to protect against hacking and cyber theft.\nConducting thorough background checks on employees and maintaining a strict policy on access to sensitive information.\nUsing legal tools like non-disclosure agreements (NDAs) and non-compete clauses to deter and have recourse against espionage by employees or partners.\nRegularly updating and auditing security protocols and training employees on recognizing and reporting potential espionage activities.\nWay forward\n\nInternational cooperation and legal frameworks are crucial in addressing economic espionage, but they face obstacles such as differing national laws, priorities, and capacities for enforcement. The dynamic nature of technology and international trade means that strategies to combat economic espionage must be continually adapted and updated.\n\nRelated articles:\n\nCyber security in India\nIntelligence agencies of different countries\nIntelligence agencies of India\n\n-Article by Swathi Satish"

Here\u2019s an in-depth look at zero carbon buildings.\n\nThe principle behind the idea is that the total amount of energy used by the building on an annual basis is roughly equal to the amount of renewable energy created on-site or in other ways compensated for (e.g., via renewable energy credits or off-site renewable energy sources).\n\nThe concept is central to discussions on reducing carbon footprints, mitigating climate change, and moving towards a sustainable future.\n\nTable of Contents\n\nZero carbon buildings\nBenefits\nChallenges of Zero carbon buildings\nWhy in the news?\nNet-zero emissions\nWay forward\nConclusion\nZero carbon buildings\n\nNote: Subscribe to the ClearIAS YouTube Channel to learn more.\n\nZero carbon buildings incorporate a variety of design strategies, technologies, and operational practices, including but not limited to:\n\n\ud83d\udc49 Which year are YOU targeting for success in the IAS/IPS/IFS Exam? \ud83d\ude80\n\n(1) \u21d2 UPSC 2025: Prelims cum Mains\n\n(2) \u21d2 UPSC 2026: Prelims cum Mains\n\n(3) \u21d2 UPSC 2027 Prelims cum Mains\n\nTip: Know more about ClearIAS Courses (Online/Offline)\n\nEnergy Efficiency: A fundamental aspect is designing buildings that require minimal energy for heating, cooling, lighting, and other operations. This involves using high-efficiency insulation, windows, and materials that minimize energy loss and optimize energy use.\nRenewable Energy Sources: Integrating renewable energy sources such as solar panels, wind turbines, geothermal systems, and biomass energy to generate electricity or heat, thereby offsetting the energy use of the building.\nSmart Building Technologies: Utilizing advanced control systems for lighting, heating, and cooling that adapt to occupancy and changing environmental conditions to minimize energy use.\nPassive Design: Leveraging natural energy sources and sinks, such as sunlight for heating and natural ventilation for cooling, often through the strategic orientation of the building, well-designed window placements, and thermal mass use.\nBenefits\nEnvironmental: By significantly reducing greenhouse gas emissions, zero carbon buildings play a crucial role in combating climate change.\nEconomic: While the initial investment may be higher, the operational costs of zero carbon buildings are much lower over time due to reduced energy consumption. This can lead to significant savings and protect against future increases in energy prices.\nHealth and Well-being: Many zero carbon buildings also focus on indoor environmental quality, which can lead to better air quality, more natural light, and overall healthier living and working environments.\nChallenges of Zero carbon buildings\nUpfront Costs: The initial cost of integrating high-efficiency systems and renewable energy technologies can be higher than traditional buildings, although costs are steadily decreasing.\nTechnological and Design Complexity: Achieving zero carbon status requires advanced design techniques, detailed energy modeling, and sometimes complex technologies that can pose challenges in terms of design, construction, and operation.\nPolicy and Regulatory Environment: In many regions, supportive policies and regulations are still evolving. Financial incentives, subsidies, and supportive regulatory frameworks can significantly impact the feasibility and adoption of zero carbon buildings.\nWhy in the news?\n\nIndia\u2019s first city-specific Zero Carbon Buildings Action Plan (ZCBAP) has been launched in Nagpur on March 4, 2024.\n\nUnder the action plan, buildings in the city will be transformed to meet net-zero emission goals by 2050.\nThe plan seeks to contribute towards India\u2019s net-zero emission goal by 2070.\nThe ZCBAP road map covers various types of buildings, including public buildings, affordable housing, commercial buildings, and private homes.\nIt also includes strategies for reducing greenhouse gas emissions through the choice of building materials and improved design, construction, management, and deconstruction practices.\n\nThe project has been developed by the Nagpur Smart and Sustainable City Development Corporation Ltd (NSSCDCL) in collaboration with the Nagpur Municipal Corporation (NMC), the World Resources Institute (WRI), the Global Environment Facility (GEF), the United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP), and ICLEI South Asia.\n\nNet-zero emissions\n\nNet zero means cutting carbon emissions to a small number of residual emissions that can be absorbed and durably stored by nature and other carbon dioxide removal measures, leaving zero in the atmosphere.\n\nScience shows clearly that to avert the worst impacts of climate change and preserve a livable planet, global temperature increase needs to be limited to 1.5\u00b0C above pre-industrial levels.\nCurrently, the Earth is already about 1.1\u00b0C warmer than it was in the late 1800s, and emissions continue to rise.\nTo keep global warming to no more than 1.5\u00b0C \u2013 as called for in the Paris Agreement \u2013 emissions need to be reduced by 45% by 2030 and reach net zero by 2050.\n\nIndia has set an ambitious goal to achieve net-zero emissions by 2070, a target announced by the Prime Minister during the COP26 UN Climate Change Conference in Glasgow in 2021.\n\nRenewable Energy Expansion: India aims to increase its renewable energy capacity to 500 GW by 2030. This includes solar, wind, biomass, and small hydroelectric power sources, significantly reducing dependence on fossil fuels.\nElectric Vehicles (EVs): Promoting the adoption of electric vehicles to reduce emissions from the transportation sector, including efforts to develop EV manufacturing and charging infrastructure.\nGreen Hydrogen: India is focusing on developing green hydrogen as a clean fuel alternative for industries like steel and chemicals, which are traditionally energy-intensive and rely on fossil fuels.\nEnergy Efficiency: Enhancing energy efficiency across various sectors, including industrial, residential, and commercial, through technology upgrades and policy measures.\nAfforestation: Committing to extensive afforestation efforts to enhance carbon sinks, India plans to restore degraded land and increase its forest cover.\nFinancial Initiatives: The country is also looking to mobilize funds and investments to support its transition to a low-carbon economy, including international climate finance and green bonds.\n\nAlso read: Climate Targets: What are India\u2019s Revised Climate Goals?\n\nWay forward\n\nThe push towards zero carbon buildings is gaining momentum globally, driven by a mix of environmental imperatives, policy measures, technological advancements, and a growing recognition of their long-term benefits. Governments and industries worldwide are increasingly adopting stringent energy efficiency standards and setting ambitious targets for reducing carbon emissions.\n\nThe International Energy Agency (IEA) and various international consortia are advocating for the wider adoption of net-zero energy buildings as a critical pathway towards achieving global climate goals and sustainable development objectives.\n\nConclusion\n\nZero carbon buildings represent a pivotal shift in how we think about and construct the built environment. They offer a promising solution to reduce our carbon footprint, promote renewable energy, and create sustainable, healthy communities for future generations.\n\nRelated articles:\n\nGreen growth\nCarbon capture, Utilization, and Storage policy\nDecarbonising transport sector\n\n-Article by Swathi Satish"

Despite being politically dominant, many within the community claim to face economic hardships and limited access to education and employment opportunities.\n\n2014: The Maharashtra government announced a 16% reservation for Marathas under a new category called the Educationally and Socially Backward Class (ESBC).\nBombay High Court\u2019s Ruling: The Bombay High Court, while acknowledging the need for Maratha reservations, stated that the 16% quota was not justifiable and suggested that a quota of 12% in education and 13% in jobs would be more appropriate.\n2018 Maharashtra Law: The Maharashtra Legislature passed a bill proposing 16% reservation for Marathas under the Socially and Educationally Backward Classes (SEBC) Act, 2018.\nSupreme Court Intervention: Implementing the quota faced challenges and was subject to scrutiny in the courts. Petitioners argued against the reservation, claiming it violated the Supreme Court\u2019s 50% cap on reservations established in the Indra Sawhney case (1992). The Maharashtra government, defending the quota, cited the community\u2019s backwardness as justification.\n2021 Supreme Court Verdict: The Supreme Court of India struck down the Maharashtra law granting reservations to the Maratha community in admissions and government jobs, stating it exceeded the 50% cap on reservations and did not meet the criteria to break this limit. The court found that the Maratha community was not a socially and educationally backward class to the extent that it warranted surpassing the cap.\nImplications of the Supreme Court verdict\n\nThe Supreme Court\u2019s decision was a significant setback to the Maratha community\u2019s demand for reservations. It reaffirmed the 50% cap on total reservations and emphasized the need for a robust justification to exceed this limit, which the Maratha quota did not fulfill according to the court.\n\nFollowing the verdict, the Maharashtra government and various Maratha organizations have been exploring alternative ways to provide support to the community, including through educational and economic measures. The issue remains a contentious and politically sensitive matter in Maharashtra, reflecting the complex interplay of caste, politics, and social justice in India.\n\nWhy in the news?\n\nThe Maharashtra Assembly in February 2024 unanimously passed a Bill granting 10% reservation in education and government jobs to the Maratha community by introducing the Maharashtra State Reservation for Socially and Educationally Backward Classes Bill, 2024.\n\nThe principle of the creamy layer will be applicable and reservation under this Act will be available only to those in the Socially and Educationally Backward Classes who are not in the creamy layer category.\nCurrently, Maharashtra has 52 per cent reservation \u2013 SC (13%); ST (7%), OBC (19%), Vimukt Jati (3%), Nomadic Tribe B (2.5%), Nomadic Tribe C (3.5%); Nomadic Tribe D (2%); and Special Backward Classes (2%).\nBesides, 10 per cent is reserved for the EWS category, and with the addition of 10 per cent for Marathas, total reservations in the state will reach 72%.\n\nThe bill is based on a report from the State Commission of Maharashtra for Backward Class (SCMBC), which found that Marathas, constituting 28 per cent of Maharashtra\u2019s population, face significant backwardness, justifying the reservation exceeding the 50 per cent limit.\n\nChallenges of Maratha quota law\n\nThe Maratha community\u2019s demand for reservation has been partly driven by perceived economic hardships, especially in the agrarian sector, and the desire for better representation in education and government jobs. They argue that their numerical strength does not translate into socio-economic benefits.\n\nOne of the critical concerns has been the potential impact of the Maratha reservation on the existing OBC quota.\n\nThere is apprehension among OBC communities that including Marathas in the OBC category or creating a special reservation for them might dilute the opportunities available to the current OBC beneficiaries.\nThis has led to tensions between the communities, with OBC groups fearing that their share of reservations in education and employment might be adversely affected.\nConclusion\n\nThe Maratha versus OBC due to Maratha quota law highlights the complexities of reservation politics in India, reflecting the challenges of balancing socio-economic equity, legal frameworks, and the aspirations of diverse communities. It underscores the need for a nuanced approach to reservations, possibly through a more detailed socio-economic assessment, to ensure that affirmative action reaches those most in need without diluting the benefits for communities currently under the reservation umbrella.\n\nRelated articles:\n\nReservation in India\nWomen\u2019s Reservation Bill, 2023\nReservation of EWS\n\n-Article by Swathi Satish"

            "[CONTENT]": "Digital monopolies by big tech firms have become a significant concern in the global economy, raising debates about market power, competition, consumer choice, and innovation. This article delves into the nature of digital monopolies, their implications, and their regulatory challenges.\n\nThe firms, often called \u201cBig Tech,\u201d include giants like Amazon, Google, Facebook (now Meta), Apple, and Microsoft.\n\nTheir dominance in digital markets has brought them under regulators, policymakers, and public scrutiny.\n\nTable of Contents\n\nDigital monopolies\nThreats of digital monopolies\nRegulatory Challenges\nResponses to digital monopolies\nWhy in the news?\nGlobal responses to digital monopolies\nConclusion\nDigital monopolies\n\nA digital monopoly occurs when a company gains predominant control over a digital market, allowing it to set or influence prices, control supply, limit entry to new competitors, or significantly impact user choice and innovation. These monopolies are characterized by:\n\nNetwork Effects: The value of the service increases as more people use it, making it difficult for newcomers to compete.\nData Control: Accumulation and control of vast amounts of user data, enabling better market targeting and personalization, further entrenching their market position.\nEcosystem Lock-in: Creating a comprehensive ecosystem of interconnected products and services that make users reliant on a single provider for their digital needs.\nThreats of digital monopolies\nMarket Power and Competition: Digital monopolies can stifle competition by using their dominant position to favor their products and services, potentially leading to less innovation and higher prices for consumers.\nData Privacy and Security: With massive amounts of user data, these firms wield significant power and responsibility, raising concerns about privacy, data protection, and potential misuse of information.\nInfluence on Society and Democracy: Their control over digital platforms, especially social media, gives them considerable influence over public discourse, media, and even political processes, raising questions about accountability and transparency.\nRegulatory Challenges\n\nRegulating digital monopolies poses unique challenges, given the fast-paced nature of technology and the global reach of these companies:\n\nGlobal Jurisdictional Issues: Big Tech firms operate across borders, making regulation complex due to differing legal frameworks and jurisdictions.\nInnovation vs. Regulation: Finding a balance between curbing anti-competitive practices and not stifling innovation is a critical challenge for regulators.\nDynamic Markets: The digital economy is rapidly evolving, requiring regulatory frameworks that are flexible and adaptive to keep pace with technological advancements.\nResponses to digital monopolies\n\nGovernments and regulatory bodies worldwide have been exploring various approaches to address the issues posed by digital monopolies:\n\n\ud83d\udc49 Which year are YOU targeting for success in the IAS/IPS/IFS Exam? \ud83d\ude80\n\n(1) \u21d2 UPSC 2025: Prelims cum Mains\n\n(2) \u21d2 UPSC 2026: Prelims cum Mains\n\n(3) \u21d2 UPSC 2027 Prelims cum Mains\n\nTip: Know more about ClearIAS Courses (Online/Offline)\n\nAntitrust Actions: Investigating and taking action against anti-competitive practices, including breaking up parts of their businesses, imposing fines, or enforcing behavioral remedies.\nLegislative Reforms: Updating competition laws to better address the unique aspects of digital markets and monopolies.\nData Protection and Privacy Laws: Implementing stringent data protection regulations to safeguard user privacy and limit the power of Big Tech firms over consumer data.\nPromoting Open Standards and Interoperability: Encouraging or mandating standards that ensure interoperability between different platforms and services to enhance competition.\n\nIndia has a few measures in place for the same:\n\nCompetition Commission of India (CCI) protects Indian markets against anti-competitive practices by enterprises. It is a statutory body under the Competition Act, of 2002.\nConsumer Protection (E-Commerce) Rules, 2020 regulates e-commerce platforms and protects the rights of consumers.\nThe Digital Personal Data Protection Act, of 2023 ensures data privacy and security.\nWhy in the news?\n\nGoogle has taken down from the Play Store the apps of ten Indian companies, including prominent matrimony and dating apps in the country, that remained non-compliant with the tech giant\u2019s app billing policy for an extended period.\n\nThis comes in the wake of continued non-payment of service fees by these companies and their refusal to comply with the updated Payment Policy for the Google Play Store.\nIt also comes three weeks after the Supreme Court refused to grant any interim protection to domestic start-ups against the removal of the apps from the Play Store by Google.\nGlobal responses to digital monopolies\n\nGovernments and international bodies have increasingly scrutinized Big Tech\u2019s actions due to concerns over anti-competitive practices, privacy breaches, tax strategies, and their overall influence on democracy and society.\n\nEuropean Union: The EU has been at the forefront, implementing stringent regulations like the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) and pursuing antitrust investigations against companies like Google, Apple, and Amazon. The Digital Markets Act (DMA) and the Digital Services Act (DSA) are recent legislative proposals aimed at curbing the power of digital giants.\nUnited States: The U.S. has seen a resurgence in antitrust scrutiny under various administrations, with significant lawsuits filed against Google and Facebook for alleged anti-competitive practices. Efforts to break up these companies have been discussed, and there are calls for revising antitrust laws to better address the nuances of digital markets. In 2022, the five largest tech companies (Apple, Google, Meta/Facebook, Amazon, and Microsoft), all faced lawsuits or investigations.\nChina: China has taken robust actions against its tech giants, such as Alibaba and Tencent, to curb their market dominance, enforce anti-monopoly laws, and ensure data security and consumer protection.\n\nGlobal actions concerning data privacy and security have intensified, with numerous countries adopting or planning to introduce regulations inspired by the EU\u2019s GDPR.\n\nCross-border data flows: There is growing concern and action regarding the control and flow of data across borders, with implications for data sovereignty and national security.\nData localization: Countries like India and Russia have implemented data localization requirements, demanding that certain types of data be stored within national borders.\n\nThe issue of fair taxation of multinational tech companies has led to global initiatives aimed at ensuring these companies pay taxes where they generate value.\n\nOver 130 countries agreed on a framework under the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) to ensure multinational enterprises pay a fair share of taxes, including a global minimum corporate tax rate.\n\nIn response to the dominance of American and Chinese tech giants, several countries are promoting digital sovereignty and supporting local competitors.\n\nDigital services taxes: France and other countries have introduced or are considering digital services taxes aimed specifically at tech giants, which has led to international disputes and negotiations.\nSupport for local tech ecosystems: Nations are investing in their digital infrastructure, education, and startup ecosystems to foster local competitors that can offer alternatives to services provided by Big Tech.\nConclusion\n\nDigital monopolies by Big Tech firms present a complex challenge that intersects with economics, technology, society, and law. While these companies have brought significant benefits in terms of innovation and convenience, their dominant positions raise critical concerns that require a nuanced and proactive regulatory approach.\n\nBalancing the promotion of competition, innovation, and the protection of consumer rights and societal values is crucial in shaping the future of the digital economy.\n\nRelated articles:\n\nOpen Network for Digital Commerce (ONDC)\nNet neutrality\n\n-Article by Swathi Satish"

Neodymium and dysprosium, for example, are critical for permanent magnets in motors.\nCopper: Vital for electrical wiring, renewable energy systems, and electric vehicles due to its high electrical conductivity.\nTitanium: Used in aerospace for its strength-to-weight ratio, corrosion resistance, and high-temperature performance.\nPlatinum Group Metals (PGMs): Essential for catalytic converters in vehicles, fuel cells, and various electronics.\nGraphite: Critical for the anodes of lithium-ion batteries and its lubricating properties in many industrial applications.\nChallenges\nSupply Risks: The supply of critical minerals is concentrated in a few countries, creating vulnerabilities to geopolitical tensions, trade disputes, and regulatory changes.\nEnvironmental Impact: Mining and processing of critical minerals can have significant environmental impacts, including habitat destruction, water pollution, and greenhouse gas emissions.\nMarket Volatility: Prices for critical minerals can be highly volatile, influenced by sudden changes in demand, supply disruptions, or speculative trading.\nCritical Minerals for India\n\nThe government released a list of 30 critical minerals for India in 2023.\n\nThese minerals are Antimony, Beryllium, Bismuth, Cobalt, Copper, Gallium, Germanium, Graphite, Hafnium, Indium, Lithium, Molybdenum, Niobium, Nickel, Platinum Group elements (PGE), Phosphorous, Potash, REE, Rhenium, Silicon, Strontium, Tantalum, Tellurium, Tin, Titanium, Tungsten, Vanadium, Zirconium, Selenium and Cadmium.\n\nThe Ministry of Mines has increased its focus on the exploration of these minerals in the country through the Geological Survey of India (GSI) and other agencies.\n\nThe Indian Critical Minerals Identification process tries to address five core objectives:\n\nSupporting economic growth, competitiveness, and job creation.\nDriving research, innovation, and exploration.\nEnhancing global security partnerships with allies.\nRaw material security for state-of-the-art defense.\nPromoting climate action and environmental protection.\n\nHowever, to achieve the desired objective, the complete value chain from exploration to manufacturing to recycling needs to be addressed, which may be considered the main pillars of the critical mineral value chain.\n\nFive pillars of the critical minerals value chain:\n\nUpstream exploration\nUpstream mining and extraction\nMidstream- processing, refining, and metallurgy (e.g., semi-finished inputs and materials)\nDownstream- component manufacturing and clean, digital, and advanced technology production (e.g., ZEV manufacturing, aircraft, and semiconductors)\nMaterial recovery and recycling\nWhy in the news?\n\nIndia launched the second part of its critical minerals auction worth an estimated 30 trillion rupees (about $362 billion).\n\nA total of 18 critical mineral blocks, including tungsten, vanadium, cobalt, and nickel, will be auctioned in eight states across the country, including Chhattisgarh, Madhya Pradesh, Karnataka, Maharashtra, and Rajasthan.\nSeventeen mineral blocks have been put up for a composite license, while one block is for a mining lease, it added. A composite license includes a license to examine a block and mine it afterward.\nFive states \u2013 Maharashtra, Madhya Pradesh, Haryana, Chhattisgarh, and Rajasthan \u2013 will auction blocks for exploration licenses of critical minerals, separately.\nStrategic Importance and Challenges\n\nThe strategic importance of these minerals cannot be overstated, given their applications in defense, renewable energy, and high-tech industries.\n\nIndia\u2019s policy framework, including the National Mineral Policy and the initiatives under the Aatmanirbhar Bharat (Self-Reliant India) program, emphasizes the exploration and development of these critical minerals.\n\nHowever, challenges remain, including environmental concerns, the need for advanced technology for extraction and processing, and the geopolitical complexities of international mineral trade.\n\nWay forward\n\nTo address these challenges, India is investing in research and development, international partnerships, and policies to encourage domestic production of critical minerals. This includes efforts to attract foreign investment, enhance mining technologies, and ensure sustainable and environmentally friendly extraction practices.\n\nThere is a need for establishing a National Institute or Centre of Excellence on critical minerals on the lines of CSIRO which is an Australian Government corporate entity and one of the world\u2019s largest mission-driven multidisciplinary science and research organizations.\n\nThe development and management of critical mineral resources are pivotal for India\u2019s ambition to become a leading player in the global market for high-tech products and renewable energy technologies. By securing a stable and sustainable supply of these minerals, India can significantly enhance its industrial, technological, and strategic capabilities on the global stage.\n\nRelated articles:\n\nMines and Minerals Development Bill, 2021\nMineral Security Partnership\nOffshore Areas Minerals\nMining sector in India\n\n-Article by Swathi Satish"

Read here to learn more about it.\n\nThe Rajya Sabha elections in the States of Uttar Pradesh, Himachal Pradesh, and Karnataka witnessed cross-voting by MLAs belonging to different parties. This has once again raised concerns about the sanctity of the election process.\n\nThis phenomenon can occur in various forms of elections, including presidential, parliamentary, and local elections and in legislative votes on specific issues.\n\nCross-voting is often seen in systems that use secret ballots, making it easier for individuals to vote according to their personal preference rather than following the party line. This behavior can have significant implications for party unity, electoral outcomes, and the dynamics of political alliances.\n\nTable of Contents\n\nRajya Sabha elections\nCauses of Cross-Voting\nTenth Schedule\nCourt\u2019s ruling on cross-voting\nImplications of Cross-Voting\nWay forward\nConclusion\nRajya Sabha elections\n\nFollowing Article 80 of the Constitution, the elected members of each State\u2019s Legislative Assembly serve as the indirect electors for each State\u2019s Rajya Sabha Members.\n\nThe Rajya Sabha polls will only be necessary if there are more candidates than there are seats available.\nActually, until 1998, it was typically inevitable what would happen in the Rajya Sabha elections.\nIn the past, candidates nominated by different parties were elected without facing opposition, based on their strength in the Assembly.\n\nNevertheless, cross-voting occurred during the Maharashtra Rajya Sabha elections in June 1998, which led to the defeat of a Congress party candidate.\n\n\ud83d\udc49 Which year are YOU targeting for success in the IAS/IPS/IFS Exam? \ud83d\ude80\n\n(1) \u21d2 UPSC 2025: Prelims cum Mains\n\n(2) \u21d2 UPSC 2026: Prelims cum Mains\n\n(3) \u21d2 UPSC 2027 Prelims cum Mains\n\nTip: Know more about ClearIAS Courses (Online/Offline)\n\nThe Representation of the People Act, of 1951 was amended in 2003 to prevent MLAs from engaging in this kind of cross-voting.\n\nThe Act\u2019s Section 59 was modified to stipulate that open ballot voting will be used for Rajya Sabha elections.\nPolitical party MLAs are expected to present their ballots to the party\u2019s designated representative.\nVoting shall be void if the ballot paper is not shown to the authorized agent or any other person.\nIt is forbidden for independent MLAs to display their ballots to third parties.\nCauses of Cross-Voting\n\nSeveral factors can lead to cross-voting in elections:\n\nPersonal Beliefs: An individual may vote against their party\u2019s choice if they disagree with the candidate\u2019s ideology, ethics, or policies.\nLocal Issues: Legislators might cross-vote to support policies or candidates that favor their constituency\u2019s interests over their party\u2019s agenda.\nPolitical Strategy: In some cases, cross-voting is a strategic move to undermine the party leadership or to realign with emerging power centers within or outside the party.\nPersonal Ambitions: Political figures may cross-vote as a step towards establishing independence from their current party, often in anticipation of a switch to another party or to create a new political faction.\nTenth Schedule\n\nIn 1985, the Tenth Schedule of the 52nd Amendment to the Constitution brought in the \u201canti-defection\u201d statute.\n\nAccording to this Schedule, a member of a State legislature or House of Parliament who willingly resigns from their political party or casts a vote in a House against the wishes of their party may be removed from the body. The party\u2019s \u201cwhip\u201d is the one who gives this voting order.\n\nNonetheless, the Rajya Sabha elections are not considered a Legislative Assembly procedure.\n\nThe Election Commission released a clarification in July 2017, citing rulings from the Supreme Court.\nIt said that in the event of a Rajya Sabha election, the Tenth Schedule\u2019s rules about voting against the party\u2019s instructions would not apply.\nMoreover, political parties are not permitted to give their members a \u201cwhip\u201d during these elections.\nCourt\u2019s ruling on cross-voting\n\nThe Supreme Court in Kuldip Nayar versus Union of India (2006), upheld the system of open ballot for Rajya Sabha elections.\n\nIt reasoned that if secrecy becomes a source of corruption, then transparency can remove it.\nHowever, in the same case, the court held that an elected MLA of a political party would not face disqualification under the Tenth Schedule for voting against their party candidate. He/she may at the most attract disciplinary action from their political party.\n\nThe Supreme Court has also held in Ravi S. Naik and Sanjay Bandekar versus Union of India (1994), that voluntarily giving up membership under the Tenth Schedule is not synonymous with only formally resigning from the party to which the member belongs.\n\nThe conduct of a member both inside and outside the house can be looked into to infer if it qualifies as voluntarily giving up membership.\n\nIt may be noted that the six Congress MLAs, who cross-voted in Himachal Pradesh, have been disqualified under the Tenth Schedule for defying the party whip and being absent during the passage of the Budget in the Assembly.\n\nNevertheless, the Supreme Court said that it would not permit the assault on democracy in the Chandigarh Mayoral election case.\n\nIn the Rajya Sabha elections, cross-voting poses a major risk to democracy.\nAs a result, the court may decide to take up this case on its own or when the Himachal Pradesh Speaker\u2019s ruling disqualifying the six MLAs is finally brought before it on appeal.\nDuring that process, it can consider its ruling in the Ravi Naik case while evaluating its order in the Kuldip Nayar case.\nImplications of Cross-Voting\n\nCross-voting can have various implications, depending on the context and scale:\n\nImpact on Party Unity: Frequent cross-voting may indicate deep divisions within a party, potentially leading to splits or the weakening of party discipline.\nElectoral Outcomes: In closely contested elections, cross-voting by a few members can change the outcome, especially in systems where a single vote can make a significant difference.\nLegislative Processes: Cross-voting in legislative bodies can lead to unexpected outcomes in law-making processes, affecting the passage of bills and the implementation of government policies.\nPolitical Careers: Individuals who engage in cross-voting may face repercussions from their party, including expulsion or being denied party support in future elections. Conversely, it can also enhance an individual\u2019s reputation as an independent thinker, appealing to voters who value autonomy over strict party loyalty.\nWay forward\n\nThe open ballot method for Rajya Sabha elections was affirmed by the court to preserve the greater ideal of free and fair elections and their integrity.\n\nNevertheless, the purpose of this process has been undermined by the occurrences of cross-voting throughout the past 10 years. Given that the ruling parties profit from such immoral strategies, it would be unrealistic to anticipate that the Constitution would be strengthened anymore or that legislation prohibiting such voting methods would be passed.\n\nIn an election for the Rajya Sabha, an MLA\u2019s vote against their political party might be interpreted as a clear indication that they had willingly left the party.\n\nThis would be a legitimate reason for disqualification under the Tenth Schedule if the court finds it to be so. Hopefully, it would serve as a disincentive for future instances of this kind of cross-voting.\n\nConclusion\n\nCross-voting reflects the complex interplay between individual autonomy, party discipline, and democratic principles in the political process. While it can pose challenges to party unity and electoral strategies, it also highlights the importance of personal conviction and the dynamic nature of democratic governance. Understanding the causes and implications of cross-voting is crucial for political parties, candidates, and voters as they navigate the intricacies of electoral politics.\n\nRead: Alternative voting methods in India\n\nClick here for more polity notes.\n\n-Article by Swathi Satish"

After 30 days, if no objections are raised, the marriage can be solemnized.\n\t\nThe procedures and rituals for marriage under personal laws are determined by the religious practices and traditions of the respective community.\n\n\nBoth parties must be of legal age (21 for males and 18 for females), must not be in a prohibited relationship, and must be mentally capable of consenting to the marriage.\n\t\nConditions for marriage, such as age, consent, and prohibited relationships, are generally similar to those in the Special Marriage Act but are interpreted within the context of each religion\u2019s traditions.\n\n\nThe marriage under this act is registered, and a marriage certificate is issued by the Marriage Officer, which is a valid legal document proving the marriage.\n\t\nWhile registration of marriages is encouraged and, in some states, mandatory, the process and adherence can vary widely. The registration under personal laws provides a legal document proving the marriage, similar to that under the Special Marriage Act.\nPersonal Laws (Amendment) Act, 2019\n\nThe Personal Laws (Amendment) Act, 2019, is a significant piece of legislation passed by the Parliament of India, which seeks to amend five personal law statutes to remove leprosy as a ground for divorce or separation.\n\nLeprosy, a chronic disease caused by the bacteria Mycobacterium leprae, has been a highly stigmatized condition, historically leading to discrimination against those affected.\nBefore this amendment, leprosy was considered an incurable and contagious disease, and it was grounds for seeking divorce or separation under various religious personal laws.\n\nKey Amendments Made by the Act\n\nThe Personal Laws (Amendment) Act, 2019 amends the following acts:\n\nThe Hindu Marriage Act, 1955\nThe Dissolution of Muslim Marriages Act, 1939\nThe Divorce Act, of 1869 (applicable to Christians)\nThe Special Marriage Act, 1954\nThe Hindu Adoptions and Maintenance Act, 1956\n\nThe amendment specifically removes leprosy as a ground for divorce, thereby supporting the rights and dignity of those affected by the disease.\n\nThis change reflects modern medical advancements that have made leprosy a curable condition, especially with the introduction of Multi-Drug Therapy (MDT) in the 1980s.\n\nUniform Civil Code\n\nThe debate around the implementation of a Uniform Civil Code (UCC) in India is centered on Article 44 of the Indian Constitution, which lays down that the state shall endeavor to secure for the citizens a uniform civil code throughout the territory of India.\n\nA UCC would mean a common set of laws governing personal matters for all citizens, irrespective of their religion, which proponents argue would ensure equality and justice for all, especially for women within various communities.\nHowever, the proposal has also faced opposition from various quarters who see it as a threat to religious freedom and cultural identity.\nChallenges and Reforms\n\nPersonal laws have been at the center of many legal and social debates in India, particularly concerning gender justice and equality.\n\nCritics argue that some aspects of personal laws discriminate against women, leading to calls for reform.\n\nOver the years, the Indian judiciary has played a significant role in interpreting and sometimes amending these laws to enhance gender justice.\n\nNotable examples include the Shah Bano case (1985) for Muslim women\u2019s right to maintenance and the Vishaka Guidelines (1997) for preventing sexual harassment in the workplace.\n\nWhy in the news?\n\n2024: Recently, the Assam Government repealed the Assam Muslim Marriages and Divorces Registration Act, of 1935.\n\nFollowing the decision, Muslim marriage or divorce registration can happen only through the Special Marriage Act.\nThe decision was widely criticized in political circles, but the fact remains that the Muslim personal law, and inevitably, Muslim marriage, divorce, maintenance, and inheritance, have been in the public eye in recent years.\n\nAlso, the Supreme Court decided to examine if a divorced Muslim woman is entitled to a claim of maintenance under Section 125 of the Criminal Procedure Code (CrPC) against her former husband thus reigniting the debate on whether secular laws should be given precedence over distinct personal laws.\n\nConclusion\n\nPersonal laws in India represent the country\u2019s commitment to its pluralistic and diverse society, acknowledging the importance of religion in personal matters.\n\nWhile these laws provide a sense of identity and belonging to different communities, they also pose challenges in terms of uniformity, gender justice, and national integration.\n\nBalancing community-specific rights with the need for a progressive and egalitarian legal system remains a dynamic and ongoing process in the Indian legal and social landscape.\n\nRelated article:\u00a0Same-Sex Marriage;Raising Marriage Age of Women in India\n\n-Article by Swathi Satish"

electrical energy within a battery system.\n\nIt can store energy from the grid or from renewable energy sources, to be used at a later time when demand is high or generation is low.\nBESS can include various types of battery technologies, with lithium-ion batteries currently being the most prevalent due to their high energy density, efficiency, and decreasing cost.\n\nThe challenge with Renewable Energy (RE) sources arises due to their varying nature with time, climate, season, or geographic location.\n\nEnergy Storage Systems (ESS) can be used for storing available energy from Renewable Energy and further can be used during peak hours of the day.\nThe various benefits of Energy Storage are help in bringing down the variability of generation in RE sources, improving grid stability, enabling energy/ peak shifting, providing ancillary support services, enabling larger renewable energy integration, bringing down peak deficit and peak tariffs, reducing of carbon emissions, deferral of transmission and distribution capex, energy arbitrage, etc.\n\nThere are several energy storage technologies available, broadly \u2013 mechanical, thermal, electrochemical, electrical, and chemical storage systems, as shown above.\n\nComponents of BESS\n\nA typical BESS includes:\n\nBattery cells: The basic units of the system where energy is stored chemically.\nBattery Management System (BMS): A system that manages the charging and discharging of batteries, ensuring the safety and efficiency of the storage system.\nPower Conversion System (PCS): Converts electrical energy from AC to DC and vice versa, facilitating the integration of the storage system with the grid.\nControl System: Manages the operation of the BESS, optimizing performance and interaction with the power grid.\nApplications\nEnergy Arbitrage: Buying energy when prices are low, storing it, and then selling it when prices are high.\nRenewable Energy Integration: Storing excess energy generated from renewable sources for use when generation is low or demand is high.\nGrid Stability and Reliability: Providing ancillary services such as frequency regulation, voltage control, and spinning reserves to support grid operation.\nPeak Shaving: Reducing peak demand charges for industrial and commercial energy users by supplying stored energy during peak demand periods.\nEmergency Backup: Offering

The sources include:\n\nSupernova Remnants: The shock waves from supernovae (the explosive deaths of stars) are thought to be responsible for accelerating the majority of galactic cosmic rays.\nActive Galactic Nuclei: Supermassive black holes at the centers of galaxies can emit jets of charged particles at high energies.\nPulsars: Highly magnetized, rotating neutron stars can also accelerate particles to high energies.\nGamma-Ray Bursts: These are extremely energetic explosions observed in distant galaxies, thought to be associated with the collapse of massive stars or the merging of neutron stars.\nImportance of Studying Cosmic Rays\n\nLet\u2019s understand the importance of studying cosmic rays:\n\n\ud83d\udc49 Which year are YOU targeting for success in the IAS/IPS/IFS Exam? \ud83d\ude80\n\n(1) \u21d2 UPSC 2025: Prelims cum Mains\n\n(2) \u21d2 UPSC 2026: Prelims cum Mains\n\n(3) \u21d2 UPSC 2027 Prelims cum Mains\n\nTip: Know more about ClearIAS Courses (Online/Offline)\n\nWhen cosmic rays collide with Earth\u2019s atmosphere, they create showers of secondary particles like electrons, photons, muons, protons, and neutrons.\nScientists study these particle showers to learn about the original cosmic rays that caused them.\nThis helps unveil the secrets of where cosmic rays come from, how they gain such immense energy, and how they travel across vast cosmic distances.\nThere is ongoing research into the effects of cosmic rays on biological tissues, especially for astronauts on long-duration space missions outside the protective shield of the Earth\u2019s magnetic field and atmosphere.\nAbout the GRAPES-3 Experiment\n\nDetails of the GRAPES-3 Experiment are as follows:\n\nGRAPES-3 stands for Gamma Ray Astronomy PeV EnergieS phase-3. It is a major scientific experiment observatory located in Ooty, India, at an altitude of 2200 meters.\nIt is operated by the renowned Tata Institute of Fundamental Research in Mumbai.\nGRAPES-3 uses advanced particle detectors and sensors to precisely measure cosmic rays and study their properties.\nObjectives of GRAPES-3 Experiment\n\nObjectives of the GRAPES-3 Experiment are:\n\nThe key objectives of GRAPES-3 are to investigate the origin, acceleration, and propagation of cosmic rays above 10^14 electronvolts (eV) within our galaxy and beyond.\nConfirm the existence of the \u201cknee\u201d \u2013 a strange change in the energy pattern of cosmic rays around 3-5 peta-electronvolts (10^15 eV).\nStudy the production and acceleration of the highest energy cosmic rays in the universe, around 10^20 electronvolts.\nPerform advanced gamma-ray astronomy of neutron stars, black holes, and other exotic cosmic objects in the multi-TeV energy range.\nThe Discovery\n\nRecently, GRAPES-3 scientists made an amazing discovery about cosmic rays.\n\nIn their latest finding, the GRAPES-3 collaboration has reported the discovery of an anomalous feature in the cosmic-ray proton energy spectrum at around 166 tera-electronvolt (TeV) or 10^14 eV.\nThis was observed while thoroughly mapping the proton spectrum over an energy range spanning 50 TeV to just over 1 peta-electronvolt (PeV) or 10^15 eV.\nTypically, the cosmic ray energy spectrum follows a smoothly declining power law distribution as the energy increases.\n\nHowever, the newly spotted feature differs from this conventional single power-law model, hinting at underlying processes that have been overlooked until now.\n\nSignificance of the Finding\n\nCosmic rays normally follow a smooth, predictable pattern of decreasing intensity as their energy increases, like a sloping line on a graph.\n\nHowever, the newly found feature shows a deviation from this standard pattern, hinting at unknown processes influencing cosmic rays.\nThis irregularity lies above 100 TeV but below the well-known \u201cknee\u201d region around 3-5 PeV, making it highly significant.\nThe knee has been the focus of intense research for decades, as scientists have sought to understand if it represents a transition between different populations of cosmic ray sources or indicates changing acceleration and propagation dynamics.\nImplications and Analysis\n\nThis discovery means that the scientific community needs to re-evaluate their current models and theories about cosmic rays.\n\nExisting ideas may be incomplete in explaining the production of cosmic rays, how they gain tremendous energies, and what happens during their long journey through the galaxy.\nCosmic rays at these ultra-high energies likely originate from violent cosmic events like supernova explosions and environments around neutron stars and black holes.\nThe particles gain tremendous energies through mechanisms like shock acceleration in the expanding debris clouds from supernovae or the extreme electromagnetic fields and jet outflows around spinning neutron stars and black holes.\nAs cosmic rays traverse through the turbulent interstellar medium within galaxies, they can undergo significant interactions with magnetic fields and clouds of gas and dust.\nThese can alter their energies and trajectories in complex ways.\n\nThe GRAPES-3 discovery suggests that current theoretical models may be incomplete in accounting for all the relevant astrophysical processes that shape the cosmic-ray energy spectrum as observed on Earth.\n\nAccording to the GRAPES-3 researchers, their findings necessitate a comprehensive re-examination of our understanding of cosmic ray sources, the efficiency of their acceleration mechanisms, as well as the roles played by magnetic field configurations and interactions with the interstellar medium during the particles\u2019 galactic propagation.\n\nAlso read: Life Cycle of a Star\n\nWay Forward\n\nIncorporating GRAPES-3 data into current models may provide important new insights into specific local phenomena or processes happening across the entire galaxy.\n\nIt may help pinpoint specific local phenomena or source populations that contribute to the observed spectral feature.\n\nAlternatively, it could reveal more universal processes at play on a galactic scale that the current theoretical framework has not accounted for sufficiently.\n\nMore research from GRAPES-3, other cosmic ray observatories, and multi-messenger astronomy (combining data from cosmic rays, gamma rays, neutrinos, and gravitational waves) is awaited.\n\nComplementary multi-messenger observations combining cosmic, gamma, neutrinos, and gravitational waves could shed further light on the astrophysical engines producing these extremely energetic particles.\n\nConclusion\n\nAs scientists get deeper into unraveling the mysteries highlighted by the GRAPES-3 discovery, we move closer toward an advanced comprehension of the high-energy processes that sculpt our dynamic, particle-bathed universe.\n\nThe epic journey of cosmic ray research, which has spanned more than a century since its inception, takes an electrifying new turn with this landmark finding from the highlands of southern India.\n\nRelated Articles:\n\nSquare Kilometer Array Observatory\nGamma-ray Bursts (GRBs)\nSouth Atlantic

Read here to learn more.\n\nOn November 8, 2016, the government of India announced a sudden and unexpected demonetisation of two of its highest denomination notes at the time, the \u20b9500 and \u20b91,000 banknotes, which constituted over 86% of the currency in circulation.\n\nThis move was directed by Prime Minister Narendra Modi, with the primary goals stated as curbing corruption, black money, counterfeit currency, and terror financing.\n\nTable of Contents\n\nWhat is demonetisation?\nObjectives of Demonetisation\nImplementation and Immediate Effects\nOutcomes and Criticism\nDemonetisation in India\nRBI Act section 26\nHistory of demonetisation in India\nWhich countries have demonetised in the past?\nConclusion\nWhat is demonetisation?\n\nDemonetisation is a governmental policy whereby a form of currency is stripped of its legal tender status.\n\nIn essence, demonetisation involves withdrawing a particular denomination or form of currency from circulation, thereby prohibiting its use in conducting transactions.\n\nThe demonetized currency is either replaced with new notes or coins of the same or different denomination or is completely phased out.\n\n\ud83d\udc49 Which year are YOU targeting for success in the IAS/IPS/IFS Exam? \ud83d\ude80\n\n(1) \u21d2 UPSC 2025: Prelims cum Mains\n\n(2) \u21d2 UPSC 2026: Prelims cum Mains\n\n(3) \u21d2 UPSC 2027 Prelims cum Mains\n\nTip: Know more about ClearIAS Courses (Online/Offline)\n\nThe French were the first to use the term \u201cdemonetise\u201d in the years between the years 1850-1855.\n\nObjectives of Demonetisation\nCurbing Black Money: Targeting the hidden wealth that is not declared to the tax authorities, which often lies in high denomination notes.\nFighting Corruption: By making large hoards of cash obsolete overnight, the move aimed to crack down on corruption and illegal cash holdings.\nCounteracting Counterfeit Currency: To eliminate counterfeit notes used for terror financing and other illegal activities.\nPromoting Digital Payments: Accelerating India\u2019s transition to a digital economy, encouraging the use of electronic payments over cash transactions.\nTo Combat Inflation: By pulling out a portion of the currency in circulation, demonetisation can help in controlling inflation to some extent. However, this depends on how the economy reacts to such a move.\nTo Target Illegal Activities: Since illicit activities like drug trafficking, terrorism financing, and money laundering often rely heavily on cash, demonetisation can disrupt these operations by making the cash they hold obsolete.\nImplementation and Immediate Effects\n\nThe process of demonetisation typically requires a sudden announcement to prevent hoarders of illegal wealth from disposing of their cash reserves.\n\nHowever, this can lead to short-term disruptions in the economy, affecting businesses and individuals who rely heavily on cash transactions, especially in regions with limited banking infrastructure.\n\nThe announcement was made unexpectedly in the evening, and from midnight of the same day, the specified notes were no longer legal tender. People were given a window period to deposit the old notes in their bank accounts or exchange them for new \u20b9500 and \u20b92,000 notes introduced by the Reserve Bank of India (RBI).\nThe immediate aftermath saw widespread chaos, long queues at banks and ATMs, and a significant cash crunch that lasted for several months.\n\nThis period of adjustment had a profound impact on the daily lives of people, particularly those in rural areas, the informal sector, and small businesses that predominantly relied on cash transactions.\n\nOutcomes and Criticism\nEconomic Impact: The demonetisation drive had a mixed impact on the Indian economy. In the short term, it led to a slowdown in economic growth due to the cash crunch. Small businesses and the informal sector were hit hard, and job losses were reported across various sectors. However, it also led to a significant increase in digital transactions, fostering a shift towards a more digital economy.\nReduction in Cash Use: While there was a temporary reduction in cash use and a spike in digital transactions, cash usage eventually returned to pre-demonetisation levels, albeit with a sustained increase in digital transactions.\nBlack Money and Tax Collection: The effectiveness of demonetisation in curbing black money has been a subject of debate. A significant portion of the demonetised currency was returned to the banking system, leading to questions about the amount of black money addressed. However, there was an increase in tax compliance and the number of tax returns filed, suggesting a broader base for taxation post-demonetisation.\n\nCritics argue that the goals of demonetisation were not fully achieved and that the move caused unnecessary hardship to the poorest and most vulnerable sections of society. The suddenness of the policy and its execution was also criticized for the economic disruption it caused.\n\nDemonetisation in India\n\n2023: The Supreme Court in a majority 4-1 verdict with four judges on a five-judge Constitution Bench held that- the November 8, 2016, notification withdrawing the legal tender of these notes \u201cdoes not suffer from any flaws in the decision-making process\u201d.\n\nThe centre\u2019s decision six years ago to demonetise currency notes of Rs 500 and Rs 1,000 was upheld through the verdict.\nRBI Act section 26\n\nThe RBI Act has been enacted to regulate the issue of bank notes and generally to operate the currency and credit system of the country.\n\nSection 26(1) of the Act provides that every bank note shall be a legal tender as per the amount expressed therein and shall be guaranteed by the central government.\nAs per Section 26(2) of the Act, bank notes can cease to be legal tender when the central government issues a notification in the Gazette of India declaring that with effect from such date as may be specified in the said notification any series of bank notes of any denomination shall cease to be legal tender. Such a notification may be issued on the recommendation of the Central Board of the Bank.\nHistory of demonetisation in India\n\n1946\n\nThe first demonetisation in British India was carried out on January 12, 1946. An Ordinance demonetised currency notes of Rs 500, Rs 1,000, and Rs 10,000 which were in circulation, primarily to check the unaccounted hoarding of money, with a directive that they could be exchanged for re\u00adissued bank notes, within ten days.\n\n1978\n\nThe second demonetisation was carried out in the year 1978, in pursuance of the recommendation of the Wanchoo Committee appointed by the central government. The government resorted to demonetisation of bank notes of denominations Rs 1,000, Rs 5,000, and Rs 10,000 notes on January 16, 1978, under the High Denomination Bank Notes (Demonetisation) Ordinance, 1978, and people were allowed three days to exchange their notes.\n\nWhich countries have demonetised in the past?\n\nThe global history of demonetisation is varied, with numerous countries resorting to this measure under different circumstances.\n\nUSA (1873)\n\nOne of the earliest instances of demonetization was in the United States. The Coinage Act of 1873 mandated the removal of silver in favor of adopting the gold standard as the legal tender. This led to a contraction of the money supply and a 5-year economic depression in the country. The dire situation and pressure from silver miners and farmers forced the implementation of the Bland-Allison Act in 1878 which re-monetized silver as legal tender.\n\n1969\n\nPresident Richard Nixon declared all bills above $100 null and void in the United States of America to curb the existence of black money. The move was highly successful and is claimed to have been the start of the development of the American banking system.\n\nGreat Britain (1971)\n\nBefore the year 1971, the currency of the pound and penny used to be in circulation in Britain but to bring uniformity in currency, the government stopped the circulation of old currency in 1971 and introduced coins of 5 and 10 pounds.\n\nGhana (1982)\n\nGhana experienced demonetisation under the rule of Jerry Rawlings, to combat tax evasion and corruption. The policy targeted wealthy individuals who had evaded taxes or acquired their wealth through corruption means, requiring them to exchange their old currency for new notes within a limited period.\n\nNigeria (1984)\n\nNigeria\u2019s government, under then-military ruler Muhammadu Buhari, announced a currency change in 1984 to tackle corruption and reduce the amount of money outside the banking system. It was a bid to control inflation and promote economic stability, though it also led to immediate economic hardships for the population.\n\nSoviet Union (1991)\n\nShortly before its collapse, the Soviet Union attempted demonetisation by withdrawing large-denomination ruble notes from circulation. The goal was to combat the black market and reduce money laundering activities. However, the move was met with widespread panic and confusion, contributing to the economic turmoil of the period.\n\nEuropean Union (2002)\n\nThe introduction of the Euro in 2002 as a physical currency across 12 EU countries (at the time) involved a massive demonetisation exercise of national currencies like the Deutsche Mark, French Franc, and Italian Lira. While this was not demonetisation in the traditional sense of combating black money, it was a unique instance of replacing multiple national currencies with a single one, aiming to facilitate trade, ensure stable prices, and establish a more integrated European economy.\n\nZimbabwe (2015)\n\nZimbabwe underwent a demonetisation process in 2015 to phase out the Zimbabwean dollar, which had become worthless due to hyperinflation. The country had already been using foreign currencies like the US dollar and South African rand for transactions. The move was part of an attempt to stabilize the economy and restore confidence in the financial system.\n\nAlso read: Rs.500, Rs.1000 Currency Notes Scrapped: What you need to know\n\nConclusion\n\nDemonetisation was one of the most significant and controversial economic policies implemented in India\u2019s recent history.\n\nIts long-term effects, particularly on black money, digital payments, and the broader economy, continue to be debated. While it achieved some of its objectives, such as an increase in digital transactions and greater tax compliance, the move also highlighted the challenges of implementing radical economic policies without comprehensive planning and gradual implementation.\n\nThe lessons from India\u2019s demonetisation experience offer valuable insights into the complexities of tackling corruption and black money within a large and diverse economy.\n\n-Article by Swathi Satish"

In 1993, an additional 23 groups were added, taking the total number of identified PVTGs to 75.\n\nThe highest number of PVTGs are found in Odisha (13), followed by Andhra Pradesh (12), Gujarat (8) and Tamil Nadu (6), while no PVTGs are found in the states of Punjab and Haryana.\n\nThe PVTG of Sahariyas has the highest population of 4,50,217, while the PVTGs of Sentinelets and Andamanese have a very small population, respectively.\n\nCriteria to Identify Particularly Vulnerable Tribal Groups\n\nThe identification of such groups was based on one or more of the following characteristics:\n\nPreservation of pre-agricultural practices,\nEconomic Backwardness,\nDecreasing or stagnant population growth, and\nRelatively low levels of literacy in contrast to other tribal groups.\nChallenges faced by PVTGs\n\nDespite efforts by the government, PVTGs continue to face immense challenges that have kept them vulnerable and marginalized.\n\nDeclining population: Many PVTGs are experiencing stagnant or declining population. This is due to high mortality rates aggravated by malnutrition, poor access to healthcare, and diseases.\n\nLoss of traditional livelihoods: PVTGs traditionally relied on forest produce, food gathering, and shifting agriculture. Depletion of forests and restrictive forest laws have eroded their traditional livelihoods and food security.\n\nLand alienation: Historically, PVTGs enjoyed rights over forestlands under various traditional and customary tenurial systems. The process of declaring forests as Protected Areas and Reserves has displaced and alienated PVTGs from their traditional landholdings.\n\nPoor literacy: PVTGs suffer from extremely low literacy levels due to a lack of access to education facilities like schools, transportation, teacher absence, etc. This hampers their participation in development.\n\nGeographical isolation: PVTG settlements are often small and located in remote, hilly, or densely forested areas with poor connectivity. This heightens their exclusion.\n\nImpact of development projects: Development projects like mining, dams, industries, etc undertaken on tribal lands without proper rehabilitation have led to the displacement of PVTGs.\n\nSocio-economic backwardness: PVTGs lag behind other social groups on parameters like poverty, malnutrition, mortality rates etc due to historical neglect and exclusion.\n\nImportant Tribal Welfare Initiatives\n\nOn the Janjatiya Gaurav Divas (15 November), PM Modi unveiled three significant schemes for uplifting Particularly Vulnerable Tribal Groups (PVTGs) \u2013\n\nPM Janjati Adivasi Nyaya Maha Abhiyan (PM JANMAN)\n\nKey information related to the scheme are:\n\nPM JANMAN is a Rs 24,104 crore tribal welfare program that will extend socio-economic justice and inclusion to over 40 lakh people from 75 PVTGs.\nPVTGs are marginalized tribal groups identified based on characteristics like declining population, low literacy levels, and economic backwardness.\nUnder PM JANMAN, PVTG families will be provided with land rights, housing, education, healthcare, drinking water, livelihoods, roads, and other basic amenities.\nIt aims to plug the gaps these vulnerable groups face in accessing welfare schemes and public services. PM JANMAN will be implemented over 3 years till 2023-26.\nViksit Bharat Sankalp Yatra\n\nImportant features of this Yatra are:\n\nThis mega outreach initiative will raise awareness about central government welfare programs among PVTG communities.\nThrough camps across districts with significant PVTG populations, the yatra will identify beneficiaries and enroll them into various schemes.\nWelfare measures under focus include financial services, LPG connections, electricity, housing, sanitation facilities, nutrition, and healthcare among others.\nThe Yatra will also gather feedback from PVTG families to understand gaps in service delivery and ensure last-mile connectivity.\nPM PVTG Development Mission\n\nKey features of PM PVTG Development Mission are:\n\nThis mission aims to comprehensively improve the socio-economic status of PVTGs in line with the 15-year vision of the Panchayati Raj Ministry.\nIt will ensure the provision of basic amenities such as pucca housing, drinking water supply, functional toilets, connectivity, healthcare, nutrition, and education in PVTG areas.\nLivelihood opportunities will be enhanced via animal husbandry, horticulture, and skill development. Conservation of PVTG culture and heritage is also envisaged.\nThe Union Budget 2022-23 has allocated Rs 24,000 crore for tribal welfare. Of this, a significant share will be utilized under the PM PVTG Development Mission.\nSignificance of the Initiatives\n\nThe significance of these initiatives are:\n\nHolistic development: These initiatives cover all aspects of socio-economic progress \u2013 livelihoods, health, education, and culture.\nRights-based: Secure land rights, forest rights, and housing rights for PVTGs can protect them against displacement.\nAccess to services: Seamless access to welfare schemes, public services, and infrastructure development will be enabled.\nFinancial inclusion: Enhanced livelihood opportunities and financial literacy can bring PVTGs into the formal banking system.\nCulture preservation: Conservation of PVTG heritage, art, and language can safeguard their identity.\nBottom-up approach: Feedback-based planning and localization of schemes based on the needs of specific PVTGs.\nThe Way Forward\n\nWhile government initiatives and budgets for PVTG development have increased, effective implementation on the ground holds the key. PVTGs need to be actively involved in the planning and execution of schemes meant for them.\n\nProtecting their traditional rights over jal-jameen-jangal is very important.\n\nOverall, adopting a rights-based approach, ensuring social security and accountability can help PVTGs break out of the cycle of vulnerability.\n\nRelated Articles:\n\nTribal Population in India\nMajor Tribes in India\nScheduled Tribes in India\nTribal Health in India\n\nArticle Written By: Priti Raj"

This puts special emphasis on the transportation network, which aims for multifaceted integration.\n\nIndia-Pakistan relations: IMEC bypasses Pakistan, breaking its influence over India\u2019s overland connectivity to the West, a hurdle persistently faced in the past.\n\nIt will help strengthen India\u2019s engagement with the Arabian Peninsula and promote regional connectivity in the politically volatile region.\nWhy in the news?\n\nAt the Raisina Dialogue 2024 inauguration, the Greek Prime Minister said that India and Greece should persevere with the India-Middle East Economic Corridor (IMEC) despite the Israeli war in Gaza destabilizing the peace project plans.\n\nThe project was discussed amongst other plans to strengthen bilateral ties in trade, finalize a mobility and migration pact to regulate legal migration, as well as cooperate on the co-production and co-development of military hardware.\n\nChallenges\n\nThe corridor passes through regions with complex geopolitical issues, including conflicts and rivalries. Navigating these challenges requires diplomatic skills and regional cooperation.\n\nIt is an extremely intricate program that will necessitate standardizing everything.\n\nFor example, trains have to operate on the same gauge, engines ought to employ comparable technology, and containers ought to have comparable sizes.\nTo ensure smooth traffic levels, crucial technical aspects have been identified and preliminary alignments are being completed. But doing this will need a lot of work.\n\nChinese presence cannot be wished away along the IMEC route, even though the initiative has been suggested as a response to China\u2019s Belt and Road Initiative.\n\nThe reason for this is that China Ocean Shipping (Group) Company, a state-owned enterprise in China, is in charge of the Piraeus port.\nFurthermore, many packages for Etihad Rail\u2019s Phases One and Two have been approved for Chinese enterprises like as PowerChina, China State Construction Engineering Corporation, and others.\n\nThe all-sea route is convenient as it is assumed that the cargo will land from point to point. It moves seamlessly without any obstructions.\n\nHowever, in the alternatively proposed IMEC, the number of times the cargo will get offloaded as it changes hands from ship to rail will increase the handling costs which include terminal-handling charges, container yard charges, and so on.\n\nEgypt, which could lose revenue if the Suez Canal is bypassed, could also raise objections to the plan.\n\nAlthough Egypt was one of the special invitees at the G-20, it was not among the countries that launched the Memorandum of Understanding (MoU).\nWay forward\n\nThe India-Middle East-Europe Economic Corridor represents a vision for a more interconnected world that leverages geography for economic gain.\n\nIts realization depends on collaboration between countries, international organizations, and the private sector.\n\nIf successful, the IMEC could become a pivotal economic artery in the global trade system, benefiting not just the regions it directly connects but also contributing to global economic stability and growth.\n\nAs this is a forward-looking project, continuous monitoring of geopolitical, economic, and environmental developments will be essential to assess its feasibility, progress, and impact over time.\n\nRelated articles:\n\nIndia\u2019s connectivity projects\nInternational North-South Transport Corridor (INSTC)\n\n-Article by Swathi Satish"

Read here to learn more about it.\n\nThe Right to disconnect concept has gained traction in various countries as a response to the increasingly blurred lines between work and personal life, particularly with the rise of digital communication technologies and remote working arrangements.\n\nThe right aims to protect employees from the expectation of being perpetually available, thereby reducing stress and burnout, and promoting a healthier work-life balance.\n\nTable of Contents\n\nRight to disconnect: Origins\nSignificance\nChallenges and Criticisms\nWhy in the news?\nDoes India have a similar law?\nThe Future of the Right to Disconnect\nRight to disconnect: Origins\n\nThe idea of a right to disconnect first garnered significant attention in France. In 2016-2017, France implemented a law requiring companies with more than 50 employees to establish hours when staff should not send or answer emails.\n\nThis law was pioneering in formally recognizing the impact of constant digital connectivity on workers\u2019 health and personal time.\n\nFollowing France, other countries and regions began to explore similar concepts, recognizing the need to address the digital era\u2019s challenges to work-life balance.\n\nFor instance, Italy, Spain, and the Philippines have taken steps towards implementing policies that, in various ways, support the right to disconnect for employees.\nKenya became the first African country to consider such a move. Its proposed Employee (Amendment) Bill seeks to prevent employers from expecting employees to answer calls, text messages, or emails outside working hours, at weekends, or on public holidays.\nBelgium passed a law in February 2022 allowing civil servants to switch off work emails, texts, and phone calls received out of hours, without fear of reprisals.\nThe European Union (EU) defines the right to disconnect as \u201ca worker\u2019s right to be able to disengage from work and refrain from engaging in work-related electronic communications, such as emails or other messages, during non-work hours\u201d.\nPortugal labels its work-life balance legislation the \u201cright to rest\u201d, with companies of 10 or more staff facing fines for contacting staff outside of set working hours. Workers with children below the age of eight are also permitted to work remotely under the new laws, which came into effect in November 2021.\nSignificance\n\nThe significance of the right to disconnect lies in its recognition of the changing nature of work.\n\n\ud83d\udc49 Which year are YOU targeting for success in the IAS/IPS/IFS Exam? \ud83d\ude80\n\n(1) \u21d2 UPSC 2025: Prelims cum Mains\n\n(2) \u21d2 UPSC 2026: Prelims cum Mains\n\n(3) \u21d2 UPSC 2027 Prelims cum Mains\n\nTip: Know more about ClearIAS Courses (Online/Offline)\n\nWith the advent of smartphones and cloud computing, employees can work from anywhere at any time.\nWhile this has benefits in terms of flexibility, it also poses risks to employees\u2019 mental health and well-being due to the potential for overwork and the stress of constant availability.\n\nPolicies supporting the right to disconnect aim to:\n\nProtect employee health and well-being by preventing burnout and stress.\nEncourage more effective and focused work during designated working hours.\nPromote a healthier work-life balance by clearly delineating work time from personal time.\nSupport employees\u2019 rights to rest, personal time, and disengagement from work responsibilities outside of work hours.\nAttract and retain employees by demonstrating a commitment to their well-being.\nThe right to disconnect fosters a culture that values efficiency during work hours and respects personal time.\nThe policy encourages individuals to take breaks from digital devices, reducing the negative effects of prolonged screen time, such as eye strain, poor sleep quality, and digital distraction.\nChallenges and Criticisms\n\nImplementing the right to disconnect comes with its set of challenges and criticisms.\n\nOne of the primary concerns is the practicality of such policies in industries that require high levels of flexibility or have peak periods of work outside traditional hours, such as the tech and healthcare sectors.\nAdditionally, there\u2019s the question of how such policies can be enforced and monitored without infringing on individual freedoms or leading to unintended negative consequences for workers, such as increased workload during official working hours.\n\nCritics also argue that the right to disconnect may hinder the flexibility that many employees value, potentially impacting productivity and the ability to work across time zones in global companies.\n\nWhy in the news?\n\nAustralia has implemented the \u201cright to disconnect\u201d law, following the example of European nations, to shield its employees from sanctions for refusing to answer calls, texts, or emails from government agencies when they are not in regular business hours.\n\nIf an employee is disciplined by an employer for not returning calls or emails relating to work after hours, the legislation will take effect.\nThe rule aims to combat the \u201calways-on\u201d office culture and was submitted as an addition to a larger legislative bill that addresses workplace relations, work health, safety, compensation, and rehabilitation.\nDoes India have a similar law?\n\nA Private Member\u2019s Bill to this effect was introduced in the Lok Sabha in 2018 and has been since lobbying for workers\u2019 rights.\n\nThe draft highlighted the need to respect the personal life of the employees by recognizing their right to disconnect and not respond to their employer\u2019s calls and e-mails, during out-of-work hours.\nThe Bill seeks to recognize the right to disconnect as a way to reduce stress and ease tension between an employee\u2019s personal and professional life.\nThe proposed regulation sought that the government set up digital detox centers and provide digital detox counseling services to citizens for the personal use of digital and communication tools.\nThe Future of the Right to Disconnect\n\nAs the nature of work continues to evolve, the discussion around the right to disconnect is likely to grow.\n\nThe COVID-19 pandemic has accelerated remote work trends, making the separation between work and personal life even more challenging for many employees. This has brought renewed attention to the importance of establishing boundaries to ensure workers\u2019 mental health and well-being.\n\nThe future of the right to disconnect may see more tailored approaches, taking into account the specific needs of industries, the diversity of work cultures across countries, and the evolving expectations of the workforce.\n\nLegislative efforts may focus on creating frameworks that encourage companies to negotiate work-life balance policies directly with employees and their representatives, providing flexibility to adapt to different sectors\u2019 unique demands and challenges.\n\nAs work becomes more digital and flexible, the right to disconnect represents a critical area for policymakers, employers, and employees to navigate together, striving for a balance that promotes both productivity and well-being.\n\nRelated articles:\n\nQuiet quitting\nMoonlighting\n\n-Article by Swathi Satish"

It is the fourth most common cancer globally among women. In India, it is the second most common cancer among women, after breast cancer.\n\nNearly all cases of this cancer (99%) are caused by high-risk strains of HPV, a sexually transmitted infection.\nAt least 14 high-risk HPV types can cause cancer of the cervix.\nSpecifically, HPV types 16 and 18 account for approximately 70% of all cervical cancers globally.\n\nIn 2020, India recorded 1.23 lakh new cases of cervical cancer and around 77,348 deaths.\n\n\ud83d\udc49 Which year are YOU targeting for success in the IAS/IPS/IFS Exam? \ud83d\ude80\n\n(1) \u21d2 UPSC 2025: Prelims cum Mains\n\n(2) \u21d2 UPSC 2026: Prelims cum Mains\n\n(3) \u21d2 UPSC 2027 Prelims cum Mains\n\nTip: Know more about ClearIAS Courses (Online/Offline)\n\nIndia\u2019s high disease burden is attributed to various factors like lack of awareness, limited access to screening and HPV vaccination, late diagnosis at advanced stages, and suboptimal treatment facilities.\n\nBurden of Cervical Cancer in India\n\nIndia bears nearly one-fourth of the global burden of cancer of the cervix. It accounts for about a fifth of the world\u2019s new cases and a fourth of all cervical cancerous deaths worldwide.\n\nCervical cancer is the second most common cancer among Indian women aged 15\u201344 years.\nUttar Pradesh, Rajasthan, Bihar, Gujarat, Maharashtra, Andhra Pradesh, West Bengal, and Karnataka account for nearly half of India\u2019s cervical cancer burden.\nMoreover, nearly 70% of cervical cancer cases in India are detected at an advanced stage, highlighting gaps in screening and early diagnosis. Late diagnosis is a major contributing factor to the high disease mortality rates in India.\nCauses and Risk Factors\n\nPersistent infection with high-risk or oncogenic strains of HPV is the leading cause of cervical cancer. HPV types 16 and 18 account for 70% of cervical cancers.\n\nOther risk factors include:\n\nEarly onset of sexual activity\nMultiple sexual partners\nTobacco smoking\nImmunosuppression\nLong-term oral contraceptive use\n\nWomen of lower socioeconomic backgrounds are at a higher risk due to lack of awareness, and limited access to screening and vaccination resources.\n\nAlso read: Cancer Care in India\n\nHPV Vaccination for Prevention\n\nThe HPV vaccine provides close to 100% protection against persistent HPV infections caused by vaccine-included strains, thereby reducing the risk of this cancer significantly.\n\nIn addition, HPV is associated with several other cancers, including anal, vulvar, vaginal, penile, and oropharyngeal cancers. HPV vaccination helps reduce the risk of these cancers as well.\nAlso, HPV vaccines offer long-lasting protection against HPV infection. Studies have shown that the vaccines provide immunity for at least 10 years, and ongoing research suggests that protection may last even longer.\n\nIndia approved its first indigenous HPV vaccine CERVAVAC in 2023. HPV vaccination of girls before their sexual debut (9-14 years) is a critical prevention strategy.\n\nScreening for Cervical Cancer\n\nScreening helps detect precancerous cervical lesions that can be treated before progression to cancer. Screening methods include cytology-based Pap smear tests, HPV testing, and visual inspection with acetic acid (VIA).\n\nThe government provides free cervical cancer screening at select primary health centers under the National Programme for Prevention and Control of Cancer, Diabetes, Cardiovascular Diseases, and Stroke (NPCDCS).\n\nHowever, screening coverage remains low in India, with only about 10% of women screened. Efforts are needed to expand screening access through innovative methods like self-sampling HPV testing.\n\nWhy in the News?\n\nThe interim Budget 2024-25 encouraged the vaccination of girls aged 9-14 years to prevent cervical cancer, seeing the disease burden on India.\n\nFor this, the government intends to initiate a vaccination program against the human papillomavirus (HPV) for girls aged 9-14 years to curb the risk of Cervical Cancer in the future.\nGovernment Initiatives for Cervical Cancer Control\n\nSome key initiatives for cervical cancer control include:\n\nNational Programme for Prevention and Control of Cancer, Diabetes, Cardiovascular Diseases and Stroke (NPCDCS): Provides free screening at select PHCs.\nHuman Papillomavirus (HPV) vaccination: The government plans to roll out HPV vaccination for girls aged 9-14 years.\nIndigenous HPV vaccine CERVAVAC: Developed and launched in India in 2023.\nNational Cancer Grid: Links cancer centers across India for uniform standards of care.\nSetting up tertiary care centers for cancer management across India.\nAwareness campaigns on World Cancer Day (4th February).\nWay Forward: Steps Needed to Eliminate Cervical Cancer\n\nBy keeping in mind the recent scenario, it is important to take steps to eliminate the threat of cervical cancer. A few of them are:\n\nPopulation-level HPV Vaccination: Achieving high vaccination coverage of 90% can help eliminate cervical cancer as a public health problem as per WHO targets. Efforts are needed to include the HPV vaccine in the Universal Immunization Programme and increase coverage.\n\nImproving Screening Rates: Expanding screening access by innovative methods like self-sampling HPV testing through community health workers can help improve screening rates.\n\nInvesting in Health Infrastructure: Strengthening tertiary care centers for cancer diagnosis and treatment across India is vital for early diagnosis and management.\n\nGenerating Awareness: Ground-level awareness campaigns are crucial to address stigma, fear, and misconceptions related to cervical cancer screening and vaccination.\n\nCapacity Building of Healthcare Workers: Training nurses, ANMs, and ASHAs to conduct screening, raise awareness, trace patients, and enable linkages to diagnostic and treatment facilities.\n\nPartnerships and Technology Innovation: Leveraging global partnerships and emerging technologies like AI and mobile apps can help expand access to prevention, screening, diagnosis, and treatment.\n\nConclusion\n\nCervical cancer poses a major public health challenge for India, which bears a disproportionately high burden.\n\nA comprehensive approach encompassing prevention through HPV vaccination, widespread screening, early diagnosis, improved treatment access, awareness generation, and leveraging technology is key to eliminating cervical cancer in India.\n\nWith concerted action on multiple fronts, eliminating cervical cancer as a public health problem in India by 2070, as targeted under the WHO call for action, can be achieved.\n\nAlso Read: Cancer: Statistics, Causes, and Type\n\nArticle Written By: Priti Raj"

The Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB) estimates that Indian cities generate millions of tonnes of C&D waste annually.\n\nThe construction industry is among the fastest-growing industries in India.\nIt is the second-largest employer in the country and has forward and backward linkages across 250 sectors of the economy.\nIt is estimated that India will have the third-largest construction market globally by 2025\n\nHowever, the actual figures could be much higher due to underreporting and illegal dumping.\n\nThe management of this waste is complicated by the lack of segregation, inadequate collection systems, and limited awareness about recycling practices.\n\nPolicy Framework and Regulations\n\nRecognizing the need for effective C&D waste management, the Government of India introduced the Construction and Demolition Waste Management Rules in 2016, a first of its kind to specifically address C&D waste. These rules mandate local authorities to:\n\nUse construction materials made from recycled C&D waste to a certain percentage in municipal and government contracts.\nEstablish waste management facilities for C&D waste.\nEncourage the proper segregation of waste at the source and its channeling to recycling facilities.\n\nDespite these regulations, implementation remains inconsistent across different states and cities due to various challenges, including financial constraints, lack of technical expertise, and limited public awareness.\n\nChallenges in Construction and demolition waste management\n\nConstruction and demolition waste is one of the largest solid waste streams in the world. As per estimates, the construction industry in India generates about 150-500 million tonnes of C&D waste every year.\n\nThis brings many challenges to the forefront such as unauthorized dumping, a lack of space for disposal, and improper mixing with biodegradable waste. In this context, there is a huge demand for technologies that will support waste reduction and recycling of waste material.\n\nLack of Segregation: The effective recycling and management of C&D waste are hindered by the lack of segregation at the source. Mixed waste complicates processing and reduces the quality of recycled materials.\nInadequate Infrastructure: There is a significant gap in the required infrastructure for C&D waste processing. While some major cities have started setting up recycling units, many areas still lack these facilities.\nPolicy Implementation: There is a gap between policy formulation and its implementation. Local bodies often face challenges due to limited funds, lack of expertise, and insufficient enforcement mechanisms.\nAwareness and Attitude: General awareness about the importance of C&D waste management and recycling is low among stakeholders, including construction companies, contractors, and the public. This results in illegal dumping and non-compliance with regulations.\nC&D waste management strategies\nReduce: Minimizing waste at the source involves designing buildings with fewer materials and using prefabricated components to cut down on off-cuts and excess.\nReuse: Many materials like doors, windows, and fixtures can be reused in other construction projects, reducing the need for new materials.\nRecycle: Materials such as concrete, bricks, and metals can be recycled. Concrete, for example, can be crushed and reused as aggregate for new construction projects.\nRecovery: Energy can be recovered from certain waste materials through processes like incineration or anaerobic digestion.\nDisposal: The last resort for C&D waste that cannot be reused, recycled, or recovered should be disposed of in environmentally safe landfills.\nWay Forward\n\nThe urban missions which were launched in 2015 are examples of the government\u2019s green vision to adopt sustainable methods of infrastructure creation and service delivery.\n\nStrengthening Policy Implementation: Effective enforcement of existing regulations and ensuring compliance through strict penalties for illegal dumping can improve the situation.\nCapacity Building: Training programs for urban local bodies and stakeholders in the construction industry can enhance understanding and implementation of C&D waste management practices.\nInfrastructure Development: Increasing investment in recycling facilities and research in innovative recycling technologies can pave the way for efficient C&D waste management.\nPublic Awareness and Participation: Raising awareness about the benefits of C&D waste recycling and encouraging public participation in segregation can significantly impact management efforts.\nIncentives for Recycling: Providing incentives to businesses and industries that utilize recycled C&D waste can foster a market for recycled materials, making the recycling process more viable and attractive.\n\nMinistry of Housing and Urban Affairs (MoHUA) has advised all states, union territories, and urban local bodies to collect data on C&D waste generation for every major city/town promote the separation of C&D waste at source, and establish institutional mechanisms for C&D waste collection.\n\nWhy in the news?\n\nRecently, a National Workshop on \u201cRecent Developments with Recycling and use of C&D Waste in the Construction Sector\u201d was organized by CPWD in collaboration with SINTEF Norway.\n\nThe platform allowed the participants engaged in the Construction Sector to deliberate on various aspects of promoting the use of C&D recycle items in the Construction Industry.\n\nThe statistics about the country\u2019s urbanization demands tell that India needs to add about 700-900 million sq. meters of commercial and residential space every year by 2030.\n\nIf India is going to be a developed country by 2047, infrastructure will be a vital component of our ambition.\n\nConclusion\n\nEffective management of C&D waste is crucial for sustainable urban development in India.\n\nWhile challenges remain, a combination of robust policy frameworks, improved infrastructure, stakeholder participation, and public awareness can significantly enhance the efficiency of C&D waste management.\n\nMoving forward, a holistic approach involving government, industry, and citizens is essential to address the growing issue of C&D waste and to promote recycling and sustainable waste management practices.\n\nRelated articles:\n\nSolid waste management\nPlastic waste management\nSolar waste management\nE-waste management\nBattery waste management\nBiomedical waste management\n\n-Article by Swathi Satish"

Sustainably harnessing ocean resources can create livelihoods.\nFood and nutrition security \u2013 Oceans support over 4 million fishermen and fish production of 13 million tonnes annually in India. The blue economy is key for food security.\nClimate change mitigation \u2013 Oceans are the largest carbon sinks absorbing 25% of CO2 released into the atmosphere. Conserving blue carbon ecosystems like mangroves, and sea-grass meadows is important.\nEnergy security \u2013 Offshore oil and gas, ocean energy, and offshore wind energy are integral to India\u2019s energy security and transition to green energy.\nHigh growth potential \u2013 Studies estimate the Indian Ocean economy can grow at 15% annually to over USD 120 billion by 2025.\nKey Components of Blue Economy 2.0\n\nThe goal of Blue Economy 2.0 is to encourage activities and development along coastlines that can withstand and adapt to climate change.\n\nMarine environments are encountering immense threats from climate change, contamination, and excessive exploitation.\n\nThis highlights the need for collaborative efforts to protect ocean resources and strengthen their durability.\n\nKey aspects of the Blue Economy 2.0 Policy are:\n\nCoastal Ecosystem Restoration and Adaptation Measures\n\nRestoring degraded coastal ecosystems like mangroves, coral reefs, and sea-grass meadows through natural and artificial interventions.\n\nImplementing shoreline protection, beach nourishment, and other adaptation measures to mitigate rising sea levels, erosion, flooding, and extreme weather events.\n\nAdopting disaster risk reduction strategies like early warning systems, and climate-proofing coastal infrastructure.\n\nConducting ecological assessments for judicious coastal zone planning balancing development needs with sustainability.\n\nExpanding Coastal and Mariculture\n\nPromoting the sustainable expansion of coastal aquaculture of shrimps, crabs, Mollusca, seaweed, etc. through productive interventions.\n\nExpanding mariculture through farming of high-value marine fish like seabass, and groupers in open seas within EEZ.\n\nProviding funding, tax incentives, and subsidies to fishermen, farmer cooperatives, and private firms for adopting sustainable coastal and mariculture practices.\n\nInvesting in R&D, technology incubation, and innovations in areas like offshore cage farming, sea ranching, and integrated multi-trophic aquaculture.\n\nIntegrated Planning and Multi-Sectoral Approach\n\nAdopting a multi-sectoral approach with coordinated planning and action across shipping, ports, tourism, offshore energy, biotechnology, and security sectors related to oceans.\n\nMainstreaming blue economy across national and state policies, schemes, and developmental plans including marine spatial planning.\n\nFostering multi-stakeholder partnerships between different ministries, state governments, industry, and coastal communities.\n\nDeveloping sustainability criteria, guidelines, and standards for the use of ocean resources across sectors.\n\nLeveraging the latest technologies like geospatial mapping, ocean observation systems, communication networks, and big data analytics to support evidence-based planning and monitoring.\n\nWhy in the news?\n\nThe government in its Interim Budget 2024 highlighted the plans to promote Blue Economy 2.0. This will be done through a new program concentrated on restoration, adaptation, coastal aquaculture, and mariculture.\n\nThis policy aimed at harnessing the vast potential of the country\u2019s 7,500 km coastline and 2.2 million sq km Exclusive Economic Zone (EEZ).\nThe specific details regarding the budget allocation for the scheme or the activities it would entail have not been revealed yet.\nWay Forward\n\nThe Indian government recently announced the Blue Economy 2.0 policy in the budget. This policy aims to use India\u2019s oceans and coastal areas to create economic growth sustainably.\n\nTo make this policy work, the government will need to get many groups to work together. These include state governments, businesses, science institutions, thinkers, and local coastal communities.\n\nThe government will need to provide enough money and incentives for people to use the oceans responsibly. New technologies can help monitor the oceans and coastal areas. This information can help plan and check that rules are followed.\n\nIndia can learn from other countries about sustainable fishing, eco-tourism, and green ports. Partnering with international organizations can also provide useful insights.\n\nIf all groups work together responsibly, the Blue Economy 2.0 scheme can sustainably create jobs and growth. But it remains to be seen if this will happen. Overall, the scheme aims to use India\u2019s vast oceans and coasts to benefit the economy while protecting the environment.\n\nArticle Written By: Priti Raj"

            "[CONTENT]": "Transforming Fair Price Shops (FPS) in India is a crucial aspect of revitalizing the country\u2019s public distribution system (PDS), which plays a significant role in ensuring food security for millions of people. Read further to learn more.\n\nThe PDS is a government-sponsored chain of shops entrusted with the distribution of essential commodities, such as wheat, rice, sugar, and edible oils, at subsidized prices to the underprivileged sections of society.\n\nHowever, the system has been plagued by issues of inefficiency, corruption, and leakages, necessitating a comprehensive overhaul.\n\nThe transformation of FPS into more efficient, transparent, and user-friendly outlets is central to these reform efforts.\n\nTable of Contents\n\nTransforming Fair Price Shops\nChallenges\nWhy FPS is in the news?\nConclusion\nTransforming Fair Price Shops\n\nAs per the National Food Security Act, 2013, FPS refers to shops licensed to distribute essential commodities to ration card holders under the Targeted Public Distribution System (TPDS).\n\nLaunched in 1997 TPDS provides for lower subsidized food prices for Below Poverty Line (BPL) families than those for Above Poverty Line (APL) beneficiaries.\n\n\ud83d\udc49 Which year are YOU targeting for success in the IAS/IPS/IFS Exam? \ud83d\ude80\n\n(1) \u21d2 UPSC 2025: Prelims cum Mains\n\n(2) \u21d2 UPSC 2026: Prelims cum Mains\n\n(3) \u21d2 UPSC 2027 Prelims cum Mains\n\nTip: Know more about ClearIAS Courses (Online/Offline)\n\nThe license for FPS is issued by an order under section 3 of the Essential Commodities Act (ECA), 1955. ECA provides for regulating control of production, supply, distribution, and trade of certain commodities in the general public interest.\n\nDigitalization and Technology Use\n\nOne of the primary strategies for transforming FPS is the integration of digital technologies.\n\nE-governance initiatives, including the installation of Electronic Point of Sale (ePoS) machines, have been pivotal.\nThese devices ensure biometric authentication of beneficiaries, which helps in curbing identity fraud and ensuring that the subsidies reach the intended recipients.\nFurthermore, the digitization of beneficiary databases and linking them with Aadhaar has streamlined the identification process, reduced leakages, and ensured better targeting of subsidies.\nAutomation of FPS and end-to-end computerization of TPDS operation are other launches for the smooth functioning of the FPS.\n\nDiversification of Services\n\nThe government is also exploring ways to diversify the services offered by fair-price shops, turning them into multi-service centers.\n\nThis includes the provision of banking, insurance, and postal services through these outlets.\nSuch diversification not only increases the viability of FPS but also brings essential services closer to the rural and marginalized populations, promoting financial inclusion.\nTDPS control order 2015 allows the sale of non-PDS items at FPS like oil, pulses, salt, spices, etc.\n\nCapacity Building and Training\n\nImproving the operational capabilities of FPS entails capacity building and training for shop owners and staff.\n\nTraining programs on the use of digital tools, customer service, and ethical practices are essential to enhance the efficiency and effectiveness of service delivery at these shops.\nTo provide banking financial services and postal services around 3200 FPS have been enabled as Banking correspondents.\nMUDRA loans through the Department of Financial Services for capital augmentation and business diversification.\n\nInfrastructure Improvement\n\nUpgrading the physical infrastructure of FPS is crucial for better storage and handling of goods, which can reduce wastage and ensure the quality of commodities distributed to beneficiaries.\n\nImprovements in infrastructure, including better warehousing and logistics facilities, are part of the transformation agenda.\nOne nation one ration card has been launched to ensure food security for migrant workers in India.\n\nTransparency and Accountability Mechanisms\n\nImplementing transparent procedures and accountability mechanisms is critical to reforming FPS.\n\nThe introduction of grievance redressal systems, regular social audits, and active involvement of local communities and civil society organizations in monitoring FPS operations can help enhance transparency and accountability.\n\nPublic-Private Partnerships (PPPs)\n\nEngaging in Public-Private Partnerships (PPPs) is another avenue for transforming FPS.\n\nCollaboration with private sector entities can bring expertise, investment, and innovation to the PDS, helping to modernize FPS and improve service delivery. However, such partnerships need to be carefully managed to ensure that the primary objective of serving the needy remains paramount.\nAbout 43000 FPS have been enabled as Common services centers (CSC), serving as access points for delivery of various B2C and G2C services.\nChallenges\n\nWhile the transformation of fair price shops holds great promise for improving India\u2019s PDS, it is not without challenges.\n\nThese include resistance to change among some stakeholders, the digital divide that may exclude the most marginalized, and the need for continuous monitoring and evaluation to ensure reforms are achieving their intended outcomes.\n\nLeakage and Diversion of Commodities:\u00a0One of the most significant challenges is the leakage and diversion of subsidized goods to the black market. This not only deprives the intended beneficiaries of their rights but also results in financial losses to the government. The diversion of grains and other goods reduces the effectiveness of the PDS and undermines trust in the system.\nCorruption and Malpractices:\u00a0Corruption at various levels of the PDS, from procurement to distribution, affects the proper functioning of fair price shops. Malpractices such as manipulation of records, selling inferior quality goods, or charging higher prices than stipulated, are not uncommon. These issues erode the integrity of the FPS and result in poor service delivery.\nInadequate Infrastructure:\u00a0Many fair price shops suffer from inadequate infrastructure, including poor storage facilities, which leads to spoilage and wastage of stock. The lack of proper warehousing and logistics support also complicates the timely distribution of commodities, affecting the availability of essential items for beneficiaries.\nIdentification and Targeting Errors:\u00a0The PDS is plagued by issues of exclusion and inclusion errors\u2014where the intended beneficiaries are either left out of the system (exclusion errors) or non-eligible individuals receive benefits (inclusion errors). These errors stem from outdated beneficiary lists, improper identification, and the lack of a dynamic system to update beneficiary statuses.\nDigital Divide:\u00a0While the introduction of technology, such as Electronic Point of Sale (EPoS) machines, has been aimed at improving transparency and efficiency, it also highlights the digital divide. Many beneficiaries, especially in rural or remote areas, may not be technologically savvy, leading to challenges in biometric authentication and other tech-based processes.\nLack of Awareness:\u00a0There is often a lack of awareness among beneficiaries about their entitlements and the functioning of the FPS. This ignorance can lead to exploitation by shop owners and deprive beneficiaries of the full benefits of the PDS.\nInefficient Supply Chain Management:\u00a0The PDS supply chain, encompassing procurement, storage, transportation, and distribution, suffers from inefficiencies that affect the FPS. Delays in transportation, poor quality of commodities, and irregular supply schedules impact the reliability of FPS as a source of essential goods.\nFinancial Viability of FPS Owners:\u00a0The financial viability of operating a fair price shop is also a concern for many FPS owners. The commission or margin provided to them is often not sufficient to cover operational costs, leading to disinterest and lack of motivation among FPS operators, which can adversely affect service delivery.\nWhy FPS is in the news?\n\nAs a step towards Digital India, the Department of Food and Public Distribution, Government of India launched a pilot to on-board the Fair Price Shops (FPSs) in Una and Hamirpur districts of Himachal Pradesh on the Open Network Digital Commerce (ONDC).\n\nThis effort aims at providing additional avenues of income generation for FPS dealers along with enhancing beneficiary satisfaction.\nThis initiative provides numerous benefits for FPS dealers including visibility in the digital marketplace, access to a larger customer base beyond NFSA beneficiaries, and the ability to compete on an equal footing with large retailers and e-commerce platforms.\nAdditionally, beneficiaries who face difficulties in making online purchases can approach the FPS dealer to make online orders on their behalf.\n\nAlso, the standing committee on Consumer affairs, food, and pubic distribution submitted a report on transforming FPSs. The key recommendations were:\n\nIncrease sales of non-PDS commodities such as Khadi & Ayush products from MSMEs.\nForm a monitoring cell to track the progress of model FPS in all states.\nImprove the working of Vigilance Committees (VCs) established under NFSA. VCs are established by Governments at the State, District, Block, and FPS levels to ensure transparency and accountability of the functionaries in TPDS.\nEnsure all ePoS machines are connected to and synchronized with weighing machines for effective delivery of ration.\nConclusion\n\nTransforming fair-price shops in India is a complex but necessary task that requires a multi-faceted approach, involving technological upgrades, capacity building, infrastructure improvement, and enhanced transparency and accountability.\n\nBy reimagining FPS as more than just distribution points for subsidized goods, but as community-centric service hubs, the PDS can become a more effective tool in the fight against food insecurity and poverty in India. The success of these transformations will depend on the collaborative efforts of the government, private sector, civil society, and the communities they serve.\n\n-Article by Swathi Satish"

Mori discovered the making of silk in 2700 BC. Although there is much earlier evidence of silk cultivation in archaeological archives.\nCultivation began in India in 140 AD.\nLater, it spread to Europe, the Mediterranean region, and other Asian nations.\nIn several nations, including China, Japan, India, Korea, Brazil, Russia, Italy, and France, sericulture has emerged as one of the most significant cottage industries.\nPresently, more than 60% of the world\u2019s supply is produced annually by the two largest producers, China and India.\n\nIt has been an integral part of Indian culture and economy for centuries. The states of Karnataka, Andhra Pradesh, Tamil Nadu, West Bengal, and Assam are the leading silk-producing states in the country, with Karnataka accounting for more than 70% of the country\u2019s total mulberry silk production.\n\nWhat is the Process Followed in Sericulture?\n\nThe sericulture procedure for making mulberry silk consists of three main steps.\n\nMoriculture \u2013 the cultivation of mulberry leaves.\nSilkworm rearing \u2013 promoting the growth of the silkworm.\nSilk reeling \u2013 the extraction of silk filaments from the silkworm cocoons.\n\nThe silk fibers are finally weaved together to create a thread. To create yarn, these threads are frequently spun together.\n\nAlso, read about Major crops and cropping patterns.\n\nMoriculture\n\nThe cultivation of mulberry plants, whose leaves are utilized as silkworm food, is referred to as moriculture. Three alternative techniques can be used to grow these plants:\n\nCultivation from seeds\nRoot-grafting\nStem grafting\n\nThe most popular technique for mulberry plantations is stem grafting. Here, stems from mature mulberry plants are cut into cuttings that are about 22 centimeters long and have at least three buds on them. These cuttings can either be planted right away or they can be stored in nurseries before being transplanted.\n\nThe mulberry leaves can be harvested from the plants via the following methods:\n\nLeaf picking \u2013 the removal of individual leaves by hand.\nBranch cutting \u2013 removal of the entire branch.\nTop shoot harvesting \u2013 removal of the mulberry shoot tops.\n\nNotably, 50 silkworms can be fed with 1 kilogram of mulberry leaves (from the egg stage to the cocoon stage).\n\nSilk Production in India\n\nFive main categories of commercially significant silk are produced by several species of silkworms. These include Muga, Eri, Mulberry, Oak Tasar, and Tropical Tasar.\n\nMulberry Silk: The most common type of silk, produced by the domesticated silkworm, Bombyx mori, which feeds on mulberry leaves. It is primarily produced in Karnataka, Andhra Pradesh, Tamil Nadu, and West Bengal.\nEri Silk: Produced by the Samia cynthia ricini worm, which feeds on castor leaves. Eri silk is primarily produced in the northeastern states of India. It is known for its thermal properties and is often used in products like shawls and quilts.\nTasar Silk: A type of wild silk obtained from the silkworm, Antheraea mylitta, which feeds on the leaves of the Asan and Arjun trees. Tasar silk is mainly produced in the forested areas of Jharkhand, Chhattisgarh, Odisha, and Maharashtra.\nMuga Silk: Exclusive to the state of Assam, muga silk is produced by the silkworm Antheraea assamensis, which feeds on the leaves of the Som and Soalu plants. Muga silk is known for its natural golden color and durability.\n\nOther non-mulberry kinds of silks include wild silks, also referred to as vanya silks.\n\nAll these commercial types of silk are produced only in India.\n\nThe largest silk-producing region in India is in the south, which is also home to renowned silk-weaving communities like Kancheepuram, Dharmavaram, Arni, etc.\n\nSteps by the Government to develop Sericulture in India\n\nIntegrated Scheme for the Development of Silk Sector, which focuses on intervention in crucial areas including feed, seed, breed, post-cocoon technology, and capacity building, is designed to grow the sericulture industry in many states, including Tamil Nadu.\n\nThe following are the elements of the plan:\n\nResearch and development, education, technology transfer, and IT initiatives. Organization Seed.\nCoordination and the growth of the market.\nSystem for Quality Certification, Brand Promotion, and Technology Upgrades\nTo produce high-quality Bivoltine silkworm seed, cold storage facilities, and grainages have been upgraded.\nTo raise the level of quality and productivity in the manufacturing of silkworm seeds, the Silkworm Seed Act is now being put into effect.\nTo lessen drudgery and increase the quality and production of Vanya silk, the Central Silk Board has created cutting-edge technological packages, enhanced farm machinery, indigenous automatic reeling units, and Vanya silk reeling and spinning units.\nBy reclassifying non-mulberry sericulture as a forest-based activity under the modified Forest Conservation Act, farmers can now raise Vanya silkworms in their native host plantations within forests.\nThe Central Sericulture Training Institute of the Central Silk Board (CSB), which is part of the Indian government, has been offering technical assistance to the weaving and cocoon industries.\nintroducing handloom artisans to all four types of silk.\nyarn and spun silk are introduced in Ikkats weaving.\nThe Ministry of Textiles has put out several extension programs to enhance the country\u2019s silk infrastructure, some of which involve turning traditional Patola fabrics into clothing.\nWhat are the Challenges Faced in Sericulture?\n\nSeveral difficulties faced by sericulture silk farmers could potentially ruin their crops. They are also vulnerable to numerous health risks. Pebrine and flacherie are two illnesses that can affect silkworms.\n\nAdditional pests pose a threat to the silkworm larvae\u2019s ability to grow healthily. The following is a list of some significant difficulties experienced in sericulture.\n\nThe eggs may become infected with the pebrine illness and perish before the larvae emerge. This sickness causes all larvae to develop dark patches and become listless.\nThe larvae\u2019s bodies may contract as a result of viral infections. Additionally, they might begin to emit a disagreeable odor.\nThe larvae may become inactive due to other viral diseases including cytoplasmic polyhedrosis.\nThe muscardine infection, brought on by fungi, can make the larvae very weak and ultimately kill them.\nDermestid beetle larvae can dig into silkworm cocoons and consume the pupae. These injured cocoons are unable to reel out silk.\nA toxic chemical that some mites make kills silkworms.\nWay forward\n\nThe promotion of silk as a luxury fabric and its integral role in Indian traditions, such as weddings and festivals, continues to sustain high demand for Indian silk. With the right blend of traditional skills and modern technologies, India\u2019s silk industry can navigate the challenges ahead and continue to thrive in the global marketplace.\n\nPromote awareness and education about the importance and benefits of sericulture.\nEncourage government support for sericulture through subsidies, insurance schemes, and tax incentives.\nEstablish sericulture parks and centers for research and development.\nImprove infrastructure for mulberry cultivation, silkworm rearing, and silk processing.\nDevelop and promote new and improved silk varieties with higher quality and productivity.\nIncrease market access for sericulturists through better marketing and distribution channels.\nFoster partnerships between sericulturists and textile industries to ensure a steady demand for silk.\nEncourage the use of eco-friendly techniques and technologies in sericulture.\n\nArticle Written by: Remya"

It aids in the recovery of populations that may be declining and preserves the genetic diversity essential for species\u2019 adaptation to changing environments.\nClimate Change Mitigation: Ecosystems such as forests, peatlands, and mangroves are significant carbon sinks. Restoring these areas can sequester carbon dioxide from the atmosphere, helping to mitigate climate change.\nEnhancing Ecosystem Services: Healthy ecosystems provide invaluable services to humans, including clean water, air purification, pollination of crops, flood control, and recreational opportunities. Restoration efforts help ensure the continued provision of these services.\nEconomic Benefits: Ecosystem restoration can also have economic benefits by creating jobs in activities like planting trees, managing protected areas, and eco-tourism. Moreover, restored ecosystems can support local economies through improved agriculture, fisheries, and forestry.\nEcosystem Restoration Practices\nReforestation and Afforestation: Planting trees in areas where forests have been cut down or degraded and establishing forests on lands that historically have not contained forests.\nWetlands Restoration: Re-establishing the water flow and native vegetation of wetlands that have been drained, filled, or otherwise altered.\nRiver and Stream Restoration: Removing barriers like dams, re-meandering channels that have been straightened, and restoring riparian vegetation to improve water quality and habitat.\nPeatland Restoration: Blocking drainage channels to raise the water table and reintroduce native plant species in degraded peatlands.\nCoral Reefs and Mangroves: Replanting mangroves and transplanting corals or using artificial structures to promote coral growth in damaged reef areas.\nGrasslands and Savannas: Removing invasive species and reintroducing fire as a management tool to maintain ecosystem health.\nChallenges and Considerations\nTechnical Challenges: Restoration projects often face technical challenges, such as the selection of appropriate native species, determining the best methods for re-establishing those species, and managing invasive species that may have taken over degraded landscapes.\nSocial and Economic Considerations: Ecosystem restoration must consider the needs and rights of local communities, including access to resources and land use. Projects can be more successful when they involve local communities in planning and implementation, ensuring that restoration efforts also support local livelihoods.\nFunding and Longevity: Restoration projects can be expensive and require sustained funding and effort over long periods, as ecosystems can take years or even decades to recover fully. Securing ongoing funding and political support is crucial for the success and sustainability of restoration efforts.\nMonitoring and Evaluation: Effective restoration requires careful planning, ongoing monitoring, and evaluation to assess progress and adapt management strategies as necessary. This helps ensure that restoration goals are met and that the ecosystem can sustain itself in the long term.\nGlobal Initiatives: Recognizing the urgent need for widespread ecosystem restoration, global initiatives such as the United Nations Decade on Ecosystem Restoration 2021-2030 aim to prevent, halt, and reverse the degradation of ecosystems worldwide. These initiatives seek to galvanize support and action from governments, NGOs, businesses, and communities.\nUN World Restoration flagships\n\nThe UN General Assembly has declared 2021\u20132030 as the UN Decade on Ecosystem Restoration.\n\nThe World Restoration Flagships are part of the UN Decade on Ecosystem Restoration led by the UN Environment Programme (UNEP) and the Food and Agriculture Organization of the UN (FAO) which aims to prevent, halt, and reverse the degradation of ecosystems on every continent and in every ocean.\n\nThe seven New World restoration flagships are:\n\nThe Terai Arc Landscape (Nepal)\n\nThe initiative aims to restore the forests of critical corridors of the Terai Arc Landscape a biodiversity hotspot shared by India and Nepal in collaboration with local communities working as citizen scientists, community-based anti-poaching units, and forest guards, among others.\nMeasures like the restoration of 66,800 hectares of Nepal\u2019s forests, among others, were said to improve the livelihoods of about 500,000 households in the country, the UN bodies observed.\n\nRestoring Mediterranean Forests\n\nThe initiative involves the countries of Lebanon, Morocco, Tunisia and T\u00fcrkiye. It consists of a novel approach said to have protected and restored natural habitats and vulnerable ecosystems.\nIt is also said to have led to around two million hectares of forests restored across the region since 2017.\nAlong with this, over eight million hectares are planned for restoration by 2030.\n\nRegreening Africa (Ethiopia, Ghana, Kenya, Mali, Niger, Rwanda, Senegal, Somalia)\n\nRegreening Africa\u2019s agriculture is expected to benefit over 6,00,000 households.\nAs per the statement, it continues to increase carbon storage, boost crop and grass yields, make the soil more resilient (by preventing floods), and treat it with fixed nitrogen that acts as a natural fertilizer.\nIt is expected to bring 5 million hectares under restoration by 2030, boosting biodiversity and supporting local communities.\n\nSri Lanka Mangrove Regeneration\n\nThe initiative is a science-driven program co-led by local communities.\nIt focuses on the restoration of natural balance in the ecosystem.\nSince its launch in 2015, efforts have led to 500 hectares of restored mangroves, according to the UN statement.\nSome 10,000 hectares are slated for restoration by 2030, with 5,000 households to benefit and more than 4,000 new jobs to be created.\n\nLiving Indus\n\nThe initiative received approval from the Pakistan parliament in the wake of the devastating 2022 climate change-induced floods.\nIts official launch took place at the 27th Conference of Parties to the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change in Sharm el-Sheikh.\nThe initiative aims to restore 25 million hectares of the river basin by 2030, encompassing 30 percent of Pakistan\u2019s surface area through the implementation of 25 high-impact interventions for policymakers, practitioners, and civil society.\nIt designates the Indus River as a living entity with rights \u2014 a measure taken to protect rivers elsewhere as well.\nIt involves Australia, Bangladesh, Bolivia, Brazil, Canada, Ecuador, India, New Zealand, Peru and Sri Lanka.\n\nAcci\u00f3n Andina (Argentina, Bolivia, Chile, Ecuador, Per\u00fa)\n\nThe social movement led by Peruvian conservation non-profit ECOAN aims to protect and restore a forest area of one million hectares.\nAbout 25,000 people from remote Andean communities are engaged in the process of restoring 5,000 hectares and protecting more than 11,000 hectares of Andean forests.\n\nAfrican Farmers Transforming Food Systems (Mali, Senegal, Tanzania, Uganda, Kenya)\n\nGrowing forests in Africa\u2019s drylands initiative aims to expand from 41,000 restored hectares today to 229,000 hectares by 2030.\nWith the involvement of African farmers, tens of millions of trees are planted under the project every year, the intergovernmental bodies noted.\nIts visions also support many more through 230,000 jobs created.\nTrees for the Future assists hundreds of thousands of smallholder farmers in several African countries \u2013 from Senegal to Tanzania \u2013 to fight soil degradation, biodiversity loss, and climate change.\nWay Forward\n\nEcosystem restoration is a powerful tool for addressing environmental degradation, but it is just one part of a broader strategy that must also include the protection of existing intact ecosystems and the sustainable management of natural resources. Restoration projects work best when they are part of an integrated approach to land and water management that balances ecological, social, and economic objectives.\n\nThe growing recognition of the importance of healthy ecosystems to human well-being and survival has led to increased investment in restoration projects around the world. By prioritizing ecosystem restoration, societies can work towards more resilient and sustainable landscapes that support both biodiversity and human prosperity for generations to come.\n\nRelated articles:\n\nNature-based solutions\nRiver Rejuvenation Projects\n\n-Article by Swathi Satish"

According to reports in 2021, the creative ecosystem on YouTube made up almost <10,000 crores of the nation\u2019s GDP.\n\nTable of Contents\n\nCreator Economy\nImpact of the Creator Economy\nBenefits for businesses\nWhy in the news?\nFuture of the Creator Economy\nConclusion\nCreator Economy\n\nThe creator economy refers to the burgeoning economic sector driven by independent content creators, curators, and community builders, including influencers, bloggers, vloggers, podcasters, and other individuals who produce content for digital and social media platforms.\n\nThe growth is being driven by several factors, including the increasing popularity of social media, the rise of new monetization platforms, and the growing demand for authentic content from consumers.\n\nHere are a few characteristics of the creator economy:\n\n\ud83d\udc49 Which year are YOU targeting for success in the IAS/IPS/IFS Exam? \ud83d\ude80\n\n(1) \u21d2 UPSC 2025: Prelims cum Mains\n\n(2) \u21d2 UPSC 2026: Prelims cum Mains\n\n(3) \u21d2 UPSC 2027 Prelims cum Mains\n\nTip: Know more about ClearIAS Courses (Online/Offline)\n\nPlatform Dependency: Creators often rely on social media and content platforms to publish their work, reach audiences, and generate income. These platforms have algorithms that can significantly impact a creator\u2019s visibility and engagement with their audience.\nMonetization Methods: The creator economy has diversified monetization options including advertising revenue, sponsorships, merchandise sales, fan funding, subscription models, and exclusive content access. This variety allows creators to explore multiple revenue streams.\nDirect Audience Engagement: Unlike traditional media, the creator economy thrives on direct interaction between creators and their audiences. This direct engagement fosters a sense of community and loyalty, which is central to a creator\u2019s growth and sustainability.\nDemocratization of Content Creation: With access to the internet and digital tools, anyone can become a content creator. This democratization has led to a vast diversity in the types of content available, catering to a wide range of interests and niches.\nChallenges and Instability: Despite the opportunities, creators face challenges such as algorithm changes, platform dependency, copyright issues, and income instability. Navigating the creator economy requires adaptability and a strategic approach to content and audience engagement.\nImpact of the Creator Economy\nEconomic Contribution: The creator economy is a significant economic force, with billions of dollars circulating within the ecosystem. It has created new job opportunities, enabling many individuals to pursue content creation as a full-time career.\nCultural Influence: Content creators play a crucial role in shaping culture, trends, and public opinion. They have become key influencers in entertainment, fashion, politics, and more, challenging traditional media\u2019s dominance.\nInnovation and Entrepreneurship: The creator economy fosters innovation, as creators continually experiment with new formats, platforms, and revenue models. It has also spurred the development of new tools and services designed to support creators.\nEducation and Learning: Many creators focus on educational content, contributing to informal learning and skill development across various subjects. This access to free or affordable education is transforming traditional notions of learning and information sharing.\nBenefits for businesses\n\nThe creator economy offers numerous benefits for businesses, ranging from enhanced brand visibility to innovative ways of engaging with target audiences. By leveraging content creators, companies can tap into a dynamic and rapidly expanding market. Here are some key benefits businesses can gain through the creator economy:\n\nAuthentic Engagement: Creators build trust and authentic relationships with their followers, which can be incredibly beneficial for businesses. When a creator endorses a product or service, their endorsement comes across as more genuine and trustworthy compared to traditional advertising. This authenticity can lead to higher engagement rates and conversions.\nTargeted Reach: Content creators often cater to niche markets or specific demographics, allowing businesses to target their marketing efforts more precisely. By partnering with creators who align with their brand values and target audience, businesses can reach potential customers more effectively than through broad, generalized advertising.\nCost-Effectiveness: Collaborating with creators can be more cost-effective than traditional marketing channels. While high-profile influencers may command significant fees, there are many micro and nano influencers with smaller, highly engaged audiences. These collaborations can offer high ROI, making them a cost-effective choice for businesses, especially SMEs (Small and Medium Enterprises).\nCreative Content Production: Creators are professional content producers who understand what resonates with their audience. By collaborating with them, businesses can tap into their creativity and expertise to produce innovative and engaging content. This not only helps in marketing the product but also in refreshing the brand\u2019s content strategy.\nIncreased Brand Loyalty: When creators share their positive experiences with a brand, it can significantly enhance the brand\u2019s image and increase loyalty among existing and potential customers. The personal touch that creators add helps in humanizing the brand, making it more relatable and trustworthy.\nMarket Insights: Creators are in constant communication with their audiences, giving them unique insights into consumer preferences and trends. Businesses can leverage these insights to better understand their target market, refine their products or services, and tailor their marketing strategies accordingly.\nGlobal Reach: The digital nature of the creator economy means that content can reach audiences worldwide. For businesses looking to expand their market presence, partnering with creators can be an effective way to enter new markets and connect with international customers.\nSEO Benefits: Collaborations with content creators can also enhance a brand\u2019s SEO strategy. High-quality content that links back to the business\u2019s website can improve search engine rankings, drive traffic, and increase online visibility.\nFlexibility and Scalability: The creator economy allows businesses to scale their marketing efforts up or down with ease. Companies can start with small collaborations and gradually increase their investment as they see positive results, offering flexibility that\u2019s harder to achieve with traditional advertising contracts.\nInnovative Advertising Formats: Creators often pioneer new content formats and marketing techniques, from interactive stories on Instagram to long-form content on YouTube. Partnering with creators allows businesses to experiment with innovative advertising formats and stay ahead of the curve in digital marketing trends.\nWhy in the news?\n\nThe government has introduced the \u2018National Creators Award\u2018 in an attempt to recognize the increasing impact of digital producers and influencers and support India\u2019s digital economy.\n\nAccording to the Ministry of Electronics & IT (MeitY), the award\u2019s objectives are to promote good social change and innovation in the digital sphere, as well as to highlight the many voices and talents influencing India\u2019s future.\n\nFuture of the Creator Economy\n\nThe future of the creator economy looks promising but is also fraught with uncertainties related to platform policies, copyright laws, and the evolving digital landscape.\n\nAs platforms seek to retain and attract creators, we may see more innovative tools and better revenue-sharing models. Simultaneously, the rise of decentralized platforms and technologies like blockchain could offer creators more control over their content and earnings.\nMoreover, as the audience becomes more discerning, there will be a greater emphasis on quality, authenticity, and value-driven content.\nCreators who can adapt to these changes, diversify their income streams, and maintain a strong connection with their audience are likely to thrive in this evolving economy.\nConclusion\n\nThe creator economy is still in its early stages, but it is growing rapidly. In 2021, the creator economy was valued at $104 billion, and it is projected to reach nearly half a trillion by 2027.\n\nThe creator economy opens up a world of opportunities for businesses willing to engage with new marketing strategies. By harnessing the power of creators, companies can achieve authentic engagement, targeted reach, and creative collaboration, leading to increased brand awareness, customer loyalty, and ultimately, business growth.\n\nRelated articles:\n\nRole of social media in UPSC CSE preparation\nSocial media and Civil servants\nRole of social media in internal security challenges\n\n-Article by Swathi Satish"

Read here for a comprehensive analysis of the issue.\n\nThe demand for statehood in Ladakh has been a substantial political issue since the region was reorganized as a Union Territory (UT) on October 31, 2019, following the abrogation of Article 370 and the bifurcation of the erstwhile state of Jammu and Kashmir into two UTs: Jammu and Kashmir (with a legislature) and Ladakh (without a legislature).\n\nThis reorganization was aimed at providing a more direct and efficient governance model for the region, addressing its unique geopolitical and socio-cultural context.\n\nHowever, the transition also sparked discussions and demands among the residents and political leaders of Ladakh for granting it full statehood.\n\nTable of Contents\n\nWhy is Ladakh important for India?\nLadakh statehood\nReasons for Statehood Demand\nGovernment Response to Ladakh statehood demand\n6th Schedule\nWhy in the news?\nConclusion\nWhy is Ladakh important for India?\n\nSubscribe to the ClearIAS YouTube Channel for more informative videos on UPSC preparation, tips, and strategies.

The region has been the site of several stand-offs and conflicts, most notably the 1962 Sino-Indian War and more recently, the 2020 Galwan Valley clash. The control and surveillance of this border are crucial for India to maintain its territorial integrity and counter Chinese influence in the region.\nBorder with Pakistan: To the west of Ladakh lies the Line of Control (LoC) with Pakistan-administered Kashmir. The strategic Siachen Glacier, often referred to as the world\u2019s highest battlefield, is also part of Ladakh. Control over this area is vital for India to secure its borders against potential threats from Pakistan.\n\nNational Security\n\nLadakh\u2019s terrain and elevation provide India with natural advantages in terms of surveillance and defense.\nThe Indian military maintains a significant presence in the region, with infrastructure developments in recent years aimed at enhancing mobility and logistic capabilities.\nThe construction of roads, bridges, and airstrips enhances India\u2019s ability to rapidly deploy forces in case of conflict, underscoring Ladakh\u2019s role as a critical frontier in India\u2019s defense strategy.\n\nEconomic and Environmental Significance\n\nLadakh is also pivotal for its water resources, as it houses several major rivers\u2019 headwaters, including the Indus.\nThese rivers are vital for the agriculture and livelihoods of millions of people downstream.\nThe region\u2019s unique biodiversity and ecosystems are of significant environmental and scientific interest, with potential for sustainable tourism and renewable energy projects that could contribute to India\u2019s green energy goals.\n\nDiplomatic Leverage\n\nLadakh\u2019s geopolitical importance extends into the realm of international diplomacy, where it serves as a leverage point in India\u2019s negotiations with China and Pakistan.\nThe ability to assert control and maintain a strong military presence in Ladakh sends a strategic signal to both countries, influencing broader diplomatic interactions and negotiations.\n\nCultural and Soft Power\n\nThe rich cultural heritage and the predominance of Buddhism in Ladakh afford India unique soft power advantages, strengthening cultural ties and exchanges with other Buddhist countries and communities.\nPromoting Ladakh as a center for Buddhist pilgrimage and studies can enhance India\u2019s cultural influence in Asia, serving its geopolitical interests.\nLadakh statehood\n\nLadakh, comprising two districts, Leh and Kargil, is known for its strategic geopolitical significance and its unique cultural heritage, distinct from the rest of Jammu and Kashmir.\n\nThe region has long voiced its demand for autonomy and a separate identity, leading to its eventual separation from Jammu and Kashmir.\n\nHowever, the grant of UT status without a legislative assembly has led to concerns among the local population regarding their representation and participation in governance.\n\nReasons for Statehood Demand\nGovernance and Representation: One of the primary reasons for the statehood demand is the desire for more significant local governance and representation. Residents and political leaders in Ladakh seek a legislative assembly that can address local issues more effectively and represent the region\u2019s interests at the national level.\nCultural Identity: Ladakh has a distinct cultural heritage, with a predominantly Buddhist population in Leh and a significant Muslim population in Kargil. The local communities see the preservation and promotion of this unique cultural identity as crucial.\nDevelopment Concerns: While Ladakh\u2019s UT status has led to an increase in central assistance and focus on development, there are concerns that without statehood, the region may not fully realize its developmental potential. Statehood is viewed as a means to ensure more resources and greater autonomy in planning and implementing development projects.\nSecurity and Border Management: Given Ladakh\u2019s strategic location, sharing borders with China and Pakistan, there are also arguments that statehood could lead to stronger local governance mechanisms to support border security and management.\n\nThe demand for Ladakh to be included in the 6th Schedule of the Indian Constitution has gained prominence. The reasons for the demand are:\n\nProtection of Tribal Rights and Identity: Ladakh is predominantly inhabited by tribal communities, including the Buddhists in Leh and the Shia Muslims in Kargil, making up around 97% of its population. The inclusion in the 6th Schedule would recognize and protect their unique cultural, social, and economic identity.\nLand Rights and Environmental Protection: Concerns have been raised about safeguarding the region\u2019s fragile environment and its land from being exploited. The 6th Schedule\u2019s provisions would help in regulating land ownership and use, thereby preventing the alienation of tribal land and ensuring sustainable development.\nAutonomy in Governance: Ladakh\u2019s inclusion in the 6th Schedule would mean a significant degree of self-governance concerning administering their laws on land, forest, and water management, thus empowering the local population in decision-making processes.\nCultural Preservation: The unique cultural heritage of Ladakh, which is distinct from the rest of the country, can be better preserved through the autonomy and legislative powers that come with the 6th Schedule.\nGovernment Response to Ladakh statehood demand\n\nThe Indian government has acknowledged the demands and concerns of the Ladakhi people, and discussions are ongoing regarding the region\u2019s future governance model.\n\nThere have been assurances of taking steps to protect Ladakh\u2019s cultural and linguistic heritage, along with initiatives to boost development and ensure the region\u2019s security.\nThe government has constituted a committee to discuss the safeguarding of the region\u2019s cultural and land rights, among other issues.\n\nPublic opinion in Ladakh is diverse, with some groups advocating for statehood. In contrast, others emphasize the need for safeguards to protect land rights, jobs, and cultural identity under the current UT status.\n\nThe establishment of the Ladakh Autonomous Hill Development Councils (LAHDC) in Leh and Kargil has been a step towards ensuring local governance, but the demand for statehood signifies a desire for a more comprehensive governance structure.\n\nImplementing the 6th Schedule in Ladakh would require the creation of Autonomous District Councils (ADCs) for Leh and Kargil, which would necessitate a careful restructuring of the current administrative framework to accommodate these changes.\n\n6th Schedule\n\nThe 6th Schedule of the Indian Constitution is a unique provision that grants autonomy to tribal communities in the northeastern region of India, allowing for the creation of Autonomous District Councils (ADCs).\n\nThis schedule applies to the states of Assam, Meghalaya, Tripura, and Mizoram, reflecting the Indian government\u2019s recognition of the diverse ethnic, cultural, and linguistic identities in these areas, and its commitment to ensuring their self-governance within the framework of the Indian Union.\n\nKey Features of the 6th Schedule\n\nAutonomous District Councils (ADCs): The 6th Schedule allows for the formation of ADCs that have legislative, administrative, and judicial powers over the areas under their jurisdiction. These councils can make laws about land, forests, cultivation, inheritance, indigenous customs, and social practices.\nComposition of the Councils: Each Autonomous District Council consists of elected members and nominated members (not exceeding one-sixth of the total members), who are nominated by the Governor. The term of the members of the council is five years, similar to that of the members of the Legislative Assembly.\nLegislative Powers: The councils have the power to make laws on certain specified subjects such as land management, forest management, agriculture, public health, and sanitation. For certain subjects, the approval of the Governor is required.\nFinancial Powers: The ADCs are empowered to collect taxes on lands and buildings, receive a share of royalties on minerals, and manage funds allotted by both the state and central governments for infrastructure and development projects within their territories.\nJudicial Powers: The councils also have the authority to constitute village courts within their territories to hear trials of cases involving the tribal people. However, the jurisdiction of these courts is subject to the limitations imposed by the state legislature.\n\nSignificance of the 6th Schedule\n\nProtects Tribal Autonomy: The 6th Schedule provides a mechanism for protecting the rights and autonomy of tribal populations, recognizing their distinct social, cultural, and economic practices, and allowing them to govern themselves according to their traditional laws.\nPromotes Governance at the Grassroots Level: By delegating powers to ADCs, the 6th Schedule promotes decentralized governance, allowing for more localized and efficient administration and development processes.\nSafeguards Cultural Identity: It helps safeguard the languages, customs, and traditions of the tribal communities by granting them the authority to make laws on social practices and customs.\nConflict Resolution: The Schedule offers a framework for peace and order in the northeastern region by politically empowering the tribal communities, thereby addressing grievances and reducing ethnic conflicts.\nWhy in the news?\n\nLeh and Kargil divisions of Ladakh observed a shutdown on February 3, 2024, to reiterate four demands:\n\nstatehood for Ladakh\ninclusion of Ladakh in the sixth schedule of the Constitution giving it a tribal status\njob reservation for locals, and\na parliamentary seat each for Leh and Kargil.\n\nAlso read: Kashmir Issue \u2013 Understand the multiple dimensions\n\nConclusion\n\nThe demand for Ladakh\u2019s statehood is intertwined with the region\u2019s unique socio-cultural fabric, strategic significance, and aspirations for self-governance.\n\nWhile the central government\u2019s steps towards ensuring Ladakh\u2019s development and security are noteworthy, addressing the local population\u2019s demands for representation and statehood will require careful consideration and dialogue.\n\nBalancing Ladakh\u2019s strategic interests with its cultural and developmental aspirations remains a critical challenge for policymakers.\n\nGiven Ladakh\u2019s strategic location along India\u2019s borders with China and Pakistan, any move to provide autonomy will have to be carefully balanced with national security considerations.\n\nIncluding Ladakh in the 6th Schedule would require an amendment to the Constitution, which necessitates approval by a majority in both houses of Parliament, making it a process that would require broad political consensus.\n\nLadakh\u2019s geopolitical importance is likely to grow in the coming years, given the shifting dynamics of global power and the increasing focus on Asia as a critical region for international security and cooperation. India\u2019s ability to navigate these challenges and leverage Ladakh\u2019s strategic position will be crucial in shaping its regional and global standing.\n\n-Article by Swathi Satish"

However, the journey is far from complete. The future direction involves completing the digitalization process and ensuring that digital land records are integrated with other initiatives like the Unique Identification Authority of India (Aadhaar) and the Goods and Services Tax Network (GSTN) for a more comprehensive approach to digital governance.\n\nMoreover, leveraging advanced technologies such as blockchain could further secure land records, making them tamper-proof and fostering trust in the digital system. Continuous education and awareness campaigns are also essential to ensure that the rural population can fully use digital land records.\n\nLand digitalization in India is a monumental task with far-reaching implications for governance, the economy, and society.

As a result, businesses\u2019 talent search expenses increase. One of the most important strategies to raise the bar for education is to have a reliable examination system.\n\nGood examination boards are said to be characterized by uniformity and secrecy. Scandals result from secrecy that is not properly checked, balanced, or audited.\n\nExperimentation in assessment and curriculum is eliminated by standardization through examination consistency. Rather, openness in instruction and evaluation is the only way to guarantee the validity of assessments and the calibre of education.\n\nStructure of examination in India\n\nSchool Level\n\nBoard Examinations: At the school level, students undergo board examinations at the end of the 10th grade (Secondary) and the 12th grade (Senior Secondary), which are crucial for determining their academic and professional paths. The Central Board of Secondary Education (CBSE) and the Indian Certificate of Secondary Education (ICSE) are the two main national boards, alongside various state boards.\nContinuous and Comprehensive Evaluation (CCE): Some boards like the CBSE had implemented the CCE to assess students throughout the year, focusing on holistic education rather than rote learning. However, its application and continuity have seen changes over the years.\n\nCollege and University Level\n\nSemester System: Higher education institutions, including universities and colleges, generally follow the semester system with mid-term and end-term examinations. This system also includes internal assessments, practicals, and projects.\nEntrance Examinations: Admission to professional courses like engineering (JEE), medical (NEET), management (CAT), and others is through competitive entrance examinations. These tests assess a candidate\u2019s aptitude and proficiency in specific subjects.\nChallenges in the examination system\n\nEvery test season, controversies involving certain colleges or even school boards are reported by the media.\n\nThe quality of the certificates that the school boards and examination authorities issue is a key factor in determining the examination system\u2019s legitimacy.\nSince learning is dependent on the suggested examination system, the examination system\u2019s lack of credibility in educational institutions has an impact on the standards of education.\nRote Learning: Traditional examination systems have often been criticized for encouraging memorization over conceptual understanding and critical thinking.\nThe Indian system right from the beginning becomes intensely competitive and stressful and starts promoting cramming as a way to move forward with high marks.\nIndia\u2019s Education system prioritizes competition over comprehension, fostering a culture of rote memorization rather than genuine understanding.\nStress and Pressure: The high stakes associated with board and entrance examinations exert considerable pressure on students, sometimes leading to anxiety and stress-related issues.\nAccess and Equity: There are concerns about equitable access to preparatory resources and opportunities, which can disadvantage students from lower socioeconomic backgrounds.\nMany of the Boards don\u2019t have adequate staff, or enough academic faculty to monitor their procedures. Many of the State Boards are actually in very poor shape as far as their academic infrastructure is concerned.\nEven the CBSE (Central Board of School Education) and ICSE (Indian Certificate of Secondary Education) operate as bureaucratic, mechanical set-ups, potentially compromising the quality of examination processes.\n\nAlso read: Education in India \u2013 A Detailed Analysis\n\nReforms and Innovations\nNew Education Policy (NEP) 2020: The NEP 2020 aims to overhaul the Indian educational system, proposing changes like reducing the high-stakes nature of board exams, making them more flexible, and focusing on critical thinking.\nTechnology Integration: Online examinations, computer-based testing, and the use of AI for personalized learning and assessment are becoming more prevalent. The COVID-19 pandemic accelerated the adoption of digital platforms for conducting exams.\nOnline Learning and Examinations: The pandemic led to a significant shift towards online learning and remote examinations. This shift has continued to influence how assessments are conducted, with many institutions adopting hybrid models.\nAdaptive Testing: Some entrance exams have started exploring computer-adaptive testing, which adjusts the difficulty level of questions based on the examinee\u2019s responses, making exams more personalized and efficient.\nAddressing Institutional Dysfunction: There is a need to recognize and rectify the systemic inadequacies within examination boards, including staffing shortages and infrastructure deficiencies.\nHolistic Evaluation Criteria: Expand the criteria for evaluating student performance to encompass a broader range of competencies, including creativity, collaboration, and emotional intelligence.\nConclusion\n\nThe examination system in India is at a crossroads, with traditional methods being reevaluated in light of new educational philosophies and technological advancements.\n\nWhile the system has served as a critical filter in the academic and professional screening process, its evolution is essential to cater to the dynamic needs of students and the broader socio-economic landscape.\n\nThe focus is gradually shifting from merely testing rote knowledge to assessing a student\u2019s comprehensive understanding, practical skills, and critical thinking abilities.\n\nThis shift, supported by technological advancements and policy reforms, promises to make the Indian examination system more holistic, inclusive, and aligned with global educational standards.\n\nPrevious year questions\n\nQ.

Its nano-sized particles allow for better dissolution and absorption by plant roots, ensuring that plants receive the right amount of nutrients at the right time.\nReduced Usage: The enhanced efficiency of nano DAP means that farmers can use significantly less fertilizer to achieve the same, if not better, results. This reduction in usage can lead to lower costs and decreased environmental impact.\nEnvironmental Benefits: By reducing the amount of fertilizer needed, nano DAP can help lower the risk of runoff into water bodies, which is a major cause of eutrophication and harmful algal blooms. Its targeted delivery system also minimizes the leaching of nutrients into the soil, reducing soil and water pollution.\nImproved Crop Yields: The precise delivery of nutrients and improved absorption efficiency can lead to healthier plants and potentially higher crop yields, benefiting farmers\u2019 productivity and profitability.\nSustainability: Nano DAP aligns with the goals of sustainable agriculture by promoting the efficient use of resources and reducing the environmental footprint of farming practices.\nDevelopment and Usage\n\nThe development of nano DAP involves the application of nanotechnology in agriculture, which is a growing field of research and innovation.\n\nNano fertilizers like nano DAP are part of an emerging trend aimed at addressing the challenges of increasing agricultural productivity while ensuring environmental sustainability.\nHowever, the adoption of nano DAP and similar technologies is subject to regulatory approvals, safety assessments, and cost considerations.\nResearch is ongoing to fully understand the long-term impacts of nano fertilizers on soil health, microbial communities, and the broader ecosystem.\nChallenges\nRegulation and Safety: There is a need for comprehensive regulatory frameworks to ensure the safe development, usage, and disposal of nano fertilizers. Assessing their long-term environmental and health impacts is crucial.\nCost: Initially, the cost of nano DAP may be higher than traditional fertilizers due to the advanced technology and production processes involved. However, its efficiency and lower usage rates can offset these costs over time.\nAwareness and Adoption: Farmers and agricultural stakeholders need to be made aware of the benefits and proper usage of nano fertilizers. Training and education are key to ensuring that these new technologies are used effectively and responsibly.\nResearch and Development: Continued research and development are essential to optimize the formulations, delivery mechanisms, and application methods of nano DAP and to explore its full potential and limitations.\nNutrient imbalance: Nano formulations may modify the nutrient balance in soil and plants, potentially affecting crop growth and development. This imbalance could result in deficiencies or toxicities of certain nutrients, impacting overall yield and quality.\n\nAlso read: Nano Urea\n\nMacro and micronutrients for plant growth\n\nFor optimal growth, health, and productivity, plants require a balanced intake of both macronutrients and micronutrients. These nutrients serve various critical functions in plant physiology, affecting everything from root development and photosynthesis to flowering and fruiting.\n\nMacronutrients\n\nMacronutrients are required by plants in larger quantities than micronutrients. They are fundamental to plant growth and are often the focus of fertilization programs. Macronutrients are divided into primary and secondary categories.\n\nPrimary Macronutrients\n\nNitrogen (N): Essential for vegetative growth, nitrogen is a key component of chlorophyll, the molecule responsible for photosynthesis. It\u2019s also a part of amino acids, the building blocks of proteins.\nPhosphorus (P): Important for energy transfer within the plant, phosphorus plays a critical role in the formation of DNA, RNA, and ATP (adenosine triphosphate), and is vital for root development, flowering, and fruiting.\nPotassium (K): Crucial for water uptake and retention, potassium aids in protein synthesis, photosynthesis, and enzyme activation. It also helps plants resist drought and diseases.\n\nSecondary Macronutrients\n\nCalcium (Ca): Important for cell wall structure and stability, calcium is also crucial in cell division and growth, and helps in nutrient uptake and signaling within the plant.\nMagnesium (Mg): A central component of chlorophyll, magnesium is essential for photosynthesis and enzyme activation. It plays a role in phosphorus utilization and plant respiration.\nSulfur (S): Integral to the formation of amino acids, vitamins, and enzymes, sulfur is also necessary for protein synthesis and plays a role in plant growth and disease resistance.\nMicronutrients\n\nMicronutrients are required by plants in much smaller quantities than macronutrients but are equally vital to plant health and development. They often act as cofactors in enzyme processes.\n\nIron (Fe): Necessary for chlorophyll synthesis and functioning as a component of many enzymes, iron plays a role in energy transfer within the plant.\nManganese (Mn): Involved in enzyme activation, manganese is essential for photosynthesis, respiration, and nitrogen assimilation.\nBoron (B): Important for cell wall formation and stability, boron is also crucial in reproductive development, seed and fruit development, and nutrient transport.\nZinc (Zn): Plays a significant role in protein synthesis, growth regulation, and development of the plant. It\u2019s also important for enzyme activation.\nCopper (Cu): Essential for photosynthesis and respiratory enzyme systems, copper also plays a role in lignin synthesis and is important for metabolism.\nMolybdenum (Mo): Crucial for nitrogen fixation in legumes and in the conversion of nitrates into amino acids within the plant.\nChloride (Cl): Important for osmosis and ionic balance, chloride also plays a role in photosynthesis.\nConclusion\n\nNano DAP represents a promising advancement in agricultural fertilizers, offering a way to enhance nutrient use efficiency, reduce environmental impact, and support sustainable farming practices. Its successful integration into agriculture depends on overcoming regulatory, cost, and educational barriers, as well as ensuring that it is safe and beneficial in the long term.\n\nRelated article:\n\nNano Urea\nOne Nation One Fertilizer\nEnvironmentally friendly fertilizers\u00a0(EFF)\nAgrochemicals\n\n-Article by Swathi Satish"

Read here to learn more about it.\n\nOnly 1% of the revenue of panchayats was earned by them, with the rest being raised as grants from the State and the Centre, show data. Specifically, 80% of the revenue was from Central government grants; only 15% was from State government grants. Consequently, the revenue raised by panchayats formed a minuscule share of the States\u2019 revenue.\n\nPanchayats act on three levels sabhas, panchayat samithis, and zila parishads.

In some cases, zila parishads are also responsible for maintaining schools, hospitals, dispensaries, and minor irrigation projects.\n\nTable of Contents\n\nFinances of Panchayati Raj Institutions: A History\nFinances of Panchayati Raj Institutions\nRole of Panchayats in Economic Development\nRural development\nAgriculture development\nLocalization of Sustainable Development Goals\nHealth\nEducation\nWomen empowerment\nConclusion\nFinances of Panchayati Raj Institutions: A History\n\nSince Vedic times, villages in India have served as fundamental administrative units. References to Panchayats can be found in ancient texts like Manusmriti, Arthashastra, and Mahabharata.\n\nThe role of Panchayats, however, waned due to factors such as the failure of kingdoms to adhere to decentralization principles.\nThe Panchayati Raj system was dismantled during British rule, with the establishment of the district collectorate, primarily for revenue collection.\nIn 1870, the Bengal Chowkidar Act granted district magistrates the authority to establish Panchayats in villages comprising of appointed members for tax collection.\nIn 1882, the British government passed a resolution, envisioning the formation of local boards with elected non-official members in substantial majority.\nThis resolution also proposed the creation of rural local boards, with two-thirds of their members elected by the populace.\nDespite these early intentions, the progress in the formation of rural local self-governments remained stagnant until 1947.\n\nThe modern concept of Panchayati Raj received a boost from Mahatma Gandhi, who saw it as a means of promoting democracy at the grassroots level. He advocated Gram Swaraj or village self-governance \u2013 a decentralized form of governance in which villages would be responsible for their affairs, serving as cornerstones of India\u2019s political system.\n\nFollowing independence, Gram Panchayats were revitalized by entrusting them with essential functions of local government.\n\n\ud83d\udc49 Which year are YOU targeting for success in the IAS/IPS/IFS Exam? \ud83d\ude80\n\n(1) \u21d2 UPSC 2025: Prelims cum Mains\n\n(2) \u21d2 UPSC 2026: Prelims cum Mains\n\n(3) \u21d2 UPSC 2027 Prelims cum Mains\n\nTip: Know more about ClearIAS Courses (Online/Offline)\n\nUnder the Directive Principles in Article 40 of the Constitution, it is stipulated that \u201cthe State shall take measures to organize Gram Panchayats and empower them with the necessary authority and powers to function as self-governing units.\u201d\nIn 1957, the Balwant Rai Mehta Committee, the first committee to address issues related to democratic decentralization in the post-independence period, proposed a three-tier Panchayati Raj system consisting of Gram Panchayats, Panchayat Samitis, and Zila Parishads, with Gram Panchayats consisting of directly elected representatives, and Panchayat Samitis and Zila Parishads comprising indirectly elected representatives.\nIn 1977, the Ashok Mehta Committee suggested a two-tier system consisting of Zila Parishads at the district level and Mandal Panchayats that would be responsible for a group of villages.\nIn 1986, the L.M. Singhvi Committee recommended the constitutional recognition of the Panchayati Raj system, emphasizing their significance and role in India\u2019s governance structure.\n\nIn 1992, the 73rd Amendment\u00a0to the Indian Constitution institutionalized the Panchayati Raj Institutions (PRIs) at three levels in rural India: Gram Panchayats at the village level, Mandal Panchayats at the intermediate/block level, and Zila Parishad at the district level.\n\nThe 73rd Amendment introduced a significant change, specifying 29 subjects for which Panchayats were entrusted with the responsibility of devising and executing plans aimed at fostering local economic development and social justice.\nThese subjects are outlined in the Eleventh Schedule of the Constitution and encompass a wide range of areas, including agriculture, animal husbandry, water management, rural housing, road infrastructure, rural electrification, healthcare, sanitation, poverty alleviation programs, family welfare, women and child development, public distribution systems, social welfare, and more\nFinances of Panchayati Raj Institutions\n\nThe revenue receipts are dominated by grants-in-aid, with a share of more than 95 percent of the total receipts.\n\nThe Panchayats receive grants from both the Central and State governments. These grants may be distributed under specific schemes or based on the Central Finance Commission\u2019s (CFC) and State Finance Commissions\u2019 (SFC) recommendations.\n\nThe grants come in various forms:\n\nUnited Grants: also known as general purpose grants, these are provided without specific conditions or restrictions and they can be utilized by PRIs based on local priorities and needs.\nTied Grants: earmarked for specific purposes or sectors, such as sanitation, education, healthcare, or infrastructure development, these grants ensure that funds are directed towards the targeted areas of development as determined by higher levels of government.\nPerformance-based Grants: based on the recommendations of some CFCs to link grants to specific performance criteria, PRIs that demonstrate effective governance, financial management, and successful implementation of development projects may receive additional funds as incentives for their performance.\nSpecial Category Grants: these grants are designed to address unique challenges or particular needs of PRIs in specific regions or contexts and provide additional financial support to regions facing particular socioeconomic or geographical constraints.\n\nThe own revenues of the Panchayats \u2013 generated by imposing local taxes, fees, and charges on various activities, including land revenue, professional and trade taxes, and miscellaneous fees \u2013 were only 1.1 percent of their total revenue during the 2020-2023 period.\n\nNon-tax revenue \u2013 primarily from Panchayati Raj programs and interest earnings \u2013 was only 3.3 percent of their total revenue receipts.\n\nThe ratio of revenue expenditure of Panchayats to nominal GSDP is less than 0.6 percent for all the States.\n\nInvestment in capital projects constituted 29.6 percent of the total expenditure of Panchayats in 2022-23, on average, across States.\n\nA significant share of the capital expenditure by PRIs is allocated to Panchayati Raj Programmes, transportation, water supply and sanitation, rural electrification, and rural housing.\nRole of Panchayats in Economic Development\n\nFinances of Panchayati Raj institutions play a central role in planning and executing diverse rural development projects and schemes.\n\nRural development\n\nRural development encompasses various sectors, from agriculture to rural industries, and essential social infrastructure, such as schools, clinics, roads, communication networks, water supply systems, markets, welfare facilities, improved nutrition, literacy programs, and adult education initiatives.\n\nPRIs have helped in identifying actual beneficiaries to target benefits from the government schemes.\nFurther, the PRI system is crucial in promoting social mobilization, broad community participation in local development, and representation of weaker sections in decision-making processes for inclusive and equitable development.\nThe PRIs have also empowered rural women through one-third reservation in Panchayati Raj bodies, promoting gender inclusivity and fostering their active involvement in shaping community development initiatives.\nPRIs prepare Village Development Plans (VDPs) and implement development projects by allocating resources based on local needs to align development initiatives with the priorities of the rural population.\nPanchayats also serve as implementing agencies for various Central and State government programs and schemes to help in the targeted delivery of these programs at the grassroots level.\nAgriculture development\nPRIs implement and oversee initiatives that boost agricultural productivity, support sustainable farming practices, and enhance the overall economic resilience of rural areas.\nPRIs collaborate with agricultural extension services, facilitate access to modern farming techniques, and promote the adoption of innovative technologies to empower local farmers.\nPanchayats also contribute to the implementation of the soil health card scheme, execution of infrastructure projects, and promotion of animal husbandry and the fisheries sector.\nCooperative endeavors like Amul have originated at the Panchayat level.\nPanchayats have supported sustainable practices such as social forestry and agro-forestry, emphasizing their crucial role in shaping and advancing agricultural practices at the grassroots level.\nLocalization of Sustainable Development Goals\n\nThe Ministry of Panchayati Raj (MoPR), Government of India is advancing the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) in collaboration with PRIs across rural India.\n\nThe Localisation of SDGs (LSDGs) is being actively pursued through 9 themes aligned with the aspirations of rural communities. These themes are:\n\nPoverty-free and enhanced livelihoods Panchayat;\nHealthy Panchayat;\nChild-Friendly Panchayat;\nWater-Sufficient Panchayat;\nClean and Green Panchayat;\nPanchayat with Self-sufficient Infrastructure;\nSocially Just and Socially Secured Panchayat;\nPanchayat with Good Governance;\nWomen-Friendly Panchayat.\n\nLSDGs involve a commitment to achieving the targets outlined in the SDGs by 2030.\n\nHealth\n\nPanchayats play a significant role in providing basic healthcare facilities to rural residents in collaboration with government health departments through establishing and maintaining health centers, clinics, and dispensaries.\n\nGPs contribute to improving maternal and child health by promoting institutional deliveries, encouraging prenatal and postnatal care, and reducing maternal and infant mortality rates.\nPanchayats engage and train local community health workers to disseminate health-related information, provide primary care, and connect individuals to appropriate medical services.\nProviding access to clean drinking water and proper sanitation facilities is also an integral role of GPs, to maintain good health and prevent waterborne diseases.\n\nRural India still faces around 29 percent shortfall in rural health facilities in several States.\n\nThe Fifteenth Central Finance Commission (CFC-XV) recommended a total grant of `4.3 lakh crore for local governments covering the period from 2021-22 to 2025-26.\n\nEducation\n\nIn rural areas, village Panchayats are responsible for constructing, maintaining, and enhancing educational institutions, primary schools, and community learning centers.\n\nPanchayats collaborate with schools and parents to encourage enrolment, minimize drop-out rates, and actively monitor school operations, teacher attendance, and educational quality.\n\nNonetheless, rural primary schooling in India faces hurdles due to a variety of factors:\n\npoorly equipped buildings;\nlimited connectivity;\nscarcity of qualified teachers; and\nlow enrolment and high drop-out rates exacerbated by gender disparities and limited community engagement.\nWomen empowerment\n\nStudies have shown that when women are involved in local governance, policy areas such as education, health, and child welfare often improve. Women leaders in local bodies have been instrumental in initiating and implementing policies that benefit children, families, and the underprivileged.\n\nArticle 243D (3) of the amended Constitution guarantees women\u2019s involvement in Panchayati Raj Institutions by stipulating a minimum one-third reservation for women in both the total seats filled by direct election and the positions of Panchayat Chairpersons.\nFurthermore, the positions of Chairpersons within the Panchayats, whether at the village level or any other tier, are to be reserved for SCs, STs, and women in a manner determined by the State Legislature.\nIt is mandated that no less than one-third of all Chairperson positions at each Panchayat level must be reserved for women.\nConclusion\n\nThe Finances of Panchayati Raj institutions are critical to providing local governance and stepping up rural development in India.\n\nNumerous challenges \u2013 inadequate financial resources; heavy reliance on grants from upper tiers of government; under-provision of basic human resources; and weak infrastructure \u2013 impede their optimal functioning.\n\nPanchayats can leverage upon digital tools for a more people-centric administration, communication, and data management to boost efficiency.\n\nEffectively addressing these challenges necessitates committed efforts from policymakers, local leaders, and citizens to fortify the functioning of Panchayats and expand inclusive and sustainable grassroots development.\n\n-Article by Swathi Satish"

            "[CONTENT]": "Fiscal federalism in India represents the financial relations between units of government in the Indian federal system. The Constitution of India establishes a dual polity consisting of the Union at the center and the states at the periphery, each endowed with sovereign powers to be exercised in the field assigned to them respectively by the Constitution. Read here to learn more.\n\nThe Union government has been cutting back on financial transfers to States ever since the commencement of the Fourteenth Finance Commission award term (2015-16).\n\nThis is especially odd considering that the suggestion of the Fourteenth Finance Commission, which is a clear 10 percentage points higher than that of the Thirteenth Finance Commission, was to transfer 42% of Union tax income to the States.\n\nExcept for the devolution to Jammu and Kashmir (J&K) and Ladakh, which were reclassified as Union Territories, the Fifteenth Finance Commission kept its 41% proposal. It should be 42% if the contributions of J&K and Ladakh are taken into account. To raise its discretionary spending, the Union administration boosted overall revenue while simultaneously decreasing budgetary transfers to the States.\n\nSince the Union government\u2019s discretionary spending is not going via the state budgets, it may have varying effects on the various states.\n\nTable of Contents\n\nFiscal federalism in India\nCentralization of Fiscal federalism\nChallenges\nConclusion\nFiscal federalism in India\n\nFiscal federalism in India is designed to ensure the division of fiscal responsibilities and revenue sources between the central and state governments, enabling both to perform their functions effectively.\n\n\ud83d\udc49 Which year are YOU targeting for success in the IAS/IPS/IFS Exam? \ud83d\ude80\n\n(1) \u21d2 UPSC 2025: Prelims cum Mains\n\n(2) \u21d2 UPSC 2026: Prelims cum Mains\n\n(3) \u21d2 UPSC 2027 Prelims cum Mains\n\nTip: Know more about ClearIAS Courses (Online/Offline)\n\nThis framework encompasses mechanisms for revenue collection, allocation, and expenditure responsibilities, aiming to achieve economic efficiency, equity, and macroeconomic stability.\n\nDivision of Powers and Responsibilities: The Constitution divides the legislative, administrative, and fiscal powers between the Centre and the States. List I (Union List), List II (State List), and List III (Concurrent List) in the Seventh Schedule of the Indian Constitution delineate these divisions.\nRevenue Sources: Taxes are divided between the central and state governments. While the Centre has the authority to levy taxes such as income tax (except on agricultural income), customs duties, and central excise (outside GST), states have the power to collect taxes on sales (within GST), state excise on liquor, stamps on property transactions, and agricultural income.\nGoods and Services Tax (GST): Introduced in July 2017, GST represents a significant step towards a unified national market, eliminating a cascading tax system and integrating state economies. GST is administered through the GST Council, where both the Centre and the States have representation, showcasing cooperative federalism.\nFinancial Distribution Mechanisms: The Constitution provides for the distribution of financial resources between the Centre and states through mechanisms like the Finance Commission, which makes recommendations on the distribution of the union taxes to the states, principles governing grants-in-aid to states, and measures needed to augment the Consolidated Fund of a State to supplement the resources of the Panchayats and Municipalities.\nPlanning and Development: Though the Planning Commission has been replaced by the NITI Aayog, the latter plays a crucial role in fostering cooperative federalism through a bottom-up approach to planning and development, focusing on the involvement of States in the economic policy-making process.\nBorrowings: Both the Centre and the States can borrow within the limits set by the Fiscal Responsibility and Budget Management (FRBM) Act, aimed at maintaining fiscal discipline. The Centre can make loans to the States or give guarantees on their behalf, with conditions for borrowing being laid down by the Centre.\nGrants and Loans: The Central Government provides grants and loans to States for various purposes, including disaster relief, and development projects, and to compensate for a reduction in revenue due to policy implementations like GST.\nCentralization of Fiscal federalism\n\nThe Finance Commissions recommend a state portion of the Union government\u2019s net tax revenue.\n\nThe tax money to be allocated to Union territories, collection expenses, cess, and surcharges are all included in the difference between the gross and net tax revenue.\nThe proportion of gross tax income was only 35% in 2015-16 and 30% in 2023-24, even though the Fourteenth and Fifteenth Finance Commissions proposed that the States receive 42% and 41%, respectively, of the net tax revenue (Budget Estimate).\nThe States\u2019 portion of Union tax revenue climbed from \u20b95.1 lakh crore to \u20b910.2 lakh crore over these two years, even though the Union government\u2019s gross tax collection increased from \u20b914.6 lakh crore in 2015-16 to \u20b933.6 lakh crore in 2023-24.\nThe rants-in-aid to States declined in absolute amount from Rs 1.95 lakh crore in 2015-16 to Rs 1.65 lakh crore in 2023-24.\n\nCess and surcharge\n\nThe fact that the net tax income is calculated after subtracting the money collected under the cess and surcharge, the revenue collected from the Union Territories, and the expense of tax administration is one of the reasons why the States\u2019 share of gross revenue decreased during this time.\n\nDirect financial transfers\n\nThere are two more avenues by which the Union government can directly transfer funds to the States: Central Sector Schemes (CS) and Centrally Sponsored Schemes (CSS).\n\nThrough CSS, wherein the Union government provides half the money and the States are responsible for the remaining portion, the government affects the priorities of the States.\nPut another way, it suggests the plans, and the States carry them out while contributing financial resources.\nThe allocation for CSS grew via 59 CSS from Rs 2.04 lakh crore to Rs 4.76 lakh crore between 2015-16 and 2023-24.\nOne significant feature of CSS shared schemes is the availability of matching grants to States able to provide matching funds from their state budgets. Regarding interstate equality in public budgets, this has two distinct impacts.\nChallenges\nVertical Imbalance: The division of fiscal powers often leads to a mismatch between the revenue-generating capacities of the states and their expenditure responsibilities, leading to vertical imbalances that require intergovernmental transfers to correct.\nHorizontal Imbalance: Differences in fiscal capacities and needs among states necessitate mechanisms for redistributing resources to ensure equity and balanced development across regions.\nGST Implementation Issues: While GST has streamlined tax administration and broadened the tax base, it has also faced challenges related to revenue allocation, compliance, and technological glitches.\nFiscal Autonomy vs. Central Oversight: Balancing fiscal autonomy for states with the need for central oversight to maintain macroeconomic stability remains a delicate task.\nConclusion\n\nFiscal federalism in India is a dynamic and evolving system, reflecting the country\u2019s socio-economic diversity and political complexities. While it has facilitated economic unity and contributed to the nation\u2019s development, ongoing reforms, and adjustments are necessary to address emerging challenges, promote state equity, and ensure efficient and effective governance at all levels.\n\nRelated articles:\n\nCentre-state relations\nIndian federalism\nIssues and challenges pertaining to the federal structure\nStates Borrowing Power\n\n-Article by Swathi Satish"

These rivers in the sky are responsible for transporting large amounts of moisture over long distances. When atmospheric rivers make landfall, they can bring heavy rainfall and contribute to significant weather events, including storms, floods, and snowstorms. Read here to learn more.\n\nCalifornia is presently dealing with an atmospheric river (AR), a remarkable meteorological phenomenon that might dump up to 8 trillion gallons of rain on the state.\n\nThis surge is the result of a second Pineapple Express weather system that passed over California in less than a week, bringing hurricane-force winds and a lot of rain.\n\nThe term \u201cPineapple Express\u201d is sometimes used to refer to atmospheric rivers that originate near Hawaii and travel eastwards towards the west coast of North America.\n\nTable of Contents\n\nAtmospheric River (AR)\nCharacteristics of Atmospheric Rivers\nImpact of ARs\nMechanism of ARs\nHow is global warming affecting atmospheric rivers?\nConclusion\nAtmospheric River (AR)\n\nSubscribe to the ClearIAS YouTube Channel for more informative videos on UPSC preparation, tips, and strategies.

Conversely, their absence can contribute to drought conditions.\nMonitoring and forecasting ARs are crucial for predicting and preparing for extreme weather events, helping mitigate potential damages.\nThe variability in precipitation brought by ARs can impact hydropower generation in regions that rely on rivers for energy production.\nMechanism of ARs\n\nNot all ARs cause damage; most are weak systems that often provide beneficial rain or snow that is crucial to the water supply.\n\nARs are a key feature in the global water cycle and are closely tied to both water supply and flood risks, particularly in the western United States.\n\nARs occur all over the world, most commonly in the mid-latitudes.\nThey form when large-scale weather patterns align to create narrow channels, or filaments, of intense moisture transport.\nThese start over warm water, typically tropical oceans, and are guided toward the coast by low-level jet streams ahead of cold fronts of extratropical cyclones.\n\nThe cause of AR families is an active area of research.\n\nCompared with single atmospheric river events, AR families tend to be associated with lower atmospheric pressure heights across the North Pacific, higher pressure heights over the subtropics, a stronger and more zonally elongated jet stream, and warmer tropical air temperatures.\nLarge-scale weather patterns and climate phenomena such as the Madden-Julian Oscillation, also play an important role in the generation of AR families.\nHow is global warming affecting atmospheric rivers?\n\nGlobal warming is influencing ARs in several ways, contributing to changes in their frequency, intensity, and behavior.\n\nThe impact of global warming on atmospheric rivers is a complex interaction that involves changes in temperature, atmospheric circulation patterns, and the hydrological cycle.\n\nIncreased Water Vapor Content: Global warming leads to higher sea surface temperatures, increasing evaporation rates. This, in turn, results in a greater amount of water vapor in the atmosphere, providing more moisture for ARs to transport.\nChanges in Atmospheric Circulation: Warming of the Earth\u2019s surface alters atmospheric circulation patterns. Changes in temperature gradients and atmospheric pressure can influence the positioning and intensity of the jet stream, which plays a crucial role in the formation and movement of atmospheric rivers.\nAmplification of Extreme Events: Global warming contributes to the intensification of extreme weather events, including heavy precipitation associated with atmospheric rivers. Warmer air can hold more moisture, leading to more intense rainfall or snowfall when atmospheric rivers make landfall.\nShifts in Timing and Location: There is evidence suggesting shifts in the timing, location, and frequency of atmospheric rivers due to global warming. Changes in the atmospheric circulation patterns may alter the typical pathways of these rivers.\nImpact on Snowpack: Atmospheric rivers play a crucial role in maintaining snowpack in certain regions. Changes in their behavior, including the shift from snow to rain, can affect snow accumulation and lead to alterations in water availability during the melt season.\nSea Level Rise: The warming of the Earth contributes to the melting of glaciers and ice caps, resulting in sea level rise. Higher sea levels can influence the interactions between atmospheric rivers and coastal areas, potentially exacerbating flooding.\nHydrological Cycle Changes: Global warming influences the hydrological cycle, affecting precipitation patterns and the distribution of water vapor in the atmosphere. These changes can influence the characteristics of atmospheric rivers.\nCompound Extreme Events: Global warming increases the likelihood of compound extreme events, where multiple climate-related factors interact. For example, warming temperatures, altered precipitation patterns, and changes in atmospheric circulation can combine to influence the behavior of atmospheric rivers.\n\nAlso read: Hydrologic Cycle\n\nConclusion\n\nUnderstanding and monitoring atmospheric rivers are essential for weather forecasting, disaster preparedness, and water resource management. Advances in technology and atmospheric science have improved the ability to predict and track these phenomena, providing valuable information for mitigating the impacts of extreme weather events.\n\n-Article by Swathi Satish"

            "[CONTENT]": "The interim budget 2024 has been presented by the finance minister. It lays out the government\u2019s spending plans for the first half of the upcoming fiscal year. This article delves into the key highlights of the interim budget 2024.\n\nFM Nirmala Sitharaman presented the Interim Budget 2024 in the Lok Sabha after approval from the Union Cabinet earlier.\n\nThe key highlights of the interim budget 2024 include no tax revisions, affordable houses, upgrading maternal and child care, free electricity, Atmanirbharta in agriculture and other sectors, fast fast-tracking infrastructure to list a few.\n\nTable of Contents\n\nWhat is an Interim Budget?\nInterim Budget 2024: Key highlights\nConclusion\nWhat is an Interim Budget?\n\nAn interim budget is essentially a temporary financial statement presented by the government. It is typically introduced in a year when general elections are scheduled, and a new government is expected to take power.\n\nThe main purpose of the interim budget is to allow the government to continue its operations and meet its financial obligations until the new government is formed and presents the full budget.\n\n\ud83d\udc49 Which year are YOU targeting for success in the IAS/IPS/IFS Exam? \ud83d\ude80\n\n(1) \u21d2 UPSC 2025: Prelims cum Mains\n\n(2) \u21d2 UPSC 2026: Prelims cum Mains\n\n(3) \u21d2 UPSC 2027 Prelims cum Mains\n\nTip: Know more about ClearIAS Courses (Online/Offline)\n\nThe interim budget covers the government\u2019s expenditures and receipts for a part of the fiscal year.\n\nKey Characteristics of an Interim Budget:\n\nDuration: Unlike the full annual budget, which outlines financial plans for the entire fiscal year, the interim budget usually covers a shorter period\u2014often a few months until the new government is in place.\nExpenditure Approval: It seeks the Parliament\u2019s approval for incurring expenses and withdrawing funds from the Consolidated Fund of India for the ongoing operations of the government until the full budget is passed.\nLimited Announcements: The interim budget generally avoids making any major policy announcements or introducing new schemes. It is more about maintaining continuity in government spending and operations.\nVote on Account: The primary component of an interim budget is the \u201cvote on account,\u201d which seeks approval for essential government spending, including salaries, administrative expenses, and ongoing project expenditures, without a detailed discussion on each demand.\nRevenue and Expenditure Estimates: It provides an overview of the government\u2019s revenue and expenditure for the part of the fiscal year. However, it might not include detailed economic projections or tax proposals, which are typically reserved for the full budget.\nPolitical Considerations: Given its timing before elections, the interim budget is often scrutinized for any measures that could influence voters, though traditionally it is expected to be a neutral financial statement.\n\nImportance:\n\nContinuity of Government Operations: It ensures that the government has the legal authority to spend funds and keep its operations running smoothly, avoiding any disruptions in public services.\nTransition to New Government: It allows the incoming government to have a say in the financial plans for the majority of the fiscal year, enabling them to implement their policies and priorities through a full budget.\nEconomic Stability: By ensuring that government expenditures and operations continue unhindered, the interim budget plays a role in maintaining economic stability.\nInterim Budget 2024: Key highlights\n\nThe Finance Minister confirmed the continuation of existing tax rates, covering direct, and indirect taxes, and export duties. The budget introduced a housing scheme for the deserving middle class, focusing on those living in rented houses, slums, chawls, or unauthorized colonies.\n\nAmid various announcements benefiting youth, the impoverished, women, and farmers, the FM highlighted the extension of Ayushman Bharat healthcare coverage to all ASHA and Anganwadi workers and helpers.\n\nThis year, the total allocation under the gender budget stands at\u00a0\u20b9three lakh crore, which is almost 6.5% of the total expenditure. This is an increase of almost 40% over the gender budget for the previous year and the highest increase in the last decade.\n\nTaxation, GDP, FDI, Expenditure\n\nThere are no changes in direct, or indirect tax rates\nThe government withdrew income tax demands up to \u20b925,000 (till 2009-10) and \u20b910,000 from 2010-11 to 2014-15.

But the western black rhino and northern white rhinos have recently become extinct in the wild.\n\nSpecies of Rhinos\n\nRhinoceroses, commonly known as rhinos, are large herbivorous mammals known for their distinctive horns.

Reintroducing rhinos to historical ranges where populations have declined.\nCommunity Engagement: Involving local communities in conservation efforts to ensure their support and active participation in protecting rhinos and their habitats.\nTechnology-Based Solutions: Implementing technology, such as GPS tracking devices and drones, to monitor rhino populations and detect potential threats.\nHabitat Protection and Management: Establishing and maintaining protected areas to safeguard rhino habitats and ensure sufficient food and water resources.\nInternational Collaboration: Collaborating with international organizations, governments, and non-profits to share expertise, funding, and resources for rhino conservation.\nLegislation and Legal Protections: Implementing and enforcing strict laws against poaching, illegal trade, and habitat destruction. Advocating for policy changes to enhance legal protections for rhinos.\nScientific Research: Researching rhino behavior, genetics, and health to inform conservation strategies and breeding programs.\nCaptive Breeding Programs: Establishing and maintaining captive breeding programs to increase rhino populations and genetic diversity.\nDemand Reduction: Implementing campaigns to reduce the demand for rhino horns by raising awareness about the ecological impact and the cruelty involved in the illegal trade.\nRhino Horn Devaluation: Investigating and promoting the infusion of rhino horns with non-lethal substances, rendering them undesirable for illegal trade.\nSurrogacy for revival of northern white rhinos\n\nWith the loss of the last male northern white rhino in 2018, surrogacy became the only practical means of reviving the species.\n\nIt was discovered that Najin and Fatu, the two surviving females, were pathologically incapable of reproducing.\nThe only viable option left for the Northern White Rhino is to employ frozen male and female reproductive cells to generate embryos in a lab, and then transfer those embryos into genetically related and more common southern white rhino surrogate moms.\n\nConcerns of IVF:\n\nThe procedure limits the gene pool for a viable northern white population by using the sperm and eggs of two deceased guys to create the embryos.\nThe special characteristics of the northern white rhino, which are specialized for marshy environments, would be lost by crossbreeding with southern white rhinos, so this is not a viable solution.\nEven in cases where IVF and surrogacy are effective, genetic diversity is still a worry.\nIVF babies are not genetically predisposed to display the usual characteristics of northern white rhinos.\nThe maintenance of features distinctive to the species depends on early interaction and learning from northern white adults.\nThe urgency stems from the ages of Najin (35), and Fatu (24), the two surviving north white females.\nIn the news\n\nSouth African scientists make rhino horns radioactive to curb poaching\n\nThe Rhisotope Project is an innovative conservation initiative aimed at protecting rhinoceroses from poaching by using radioactive isotopes. The project leverages cutting-edge technology and scientific research to address the critical issue of rhino horn poaching, which poses a significant threat to rhino populations worldwide.\n\nOBJECTIVES:\nDeterrence of Poaching: The primary objective is to make rhino horns undesirable to poachers and traders by incorporating a radioactive isotope into the horn.\nConservation: Protect endangered rhino species and help stabilize and increase their populations.\nResearch and Development: Advance the scientific understanding of using radioactive isotopes for wildlife protection.\nConclusion\n\nDespite these efforts, rhino conservation faces ongoing challenges, including poaching, habitat loss, and geopolitical issues. The collaborative and sustained commitment of governments, conservation organizations, local communities, and the public remains crucial for the survival of these magnificent creatures.\n\nRelated articles:\n\nIndian Rhino Vision 2020\nWildlife conservation projects\nCritically endangered animal species\n\n\u00ad-Article by Swathi Satish"

Read further to know more.\n\n\nSpecial Courts in India are judicial bodies set up to expedite the legal process for specific types of cases, often involving complex or high-profile issues.\n\nThese courts are established under various laws and statutes, and they operate alongside the regular judicial system. Their primary objective is to ensure swift justice and to handle cases that require specialized knowledge or handling due to their nature.\n\nBetween 1950 and 2015, more than 25 special courts were established thanks to various Central and State laws.\n\nTable of Contents\n\nSpecial \u00a0Courts\nImportance of Special Courts in India\nFast Track Courts\nVarious special courts in India\nCourts for the 2013 Company Act\nCourts for MPs and MLA\nCourts for POCSO\nFamily courts\nCBI Courts\nNational Company Law Tribunal (NCLT) and Appellate Tribunal (NCLAT)\nDebt Recovery Tribunals (DRTs) and Appellate Tribunals (DRATs)\nSpecial Courts for Terrorist and Disruptive Activities\nNational Green Tribunal (NGT)\nSpecial Courts for Money Laundering Cases\nSpecial Courts for Scheduled Castes and Tribes (Prevention of Atrocities) Act\nMajor Challenges for Special Courts in India\nWay Forward\nConclusion\nSpecial \u00a0Courts\n\nSubscribe to the ClearIAS YouTube Channel for more informative videos on UPSC preparation, tips, and strategies. Stay updated with our latest content and enhance your exam readiness.\n\nSpecial Courts were designed to resolve matters that had been open for a while swiftly. The State governments have the same authority to name qualified judicial personnel to such Courts, in cooperation with High Courts, much like statutes that require such courts to hear specific offences.\n\n\ud83d\udc49 Which year are YOU targeting for success in the IAS/IPS/IFS Exam? \ud83d\ude80\n\n(1) \u21d2 UPSC 2025: Prelims cum Mains\n\n(2) \u21d2 UPSC 2026: Prelims cum Mains\n\n(3) \u21d2 UPSC 2027 Prelims cum Mains\n\nTip: Know more about ClearIAS Courses (Online/Offline)\n\nIn addition, the Constitution\u2019s Article 142 allows the Supreme Court to order the creation of such a judiciary system.\n\nIn its order dated November 1, 2017, the Supreme Court of India ordered the Union Government to develop a plan for the establishment of courts that would be solely responsible for handling criminal cases involving political figures, similar to the Fast Track Courts (FTCs) that the Central Government established for a five-year initial term and later extended.\nThese courts are such courts that, despite being \u201cJudicial\u201d institutions, aren\u2019t part of the hierarchy of the nation\u2019s normal judicial courts.\nThey are founded independently by separate statutes and differ from conventional courts in that they only deal with the one area of law for which they were intended, as opposed to several areas within a small geographic jurisdiction.\n\nThey were established by a specific statute to address issues about only the legal disciplines covered by that statute.\n\nThe CBI Court is one such judiciary system that has gained attention since June 2022. The Delhi Special Police Establishment Act of 1946 established the CBI courts, which are dedicated to handling matters brought before them by the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI).\nThe Family Courts, which were established by Section 3 of the Family Courts Act, 1984, are another example of such in India. These courts deal specifically with issues related to marriage, divorce, conjugal rights, maintenance, and the determination of someone\u2019s validity, among other things.\nImportance of Special Courts in India\nLawmakers with clean backgrounds are better able to enact effective legislation and give better government than those with murky pasts.\nThe criminalization of politics, which is one of the largest threats to democracy and law and order, can be ended by a swift trial of accused politicians.\nConviction of legislators might boost public confidence in the judiciary system, which is frequently viewed as being helpless in the face of powerful people who win elections despite being accused of horrific crimes.\nAs more lawmakers are elected who can effectively represent public interests and work on development, public confidence in democracy will rise.\nThe Prevention of Corruption Act accuses a large number of parliamentarians, and their conviction can deter corruption.\nMakes elections fair and free while reducing the criminalization of politics and corrupt politicians\u2019 use of force and money.\nRule of law will increase as more legislators with clean records become legislation makers.\nTo keep their attacker at a distance, victims of domestic abuse can ask the family court for protection orders.\nTo ensure a swift trial, the POCSO Act of 2012 calls for the creation of Special Courts.\nFast Track Courts\n\nMost recently, in 2019, the government approved a plan to establish 1,023 fast-track special courts (FTSCs) around the nation for the quick resolution of pending rape cases under the Indian Penal Code (IPC) and offences under the POCSO Act.\n\nIn order to handle just these matters, the SC further ordered in July 2019 that a centrally funded court be established in each district where more than 100 FIRs have been registered under the POCSO Act.\nFTSCs are intended to ensure the prompt delivery of justice.\nThey hold trials quickly and have a higher clearing rate than conventional courts.\nAlso, it improves the system for deterring sexual offenders.\n\nThe 11th Finance Commission\u2019s proposals led to the creation of fast-track courts. To clear the backlog of cases, the 11th FC recommended the establishment of 1,734 such courts. In the instance of these courts, they were implemented by an executive plan as opposed to a legislative enactment. Also, these are intended to be established by the State governments after consulting with the relevant high courts.\n\nVarious special courts in India\n\nNowadays, the nation has more than 25 Special Courts that were established by various statutes. Below, a handful of them is discussed along with their effects:\n\nCourts for the 2013 Company Act\nThese judiciary systems, which were established under Section 435 of the act, have the authority to try every offence listed there.\nThe High Court in question may hear appeals from this court.\nIt is made up of a single Judge who is selected by the Central Government with the approval of the Chief Justice of the HC, whose district the proposed judge will be serving.\nSince the outset, business conflicts have been a major issue, and the creation of these Courts has proven to be a turning point for the judiciary by greatly relieving the heavy caseload associated with them.\nCourts for MPs and MLA\nTo expedite the lengthy pending trials of legislators, the SC ordered that special courts be established across the nation in 2017.\nFollowing this, 12 specialized judiciary systems were established across 11 States with the exclusive purpose of trying current MPs and MLAs.\nIf these Extraordinary judiciary systems deprive the accused of their right to an appeal rung, the Supreme Court will look into it. Some of these cases can be tried by magistrates, according to the argument.\nIn the normal course of events, an accused person who was unsuccessful before the Magistrate could appeal the ruling to the Sessions Court.\nIn such circumstances, the Sessions Court serves as the first appellate court, the High Court as the second, and the Magistrate serves as the trial judge.\nIf an MLA or MP\u2019s case that can be heard by a magistrate is brought straight before a special court, the accused loses both the right to present their case in front of a magistrate and the right to file their first appeal with a Sessions Court.\nCourts for POCSO\nThe National Commission for the Protection of Child Rights (NCPCR), which is tasked with overseeing the application of the Protection of Children from Sexual Offenses (POCSO) Act, has been deemed by the Supreme Court to be lacking in information regarding POCSO cases across the nation.\nThe Supreme Court has ordered the Center to establish specialized courts to handle matters involving POCSO (Protection of Children from Sexual Offenses).\nIn each district across the nation where there were more than 100 instances of child abuse and sexual assault for trial under the Protection of Children from Sexual Offenses (POCSO) Act, special courts will be established as part of a central system (totally funded by the Center).\nTo handle POCSO cases, the Center would need to designate qualified, sensitive prosecutors and support staff (deals with crime against minors).\nStates are also required by the Supreme Court to make sure that the Forensic Sciences Laboratories (FSL) release test results in POCSO cases without delay.\nFamily courts\nAn exclusive court called a family court hears cases involving family connections and the law. The family court combines several other types of courts that deal with particular family issues, such as children\u2019s courts and orphans\u2019 courts.\nCompared to civil or criminal courts, family court has less stringent procedures. Intake procedures in the family court look at potential cases and weed out those that don\u2019t need judicial attention.\nSpecial statutes governing guardianship, child neglect, juvenile delinquency, paternity, support, and family offences define the types of cases that family courts can handle.\nA special procedure for family law disputes was included in the Code of Civil Procedure in a 1976 revision.\nThe new law\u2019s objectives were not met, nonetheless, as many courts handled family law issues similar to other civil proceedings.\nSeveral NGOs, women\u2019s groups, and private citizens urged the government to set up special tribunals to hasten the settlement of family-related disputes. As a result, the Family Courts Act was adopted in 1984.\nCBI Courts\nThese courts handle cases investigated by the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI), particularly those involving corruption, economic offenses, and other high-profile cases.\nLegal Basis: CBI Courts are established under the Delhi Special Police Establishment Act.\nNational Company Law Tribunal (NCLT) and Appellate Tribunal (NCLAT)\nNCLT adjudicates issues related to Indian companies, including insolvency and bankruptcy cases. NCLAT hears appeals against the decisions of NCLT.\nLegal Basis: These tribunals were established under the Companies Act, 2013.\nDebt Recovery Tribunals (DRTs) and Appellate Tribunals (DRATs)\nDRTs focus on cases involving the recovery of debts owed to banks and financial institutions. DRATs hear appeals against the orders of DRTs.\nLegal Basis: Established under the Recovery of Debts Due to Banks and Financial Institutions Act, 1993.\nSpecial Courts for Terrorist and Disruptive Activities\nThese courts specifically handle cases involving terrorist activities and acts disrupting the sovereignty and integrity of India.\nLegal Basis: Established under laws like the Terrorist and Disruptive Activities (Prevention) Act (TADA) and the Unlawful Activities (Prevention) Act (UAPA).\nNational Green Tribunal (NGT)\nNGT specializes in cases involving environmental protection and conservation of forests and other natural resources. It provides a speedy disposal of environmental cases.\nLegal Basis: Formed under the National Green Tribunal Act, 2010.\nSpecial Courts for Money Laundering Cases\nThese courts deal with cases involving money laundering and other financial crimes.\nLegal Basis: Established under the Prevention of Money Laundering Act (PMLA).\nSpecial Courts for Scheduled Castes and Tribes (Prevention of Atrocities) Act\nTo expedite cases related to atrocities against members of Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes.\nLegal Basis: These courts are established under the SC/ST (Prevention of Atrocities) Act, 1989.\nMajor Challenges for Special Courts in India\n\nSpecial courts are an important tool for dealing with the particularities of some statutes and the backlog of judicial cases.\n\nA gap exists in the study and analysis of such courts, and there is little to no evaluation of how this system functions.\nAs a result, there are no discrepancies in the operation and legislation, which are more obvious in the Parliament.\nAmbiguities \u2013 The phrase \u201cformed under the statute,\u201d which refers to the creation of a new court, is used in the Special Courts case without any ambiguity.\nYet, statutes\u2019 use of words like \u201cconstitute,\u201d \u201cproduce,\u201d \u201cdesignate,\u201d \u201cnotify,\u201d and \u201cappoint\u201d among others confuses their status.\nThe oddity is that these phrases haven\u2019t been defined or given any context about the procedure.\nMoreover, some laws indicate the government \u201cmay\u201d create special courts, while others say the government \u201cmust\u201d do so.\nAccording to the definition, the question of whether a law calls for a special court or not should only have a yes or no response.\nLeaving out possibilities like \u201cmay\u201d increases ambiguity.\n\u00a0This causes uncertainty in the administration and establishment of such courts for States and high courts.\nMoreover, appointments, financial allocation, infrastructure, and listing practices are all made unclear as a result of this.\nWay Forward\nThe SC should discuss the constitutional situation and examine any pertinent policy issues regarding its necessity and effectiveness of.\nA critical analysis of their operations is necessary.\nIt is necessary to define parameters for the frequency and quantity of effective hearings as well as for determining the number of pending cases.\nThey are crucial in preventing the establishment of an increasing number of such courts with vague goals.\nAll things considered, it\u2019s critical to assess whether or not such a\u00a0 court system is effective at clearing the backlog in cases.\nConclusion\n\nEven though Special Courts may appear to be a one-size-fits-all answer to the current issues with the Indian judiciary, they still lack an evaluation of how this system functions and need further reassessment to get to the root of its working efficacy to be more viable and practical in its operation. Even while it is urgent given the backlog of cases in our system, it is crucial to keep an eye on the public funds used for the construction and operation of special courts.\n\nAlso read: High Courts in India\n\nArticle Written By: Atheena Fathima Riyas"

            "[CONTENT]": "What are the Institutions of Eminence Scheme? What are the objectives and benefits of the scheme?\n\nThe University Grants Commission (UGC), which is responsible for maintaining the standards of higher education in India, has identified and nominated a total of 20 institutions that are deemed to be worthy of receiving the coveted tag of Institutes of Eminence (IOE).\n\nThese 20 institutions were selected based on the recommendations made by the Empowered Expert Committee (EEC), which is chaired by N Gopalaswami.\n\nThe EEC, which was formed by the UGC, was tasked with the responsibility of assessing and evaluating the applications submitted by various institutions and shortlisting the top 20 Institutions of Eminence, with 10 being public institutions and 10 being private institutions.\n\nTable of Contents\n\nWhat are the Institutions of Eminence Scheme?\nObjectives of the Scheme\nCriteria for Institutions of Eminence Tag\nBenefits of Institutions of Eminence Scheme\nChallenges\nConclusion\nWhat are the Institutions of Eminence Scheme?\n\nThe UGC (Declaration of Government Educational Institutions as Institutions of Eminence) Guidelines, 2017 were established to provide a regulatory framework that enables higher education institutions to achieve world-class status as teaching and research institutions.\n\nThe step is to improve the quality of higher education in the country and to put Indian educational institutions on the global map. These institutions are expected to become hubs of excellence in teaching, research, and innovation, and to be ranked among the top 500 in the world. The selected institutions are granted academic and administrative autonomy, as well as the freedom to set their curriculum, hire foreign faculty and students, collaborate with international institutions, and operate under flexible norms.\n\nObjectives of the Scheme\n\nThe aim and objectives of the Institutions of Eminence Scheme are:\n\n\ud83d\udc49 Which year are YOU targeting for success in the IAS/IPS/IFS Exam? \ud83d\ude80\n\n(1) \u21d2 UPSC 2025: Prelims cum Mains\n\n(2) \u21d2 UPSC 2026: Prelims cum Mains\n\n(3) \u21d2 UPSC 2027 Prelims cum Mains\n\nTip: Know more about ClearIAS Courses (Online/Offline)\n\nThe primary objectives of the university education system are to provide higher education leading to excellence and innovations in post-graduate, graduate, and research degree levels.\nThe universities aim to award degrees, diplomas, and other academic distinctions to students.\nUniversities engage in areas of specialization to make distinctive contributions to the objectives of the university education system.\nThe academic engagement is distinguishable from programs of an ordinary nature and is tuned to developing the capacity of the students and the researchers to compete in the global tertiary education marketplace.\nUniversities provide high-quality teaching and research to advance knowledge and disseminate it through various research programs undertaken in-house by a substantial number of full-time faculty and research scholars in diverse disciplines.\nSpecial attention is paid to teaching and research in unique and emerging areas of knowledge, including interdisciplinary areas, regarded as important for the strategic needs of the country.\nThe universities aim to be rated internationally for their teaching and research as a top hundred Institutions in the world over time.\nUniversities award degrees, diplomas, and other academic distinctions to students who complete their programs.\nCriteria for Institutions of Eminence Tag\n\nCriteria for Institutions of Eminence (IoE) status under the Institutions of Eminence Scheme:\n\nGlobal/National Ranking: Only institutions that have appeared in any global or national ranking are eligible for IoE status.\n\nPublic institutions are assessed based on QS-2020 world rankings. If there is a tie, QS-2019 rankings are used.\nPrivate institutions are assessed based on their ranking in the QS India or National Institution Ranking Framework (NIRF). The NIRF ranking is used as a tie-breaker.\nAny institution that did not appear in any rankings (QS-2019, QS-2020, and NIRF) is excluded completely from the IoE list.\n\nGreenfield Proposals: If there are still vacant slots after exhausting the above criterion, consideration is given to yet-to-be-established (Greenfield) proposals.\n\nGreenfield projects refer to the initiation of a project without the need to consider any prior work.\nGreenfield institutions are given 3 years to establish and operationalize the institution.\nEEC will then consider giving IoE status to such institutions.\nBenefits of Institutions of Eminence Scheme\n\nIt is important to note that UGC Inspection will not apply to Institutions of Eminence. Benefits of the scheme are:\n\nGovernment Institutions can receive up to 1000 Cr. in additional funding as Institutions of Eminence (IoE).\nIoE will have complete academic, administrative, and financial autonomy subject to general conditions and restrictions.\nAcademic collaborations with the top 500 foreign higher educational institutions are exempt from government approvals.\nFreedom to hire industry personnel as faculty and recruit up to 25% of faculty from outside India (for public institutions).\nFreedom to collaborate with other institutions within the country and have a transparent merit-based admission system.\nFreedom to admit up to 30% foreign students based on merit and charge fees without restrictions.\nFlexibility to offer courses in newer areas and interdisciplinary ones after approval and minimum standards are met.\nFreedom to fix curriculum, and syllabus, and offer online courses (up to 20% of the program).\nChallenges\n\nWhile the Institutions of Eminence (IoE) scheme is a significant step towards promoting excellence in higher education in India, there are still several challenges that need to be addressed to achieve the desired outcomes. Some of the key challenges that lie ahead for institutions under the IoE scheme are:\n\nFunding: One of the most significant challenges for institutions under the IoE scheme is funding. While these institutions have been granted greater autonomy and resources, they still need additional funding to carry out research, and infrastructure development, and to attract and retain top talent.\nFaculty Quality: Faculty quality is crucial, and this remains a challenge for institutions under the IoE scheme. Attracting and retaining top faculty is a difficult task.\nCollaboration: Collaboration with industry, other academic institutions, and international partners is vital for research and innovation. However, many IoE institutions still face challenges in building effective collaborations with stakeholders in India and abroad.\nInclusivity: While the IoE scheme aims to create world-class universities, it is essential to ensure that these institutions are accessible to all students, regardless of their socio-economic background. Ensuring inclusivity and diversity in these institutions remains a significant challenge.\nConclusion\n\nIn conclusion, the Institutions of Eminence (IoE) scheme is a significant step towards promoting excellence in higher education in India. The scheme has already helped these institutions to enhance their research capabilities, faculty quality, infrastructure, and international collaborations. The IoE scheme has also encouraged these institutions to adopt innovative approaches to teaching, research, and administration.\n\nOverall, the Institutions of Eminence scheme has been a positive step towards improving the quality of higher education in India. However, there is still a long way to go to achieve the goal of creating world-class universities in India. The government and the institutions themselves must continue to work towards this goal by investing in research, infrastructure, and human resources, and by fostering an environment of innovation and creativity.\n\nRelated article:\u00a0Education in India\n\nArticle Written By: Priti Raj"

Here\u2019s an overview of seaweed cultivation in India, its benefits, challenges, and prospects.\n\nSeaweed cultivation is an alternative for employment generation of seaweed products as it diversifies marine production and its opportunities for enhancing fish farmer income.\n\nA National Conference on Promotion of Seaweed Cultivation was organized at Koteshwar (Kori Creek), Kutch, Gujarat to implement seaweed cultivation on a Pan India basis and to emphasize the promotion of seaweed cultivation.\n\nThe pilot project of Kori Creek can be a game changer for seaweed cultivation in India.\n\nTable of Contents\n\nSeaweed\nSeaweed cultivation in India\nBenefits\nPotential climate benefits of seaweed cultivation\nChallenges\nFuture Prospects for Seaweed Cultivation\nGlobal seaweed market\nConclusion\nSeaweed\n\nSeaweeds are macroscopic algae growing in marine and shallow coastal waters and on rocky shores.\n\nSeaweeds are wonder plants of the sea, the new renewable source of food, energy, chemicals, and medicines with manifold nutritional, industrial, biomedical, agriculture, and personal care applications.\nSeaweeds are also termed the \u2018Medical Food of the 21st Century\u2019 as they are being used as laxatives, for making pharmaceutical capsules, in the treatment of goiter, and cancer, in bone-replacement therapy, and cardiovascular surgeries.\nThe major industrial applications of seaweeds are as a source of agar, agarose, and carrageenan used in laboratories, pharmaceuticals, cosmetics, cardboard, paper, paint, and processed foods.\n\nIn India, there are 46 seaweed-based industries, 21 for Agar and 25 for Alginate production, but they are not functioning up to their rated capacity, due to the short- supply of raw materials.\n\n\ud83d\udc49 Which year are YOU targeting for success in the IAS/IPS/IFS Exam? \ud83d\ude80\n\n(1) \u21d2 UPSC 2025: Prelims cum Mains\n\n(2) \u21d2 UPSC 2026: Prelims cum Mains\n\n(3) \u21d2 UPSC 2027 Prelims cum Mains\n\nTip: Know more about ClearIAS Courses (Online/Offline)\n\nRead:\u00a0Blue Food\n\nSeaweed cultivation in India\n\nIndia, with its vast coastline extending over 7,500 kilometers, offers a conducive environment for seaweed cultivation, especially along the coasts of Tamil Nadu, Gujarat, and the Andaman and Nicobar Islands.\n\nRich seaweed beds occur around Mumbai, Ratnagiri, Goa, Karwar, Varkala, Vizhinjam, and Pulicat in Tamil Nadu, Andhra Pradesh, and Chilka in Orissa.\n\nSpecies Cultivated: The commonly cultivated seaweeds in India include species like Kappaphycus alvarezii (red algae) and Sargassum (brown algae), known for their high commercial value.\n\nOut of the 844 seaweed species, India possesses around 434 species of Red Algae, 194 species of Brown Algae, and 216 species of Green Algae.\nThe Red Algae Gelidiella acerosa, Gracilaria edulis, G. crassa, G. foliifera, and G. verrucosa are farmed for manufacturing Agar, and Brown Algae Sargassum spp., Turbinaria spp., and Cystoseira trinodis for the production of alginates and liquid seaweed fertilizer.\nThe quantity of seaweed available currently is inadequate to meet the raw material requirement of Indian seaweed industries.\nSeed stock of seaweeds is traditionally collected from the sea bed in shallow waters along the southeastern coast of Tamil Nadu.\nFurther, continuous, indiscriminate, and unorganized harvesting has resulted in the depletion of natural resources.\nSeaweed cultivation is a highly remunerative activity involving simple, low-cost, low-maintenance technology with a short grow-out cycle.\n\nTraditional vs. Modern Cultivation: Seaweed cultivation in India has transitioned from traditional methods to more modern, efficient practices. This includes the use of rafts and long-line cultivation techniques, which increase yield and efficiency.\n\nBenefits\nEconomic Opportunities: Seaweed farming provides livelihood opportunities for coastal communities, especially for fishermen during lean fishing periods.\nIndustry Applications: Seaweed is used in various industries, including pharmaceuticals, food processing, cosmetics, and biofertilizers, contributing to economic diversification.\nEnvironmental Impact: Seaweed cultivation is environmentally sustainable, requiring no freshwater, land, or fertilizers. It also helps in carbon sequestration and maintaining marine biodiversity.\nNutritional Security: Seaweeds are a source of essential nutrients, vitamins, and minerals, contributing to food and nutritional security.\nPotential climate benefits of seaweed cultivation\n\nSeveral studies indicate the potential for wild seaweed forests to contribute to ocean carbon sequestration.\n\nUnder an atmospheric CO2 removal and sequestration scenario for seaweed forests, seaweeds absorb dissolved inorganic carbon in surface waters, reducing the partial pressure of aqueous (i.e., dissolved) CO2, and eventually driving the flux of CO2 from the atmosphere into the ocean.\nIt was reported that seaweed farms could significantly lower ocean surface dissolved CO2 and greater air-sea CO2 flux (i.e., increased CO2 flux into the ocean) compared to reference areas outside seaweed farms, indicating an atmospheric CO2 sink.\n\nClimate benefits could be realized from seaweed farming through the replacement of fossil fuels with seaweed biofuels.\n\nWhile the use of seaweeds for biofuels must be traded off against other potential uses, such as human food, seaweeds are considered a viable option as a third-generation biofuel feedstock given their fast growth rates and lack of need for arable land, freshwater, and fertilizer for growth.\nMoreover, seaweed biofuels are considered less toxic and produce fewer pollutants than fossil fuels.\nTechnologies considered feasible for seaweed biofuel production include anaerobic digestion for biogas, ethanol fermentation, and hydrothermal liquefaction for bio-oil, as these methods each allow for the use of wet seaweed biomass, avoiding the energy-intensive seaweed drying process.\n\nEnhancing livestock feeds with small quantities of some seaweed species can reduce the enteric methane emissions from ruminant livestock, providing a potential pathway for climate mitigation.\n\nTo summarise, seaweed commercial use pathways have been proposed for carbon sequestration and GHG emissions reduction, with varying levels of progress towards implementation. These pathways include:\n\ndisplacing carbon-intensive energy with seaweed biofuels\nreducing livestock methane emissions with seaweed feed\ndisplacing land-based crops with seaweed foods, providing ocean carbon sequestration through the intentional sinking of seaweeds\nproviding land carbon sequestration in seaweed products.\nChallenges\nLack of Awareness: There is a general lack of awareness about the benefits and methods of seaweed cultivation among potential cultivators.\nTechnology and Training: Access to modern cultivation technology and training for farmers remains limited.\nMarket Linkages: Developing robust market linkages for seaweed products, both domestically and internationally, is essential for the growth of this sector.\nPolicy and Regulatory Framework: There is a need for a comprehensive policy framework to promote seaweed cultivation, including subsidies, insurance, and quality standards.\nFuture Prospects for Seaweed Cultivation\n\nGovernment Initiatives\n\nThe Indian government, recognizing the potential of seaweed farming, has launched various initiatives and schemes to promote this sector.\n\nThe Pradhan Mantri Matsya Sampada Yojana (PMMSY) aims to enhance fish production, including seaweed cultivation.\nThe Seaweed Mission for commercial farming of seaweeds and its processing for value addition towards boosting the national economy was launched in 2021 by TIFAC.\n\nResearch and Development: Increased investment in R&D for high-yielding varieties and efficient cultivation techniques can significantly boost the industry.\n\nSustainable Practices: Emphasizing sustainable and eco-friendly cultivation practices will be crucial for long-term growth.\n\nExport Potential: There is considerable potential to expand into international markets, given the global demand for seaweed in various industries.\n\nRead:\u00a0Blue Revolution\n\nGlobal seaweed market\n\nWith its ability to sink carbon, sustain marine biodiversity, employ women, and unlock value chains, seaweed farming demonstrates how development, climate, and nature work together to generate value and uplift communities.\n\nSeaweed farming can help build a world free of poverty on a livable planet and has enormous growth potential.\nFarmed seaweeds are an important component of human diets in several Asian countries (FAO 2020).\nMost of the global farmed seaweed production is processed for direct human consumption or hydrocolloids (i.e., carrageenan, alginate, and agar) used as stabilizing, thickening, suspending, and gelling agents in food, cosmetics, and pharmaceuticals.\nWhile global seaweed production tripled from 2000 to 2018, the growth rate of the industry has slowed since 2015, largely due to a reduction in tropical seaweed production in Southeast Asia, and primarily Indonesia.\nSeaweed farming is an emerging industry in several African countries, including Kenya, Mozambique, and Namibia, with a perceived potential for expansion in these regions.\nConclusion\n\nSeaweed cultivation in India offers a promising avenue for sustainable economic development, especially for coastal communities. By addressing challenges related to technology, market access, and awareness, and leveraging government support and international demand, India can harness the full potential of this sector. With its environmental and socio-economic benefits, seaweed cultivation aligns well with India\u2019s broader goals of sustainable development and blue economy.\n\n-Article by Swathi Satish"

Here\u2019s an overview of seaweed cultivation in India, its benefits, challenges, and prospects.\n\nSeaweed cultivation is an alternative for employment generation of seaweed products as it diversifies marine production and its opportunities for enhancing fish farmer income.\n\nA National Conference on Promotion of Seaweed Cultivation was organized at Koteshwar (Kori Creek), Kutch, Gujarat to implement seaweed cultivation on a Pan India basis and to emphasize the promotion of seaweed cultivation.\n\nThe pilot project of Kori Creek can be a game changer for seaweed cultivation in India.\n\nTable of Contents\n\nSeaweed\nSeaweed cultivation in India\nBenefits\nPotential climate benefits of seaweed cultivation\nChallenges\nFuture Prospects for Seaweed Cultivation\nGlobal seaweed market\nConclusion\nSeaweed\n\nSeaweeds are macroscopic algae growing in marine and shallow coastal waters and on rocky shores.\n\nSeaweeds are wonder plants of the sea, the new renewable source of food, energy, chemicals, and medicines with manifold nutritional, industrial, biomedical, agriculture, and personal care applications.\nSeaweeds are also termed the \u2018Medical Food of the 21st Century\u2019 as they are being used as laxatives, for making pharmaceutical capsules, in the treatment of goiter, and cancer, in bone-replacement therapy, and cardiovascular surgeries.\nThe major industrial applications of seaweeds are as a source of agar, agarose, and carrageenan used in laboratories, pharmaceuticals, cosmetics, cardboard, paper, paint, and processed foods.\n\nIn India, there are 46 seaweed-based industries, 21 for Agar and 25 for Alginate production, but they are not functioning up to their rated capacity, due to the short- supply of raw materials.\n\n\ud83d\udc49 Which year are YOU targeting for success in the IAS/IPS/IFS Exam? \ud83d\ude80\n\n(1) \u21d2 UPSC 2025: Prelims cum Mains\n\n(2) \u21d2 UPSC 2026: Prelims cum Mains\n\n(3) \u21d2 UPSC 2027 Prelims cum Mains\n\nTip: Know more about ClearIAS Courses (Online/Offline)\n\nRead:\u00a0Blue Food\n\nSeaweed cultivation in India\n\nIndia, with its vast coastline extending over 7,500 kilometers, offers a conducive environment for seaweed cultivation, especially along the coasts of Tamil Nadu, Gujarat, and the Andaman and Nicobar Islands.\n\nRich seaweed beds occur around Mumbai, Ratnagiri, Goa, Karwar, Varkala, Vizhinjam, and Pulicat in Tamil Nadu, Andhra Pradesh, and Chilka in Orissa.\n\nSpecies Cultivated: The commonly cultivated seaweeds in India include species like Kappaphycus alvarezii (red algae) and Sargassum (brown algae), known for their high commercial value.\n\nOut of the 844 seaweed species, India possesses around 434 species of Red Algae, 194 species of Brown Algae, and 216 species of Green Algae.\nThe Red Algae Gelidiella acerosa, Gracilaria edulis, G. crassa, G. foliifera, and G. verrucosa are farmed for manufacturing Agar, and Brown Algae Sargassum spp., Turbinaria spp., and Cystoseira trinodis for the production of alginates and liquid seaweed fertilizer.\nThe quantity of seaweed available currently is inadequate to meet the raw material requirement of Indian seaweed industries.\nSeed stock of seaweeds is traditionally collected from the sea bed in shallow waters along the southeastern coast of Tamil Nadu.\nFurther, continuous, indiscriminate, and unorganized harvesting has resulted in the depletion of natural resources.\nSeaweed cultivation is a highly remunerative activity involving simple, low-cost, low-maintenance technology with a short grow-out cycle.\n\nTraditional vs. Modern Cultivation: Seaweed cultivation in India has transitioned from traditional methods to more modern, efficient practices. This includes the use of rafts and long-line cultivation techniques, which increase yield and efficiency.\n\nBenefits\nEconomic Opportunities: Seaweed farming provides livelihood opportunities for coastal communities, especially for fishermen during lean fishing periods.\nIndustry Applications: Seaweed is used in various industries, including pharmaceuticals, food processing, cosmetics, and biofertilizers, contributing to economic diversification.\nEnvironmental Impact: Seaweed cultivation is environmentally sustainable, requiring no freshwater, land, or fertilizers. It also helps in carbon sequestration and maintaining marine biodiversity.\nNutritional Security: Seaweeds are a source of essential nutrients, vitamins, and minerals, contributing to food and nutritional security.\nPotential climate benefits of seaweed cultivation\n\nSeveral studies indicate the potential for wild seaweed forests to contribute to ocean carbon sequestration.\n\nUnder an atmospheric CO2 removal and sequestration scenario for seaweed forests, seaweeds absorb dissolved inorganic carbon in surface waters, reducing the partial pressure of aqueous (i.e., dissolved) CO2, and eventually driving the flux of CO2 from the atmosphere into the ocean.\nIt was reported that seaweed farms could significantly lower ocean surface dissolved CO2 and greater air-sea CO2 flux (i.e., increased CO2 flux into the ocean) compared to reference areas outside seaweed farms, indicating an atmospheric CO2 sink.\n\nClimate benefits could be realized from seaweed farming through the replacement of fossil fuels with seaweed biofuels.\n\nWhile the use of seaweeds for biofuels must be traded off against other potential uses, such as human food, seaweeds are considered a viable option as a third-generation biofuel feedstock given their fast growth rates and lack of need for arable land, freshwater, and fertilizer for growth.\nMoreover, seaweed biofuels are considered less toxic and produce fewer pollutants than fossil fuels.\nTechnologies considered feasible for seaweed biofuel production include anaerobic digestion for biogas, ethanol fermentation, and hydrothermal liquefaction for bio-oil, as these methods each allow for the use of wet seaweed biomass, avoiding the energy-intensive seaweed drying process.\n\nEnhancing livestock feeds with small quantities of some seaweed species can reduce the enteric methane emissions from ruminant livestock, providing a potential pathway for climate mitigation.\n\nTo summarise, seaweed commercial use pathways have been proposed for carbon sequestration and GHG emissions reduction, with varying levels of progress towards implementation. These pathways include:\n\ndisplacing carbon-intensive energy with seaweed biofuels\nreducing livestock methane emissions with seaweed feed\ndisplacing land-based crops with seaweed foods, providing ocean carbon sequestration through the intentional sinking of seaweeds\nproviding land carbon sequestration in seaweed products.\nChallenges\nLack of Awareness: There is a general lack of awareness about the benefits and methods of seaweed cultivation among potential cultivators.\nTechnology and Training: Access to modern cultivation technology and training for farmers remains limited.\nMarket Linkages: Developing robust market linkages for seaweed products, both domestically and internationally, is essential for the growth of this sector.\nPolicy and Regulatory Framework: There is a need for a comprehensive policy framework to promote seaweed cultivation, including subsidies, insurance, and quality standards.\nFuture Prospects for Seaweed Cultivation\n\nGovernment Initiatives\n\nThe Indian government, recognizing the potential of seaweed farming, has launched various initiatives and schemes to promote this sector.\n\nThe Pradhan Mantri Matsya Sampada Yojana (PMMSY) aims to enhance fish production, including seaweed cultivation.\nThe Seaweed Mission for commercial farming of seaweeds and its processing for value addition towards boosting the national economy was launched in 2021 by TIFAC.\n\nResearch and Development: Increased investment in R&D for high-yielding varieties and efficient cultivation techniques can significantly boost the industry.\n\nSustainable Practices: Emphasizing sustainable and eco-friendly cultivation practices will be crucial for long-term growth.\n\nExport Potential: There is considerable potential to expand into international markets, given the global demand for seaweed in various industries.\n\nRead:\u00a0Blue Revolution\n\nGlobal seaweed market\n\nWith its ability to sink carbon, sustain marine biodiversity, employ women, and unlock value chains, seaweed farming demonstrates how development, climate, and nature work together to generate value and uplift communities.\n\nSeaweed farming can help build a world free of poverty on a livable planet and has enormous growth potential.\nFarmed seaweeds are an important component of human diets in several Asian countries (FAO 2020).\nMost of the global farmed seaweed production is processed for direct human consumption or hydrocolloids (i.e., carrageenan, alginate, and agar) used as stabilizing, thickening, suspending, and gelling agents in food, cosmetics, and pharmaceuticals.\nWhile global seaweed production tripled from 2000 to 2018, the growth rate of the industry has slowed since 2015, largely due to a reduction in tropical seaweed production in Southeast Asia, and primarily Indonesia.\nSeaweed farming is an emerging industry in several African countries, including Kenya, Mozambique, and Namibia, with a perceived potential for expansion in these regions.\nConclusion\n\nSeaweed cultivation in India offers a promising avenue for sustainable economic development, especially for coastal communities. By addressing challenges related to technology, market access, and awareness, and leveraging government support and international demand, India can harness the full potential of this sector. With its environmental and socio-economic benefits, seaweed cultivation aligns well with India\u2019s broader goals of sustainable development and blue economy.\n\n-Article by Swathi Satish"

A bailout can be described as a form of financial support extended to a company or a country facing a potential threat of bankruptcy.\n\nThis support can take various forms, such as loans, cash, bonds, or stock purchases, depending on the situation at hand. A bailout may or may not require reimbursement, but it often comes with greater oversight and regulations.\n\nThe International Monetary Fund (IMF) is one of the most prominent organizations that provides bailout packages to countries facing major macroeconomic problems. These risks can take many forms, but most commonly occur in the form of currency crises, such as those currently being experienced by countries like Sri Lanka and Pakistan.\n\n\ud83d\udc49 Which year are YOU targeting for success in the IAS/IPS/IFS Exam? \ud83d\ude80\n\n(1) \u21d2 UPSC 2025: Prelims cum Mains\n\n(2) \u21d2 UPSC 2026: Prelims cum Mains\n\n(3) \u21d2 UPSC 2027 Prelims cum Mains\n\nTip: Know more about ClearIAS Courses (Online/Offline)\n\nTypes of IMF Programs\nStand-By Arrangements (SBAs): Short- to medium-term programs providing financial assistance to address balance of payments problems.\nExtended Fund Facility (EFF): Longer-term programs, often associated with structural reforms, are designed to address deep-seated economic issues.\nStructural Adjustment Programs (SAPs): Comprehensive reform programs focusing on macroeconomic stabilization and structural adjustments.\nHow is an IMF Bailout Provided?\n\nThere is a procedure to provide bailouts. It always comes with certain conditions that need to be followed to get such bailouts. Details regarding the procedure are:\n\nProcedure\n\nWhen a country\u2019s economy is facing a major macroeconomic risk, such as a currency crisis, it may turn to the International Monetary Fund (IMF) for financial assistance. The IMF provides this assistance by lending money to the troubled economy, often in the form of Special Drawing Rights (SDRs).\n\nSDRs are essentially a basket of five currencies, including the U.S. dollar, the euro, the Chinese yuan, the Japanese yen, and the British pound. This lending is carried out by several lending programs, including the extended credit facility, the flexible credit line, and stand-by agreements.\n\nOnce a country receives the bailout, it can use the SDRs for various purposes depending on its circumstances. For example, they may use the funds to meet their external debt and other obligations, to purchase essential imports, or to prop up the exchange value of their currencies.\n\nConditions\n\nIn exchange for financial assistance, a country may have to agree to implement certain structural reforms as a condition to receive IMF loans. These reforms can include things like reducing government spending, increasing tax revenues, and improving the efficiency of the financial sector.\n\nWhile these conditions are seen as essential for successful lending, they have also been criticized for being too tough on the public. Additionally, some have accused the IMF of being influenced by international politics, while free-market supporters have criticized the organization for being too interventionist.\n\nAdvantages of IMF Bailouts\n\nBailouts, particularly those provided by the International Monetary Fund (IMF), can offer several advantages to countries facing economic turmoil. Here are some of the advantages of IMF bailouts:\n\nEnsuring Continued Survival: IMF bailouts can help ensure the continued survival of a country under difficult economic circumstances. These bailouts provide financial support to countries facing bankruptcy threats and help solve balance of payment (BoP) problems. This can help prevent a country from resorting to measures that can be even more harmful to national and international prosperity.\nAvoiding Collapse of Financial System: A complete collapse of the financial system can be avoided when industries that are too big to fail start to crumble. In such situations, the government or the IMF may step in to provide financial assistance and prevent a catastrophic failure of the economy.\nPreventing Insolvency of Key Institutions: Insolvency of institutions that are needed for the smooth functioning of the overall markets can be avoided with the help of IMF bailouts. This can help prevent a chain reaction of failures in the financial system.\nTechnical Assistance and Expertise: In addition to financial support, the IMF can provide technical assistance and expertise to help a country implement economic reforms and strengthen its institutions. This can help improve the long-term economic prospects of a country.\nDisadvantages of IMF Bailouts\n\nWhile IMF bailouts have several advantages, including avoiding the collapse of the financial system and insolvency of critical institutions, some disadvantages must be considered. Here are some of the disadvantages of IMF bailouts:\n\nIMF Conditions for Economic Policy Reforms: The IMF typically imposes strict conditions for countries receiving bailout funds. These conditions often require the government to implement economic policy reforms, such as reducing government spending, increasing taxes, and privatizing state-owned enterprises. Such reforms can be politically unpopular and can lead to social unrest, especially in cases where the government\u2019s policies have contributed to the economic crisis in the first place.\nDamage to Reputation: Seeking an IMF bailout can harm a country\u2019s reputation in the eyes of investors and lenders. Investors may see a country\u2019s reliance on IMF funding as a sign of instability, and this can make it more difficult for the country to access international capital markets. This can make it harder for the country to raise the funds it needs for long-term development projects.\nDependency on External Funding: Repeated IMF bailouts can create a sense of dependency on external funding and discourage countries from implementing necessary long-term reforms to address their economic problems. This can lead to a situation where countries become trapped in a cycle of crisis and dependency.\nPolitical Instability: IMF bailouts may be viewed as an admission of economic failure by a government. This can lead to political instability and even the collapse of the government. In some cases, governments have been forced to resign or have faced violent protests following the implementation of IMF conditions.\nExamples\nGreece (2010 and 2012): Greece received multiple IMF bailouts amid a sovereign debt crisis, with programs focusing on fiscal consolidation, structural reforms, and debt restructuring.\nUkraine (2014): Ukraine received financial assistance to stabilize its economy amid political and economic challenges, with conditions including fiscal reforms and anti-corruption measures.\nArgentina (2018): Argentina entered into a Stand-By Arrangement with the IMF, facing a currency crisis and high inflation. The program included fiscal consolidation and monetary policy measures.\nPakistan (2024): The International Monetary Fund\u2019s board has approved a roughly $700 million loan for Pakistan under a $3 billion bailout. The country is operating under a caretaker government and the IMF loan program,\u00a0approved in July 2023, which helped avert a sovereign debt default.\nConclusion\n\nIn conclusion, the International Monetary Fund (IMF) plays a crucial role in providing financial assistance and expertise to countries facing economic crises.\n\nWhile IMF bailouts have their advantages, such as preventing a complete collapse of the financial system and providing technical assistance for economic reforms, they also come with disadvantages such as strict conditions, harm to a country\u2019s reputation, and creating a dependency on external funding.\n\nThe recent IMF bailout plans for Sri Lanka and negotiations with Pakistan highlight the continued need for such financial support and the importance of balancing short-term relief with long-term economic reforms.\n\nArticle Written By: Priti Raj"

This article explores the production process, applications, benefits, and challenges associated with green ammonia.\n\nIndia is gearing up to establish about 5.8 million tonnes of green ammonia manufacturing capacity across various regions. This highlights the commitment to decarbonizing the economy.\n\nIndia is well on its way to becoming one of the major global manufacturers of green hydrogen and green ammonia.\n\nTable of Contents\n\nGreen ammonia\nConventional Ammonia Production\nGreen Ammonia Production Process\nApplications\nBenefits\nChallenges and Considerations\nGreen ammonia in India\nConclusion\nGreen ammonia\n\nAmmonia (NH3), primarily used in fertilizers and various industrial processes, has traditionally been produced through energy-intensive methods with substantial greenhouse gas emissions.\n\nGreen ammonia, produced using renewable energy sources, holds the promise of reducing carbon footprints and addressing climate change concerns.\n\nConventional Ammonia Production\n\nBefore delving into green ammonia, it\u2019s essential to understand the conventional Haber-Bosch process, which has been the cornerstone of ammonia production for over a century.\n\n\ud83d\udc49 Which year are YOU targeting for success in the IAS/IPS/IFS Exam? \ud83d\ude80\n\n(1) \u21d2 UPSC 2025: Prelims cum Mains\n\n(2) \u21d2 UPSC 2026: Prelims cum Mains\n\n(3) \u21d2 UPSC 2027 Prelims cum Mains\n\nTip: Know more about ClearIAS Courses (Online/Offline)\n\nThis process involves combining nitrogen (N2) from the air with hydrogen (H2) derived from natural gas, typically methane (CH4), under high pressure and temperature in the presence of a catalyst.\nWhile effective, this method is energy-intensive and contributes significantly to carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions, making it a major contributor to climate change.\nGreen Ammonia Production Process\n\nGreen ammonia, in contrast, is produced using renewable energy sources, and its production process aims to mitigate the environmental impact associated with traditional methods.\n\nThe key steps in green ammonia production include:\n\nElectrolysis for Hydrogen Production:\nGreen NH3 begins with the generation of hydrogen using renewable energy sources such as wind, solar, or hydropower.\nElectrolysis involves splitting water (H2O) into hydrogen (H2) and oxygen (O2) using an electric current. The hydrogen produced through this process is emission-free, as it avoids the use of fossil fuels.\nNitrogen Capture:\nThe second key component, nitrogen, is captured from the air using air separation technologies, often through pressure swing adsorption (PSA) or membrane separation.\nHaber-Bosch Synthesis:\nThe hydrogen and nitrogen are then combined through the traditional Haber-Bosch synthesis, resulting in the production of green NH3.\nSince the hydrogen used is derived from renewable sources, the overall process is considered environmentally sustainable.\nApplications\n\nGreen ammonia maintains the versatility of conventional ammonia and finds applications across various industries, including:\n\nFertilizer Production: The primary use of ammonia is in the production of fertilizers. Green ammonia offers a sustainable alternative to conventional ammonia-based fertilizers, aligning with the growing demand for environmentally friendly agricultural practices.\nEnergy Storage: Ammonia can be used as an energy carrier and storage solution. It has the potential to store and transport renewable energy generated from intermittent sources like wind and solar.\nHydrogen Carrier: Ammonia is considered a promising carrier for hydrogen, as it has a higher volumetric energy density than pure hydrogen and can be transported and stored more efficiently.\nFuel Production: It can be used as a clean fuel in combustion engines or fuel cells, providing an alternative to traditional fossil fuels.\nBenefits\n\nThe adoption of green ammonia brings forth several environmental, economic, and social benefits:\n\nReduced Carbon Footprint: Green ammonia production significantly reduces greenhouse gas emissions compared to traditional methods, contributing to global efforts to combat climate change.\nRenewable Energy Integration: The use of renewable energy sources for hydrogen production aligns with the transition to a more sustainable and decarbonized energy system.\nAgricultural Sustainability: Green ammonia-based fertilizers promote sustainable agriculture by minimizing the environmental impact of conventional fertilizers.\nEnergy Security: Ammonia\u2019s potential as a carrier of renewable energy contributes to enhanced energy security by providing a means to store and transport green energy.\nTechnological Innovation: The development and implementation of green ammonia technologies drive innovation and create opportunities for new business models and industries.\nChallenges and Considerations\n\nDespite its potential, the widespread adoption of green ammonia faces challenges that need to be addressed for its successful integration into various sectors:\n\nCost Competitiveness: Currently, green NH3 production is often more expensive than conventional methods. Continued technological advancements and economies of scale are necessary to improve cost competitiveness.\nInfrastructure Development: Infrastructure for the production, storage, and transportation of green ammonia needs further development to support its integration into existing energy and industrial systems.\nRegulatory Framework: Clear and supportive regulatory frameworks are crucial to encourage investments in green ammonia projects and facilitate the transition to sustainable ammonia production.\nPublic Awareness: Public awareness and acceptance are essential, as the success of green ammonia depends on societal support and understanding of its benefits.\nGreen ammonia in India\n\nWith 8% of the world\u2019s current output, India is one of the biggest ammonia manufacturers worldwide.\n\nThe majority of what is produced domestically is directly transformed into urea, which is then utilized as fertilizer.\nHowever, sizable imports of urea and ammonia are also necessary to satisfy demand.\nThe World Bank estimates that 2.4 million tonnes of ammonia were imported in 2021, placing India as the world\u2019s second-largest importer of ammonia.\nThe Middle East is the primary source of imports. This presents a huge potential for using India\u2019s renewable energy resources.\n\nThe decarbonization of domestic urea manufacturing can be challenging since both ammonia and carbon dioxide are needed as feedstocks. Nonetheless, domestically generated renewable ammonia or imported renewable ammonia can currently replace imported fossil ammonia.\n\nHydrogen and Ammonia are envisaged to be the future fuels to replace fossil fuels.\n\nProduction of these fuels by using power from renewable energy, termed green hydrogen and green ammonia, is one of the nation\u2019s major requirements for environmentally sustainable energy security.\nThe government of India is taking various measures to facilitate the transition from fossil fuel/fossil fuel-based feedstocks to green hydrogen / green ammonia.\n\nThe Ministry of New and Renewable Energy (MNRE) has laid down the incentive implementation framework for the production and supply of green ammonia at the lowest cost through a competitive selection process under Mode 2A of the Strategic Interventions for Green Hydrogen Transition (SIGHT) program.\n\nUnder the framework, direct incentives for green ammonia production and supply will be granted over three years from the commencement date.\nThe Solar Energy Corporation of India (SECI) will act as the implementing agency, providing support and carrying out various tasks assigned by MNRE.\nIts responsibilities include receiving and assessing applications, issuing acknowledgments and awards, examining incentive claims from beneficiaries, and verifying claims with prescribed documents.\nSECI will also compile data on the program\u2019s progress and performance and submit quarterly reports to MNRE.\nAs an administrative charge, SECI is eligible to receive 0.5% of the disbursed incentive amount annually.\n\nCompared to solar and wind energy, the flexibility of the ammonia plant is a key aspect of a low renewable ammonia cost.\n\nConclusion\n\nGreen ammonia represents a significant stride towards sustainability in ammonia production, with the potential to revolutionize various industries.\n\nAs the world seeks cleaner and more environmentally friendly alternatives, the development and adoption of green ammonia technologies become paramount.\n\nContinued research, investment, and collaborative efforts are essential to overcome challenges and unlock the full potential of green ammonia, contributing to a more sustainable and resilient future.\n\nRelated articles:\u00a0Green Energy partnerships of India\n\n-Article by Swathi Satish"

Seven out of ten of the world\u2019s biggest corporates have either a billionaire CEO or a billionaire as their principal shareholder.\n\nSharply increasing billionaire wealth and rising corporate and monopoly power are deeply connected.\nThe profits of mega-corporations are in turn used to benefit shareholders, at the expense of workers and ordinary people.\nCorporations drive inequality by using their power to force wages down and direct profits to the ultra-wealthy.\nIn 2022, the International Labour Organization (ILO) warned that the historic decline in real wages could increase inequality and fuel social unrest.\nCorporations and their wealthy owners also drive inequality by undertaking a sustained and highly effective war on taxation.\nPrivatization can drive and reinforce inequalities in vital public services, entrenching gaps between rich and poor, excluding and impoverishing those who cannot pay while those who can pay can access good healthcare and education.\nPrivatization can also drive inequalities based on gender, race, and caste.\nCorporate power is driving climate breakdown, in turn causing great suffering and exacerbating inequalities, including along lines of race, class, and gender.\n\nTo end extreme inequality, governments must radically redistribute the power of billionaires and corporations back to ordinary people. A more equal world is possible if governments effectively regulate and reimagine the private sector.\n\n\ud83d\udc49 Which year are YOU targeting for success in the IAS/IPS/IFS Exam? \ud83d\ude80\n\n(1) \u21d2 UPSC 2025: Prelims cum Mains\n\n(2) \u21d2 UPSC 2026: Prelims cum Mains\n\n(3) \u21d2 UPSC 2027 Prelims cum Mains\n\nTip: Know more about ClearIAS Courses (Online/Offline)\n\nWhat contributes to Corporate driven inequality?\n\nSeveral factors contribute to corporate-driven inequality:\n\nIncome Disparities: Large corporations, especially in the financial and technology sectors, are often criticized for excessive executive compensation, leading to significant income gaps between top executives and average employees.\nWealth Concentration: The concentration of ownership in major corporations can lead to the accumulation of wealth among a small group of shareholders, widening the wealth gap in society.\nTax Avoidance: Some corporations engage in tax avoidance strategies, such as shifting profits to low-tax jurisdictions, and reducing their overall tax contributions. This deprives governments of resources that could be used for social welfare programs.\nLabor Exploitation: In certain industries, corporations may exploit low-wage labor, contributing to income inequality. This is particularly evident in sectors with a high prevalence of precarious employment.\nMarket Monopolies: Corporations that engage in anti-competitive practices or monopolistic behavior can stifle competition, limit consumer choice, and concentrate economic power, contributing to inequality.\nCorporate Lobbying: Corporations with significant resources may engage in lobbying activities to influence government policies and regulations, potentially leading to preferential treatment and unequal access to opportunities.\nSupply Chain Exploitation: Global corporations may exploit low-wage labor and lax environmental regulations in developing countries, contributing to global economic disparities.\nTechnological Impact: The adoption of automation and artificial intelligence by corporations can lead to job displacement, affecting lower-skilled workers more severely and exacerbating income inequality.\nEnvironmental Injustices: Corporations, particularly in industries with high environmental impact, may contribute to environmental injustices, disproportionately affecting marginalized communities.\nPrioritizing Shareholders: Some corporations prioritize stock buybacks to increase share prices, benefiting shareholders, including executives, over investing in employee wages, benefits, or research and development.\nCorporate Influence on Education: Corporate involvement in education, such as shaping curriculum or influencing educational policies, may exacerbate educational inequalities by favoring certain skill sets aligned with corporate interests.\nCorporate Influence on Healthcare: Corporations in the pharmaceutical and healthcare industries may contribute to healthcare disparities through pricing strategies that limit access to essential medications and treatments.\nCorporate Media Influence: Concentration of media ownership in a few corporations can shape public discourse, influencing perceptions and potentially reinforcing existing social and economic hierarchies.\nWhat can be done for containment?\n\nThe richest governments have a particular responsibility, given their disproportionate influence in setting global rules and norms. The role of the Brazilian-led G20 and the efforts of Global South nations at the UN offer vital opportunities for multilateral action to tackle national and global inequality.\n\nA strong and effective state is the best bulwark against corporate power. Governments need to take a proactive role in shaping their economies for the common good. They must:\n\nGuarantee inequality-busting public services including healthcare, education, care services, and food security.\nInvest in public transport, energy, housing, and other public infrastructure.\nExplore a public monopoly or a public option in sectors that are prone to monopoly power and key to tackling extreme inequality and driving a rapid transition away from fossil fuels.\nThese could include public energy, public transport (where the infrastructure investment costs mean there can only be one efficient provider), and other sectors where there is a significant national benefit.\nImprove public institutions\u2019 transparency, accountability, and oversight (including state-owned enterprises).\nStrengthen, finance and staff regulatory capacity to enforce regulations to ensure that the private sector serves the common good.\n\nGovernments need to regulate corporations and prevent injustices across their supply chains, nationally and internationally. They must:\n\nThey must stop the monopoly over knowledge by democratizing trade and ending the abuse of patent rules (for example, by Big Pharma over medicines) that drive inequality.\nEmpower workers and communities. Corporations must pay living wages and commit to ensuring climate and gender justice: dividend payments and buybacks should be banned until this is guaranteed.\nRadically increase taxes on corporations and rich individuals. This includes a permanent wealth tax and a permanent excess profit tax.\n\nGovernments can use their power to reinvent and repurpose the private sector. They must:\n\nUse their power to create and promote a new generation of companies that do not put shareholders first \u2013 including worker and local cooperatives, social enterprises, and fair-trade businesses \u2013 owned and governed in the interest of workers, local communities, and the environment.\nProvide financial support to equitable businesses. They can also use tax and other economic instruments such as public procurement to prioritize equitable business models.\nConclusion\n\nCorporate-driven inequality is a complex and multifaceted issue with deep-rooted economic, social, and political implications.\n\nAddressing this form of inequality requires a combination of regulatory measures, corporate responsibility initiatives, and societal awareness to ensure that the benefits of economic growth are more equitably distributed across all segments of society.\n\nPolicymakers, civil society, and corporate leaders are critical in shaping a more inclusive and fair economic landscape.\n\nRelated article:\u00a0Gender pay parity\n\n-Article by Swathi Satish"

These fertilizers are designed to provide essential nutrients to plants while minimizing negative environmental impacts.\n\nReduced Environmental Pollution: Environmentally friendly fertilizers, particularly organic and natural alternatives, reduce the risk of water pollution. Traditional synthetic fertilizers can contribute to nutrient runoff, contaminating water sources. Organic fertilizers release nutrients more slowly, minimizing the impact on water quality.\nImproved Soil Health: Organic fertilizers, cover crops, and other sustainable practices help improve soil structure, moisture retention, and nutrient content. They enhance microbial activity and biodiversity in the soil, contributing to long-term soil health.\nDecreased Soil Erosion: Cover crops and organic materials, such as compost, act as natural mulch, reducing soil erosion. By preventing the loss of topsoil, environmentally friendly fertilizers help maintain soil fertility and reduce the risk of sedimentation in water bodies.\nEnhanced Nutrient Retention: Organic fertilizers release nutrients slowly, providing a sustained supply to plants. This reduces the likelihood of nutrient leaching into groundwater and minimizes nutrient losses that can contribute to environmental degradation.\nMitigated Greenhouse Gas Emissions: Organic and natural fertilizers contribute to improved soil carbon sequestration. This helps mitigate greenhouse gas emissions by promoting soil health and reducing the need for energy-intensive production processes associated with synthetic fertilizers.\nSupport for Biodiversity: Sustainable fertilization practices contribute to a more biodiverse agricultural ecosystem. By encouraging the presence of beneficial microorganisms and supporting a variety of plant species, environmentally friendly fertilizers promote ecological balance and resilience.\nReduced Dependency on Synthetic Chemicals: Environmentally friendly fertilizers reduce reliance on synthetic chemicals, minimizing the environmental impact associated with the manufacturing, transportation, and application of conventional fertilizers.\nHealthier Food Products: Plants grown with environmentally friendly fertilizers often produce crops with fewer chemical residues. This can lead to healthier food products that meet consumer preferences for organic and sustainably produced items.\nWater Conservation: Improved soil structure and moisture retention associated with sustainable fertilization practices contribute to water conservation. Efficient water use is essential for agricultural sustainability, especially in regions facing water scarcity.\nAdaptation to Climate Change: Environmentally friendly fertilizers, particularly those associated with organic and regenerative agriculture practices, contribute to climate change adaptation. These practices enhance soil resilience, reduce vulnerability to extreme weather events, and support sustainable agriculture in the face of changing climate patterns.\nCompliance with Sustainable Agriculture Standards: Using environmentally friendly fertilizers aligns with sustainable agriculture standards and certifications. This is increasingly important for farmers seeking to meet market demands for sustainably produced and environmentally conscious products.\nEconomic Benefits: While transitioning to environmentally friendly fertilizers may involve initial adjustments, the long-term benefits include improved soil fertility, reduced input costs, and increased resilience to climate-related challenges.\n\nAlso read: Nano DAP\n\nGovernment initiatives for EFFs\n\nTo reduce the use of chemical fertilizers in agriculture, the Government of India (GoI) is promoting the balanced and judicious use of fertilizers based on soil test-based recommendations in conjunction with organic fertilizers and bio-fertilizers.\n\nPM PRANAM (Programme for Restoration, Awareness, Nourishment, and Amelioration of Mother Earth) Scheme.\nDevelopment of Nano Urea and Neem Coated Urea with Pradhan Mantri Kisan Samruddhi Kendras (PMKSK) facilitating these fertilizers.\nGOBARdhan (Galvanizing Organic Bio-Agro Resources Dhan), helps in preparing organic manure.\n\nUnder organic schemes of Paramparagat Krishi Vikas Yojana (PKVY), Namami Gange, Bhartiya Prakritik Krishi Padhati (BPKP), Mission Organic Value Chain Development for North-Eastern Region (MOVCDNER), National Project on Organic Farming (NPOF), etc., farmers are assisted with the use of organic and bio-fertilizers.\n\nThe National Centre for Organic Farming (NCOF) is involved in awareness generation & training activities for the promotion of organic farming.\n\nChallenges for increasing EFF usage\n\nPromoting the usage of environmentally friendly fertilizers in India faces several challenges, ranging from agricultural practices and economic considerations to awareness and policy issues.\n\nMany farmers in India are accustomed to conventional chemical fertilizers and may be hesitant to switch to environmentally friendly alternatives due to a lack of awareness or perceived efficacy.\nEnvironmentally friendly fertilizers, such as organic or bio-based options, can sometimes be more expensive than synthetic alternatives.\nThe accessibility and distribution of these alternatives can be challenging, particularly in remote rural areas.\nFarmers may be concerned about the economic viability of using environmentally friendly fertilizers, especially if the benefits in terms of increased yields or improved soil health are not immediately apparent.\nThe domestically produced urea heavily relies on imported natural gas, the essential feedstock for production.\nThe Indian government heavily subsidizes Urea to ensure affordable prices for farmers. However, this subsidy has led to issues of overuse and inefficiencies in urea consumption.\nWay forward\n\nAddressing these challenges requires a holistic approach involving government initiatives, research and development, educational programs, and collaborations with farmers and stakeholders in the agricultural sector.\n\nUsing technology like precision farming practices should be encouraged to optimize fertilizer application based on soil and crop needs, reducing over-application and nutrient runoff.\n\nDesigning farming systems that minimize nutrient losses and environmental impact by recycling organic matter and nutrients within the system should be promoted.\n\nSlowly, Farmers and agricultural practitioners are increasingly recognizing the importance of adopting environmentally friendly fertilizers and practices to ensure sustainable and responsible farming.\n\nRelated articles:\n\nOne nation one fertilizer\nAgrochemicals\nGreen Agriculture\nZero-budget natural farming\nOrganic farming\nNano Urea\nNano DAP\n\n-Article by Swathi Satish"

These measures include guidelines on food safety, microbiological standards, and maximum residue limits for pesticides.\nAnimal Health: In animal health, SPS measures focus on preventing the introduction and spread of diseases among animals. This includes regulations on importing and exporting live animals, animal products, and by-products.\nPlant Health: For plant health, SPS measures are designed to regulate the movement of plants and plant products to prevent the introduction and spread of pests and diseases that could harm crops, forests, and ecosystems.\nHow can strengthening SPS systems help the world?\n\nClimate change is increasingly affecting ecosystems and agricultural production across the world. Extreme weather events, droughts, and rising temperatures also affect the global prevalence of pests and diseases and contribute to increased food safety risks. Plant pests are estimated to be responsible for the loss of up to 40 percent of crop production.\n\nAs climate change deeply affects agricultural yields, trade will increasingly play a key role in global food security by helping food flow predictably and smoothly to areas in need of supply.\n\nAt the same time, trade can also act as a transmitter of pests, diseases, and food safety risks to areas where they were previously unknown.\nEconomies normally protect themselves against such risks by establishing SPS systems to regulate the import of agricultural goods.\nGiven the effects of climate change increasing these challenges, it is likely that the ongoing growth in SPS measures adopted in recent years will not abate.\n\nTo protect people from new pest and disease risks linked to climate change, it is important to adopt strategies and policies that strengthen SPS systems. Direct investments towards such systems, not only to protect their own populations and agriculture sectors but to ensure agriculture exports can continue to reach markets where they are needed.\n\nThis is particularly relevant for vulnerable economies experiencing severe consequences of climate change and extreme weather events.\n\nImplementation Challenges\n\nWhile SPS measures are crucial for protecting public health and the environment, their implementation poses several challenges:\n\nTechnical Barriers: Developing and implementing SPS measures requires technical expertise and scientific knowledge. Many developing countries may face challenges in meeting these standards, leading to potential barriers to trade.\nCosts and Capacity Constraints: Complying with SPS measures often involves significant costs for infrastructure, training, and monitoring. Developing countries, in particular, may struggle with limited resources and capacity to meet these requirements.\nInformation Asymmetry: Disparities in information and communication can hinder effective cooperation and understanding between exporting and importing countries. This can lead to misunderstandings about the necessity and implications of specific SPS measures.\nImpact of SPS measures on International Trade\nTrade Facilitation: SPS measures, when implemented effectively, facilitate international trade by ensuring that products meet certain health and safety standards. This instills confidence among trading partners and consumers, promoting smoother cross-border transactions.\nMarket Access: Compliance with SPS measures is often a prerequisite for market access. Countries that fail to meet these standards may face restrictions or bans on their products, limiting their participation in global markets.\nEconomic Consequences: Non-compliance with SPS measures can have severe economic consequences, including loss of market share, decreased export revenues, and negative impacts on the livelihoods of those involved in agriculture and related industries.\nConsumer Confidence: SPS measures contribute to building and maintaining consumer confidence in the safety and quality of imported products. This is particularly important in industries like food and agriculture, where public health is a primary concern.\nFuture Directions\nHarmonization of Standards: Encouraging the harmonization of SPS standards can enhance consistency and reduce the complexity of complying with multiple sets of regulations. International organizations and forums should play a role in facilitating dialogue and agreement on common standards.\nCapacity Building: Providing support for capacity building in developing countries is essential. This includes technical assistance, training programs, and financial aid to help nations meet the necessary infrastructure and expertise requirements for effective SPS implementation.\nTransparency and Information Exchange: Improving transparency and promoting information exchange between trading partners can help reduce misunderstandings and facilitate cooperation. Effective communication about potential risks and preventive measures is key to fostering trust.\nTrade Policy Tools for Climate Action\n\nTrade Policy Tools for Climate Action, a publication by the WTO Secretariat, looks into the trade policies that governments could consider as part of their strategies for climate change mitigation and adaptation.\n\nThe publication covers ten policy areas where governments have introduced measures to support the transition to a low-carbon economy, improve the flow of climate-friendly goods and services, decarbonize supply chains, and build resilience to extreme weather events and climate change.\n\nPolicy tools:\n\nTrade facilitation\nGovernment procurement\nRegulations and certification\nServices\nImport tariffs\nSubsidies\nTrade finance\nFood and Agriculture\nSanitary and phytosanitary measures\nInternal taxation and carbon pricing\nConclusion\n\nSanitary and Phytosanitary Measures stand as a linchpin in the global trade system, balancing the need for open markets with the imperative to protect public health, animal welfare, and the environment.\n\nStriking the right balance requires international cooperation, capacity building, and a commitment to harmonized standards.\n\nAs the world becomes more interconnected, the effective implementation of SPS measures becomes not just a regulatory necessity but a shared responsibility for a safer, healthier, and more sustainable global trading environment.\n\n-Article by Swathi Satish"

It extends to 12 years depending upon the maturity of the accused.\u00a0 This may contravene recommendations of international conventions.\nThe BNS2 defines a child to mean a person below the age of 18. However, for several offences, the age threshold of the victim for offences against children is not 18.\u00a0 The threshold for the minority of the victim of for rape and gang rape is different.\n\nOverlap with special laws\n\nIn many cases, both carry different penalties or provide for different procedures.\u00a0 This may lead to multiple regulatory regimes, additional costs of compliance and possibility of levelling multiple charges.\n\nThe BNS2 overlaps with the following special laws\n\nThe Food Safety and Security Act, 2006\nThe Drugs and Cosmetics Act, 1940\nThe Bonded Labour System (Abolition) Act, 1976\nThe Juvenile Justice Act, 2015\nThe Motor Vehicles Act, 1988\nThe Bharatiya Nagarik Suraksha (Second) Sanhita, 2023\n\nThe Bharatiya Nagarik Suraksha (Second) Sanhita, 2023 (BNSS2) seeks to replace the Criminal Procedure Code, 1973 (CrPC).\n\nThe BNSS2 mandates forensic investigation for offences punishable with seven years of imprisonment or more. Forensic experts will visit crime scenes to collect forensic evidence and record the process.\nAll trials, inquiries, and proceedings may be held in electronic mode. Production of electronic communication devices, likely to contain digital evidence, will be allowed for investigation, inquiry, or trial.\nIf a proclaimed offender has absconded to evade trial and there is no immediate prospect of arresting him, the trial can be conducted and judgment pronounced in his absence.\nAlong with specimen signatures or handwriting, finger impressions, and voice samples may be collected for investigation or proceedings. Samples may be taken from a person who has not been arrested.\n\nThe BNSS2 retains most of the provisions of the CrPC.\u00a0 Key changes proposed include:\n\nDetention of undertrials: \u00a0As per the CrPC, if an accused has spent half of the maximum period of imprisonment in detention, he must be released on personal bond.\n\nThis does not apply to offences punishable by death.\nThe BNSS2 adds that this provision will also not apply to:\noffences punishable by life imprisonment, and\npersons against whom proceedings are pending in more than one offence.\n\nMedical examination: \u00a0The CrPC allows medical examination of the accused in certain cases, including rape cases.\n\nSuch examination is done by a registered medical practitioner at the request of at least a sub-inspector-level police officer.\nThe BNSS2 provides that any police officer can request such an examination.\n\nForensic investigation: \u00a0The BNSS2 mandates forensic investigation for offences punishable with at least seven years of imprisonment.\n\nIn such cases, forensic experts will visit crime scenes to collect forensic evidence and record the process on a mobile phone or any other electronic device.\nIf a state does not have a forensics facility, it shall utilise such a facility in another state.\n\nSignatures and finger impressions: \u00a0The CrPC empowers a Magistrate to order any person to provide specimen signatures or handwriting.\n\nThe BNSS2 expands this to include finger impressions and voice samples.\nIt allows these samples to be collected from a person who has not been arrested.\n\nTimelines for procedures: \u00a0The BNSS2 prescribes timelines for various procedures.\n\nIt requires medical practitioners who examine rape victims to submit their reports to the investigating officer within seven days.\nOther specified timelines include: (i) giving judgment within 30 days of completion of arguments (extendable up to 45 days), (ii) informing the victim of the progress of the investigation within 90 days, and (iii) framing of charges by a sessions court within 60 days from the first hearing on such charges.\n\nHierarchy of Courts: \u00a0The CrPC establishes a hierarchy of courts for the adjudication of criminal matters in India.\n\nThese courts include: (i)\u00a0Magistrate\u2019s Courts:\u00a0subordinate courts responsible for the trial of most criminal cases, (ii)\u00a0Sessions Courts:\u00a0presided over by a Sessions Judge and hear appeals from Magistrate\u2019s Courts, (iii)\u00a0High Courts:\u00a0have inherent jurisdiction to hear and decide criminal cases and appeals, and (iv)\u00a0Supreme Court:\u00a0hear appeals from High Courts and also exercise its original jurisdiction in certain matters.\nThe CrPC empowers the state governments to notify any city or town with a population of more than one million as a metropolitan area. \u00a0Such areas have Metropolitan Magistrates.\nThe BNSS2 removes the classification of metropolitan areas and Metropolitan Magistrates.\nIssues with BNSS2\n\nThe power of the police may be expanded\n\nThe BNSS2 amends the provisions related to detention, police custody, and the use of handcuffs, which may present some issues.\nThe BNSS2 allows up to 15 days of police custody, which can be authorized in parts during the initial 40 or 60 days of the 60- or 90-day period of judicial custody.\nThe Supreme Court has also issued various guidelines to prevent such arbitrary exercise of police powers.\n\nRights of the accused\n\nThe power to attach property from proceeds of crime does not have safeguards provided in the Prevention of Money Laundering Act.\nThe BNSS2 denies this facility to anyone facing multiple charges. As many cases involve charges under multiple sections, this may limit such bail.\nThe use of handcuffs is permitted in a range of cases including organised crime, contradicting Supreme Court directions.\n\nPrison congestion\n\nRestricting bail, and limiting the scope for plea bargaining could deter decongesting of prisons.\n\nRecommendations not incorporated\n\nRecommendations of high-level committees on changes to the CrPC such as reforms in sentencing guidelines and codifying rights of the accused have not been incorporated in the BNSS2.\nThe Bharatiya Sakshya (Second) Bill, 2023\n\nThe Bharatiya Sakshya (Second) Bill, 2023 (BSB2) replaces the Indian Evidence Act, 1872 (IEA).\n\nThe IEA provides two kinds of evidence \u2013 documentary and oral. Documentary evidence includes primary (original documents) and secondary (that prove the contents of the original).\u00a0 The BSB2 retains the distinction.\u00a0 It classifies electronic records as documents.\nUnder the IEA, electronic records are categorized as secondary evidence. The BSB2 classifies electronic records as primary evidence.\u00a0 It expands such records to include information stored in semiconductor memory or any communication devices (smartphones, laptops).\nThe BSB2 expands secondary evidence to include: (i) oral and written admissions, and (ii) the testimony of a person who has examined the document and is skilled in the examination of documents.\n\nKey changes of the BSB2 are:\n\nDocumentary evidence: \u00a0Under the IEA, a document includes writings, maps, and caricatures. \u00a0The BSB2 adds that electronic records will also be considered as documents.\n\nDocumentary evidence includes primary and secondary evidence.\nPrimary evidence includes the original document and its parts, such as electronic records and video recordings.\nSecondary evidence contains documents and oral accounts that can prove the contents of the original. The BSB2 retains this classification.\n\nOral evidence: Under the IEA, oral evidence includes statements made before Courts by witnesses about a fact under inquiry.\n\nThe BSB2 allows oral evidence to be given electronically.\nThis would permit witnesses, accused persons, and victims to testify through electronic means.\n\nAdmissibility of electronic or digital records as evidence:\u00a0Documentary evidence includes information in electronic records that have been printed or stored in optical or magnetic media produced by a computer.\n\nSuch information may have been stored or processed by a combination of computers or different computers.\nThe BSB2 provides that electronic or digital records will have the same legal effect as paper records.\nIt expands electronic records to include information stored in semiconductor memory or any communication devices (smartphones, laptops).\nThis will also include records on emails, server logs, smartphones, locational evidence, and voice mails.\n\nSecondary evidence:\u00a0 The BSB2 expands secondary evidence to include: (i) oral and written admissions, and (ii) the testimony of a person who has examined the document and is skilled to examine the documents.\n\nJoint trials:\u00a0A joint trial refers to the trial of more than one person for the same offence.\n\nThe IEA states that in a joint trial, if a confession made by one of the accused which also affects the other accused is proven, it will be treated as a confession against both.\nThe BSB2 adds an explanation to this provision. \u00a0It states that a trial of multiple persons, where an accused has absconded or has not responded to an arrest warrant, will be treated as a joint trial.\nIssues with BSB2\n\nThe admissibility of electronic records as evidence\n\nThe Supreme Court has recognized that electronic records may be tampered with. While the BSB2 provides for the admissibility of such records, there are no safeguards to prevent the tampering and contamination of such records during the investigation process.\nThe BSB2 also classifies electronic evidence as documents (which may not need certification).\u00a0 This creates a contradiction.\n\nAdmissibility of information\n\nUnder the IEA, a fact discovered due to information received from an accused in police custody may be provable. The BSB2 retains this provision.\nThe Law Commission recommended to remove this distinction.\nIn news\n\nFrom July 1, 2024, India has replaced its colonial-era criminal laws with a set of three new penal laws.\n\nThe Indian Penal Code of 1860 will be substituted by the Bharatiya Nyaya Sanhita or the BNS, the Code of Criminal Procedure of 1973 will give way to the Bharatiya Nagarik Suraksha Sanhita or the BNSS, and the Indian Evidence Act, 1872 will be replaced by the Bharatiya Sakshya Adhiniyam or the BSB.\nConclusion\n\nIndia\u2019s criminal laws have evolved over the centuries, influenced by indigenous legal traditions, foreign invasions, and the colonial legacy. The legal system continues to undergo reforms to address contemporary challenges and uphold principles of justice, equity, and human rights.\n\nRelated articles:\n\nCriminal Procedure (Identification) Act 2022\nCriminal Justice System (CJS)\nBail laws in India\nPreventive detention\nFIR\nNational Forensic Infrastructure Enhancement Scheme (NFIES)\n\n-Article by Swathi Satish"

It aims to repeal the Indian Post Office Act, of 1898, which has been in existence for 125 years. Read here to learn more.\n\nThe Rajya Sabha on December 4, 2023, passed the Post Office Bill, 2023, which seeks to replace the colonial-era Indian Post Office Act, of 1898.\n\nAccording to the government, the legislation is an attempt to ensure the effective functioning of the Postal Department as a messenger service and as a provider of banking facilities.\n\nThe bill has been facing opposition with concerns that the provision in the Bill that allows the Centre to intercept, open, or detain any postal item lacks safeguards and is centred around an \u201cambiguous definition\u201d.\n\nOther Opposition leaders also opposed the Bill for violating the right to privacy and encouraging state surveillance.\n\nTable of Contents\n\nHistory of Post Office Acts\nPost Office Bill 2023\nHow is the new Bill different from the old act?\nIssues with Post Office Bill 2023\nPost office Act 2023\nHistory of Post Office Acts\n\nThe postal system in India has a long history dating back to ancient times. During the British colonial period, the postal system was established to facilitate communication and administration. The British East India Company introduced reforms to the postal system.\n\n\ud83d\udc49 Which year are YOU targeting for success in the IAS/IPS/IFS Exam? \ud83d\ude80\n\n(1) \u21d2 UPSC 2025: Prelims cum Mains\n\n(2) \u21d2 UPSC 2026: Prelims cum Mains\n\n(3) \u21d2 UPSC 2027 Prelims cum Mains\n\nTip: Know more about ClearIAS Courses (Online/Offline)\n\nBefore the Indian Post Office Act of 1898, the British introduced the Postal Act of 1866, which aimed at unifying and regulating postal services in India.\nThe Indian Post Office Act of 1898 was a significant piece of legislation during the British colonial era. It outlined the legal framework for postal services in India.\nAnother important legislation related to the post office was the Indian Post Office Act of 1908, which amended certain provisions of the 1898 Act.\nThe Indian Post Office Act, 1898, underwent a comprehensive revision, and the Indian Post Office Act, 1978, came into existence. This legislation continued to govern postal services in India for several years.\nThe Department of Posts (DOP) Act, 1986, was enacted to provide statutory status to the Department of Posts. This act aimed at better management and organization of postal services.\n\nRead:\u00a0Postal History of India\n\nPost Office Bill 2023\n\nThe Bill replaces the Indian Post Office Act, of 1898. \u00a0The Act regulates India Post, a departmental undertaking of the central government.\n\nThe government will not have exclusive privilege over conveying letters. \u00a0Services to be provided by India Post will be prescribed under the Rules.\nThe Director General of Postal Services will be appointed to head India Post. \u00a0He will have powers to make regulations on various matters including tariffs for services and supply of postage stamps.\nThe government may intercept an article transmitted through India Post on specified grounds, including the security of the state and public order.\nIndia Post will not incur any liability concerning its services, except any liability prescribed through Rules.\nHow is the new Bill different from the old act?\n\nExclusive privileges of the central government:\u00a0\n\nThe Act provides that wherever the central government establishes posts, it will have the exclusive privilege of conveying letters by post, as well as incidental services such as receiving, collecting, sending, and delivering letters. The Bill does not provide for such privileges.\nThe Act provides for the issuance of postage stamps as per the prescribed Rules.\nThe Bill also states that India Post will have the exclusive privilege of issuing postage stamps.\n\nServices to be prescribed:\u00a0\n\nThe Act specifies the services provided by India Post to include: (i) delivery of postal articles including letters, postcards, and parcels, and (ii) money orders.\nThe Bill provides that India Post will provide services, as may be prescribed by the central government.\n\nDirector General to make regulations regarding services:\n\nThe Act, as well as the Bill, provides for the appointment of the Director General of Postal Services.\nUnder the Act, the Director General has powers to decide the time and manner of delivery of postal services.\nThe Bill provides that the Director General may make regulations regarding any activity necessary to provide postal services. He may also make regulations regarding charges for services, and supply and sale of postage stamps and postal stationery.\n\nPowers to intercept postal articles:\n\nThe Act allows interception of an article being transmitted through a post on certain grounds.\nAn interception may be carried out on the occurrence of any public emergency, or in the interest of public safety or tranquillity. Such interceptions may be carried out by the central government, state governments, or any officer specially authorized by them.\nAn intercepted shipment can be detained or disposed of by the officer in charge. The officer also has powers to open, detain, or destroy shipments carrying items prohibited under the Act or any other law.\n\nThe Bill instead provides that interception of an article being transmitted through post may be carried out on the following grounds:\n\nthe security of the state,\nfriendly relations with foreign states,\npublic order,\nemergency,\npublic safety, or\ncontravention of the provisions of the Bill or any other laws. An officer empowered by the central government through a notification may carry out interception.\n\nExamination of postal articles prohibited under law or liable for duty:\u00a0\n\nUnder the Act, an officer in charge may examine a postal article if he suspects that it contains goods which are prohibited, or are liable to be paid duty upon.\nThe Bill removes the powers of examination. It instead provides that in such cases, the central government may empower an officer of India Post to deliver the postal article to the customs authority or any other specified authority.\u00a0 The authority will then deal with the item in question.\n\nExemptions from liability:\n\nThe Act exempts the government from any liability related to the loss, misdelivery, delay, or damage to a postal article. This does not apply where the liability is undertaken by the central government in express terms. Officers are also exempt from such liability unless they have acted fraudulently or wilfully.\nThe Bill retains these exemptions. It also provides that the central government may prescribe liability about services by India Post under the Rules.\n\nRemoval of offenses and penalties:\n\nThe Act specified various offenses and penalties, all of which were removed by the Jan Vishwas (Amendment of Provisions) Act, 2023.\nFor instance, theft, misappropriation, or destruction of postal articles by an officer of the Post Office was punishable with imprisonment of up to seven years and a fine.\nSending certain prohibited items through post was punishable with imprisonment up to one year, a fine, or both.\nThe Bill does not provide for any offenses or consequences, except one. Amounts not paid by a user will be recoverable as arrears of land revenue.\nIssues with Post Office Bill 2023\nThe Bill does not specify procedural safeguards for interception of articles transmitted through India Post. \u00a0 Lack of safeguards may violate the freedom of speech and expression and the right to privacy of individuals.\nThe grounds for interception include \u2018emergency\u2019, which may be beyond reasonable restrictions under the Constitution.\nThe Bill exempts India Post from liability for lapses in postal services. \u00a0Liability may be prescribed through Rules by the central government, which also administers India Post. \u00a0This may lead to a conflict of interest.\nThe Bill does not specify any offences and penalties. \u00a0For instance, there are no consequences for the unauthorized opening of postal articles by a postal officer. \u00a0This may have adverse implications for the right to privacy of consumers.\nPost office Act 2023\n\nThe Post Office Act, 2023 received the assent of Hon\u2019ble President of India on 24th\u00a0December 2023 and was published in the Gazette of India, Extraordinary, Part II, Section 1, dated 24th\u00a0December 2023 by Ministry of Law & Justice (Legislative Department) for general information.\n\nThe Act aims to create a simple legislative framework for delivery of citizen centric services, banking services and benefits of Government schemes at the last mile.\nThe Act does away with provisions such as the exclusive privilege of collecting, processing and delivering of letters, to enhance the ease of doing business and ease of living.\nNo penal provisions have been prescribed in the Act.\nThis provides a framework for prescribing standards for addressing of the items, address identifiers and usage of postcodes.\n\n-Article by Swathi Satish"
