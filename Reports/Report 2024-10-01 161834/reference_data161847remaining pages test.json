Read further to know more.\n\nUnder our Background Digging Operation on the most highlighted economy terms in recent times, we have so far covered the following topics : (1)\u00a0Sub-prime crisis, Fiscal Cliff, and Fiscal Drag. (2)\u00a0US debt ceiling crisis and US Federal Government Shutdown.\n\nAnother important topic worth discussing and understanding is Quantitative Easing and Federal Tapering.\n\nWhile the Fiscal Cliff and US debt ceiling are fiscal issues related will government bills in US congress, Quantitative easing is a monetary policy related to the central bank, and in this case, the Federal Reserve of the United States of America.\n\nLet\u2019s straight away dive into the topics of Quantitative Easing and Federal Tapering.\n\nTable of Contents\n\nDifference between Conventional Monetary Policies and Quantitative Easing\nQuantitative Easing : Asset Purchase\nCases when lending is affected : Need for Quantitative Easing\nQuantitative Easing is Not Printing Currency!\nWhat happens during Quantitative Easing?\nProblems of Quantitative Easing\nUS Quantitative Easing (QE1, QE1 and QE3)\nFederal Tapering\nWhy many countries including India fear Federal Tapering?\nIs India ready now to face Federal Tapering?\nQuantitative Easing vs Qualitative Easing\nDifference between Conventional Monetary Policies and Quantitative Easing\n\nMonetary Policies are policies taken by the central bank \u2013 RBI in the case of India and the Federal Reserve in the case of the United States of America. What are standard or conventional monetary policies? Hope you remember about conventional monetary policies. In the case of RBI \u2013 remember REPO, Reverse REPO, CRR, SLR, Bank Rate, Base Rate, etc.\n\nNormally the central bank follows an easy money policy (low interest rates) when they need to promote growth and a tight money policy (high interest rates) when they concentrate on controlling inflation. You may also take a close look at the Open Market Operations (OMO), a conventional monetary policy action performed by the Reserve Bank of India (RBI).\n\n\ud83d\udc49 Which year are YOU targeting for success in the IAS/IPS/IFS Exam? \ud83d\ude80\n\n(1) \u21d2 UPSC 2025: Prelims cum Mains\n\n(2) \u21d2 UPSC 2026: Prelims cum Mains\n\n(3) \u21d2 UPSC 2027 Prelims cum Mains\n\nTip: Know more about ClearIAS Courses (Online/Offline)\n\nWhat happens during OMO? The Reserve Bank of India either sells or purchases\u00a0Government Securities\u00a0to/from the public. The purpose of OMO is to control liquidity or to raise cash from the public. But you may please note that during OMO, RBI deals with Government securities and not private bonds.\n\nHaving understood the basics of conventional monetary policies, now let\u2019s look at Quantitative Easing \u2013 a recent policy used by the US Federal Reserve.\n\nQuantitative Easing : Asset Purchase\n\nQuantitative Easing is mainly an asset purchase or asset swap policy. The purpose is to increase the money supply to the banks. A central bank implements quantitative easing by buying specified amounts of\u00a0financial assets from commercial banks and other private institutions, thus increasing the monetary base and lowering the yield on those financial assets.\n\nThis is distinguished from the more usual policy of buying or selling\u00a0short-term government bonds\u00a0in order to keep interbank interest rates at a specified target value.\n\nThe best definition I read about Quantitative easing (QE) is the one from Wikipedia itself: QE is an unconventional monetary policy used by central banks to stimulate the economy when standard monetary policy has become ineffective.\n\nA central bank implements quantitative easing by buying specified amounts of\u00a0financial assets from commercial banks and other private institutions, thus increasing the monetary base, so that the banks have more money to lend.\n\nYou may please note that all commercial banks work based on lending. It\u2019s the lending that runs and economy too. What if banks do not have money to lend?\n\nCases when lending is affected : Need for Quantitative Easing\nWhen interest rates have been lowered to nearly zero (because of either deflation or extremely low money demand).\nWhen a large number of non-performing or defaulted loans prevent further lending (money supply growth) by member banks.\nWhen the main systemic risk is a recession or depression.\nQuantitative Easing is Not Printing Currency!\n\nQuantitative easing has been nicknamed \u201cprinting money\u201d by some members of the media. But this idea is wrong. Printing new currency is one of the options under deficit financing, (also known as monetizing the government debt). But don\u2019t confuse it with\u00a0Quantitative Easing.\n\nAnother term associated with QE is creating new money. Though the creation of money is a better wording for the process, that too does not convey the true picture of the story. Though the central bank purchases assets from commercial banks, it normally does not involve printing new currencies. The \u2018money creation\u2019 is done using asset swaps.\n\nWhat happens during Quantitative Easing?\n\nIn layman\u2019s terms, QE corresponds to more liquid cash with commercial banks instead of bonds. The Central Banks allow the asset swap under QE so that the commercial banks will have more cash instead of bonds.\n\nThere is no difference in the net asset-liability position; i.e. the net-asset-liability position remains the same. (There will be an addition in the assets and liabilities column of the central bank; so the total-asset-liability value may increase, but the net value will remain the same). Also, there is no printing of new money. If you need an example of how Quantitative Easing works, then read the\u00a0CNBC article on QE.\n\nProblems of Quantitative Easing\nIf the money supply increases too quickly, quantitative easing can lead to higher rates of inflation.\nBanks may decide to keep funds generated by quantitative easing in reserve rather than lending those funds to individuals and businesses (failing the purpose of QE).\nDifficult to gauge how much QE is required.\nPotential to destroy the confidence in an economy.\nCentral bank can lose money.\nMay not work if not implemented aggresevily enough.\nUS Quantitative Easing (QE1, QE1 and QE3)\n\nQuantitative easing was first used by the Bank of Japan (BOJ) to fight domestic deflation in the early 2000s. Since the advent of the global financial crisis of 2007\u201308, similar policies have been used by the United States, the United Kingdom, and the Eurozone during the financial crisis of 2007\u20132012. Quantitative easing was used by these countries because their risk-free short-term nominal interest rates were either at or close to zero.\n\nThe US has done Quantitative Easing measures three times \u2013 in 2008, 2010, and 2012 \u2013 and they are known as QE1, QE2 and QE3 respectively. US Fed Reserve started buying Treasury notes and Mortgage Backed Securities and this increased the monetary base of US banks. Understand that this measure of buying Treasury notes corresponds to a position of more liabilities in the asset-liability portfolio of the Central Bank. Though not a sustainable measure, QE1, QE2, and QE3 have helped the United States to slowly recover from recession and other economic problems.\n\nFederal Tapering\n\nTapering refers to a gradual reduction in the monthly purchase of assets by the Federal Reserve. Keep in mind that tapering means the Fed will still be purchasing assets, just not as many. So Federal Tapering is the process of slowing down the rate at which Quantitative Easing is done.\n\n$85 billion in assets were being added to the Fed\u2019s balance sheet each month\u2014$45 billion in Treasuries and $40 billion in mortgage-backed securities (MBS). The first step in the Fed\u2019s exit framework was to decrease the level of asset purchases each month or taper them. After the tapering phase concludes, the Fed\u2019s next step would be to reinvest maturing securities in like securities, keeping the size of its balance sheet steady for some time.\n\nThe whole process should be quite gradual: Tapering may last for six to nine months, maintaining a steady balance sheet may persist for another six to nine months, and then the Fed may raise its target federal funds rate sometime in 2015.\n\nThe unconventional monetary policies experienced in the past several years have to be rolled back at some point. As the economy gradually regains the ability to stand on its own\u2014at least in the Fed\u2019s view\u2014the Fed will inevitably start the gradual process of removing the quantitative easing measures.\n\nWhy many countries including India fear Federal Tapering?\n\nWhat will happen to the economy after the Federal Reserve begins to slow down its current quantitative easing? Because once federal tapering happens, banks will have less free money with them to lend loans. There are chances of loans becoming costlier, and inflation going high. This can affect FDI and FII inflows to India. Hence the fear.\n\nIndia is among the markets that may be affected, at least in the short-term, as capital flows shift to the US as growth there recovers. Outflows may put more pressure on the slumping rupee. Portfolio flows are a key tool to finance India\u2019s current account deficit.\n\nIs India ready now to face Federal Tapering?\n\nYes. According to\u00a0the Finance Minister\u00a0and\u00a0RBI Governor. Tapering will be a gradual process, followed by keeping the balance sheet steady, and then eventually increasing the target rate. Though there are many claims that India is ready to face it, only time can test the strength of the Indian Economy.\n\nQuantitative Easing vs Qualitative Easing\n\nIf quantitative easing is focused on the amount of assets purchased, qualitative easing is focused on the type of assets bought. Qualitative easing is a shift in the\u00a0composition\u00a0of the assets of the central bank towards less liquid and riskier assets, holding constant the size of the balance sheet (and the official policy rate and the rest of the list of usual suspects). The less liquid and more risky assets can be private securities as well as sovereign or sovereign-guaranteed instruments. All forms of risk, including credit risk (default risk) are included.\n\nThe Fed has engaged in aggressive quantitative and qualitative easing. Federal Reserve\u2019s purchase of riskier assets such as mortgage-backed securities was crucial to reviving the stock market in 2009 and spurring economic recovery.\n\nTo sum up, qualitative easing is a government policy that is designed to mitigate risk through central bank purchases of privately held risky assets and their replacement by government debt, with a return that is guaranteed by the taxpayer. Policies of this kind have recently been carried out by national central banks, backed by implicit guarantees from national treasuries.",

Unlike a centralised database, there is no single administrator. Because the data is mirrored in nodes that store full copies of the data and the data in the blocks is included in timely order, more in the manner of an accounting journal than an accounting ledger, an alternate moniker, RJT for Replicated Journal Technology, is occasionally used.\n\nA peer-to-peer network, as well as consensus procedures, are required to ensure replication between nodes. One example of a distributed ledger design is the blockchain network, which can be open or closed.\n\nEach node (device) in a peer-to-peer network replicates and saves an exact copy of a distributed ledger database, which updates itself autonomously. The absence of central authority is the primary advantage. When a ledger update occurs, each node generates a new transaction, and the nodes then use a consensus process to determine which copy is valid.\n\nAfter the agreement is reached, all other nodes are updated to the most recent, correct version of the ledger. To ensure security, cryptographic keys and signatures are utilised.\n\nVarious Generations of Web\n\nVarious Generations of Web\u00a0 are Web 1.0, Web 2.0, Web 3.0, Web 4.0 & Web 5.0\n\nWEB 1.0 (The Read-only Web)\nThe early Internet was largely made up of web pages connected by hyperlinks.\nBecause it was a static platform with no social elements, it was labelled as a read-only network.\nFurthermore, the web user was primarily a passive observer, with the majority of user comments occurring offline.\nWeb 2.0 (The Social (Read-Write) Web)\nUsing social media discussion, a Platform 2.0 website allows users to participate and communicate with one another as makers of user-generated content in a virtual environment.\nIn contrast, the earliest wave of Web 1.0-era websites limited users to passively browse content.\nWeb 3.0 (The Semantic (Read-Write-Execute) Web)\nWeb 3.0 is a cutting-edge wave of information technology for websites and smartphones that focuses on providing a data-driven and interactive web through machine-based information processing.\nThe ultimate goal of the semantic web is to create more knowledgeable, connected, and accessible websites.\nSmart home systems that employ cellular networks and the Internet of Things are only two examples of how Web 3.0 is now affecting innovation.\nWeb 4.0 (The Mobile Web)\nThe mobile web is already under development, with no clear idea of what it will include.\nPlatform 4.0 is also known as the symbiotic web. The symbiotic web\u2019s fantasy is symbiotic contact between humans and machines.\nWeb 5.0 (The Intelligent / Emotional (Symbiotic) Web)\nThe introduction of smart devices that foresee your wants based on your habits without providing many hints foreshadows what the Intelligent Web will bring.\nSymbiotic web algorithms will be able to understand the evidence on a more complicated emotional and intellectual level.\nChallenges Related to Web 5.0\n\nVarious Challenges Related to Web 5.0 are as follows.\n\nThere are few consequences for this technology in the near future because it is still a concept in its early stages, and no one knows how it will turn out.\nHow the sovereign government would allow this decentralised platform free of government intrusion could lead to conflict between the government and Web 5.0 supporters.\nThere is still uncertainty about how the system will work, who will regulate it, and what safety scenarios exist for vulnerable people such as women, children, and the elderly.\n\u00a0The web democratised information exchange, but it lacks a critical layer identity.\n\u00a0With hundreds of accounts and passwords, we struggle to secure personal data.
