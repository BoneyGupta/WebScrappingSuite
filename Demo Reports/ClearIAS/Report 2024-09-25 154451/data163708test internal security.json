I have no doubt India will develop her scientific researches and I hope Indian scientists will use the atomic force for constructive purposes. But if India is threatened, she will inevitably try to defend herself by all means at her disposal.\n\n1940s-1950s: Early Developments\n\nIndia\u2019s interest in nuclear technology began during the colonial era, and scientific research in nuclear physics gained momentum in the 1940s.\nIndia\u2019s nuclear program started in March 1944 and its three-stage indigenous efforts in technology were established by Dr. Homi Bhabha when he founded the nuclear research center, the Institute of Fundamental Research.\nThe establishment of the Tata Institute of Fundamental Research (TIFR) and the Atomic Energy Commission (AEC) marked significant steps in India\u2019s nuclear research.\n\n1960s-1970s: Peaceful Nuclear Explosions\n\nIndia\u2019s loss of territory to China in the war of 1962, provided the New Delhi government impetus for developing nuclear weapons as a means of deterring potential Chinese aggression.\nIndia conducted its first peaceful nuclear explosion (PNE) in 1974 at the Pokhran Test Range in Rajasthan. This test, codenamed \u201cSmiling Buddha,\u201d marked India\u2019s entry into the global nuclear stage.\nThe PNE was presented as a demonstration of India\u2019s nuclear capabilities for peaceful purposes, but it had military implications.\n\n1980s: Shift towards Weaponization\n\nIn the 1980s, India\u2019s nuclear program shifted from a focus on peaceful uses of nuclear technology to military applications.\nConcerns about regional security dynamics, including China\u2019s nuclear capabilities and the proliferation of nuclear weapons, contributed to this shift.\n\n1998: Pokhran-II Tests\n\nIn May 1998, India conducted a series of nuclear tests, known as \u201cPokhran-II,\u201d (code-named \u201cOperation Shakti\u201d) at the Pokhran Test Range. Five nuclear devices were detonated.\nThese tests included both fission and thermonuclear (fusion) devices, showcasing India\u2019s ability to develop a range of nuclear weapons.\nIndia\u2019s No-First-Use Policy and Doctrine of Credible Minimum Deterrence (CMD)\n\nIn August 1999, the Indian government released a draft of the doctrine which asserts that nuclear weapons are solely for deterrence and that India will pursue a policy of \u201cretaliation only\u201d.\n\nThe document also maintains that India \u201cwill not be the first to initiate a nuclear first strike, but will respond with punitive retaliation should deterrence fail\u201d and that decisions to authorize the use of nuclear weapons would be made by the Prime Minister or his \u2018designated successor(s).\n\n\u2018 The doctrine of \u201cNo first use\u201d means \u201cno first use against non-nuclear-weapon states\u201d, as clarified by our NSA. The doctrine of \u201cno first use against non-nuclear-weapon states\u201d reflected India\u2019s strategic culture, with its emphasis on minimal deterrence.\n\nIndia\u2019s nuclear doctrine emphasizes a retaliatory strike capability and NFU. The doctrine also stresses a massive retaliation policy against any nuclear aggression.\n\nAlso read: Indian Arms Import\n\nIndia\u2019s Nuclear Weapon Programme: Main Authorities\n\nNames to remember Nuclear Command Authority (NCA), Strategic Nuclear Command, Cabinet Committee on Security, National Security Advisory Board, etc.\n\nCabinet Committee on Security (CCS)\n\nThe civil leadership, in the form of the CCS (Cabinet Committee on Security), is the only body authorized to order a nuclear strike against another offending strike: In effect, it is the Prime Minister who has his finger \u201con the button.\u201d\n\nNuclear Command Authority (NCA)\n\nOn January 4, 2003, the\u00a0Cabinet Committee on Security (CCS) constituted the Nuclear Command Authority (NCA). NCA has two councils: the Executive Council and the Political Council.\n\nThe Executive Council is chaired by the\u00a0National Security Advisor (NSA) while the Political Council is chaired by the Prime Minister.\n\nThe National Security Advisor gives the inputs to the Political Council, which authorities a nuclear attack when deemed necessary. This mechanism of the Political Council is advised by the Executive Council and letting the \u201cnuclear button remain with PM\u201d was implemented to ensure that Indian nukes\u00a0remain firmly in\u00a0civilian control\u00a0and that there exists a sophisticated\u00a0Command and Control (C2) mechanism to prevent their accidental or unauthorized use.\n\nStrategic Nuclear Command or\u00a0Strategic Forces Command\n\nStrategic Nuclear Command, forms part of India\u2019s\u00a0Nuclear Command Authority\u00a0(NCA).\u00a0India\u2019s Strategic Nuclear Command was formally established in 2003.\n\nThe Joint Services SNC is the custodian of all of India\u2019s nuclear weapons, missiles, and assets. It is also responsible for executing all aspects of India\u2019s nuclear policy.\n\nThe directives of the NCA are to be operationalized by the Strategic Forces Command\u00a0under the control of a Commander-in-Chief of the rank of\u00a0Air Marshal\u00a0(or its equivalent) in charge of the management and administration of the tactical and strategic nuclear forces. (So as it is clear, Strategic Nuclear Command is the implementing agency of the nuclear decision.)\n\nNational Security Council\u00a0(NSC) of India\n\nThe\u00a0National Security Council (NSC) of India is the apex agency looking into the country\u2019s political, economic, energy, and strategic security concerns. (Please note that the NSC has roles beyond nuclear deterrence.\n\nThe chief executive is the\u00a0National Security Adviser. Before the formation of the NSC, these activities were overseen by the Principal Secretary to the Prime Minister).\u00a0\n\nThe three-tiered structure of the NSC comprises the Strategic Policy Group, the National Security Advisory Board, and a Secretariat represented by the Joint Intelligence Committee\u00a0(JIC).\n\nAlso read: India\u2019s Defence Exports\n\nHow does Nuclear Deterrence Work in India?\n\nThe executive council of the NSA advises the political council of the NSA in case of any security threat or nuclear action needed. The political council gives orders to Strategic Nuclear Command.\n\nStrategic Nuclear Command possesses all major nuclear arsenals, and it is the agency responsible for executing a nuclear retaliation. SNC requires approval from NCA for any nuclear action. Recent estimates suggest that India has between 90 and 110 nuclear weapons.\u00a0\n\nNuclear Triad\n\nNuclear Triad is a term used to denote a nation that has the capabilities of a nuclear strike from land, air, and water. India has tested its abilities on land, air, and sea.\n\nFrom Land: Ballistic missiles with a nuclear warhead in the Prithvi and Agni Series.\nFrom Air: Nuclear bombs from\u00a0Dassault Mirage 2000s\u00a0and\u00a0SEPECAT Jaguars. (Free-falling and un-guided method).\nFrom Sea: \u00a0Submarines: Sagarika K-15 missile in Arihant Submarine; Ship: Dhanush missile from ships like INS\u00a0Subhadra or\u00a0INS Rajput.\nIndia\u2019s Nuclear Weapon programme: Current status\n\nIndia has regularly engaged in diplomatic efforts to improve its nuclear standing on the global stage.\n\nThe Indo-US Civil Nuclear Agreement in 2008 allowed for international civilian nuclear trade with India despite its status as a non-signatory of the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty (NPT).\nDeveloping anti-satellite weapon (ASAT) capabilities; successfully carried out an ASAT missile test in March 2019\nPossesses several types of operational nuclear-capable land-based ballistic missiles, SLBMS, and\u00a0cruise missiles\nSuccessfully conducted 11 missile tests in late 2020, including the new naval version of the BrahMos cruise missile and hypersonic Shaurya missile\nOn October 14, 2022, India conducted a successful test launch of a submarine-launched ballistic missile (SLBM) from an Arihant-class SSBN.\nAs of January 2023, India was estimated to have a growing stockpile of 164 nuclear weapons, a small increase from the previous year\u2019s count of 160. These weapons are assigned to a nuclear triad of aircraft, land-based missiles, and nuclear-powered ballistic missile submarines.\nConclusion\n\nIndia\u2019s nuclear weapon program has been a subject of debate and discussion both within the country and internationally. While India maintains its nuclear weapons for deterrence purposes and emphasizes its commitment to responsible nuclear behavior, questions about non-proliferation, disarmament and regional security dynamics remain important aspects of the global nuclear landscape.\n\nRead: India\u2019s nuclear future;\u00a0Mission Divyastra"

Sexting\n\nSexting is an act of sending sexually explicit digital images, videos, text messages, or emails, usually by cell phone.\n\n11. SIM Swap Scam\n\nSIM Swap Scam occurs when fraudsters manage to get a new SIM card issued against a registered mobile number fraudulently through the mobile service provider. With the help of this new SIM card, they get One Time Password (OTP) and alerts, required for making financial transactions through the victim\u2019s bank account. Getting a new SIM card against a registered mobile number fraudulently is known as SIM Swap.\n\n12. Credit Card Fraud or Debit Card Fraud\n\nCredit card (or debit card) fraud involves the unauthorized use of another\u2019s credit or debit card information for the purpose of purchases or withdrawing funds from it.\n\n13.

The victim is asked to pay the demanded ransom to get his device decrypts\n\n16. Viruses, Worms, and Trojans\n\nA computer virus is a program written to enter your computer and damage/alter your files/data and replicate itself.\n\nWorms are malicious programs that make copies of themselves again and again on the local drive, network shares, etc.\n\nA Trojan horse is not a virus. It is a destructive program that looks like a genuine application. Unlike viruses, Trojan horses do not replicate themselves but they can be just as destructive. Trojans open a backdoor entry to your computer which gives malicious users/programs access to your system, allowing confidential and personal information to be theft.\n\n17. Data Breach\n\nA data breach is an incident in which information is accessed without authorization.\n\n18. Denial of Services (DoS) attack\n\nA denial of Services (DoS) attack is an attack intended for denying access to computer resources without the permission of the owner or any other person who is in charge of a computer, computer system or computer network.\n\nA Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attack is an attempt to make an online service unavailable by overwhelming it with traffic from multiple sources.\n\n19.

            "[CONTENT]": "Almost everyone is familiar with the term computer virus, but only a few might have heard about the term malware. A computer virus is a type of malware. Malware includes computer\u00a0viruses,\u00a0worms,\u00a0Trojan horses, spyware, ransomware and many others. In this post, we analyse the different types of malware including the Wannacry, which is a form of ransomware.\n\nTable of Contents\n\nWhat is a Malware?\nEvolution of Malware\nWhat is the purpose of creating a Malware?\nList of Common Malware types:\nHow does a Malware spread?\nRecent case of Malware attack: WannaCry\nWhat is WannaCry?\nWhat is the Origin of Wannacry attack?\nWhat does it do the computer?\nHow does it spread?\nHow to remain protected from ransomware?\nSome Initiatives by Government of India:\nWhat is a Malware?\n\nMalware is the shortened form of malicious software.\nMalware is an umbrella term used to refer to a variety of forms of hostile or intrusive software including Ransom wares, Computer Viruses, Worms, Trojan Horses, Spyware, Adware, Scareware etc.\nThis is any program or file that is harmful to a computer user.\nThe term refers to software that is deployed with malicious intent.\nMalware can be deployed even remotely, and tracking the source of malware is hard.\nIt can take the form of executable code, scripts, active content, and other software.\nThese malicious programs can perform a variety of functions, including stealing, encrypting or deleting sensitive data, altering or hijacking core computing functions and monitoring users\u2019 computer activity without their permission.\nThis combination has enabled commercial malware providers to supply sophisticated black markets for both malware and the information that it collects.\nEvolution of Malware\nComputer-enabled fraud and service theft evolved in parallel with the information technology that enabled it.\nThe term malware was first used by computer scientist and security research YisraelRadai in 1990.\nBefore the term malware, malicious software was referred to as computer viruses.\nOne of the first known examples of malware was the Creeper virus in 1971, which was created as an experiment by BBN Technologies engineer Robert Thomas.\nWhat is the purpose of creating a Malware?\nInitially, it started as a prank among software developers. However, later on, malware converted into a full-fledged industry of black and white market.\nIt may be used by black hat hackers or even some governments for monitoring their targets.\nDemand for sophisticated malware is created primarily by organised crime syndicates and state-sponsored espionage agents.\n\nMalware is typically used:\n\nTo steal information that can be readily monetized, such as login credentials, credit card and bank account numbers,\nAnd intellectual property such as computer software, financial algorithms, and trade secrets.\nTo ransom money in Bitcoin, for example, Wannacry Ransomware.\nSpy on computer users for an extended period without their knowledge, for example, Reign Malware.\nIt may be designed to cause harm, often as sabotage for example Stuxnet.\nExtort payment for example Cryptolocker.\nList of Common Malware types:\n\nAdware: The least dangerous and most lucrative Malware. Adware displays ads on your computer.\nSpyware: Spyware is software that spies on you, tracking your internet activities in order to send advertising (Adware) back to your system.\nVirus: A virus is a contagious program or code that attaches itself to another piece of software, and then reproduces itself when that software is run. Most often this is spread by sharing software or files between computers.\nSpam: Spamming is a method of flooding the Internet with copies of the same message. Most spams are commercial advertisements which are sent as an unwanted email to users. Spams are also known as Electronic junk emails or junk newsgroup postings. These spam emails are very annoying as it keeps coming every day and keeps your mailbox full.\nWorm: A program that replicates itself and destroys data and files on the computer. Worms work to \u201ceat\u201d the system operating files and data files until the drive is empty.\nTrojan: A Trojan horse or Trojan is a type of malware that is often disguised as legitimate software. Trojans are written with the purpose of discovering your financial information, taking over your computer\u2019s system resources, and in larger systems creating a \u201cdenial-of-service attack\u201d which is making a machine or network resource unavailable to those attempting to reach it. Example: Google, AOL, Yahoo or your business network becoming unavailable.\nBackdoors: Backdoors are much the same as Trojans or worms, except that they open a \u201cbackdoor\u201d on a computer, providing a network connection for hackers or other Malware to enter or for viruses or SPAM to be sent.\nRootkit: This one is likened to the burglar hiding in the attic, waiting to take from you while you are not home. It is the hardest of all Malware to detect and therefore to remove; many experts recommend completely wiping your hard drive and reinstalling everything from scratch. It is designed to permit the other information gathering Malware in to get the identity information from your computer without you realising anything is going on.\nKeyloggers: Records everything you type on your PC in order to glean your log-in names, passwords, and other sensitive information, and send it on to the source of the keylogging program. Many times keyloggers are used by corporations and parents to acquire computer usage information.\nRogue security software: This one deceives or misleads users. It pretends to be a good program to remove Malware infections, but all the while it is the Malware. Often it will turn off the real Anti-Virus software.\nRansomware: If you see this screen that warns you that you have been locked out of your computer until you pay for your cybercrimes. Your system is severely infected with a form of Malware called Ransomware. Even if you pay to unlock the system, the system is unlocked, but you are not free of it locking you out again.\nBrowser Hijacker: When your homepage changes to one that looks like those in the images inserted next, you may have been infected with one form or another of a Browser Hijacker. This dangerous Malware will redirect your normal search activity and give you the results the developers want you to see. Its intention is to make money off your web surfing. Using this homepage and not removing the Malware lets the source developers capture your surfing interests.\nHow does a Malware spread?\n\nCybercriminals continuously devise innovative resources to get malware into the computer. Here are some of the most common ways of spreading:\n\nEmail: Cybercriminals are notorious for including malicious attachments and links in emails that appear to come from friends, reputable organisations, or other trusted sources. Some malicious emails can even infect your computer from the email client\u2019s preview pane, without your opening or be downloading an attachment or a link.\nThe Internet: Surfing the Web may feel like a private activity, but in fact, you\u2019re exposing your computer to unwanted contact with anyone else who has a computer and Internet access.\nOutdated software: Malwares can crawl the Internet, looking for vulnerabilities of outmoded software to spread its influence over computer systems.\nLocal Area Networks (LANs): A LAN is a group of locally connected computers that can share information over a private network. If one computer becomes infected with malware, all other computers in the LAN may quickly become infected as well.\nInstant messaging (IM) and peer-to-peer (P2P) file-sharing systems: If one is using a client for these online activities, malware may spread to your computer.\nSocial networks: Malware authors take advantage of many popular social networks, infecting the massive user-data networks with worms. If a social website account is infected with a worm, just about anyone who visits a poster\u2019s profile page could \u201ccatch\u201d the worm on her system.\nPop-ups: Some of the most sophisticated malware spreads through well-disguised screen pop-ups that look like genuine alerts or messages. One particularly devious and widespread \u201choax pop-up\u201d claims to have scanned your computer and detected malware. If you attempt to remove the malware as urged, you\u2019ll actually\u00a0install\u00a0the malware.\nComputer storage media: Malware can be easily spread if you share computer storage media with others, such as USB drives, DVDs, and CDs. While it may seem safe to open a CD of photos from a colleague, it\u2019s always best to scan unfamiliar files first for possible corruptions or security risks before you copy or open them.\nMobile devices: Mobile malware threats have become increasingly prevalent, as more people use their smartphones and tablets as mini-computers, helping malware problems proliferate across additional platforms.\nRecent case of Malware attack: WannaCry\n\nIn 2017 May, there was a massive global ransomware attack. The attack infected more than 230,000 computers in 150 countries including India, demanding ransom payments in bitcoin in 28 languages.\n\n\ud83d\udc49 Which year are YOU targeting for success in the IAS/IPS/IFS Exam? \ud83d\ude80\n\n(1) \u21d2 UPSC 2025: Prelims cum Mains\n\n(2) \u21d2 UPSC 2026: Prelims cum Mains\n\n(3) \u21d2 UPSC 2027 Prelims cum Mains\n\nTip: Know more about ClearIAS Courses (Online/Offline)\n\nWhat is WannaCry?\n\nWannaCry is Encrypting Ransomware or Crypto Locker type of ransomware that is programmed to attack Microsoft Windows software.\nAccording to some statistics, hackers extorted business and institutions for more than $209 million in Ransomware payments in the first three months of 2016. The business of Ransomware is on pace to be a $1 billion a year crime.\nShadow Brokers: People (Hackers) behind these attacks call themselves by this term.\n\nSeverely affected:\n\nBritain\u2019s National Health Service (NHS),\nSpain\u2019s Telef\u00f3nica,\nFedEx\u00a0(USA)\nDeutsche Bahn\nSeveral plants of carmakers Renault and Nissan had stopped production in France and England due to the malware,\nThe Russian Interior Ministry had reported about 1,000 computers.\nAffected Areas in India: Andra Pradesh, Kerala, some Pharma companies and over 48,000 attempts of ransomware attacks were detected in India. 60% of the attempts targeted enterprises, while 40% targeted individual customers said a cyber-security firm, Quick Heal Technologies.\nWhat is the Origin of Wannacry attack?\nIt is said by Wikileaks that National Security Agency (NSA) of USA had these methods to have monitored over subjects.\nThis loophole was recently leaked by WikiLeaks.\nThe same vulnerability of Windows Operating system was used by ransomware.\nHowever, Microsoft had released the security patches for the same earlier.\nWhat does it do the computer?\nSome variants of ransomware encrypt data in such a way that it is impossible to decrypt unless the user has an encryption key. These are called \u2018Encrypting Ransomware\u2019\u00a0that incorporate advanced encryption methods.\nAnother type of ransomware that is frequently circulated is\u00a0\u2018Locker ransomware, which locks the victim out of the operating system, making it impossible to access the desktop and any apps or files.\u00a0CryptoLocker, like WannaCry, is a malware when injected into a host system, scans the hard drive of the victim and targets specific file extensions and encrypts them.\nHow does it spread?\nWannacry encrypts the files on an infected computer.\nIt spreads by using a vulnerability in implementations of Server Message Block (SMB) of Windows systems. This exploit is known as ETERNALBLUE.\nIt encrypts hard disk/drive and then spread laterally between computers on the same LAN.\nIt also spreads through the malicious Email-attachment.\nHow to remain protected from ransomware?\n\nRegular Data Backup: This helps restore the last saved data and minimise data loss. Ransomware also attacks servers; hence it is important to have a backup on a disconnected hard drive or external device on the pre-defined regular basis.\nPrevention:\u00a0To prevent infiltration of malware, having password protected tools to identify and filter certain file extensions like \u201c.exe\u201d or \u201c. Zip\u201d, are essential. Emails that appear suspicious should also be filtered at the exchange level. There are also some tools that detect the entry of such malware with features of zero days\u2019 protection which work on threat emulation and threat extraction techniques. Users and businesses also need to ensure that hidden file extension is displayed since it becomes easier to filter them.\nUser awareness:\u00a0Awareness among users needs to be created to avoid opening the unsolicited attachment. Malware is typically designed to mimic identities of people that users interact with on a regular basis either on a personal or professional level.\nRules in IPS:\u00a0It\u2019s necessary to create rules in the Intrusion Prevention Software (IPS) to discard or disallow the opening of files with extension \u201c.exe\u201d from local App data folders or AppData.\nRegular patch and upgrades:\u00a0To prevent leaks or vulnerabilities in software, ensure to regularly update the software versions and apply patches released by the vendor. These patches and version are often released to wrestle with known or newly discovered exploits and can prevent known signatures of these malware, Trojans or ransomware to enter the system.\nInstall and run anti-malware and firewall software. When selecting software, choose a program that offers tools for detecting, quarantining, and removing multiple types of malware.\nThe combination of anti-malware software and a firewall will ensure that all incoming and existing data gets scanned for malware and that malware can be safely removed once detected.\nKeep software and operating systems up to date with current vulnerability patches. These patches are often released to patch bugs or other security flaws that could be exploited by attackers.\nBe vigilant when downloading files, programs, attachments, etc. Downloads that seem strange or are from an unfamiliar source often contain malware.\nSome Initiatives by Government of India:\nNational Cyber Security Policy 2013: Indian Government already have a National Cyber Security Policy in place. The National Cyber Security Policy document outlines a roadmap to create a framework for comprehensive, collaborative and collective response to deal with the issue of cyber security at all levels within the country.\nComputer Emergency Response Team (CERT-In) has been designated to act as a nodal agency for coordination of crisis management efforts. CERT-In will also act as an umbrella organisation for coordination actions and operationalization of sectoral CERTs. CERT-in will also issue early warnings.\nCyber\u00a0Swachhta\u00a0Kendra: The \u201cCyber\u00a0Swachhta\u00a0Kendra\u201d is a Botnet Cleaning and Malware Analysis Centre (BCMAC), operated by the Indian Computer Emergency Response Team (CERT-In) as part of the Government of India\u2019s Digital India initiative under the Ministry of Electronics and Information Technology (MeitY). Its goal is to create a secure cyberspace by detecting botnet infections in India and to notify, enable cleaning and securing systems of end users so as to prevent further infections.\n\nArticle by: Nishant\u00a0Raj.

In the case of the Indian scenario, it can be seen as armed rebellion and violent protests against Indian Government or authority.\n\nt is characterized by the use of irregular military tactics, guerrilla warfare, and asymmetric tactics by non-state actors or insurgent groups. Insurgencies are driven by a variety of political, social, economic, or ethnic grievances, and they typically seek to challenge or overthrow existing political systems.\n\nInsurgency in North East India\n\nNagaland, Manipur, Assam, and Tripura had been witnessing conflict since the 1950-60 period, but since 1990, the intensity of conflicts started to decrease.

It\u2019s important to note that the situation has evolved, and efforts have been made to address the root causes of conflicts.\n\nBut in this region, several armed factions operate. Some groups call for a separate state, others for regional autonomy while some extreme groups demand complete independence.\n\nReasons for conflict in North East India:\nHistorical reasons \u2013 loosely administered under British India.\nTensions between these states and the central government.\nTensions between tribal people, who are natives of these states, and migrant peoples from other parts of\u00a0India.\nGeographical reasons \u2013 not well connected with the present Indian mainland.\nDevelopmental reasons \u2013 Poorly developed due to lack of funds from centers/States.\nEnvironmental reasons.\nMilitary reasons \u2013\u00a0\u00a0AFSPA (Armed Forces Special Power Act).\nForeign Policy \u2013 Look for easy policy and market changes bought.\nExternal support \u2013 China and Myanmar.\nInsurgent Groups in North East India\n\nThe following are the insurgent groups operating in Northeast India:\n\nAssam:\nUnited Liberation Front of Asom (ULFA):\nFormed in 1979, ULFA initially sought Assamese independence. It has been involved in armed struggle, bombings, and attacks against security forces.\nInternal divisions have led to peace talks with one faction, while another faction, led by Paresh Baruah, continues armed resistance.\nNational Democratic Front of Bodoland (NDFB):\nNDFB, formed in the late 1980s, seeks an independent Bodoland for the Bodo people. The conflict has resulted in violence and displacement.\nCeasefire agreements have been signed with factions of NDFB, and peace talks are ongoing.\nOthers:\nVarious smaller groups, including the Karbi Longri N.C. Hills Liberation Front (KLNLF), have been involved in conflicts seeking autonomy or independence.\nManipur:\nPeople\u2019s Liberation Army (PLA) and United National Liberation Front (UNLF):\nVarious groups in Manipur, including PLA and UNLF, have sought independence or greater autonomy. The conflict has involved attacks on security forces and political leaders.\nOngoing talks, but some factions remain active.\nKangleipak Communist Party (KCP) and others:\nMultiple groups in Manipur, including KCP, have engaged in armed struggle for political and ethnic rights.\nEfforts have been made to address grievances and bring about peace.\nNagaland:\nNational Socialist Council of Nagaland (NSCN):\nNSCN, formed in 1980, initially sought an independent Nagalim. The conflict has seen several rounds of talks.\nCeasefire agreements and talks have been ongoing, with discussions on autonomy within the Indian Union.\nTripura:\nNational Liberation Front of Tripura (NLFT) and All Tripura Tiger Force (ATTF):\nNLFT and ATTF have sought Tripura\u2019s secession from India, leading to violence and displacement.\nCeasefire agreements have been signed, and efforts are made for political integration.\nMizoram:\nMizo National Front (MNF):\nMNF, which sought Mizo independence, engaged in armed struggle in the 1960s and 1970s.\nFollowing the Mizoram Accord in 1986, there has been political integration, and MNF is now a political party.\nArunachal Pradesh:\nWhile Arunachal Pradesh has not witnessed major insurgencies compared to some other northeastern states, there have been sporadic incidents and concerns related to border disputes.\nRecent Observations about North East India\n\nSome of the recent observations about the Northeast are:\n\nInsurgency & Ceasefire\nThe basic ingredient of insurgency i.e. popular support is drying up in the region. Insurgency is active only in Manipur. There are around 50 insurgent groups in Manipur.\nCeasefire and Suspension of Operations with militant groups allow them to indulge in extortion and kidnapping, which in turn help them maintain their clout over the people of the region.\nThere exists a deep nexus between all the insurgent groups in the Northeast. The CPI (Maoist) is also in touch with the Northeast insurgents primarily to source weapons. Arms were given by the United Liberation Force of Asom (ULFA) to the CPI (Maoist) in West Bengal.\nThe biggest challenge to the North East is extortion carried out by various insurgent groups. Extortion has become a meticulously organized activity in the region and is one of the major sources of funds for the militants.\nPolitical\nIt is important to understand the culture and psyche of the people of the East while framing policy alternatives.\nThe perceived threat to the political identity of the Assamese people from the illegal migrants from Bangladesh lies at the core of the Assam problem. The indigenous people of Assam feel that in the future the illegal migrants will become the majority population and they will lose political power.\nThe ceasefire agreements and peace negotiations have resulted in reducing the violence levels and given the civil societies of the region space to talk.\nOne of the ways to contain insurgency in the region is to delegate powers to ethnic minorities through the Autonomous District Councils so that they can fashion their development.\nThe implementation of the Sixth Schedule in Assam has not benefited the tribal communities of the state. Following the 73rd and 74th amendments, the Central and state governments are providing huge amounts of financial resources to the Panchayati Raj Institutions (PRI) and municipalities. Since the scheduled areas do not fall under the purview of the PRI and municipalities, they do not receive any share of these funds and as a result, they lose out.\nDevelopment\nThe security situation in the region has improved considerably in Assam and Meghalaya in particular facilitating a conducive atmosphere for investment and development. The Northeast Industrial Policy initiated by the Government of India further contributed to encouraging investment and industries in the region.\nHowever, the Northeast will not attract big industries because the region is a resource deficit, and does not have economies of scale to match. Moreover, the security situation in the whole of the region has not improved uniformly.\nThe North East Council (NEC) and the Ministry for the Development of the North East Region (DoNER) have become fund disbursing agencies instead of strategic planning agencies. At present approximately Rs. 11,000 crore is lying idle with the Ministry of DoNER.\nLook East Policy\nThe North East remains inward-looking focussing primarily on internal conflicts. There is no discussion on the benefits that could accrue to the region from the Look East Policy.\nIf the North East Region is opened up there is a fear of being swamped by cheap Chinese goods, which would spell disaster for the local manufacturing units.\nApprehensions exist that the development of communication links could result in developing strong links between the people of the North east with the people of China, Myanmar, and ASEAN countries, which would undermine the unity and integrity of India.\nBorder issues\nThe international borders in the Northeast are extremely porous. Thus, cross-border infiltration of militants and smuggling of arms are rampant in the region.\nChina has differing claims in Arunachal Pradesh. Along the westernmost corner, the Chinese claim line lay 20 km south and in the easternmost extreme of Arunachal Pradesh, it lay 30 km south.\nInternational boundaries in the North East have not crystallized into lines separating sovereign countries on the ground.\nRecommendations to solve North East India Problems\nInsurgency\nA thorough background check of all insurgent groups should be carried out before the central government enters into any Ceasefire or Suspension of Operations Agreements with the insurgents.\nPolitical\nPolitical solutions to the Assam problem should be discussed openly as widely as possible to avoid backlash from the tribal and the minority population of the state.\nA system of work permits should be issued so that the illegal Bangladeshi migrants do not end up as Indian citizens.\nThe Autonomous District Councils should be empowered.\nGovernance should be improved in a step-by-step manner. Strict supervision by senior officials should be initiated to improve the delivery system of the government.\nDevelopment\nThe Ministry of the Development of the North East Region (DoNER) be merged with the North East Council (NEC) for better strategic planning and coordination of various developmental projects in the region.\nThe focus of the Ministry of DoNER and NEC should be on investment in mega-projects which will make a big difference to the development of the region.\nInstitutional capacities in the Northeast should be developed urgently.\nA pragmatic land use policy should be formulated to attract industries in the region. Micro, small, and medium enterprises should be encouraged.\nLocal tourism should be promoted. Tourists residing in the eight North Eastern states should be encouraged to travel within the region.\nNiche tourism or high-end tourism should be encouraged. Medical and higher education tourism should be encouraged.\nThe North East should become a single economic unit without disturbing the political boundaries of the states. No internal traffic barriers in the region. Exclusive five-year plan for the Northeast focusing on the development of infrastructure.\nLook East Policy\nGreater awareness about the Look East Policy and its benefits to the North East should be generated among the policymakers and the intelligentsia of the region.\nTies with Myanmar should be deepened by exploiting Myanmar\u2019s anxieties about China as well as existing deep civilization and spiritual ties.\nThe North East region must be included in the India-ASEAN Vision for trade and cooperation. The Development Plan for the North East should factor in India-ASEAN strategic cooperation.\nIntegrated and bottoms-up approaches are required for the integration of the Northeast in the Look East Policy. The North East should formulate plans as to how it can engage with the ASEAN. Better coordination of efforts by all the Northeastern states should be ensured.\nVisa offices in Bangladesh and Myanmar should be located in the North East.\nCenters/Departments for the studies of neighboring countries like Myanmar, Bangladesh, Tibet, Bhutan, and Nepal in Universities should be set up in universities to understand India\u2019s neighbors better.\n\nRead: Act East Policy\n\nBorder issues\nSpecial economic zones along the India-Bangladesh border, especially in Meghalaya and Assam should be set up.\nStates should focus more on the development and security of the border areas.\nSentiments of the people of Arunachal Pradesh should be taken into consideration by the central government while discussing the frameworks for the resolution of the border dispute with China.\nMatching infrastructure and military capability should be built to ensure peace and enable negotiations from a position of strength.\n\nCourtesy and Reference: IDSA and Wikipedia"

Here, in this article, we are discussing in detail about the Gorkhaland Movement, its background, causes, the current situation, etc.\n\nTable of Contents\n\nWhat is the Gorkhaland Issue?\nWhy is there a demand for separate statehood for Gorkhaland?\nThe story behind the rise of Gorkhaland \u2013 Chronology and Cause\nHow Darjeeling came into existence?\nChronology of \u2018demands for autonomy\u2019\nMajor Post-Independence Movements related to Gorkhaland\n2017 Darjeeling Agitation\nWhy Gorkhaland Movement Matters?\nPossible Resolution -Division of the state of West Bengal, to create Gorkhaland\nConclusion\nWhat is the Gorkhaland Issue?\nGorkhaland consists of Nepali-speaking people of Darjeeling, Kalimpong, Kurseong and other hilly districts of West-Bengal. The people belonging to these areas have ethical, cultural and language differences with the Bengali community of West-Bengal.\nThe demand of Darjeeling as a separate administrative region dates back to 1907. But, the term \u201cGorkhaland\u201d was coined recently, in the 1980s, by Subhash Ghising, the founder of Gorkha National Liberation Front (GNLF).\nThe Gorkhaland Movement is a movement mainly focused in the Darjeeling Hills of West Bengal, which demands the creation of a separate state of Gorkhaland.\nThe area covers Duars and Terai region of West Bengal. And is famous for its tea and beauty, which are the main sources of its income.\nWhy is there a demand for separate statehood for Gorkhaland?\nThe main reason for the separate Gorkhaland movement is due to the differences in ethnicity, culture and language.\nThe people of Nepali-Indian Gorkha ethnic origin on the Northern part of\u00a0West Bengal\u00a0demands a state on basis of their cultural identity, which is very different from Bengali culture.\nIn addition to an identity crisis, there is also an issue of poverty, under-development and politicisation of the issue.\nAccording to Rajat Ganguli\u00a0(author of \u2018Poverty, Malgovernance and Ethnopolitical Mobilization: Gorkha Nationalism and the Gorkhaland Agitation in India\u2019). It was a failure of governance combined with politicisation that bred the Gorkhaland issue. He cites the historical trend, especially post-independence, where the issue erupts only when it\u2019s pampered by political aspirations.\nThe story behind the rise of Gorkhaland \u2013 Chronology and Cause\n\nHow Darjeeling came into existence?\nPrior to 1780s the area was ruled by Chogyal of Sikkim\nAround 1780 the Gorkhas had captured Sikkim and most parts of the North East including Darjeeling.\nIn 1814,\u00a0the\u00a0Anglo-Gorkha war broke out, which ended with the\u00a0Treaty of Segoulee in 1815 (ratified in March 1816).\nAs per the treaty, British East India Company took all the territory that Gorkha annexed from Chogyal of Sikkim.\nIn 1817, through the\u00a0Treaty of Titalia, the British reinstated Chogyal of Sikkim and gave back all the territory annexed by Gorkhas back to Chogyals.\nThough in 1835, through Deed of Grant, they took possession of the hills of Darjeeling from Sikkim.\nBritish added Bengal Duars and Kalimpong to Darling hills in 1864 via Treaty of Sinchula, signed between the British and Bhutan.\nThus the present district of Darjeeling came into existence in 1866.\nChronology of \u2018demands for autonomy\u2019\nIn 1907, The demand for a separate administrative unit in Darjeeling was raised for the first time by the Hillmen\u2019s Association of Darjeeling.\nIn 1941, it demanded exclusion of Darjeeling from Bengal and to make it a chief commissioner province.\nThe undivided Communist Party of India, in 1947 submitted a memorandum to the Constituent Assembly demanding the formation of Gorkhasthan comprising Darjeeling district and Sikkim.\nIn 1952, Akhil BharatiyaGorkha League (ABGL) meets Prime Minister and demands separation from Bengal.\n1977- 81:\u00a0The West Bengal government passes a unanimous resolution supporting the creation of an autonomous district council consisting Darjeeling and related areas.\n1980: Subhash Ghising forms Gorkha National Liberation Front (GNLF).\nGNLF launches a most violent agitation in Gorkhaland movement history in 1986.\nIn 1988, Darjeeling Gorkha Hill Council accord is signed by GNLF, the state of Bengal and the Centre. Darjeeling Gorkha Hill Council came into action. GNLF drops the demand for the separate state.\nIn 2005, the same parties signed an in\u2013principle memorandum of settlement to include Darjeeling in the Sixth Schedule of the Indian Constitution, which addresses the administration of tribal areas.\nCalling \u2018the Sixth Schedule solution\u2019 a betrayal to Gorkhaland, Bimal Gurung launched Gorkha Janmukti Morcha (GJM) in 2007. The same year witnessed a\u00a0rise in agitations for the separate Gorkhaland demand.\nIn 2011 the memorandum of agreement for the formation of a Gorkhaland Territorial Administration (GTA), a semi-autonomous administrative body for the Darjeeling, passed by\u00a0 West Bengal legislative assembly to calm the GJM.\nMajor Post-Independence Movements related to Gorkhaland\nThe All India Gorkha League (AIGL) came into existence in 1943 as the first political party in the Darjeeling hills. After India\u2019s independence, it demanded the addition of Darjeeling to Assam and started \u2018Assam Chalo\u2019 movement. It worked on petitions, like the moderates, and had submitted memorandums to the President of India and the Prime Minister of India. It was never violent, except few exceptions.\nThe biggest and most violent agitation took place in 1986 under the banner of GNLF, led by Subhash Ghising. Between 1986-88, Darjeeling witnessed most violent phase in its post-independence history of India. As per one estimate, more than 1200 people lost their lives. It ended with DGHC accord (discussed above).\nIn 2004, the fourth elections for DGHC didn\u2019t take place. Instead, in 2005, Darjeeling was added to the sixth schedule and a tribal council was set up with Ghising as its head. It leads to revolt by Bimal Gurung, who launched GJM in 2007. Thereby, the second biggest agitation in Gorkhaland movement took place. As evident from the turn of events, it was a politically motivated rather than identity driven.\nIn 2010-2011, the Gorkhaland agitation saw a new turn after local leaders fought among themselves as one of the leader of the Akhil Bharatiya Gorkha League (ABGL), was allegedly stabbed to death by GJM supporters.\nIn 2013, the demand for separation rose high again due to the division of Andhra Pradesh. The movement was peaceful under the leadership of GJM. GJM adopted the innovative method of protest called \u201cJanta Bandh\u201d.\u00a0People were told to voluntarily stay inside on 13th\u00a0and 14th August. There was no force used but the silence on streets was an evident sign of revolt. It was portrayed as an embarrassment to the government.\n2017 Darjeeling Agitation\n\nCause\n\nWest Bengal government\u2019s decision to impose Bengali language in all the schools from Class I to IX.\n\nWhat made it worse?\n\nHeavy-handed response from state leading to the death of protestors.\nConsidered as an attempt by TMC (All India Trinamool Congress) to gain hold in Darjeeling. In 2017 municipal election, TMC won only 1 seat while GJM held 31 seats.\nGJM finds it as right opportunity to raise its importance.\nWhy Gorkhaland Movement Matters?\nIt is one of the oldest movement in India (began in 1907)\nWhat happens in Gorkhaland will affect India-Nepal relations too. How India treats the problems of the Nepali people of hill origin in Darjeeling will affect how Nepal deals with the people of Indian origin in Nepal, i.e. Madhesi in Terai.\nGorkhaland has a strategic location, it\u2019s vicinity to the chicken neck that connects rest of India with North East. Its stability is must for India\u2019s strategic and economic interests of the nation.\nDarjeeling is a tea and tourist hot-spot with a high level of poverty. It needs and has potential to become the economic engine of the East with a sustainable economic model. But such things will be possible only if there is stability in the region.\nPossible Resolution -Division of the state of West Bengal, to create Gorkhaland\n\nPros\n\nIt may create a stable and responsible government in Darjeeling.\nIt will end one of the longest movement for the creation of a separate state in India\n\nCons\n\nIt can lead to \u201cBalkanization\u201d of India.\nIt may legitimise violence as a way to meet demands.\nThe rise of agitation with the\u00a0rise of new outfits shows that politics plays the vital role. The division would be an extreme measure for a problem that can be resolved by political consensus like done in 1988 and 2011.\nDivision of state should be done on the criteria set by State Reorganisation Commission. Any diversion would only create a more dissension than the solution.\n\n2. Giving more powers to Gorkhaland Territorial Administration, creating a transparent and open election process. It must be realised that GJM rose due to the failure of the government to conduct 4th DGHC elections.\n\n\ud83d\udc49 Which year are YOU targeting for success in the IAS/IPS/IFS Exam? \ud83d\ude80\n\n(1) \u21d2 UPSC 2025: Prelims cum Mains\n\n(2) \u21d2 UPSC 2026: Prelims cum Mains\n\n(3) \u21d2 UPSC 2027 Prelims cum Mains\n\nTip: Know more about ClearIAS Courses (Online/Offline)\n\n3. The Parliament can amend the Constitution of India and insert autonomous district within West Bengal by adding a provision like 244 A, which provides for such method for Assam.\n\nConclusion\n\nImage Credit: Maximilian D\u00f6rrbecker (Chumwa) (Own work) [CC BY-SA 2.5], via Wikimedia Commons\nThe demands for separate statehood in India have been there even before India\u2019s Independence. Even after the state re-organization of 1956, there were demands from various corners of the country for the creation of a separate state. Linguistic, cultural, ethnic and economic distinctions can be traced as the core reasons behind these demands.\n\nHegel said, \u201cWe learn from history that we do not learn from history\u201d. The repetition of history in the Gorkhaland issue is the living proof. Especially in the post-independence, where the rise and fall of momentum in demand follow the rise and fall of the party involved. The solution lies in pleasing the population rather than the parties. Gorkhaland can become an epitome of decentralisation or a failed divided state. The choice is in the hands of people protesting. Are they protesting for the right cause?\n\nArticle contributed by: Alok Singh"

But the Assam Rifles and the state armed police could not contain the Naga rebellion and the rebel Naga Nationalist Council (NNC) formed a parallel government \u201cThe Federal Government of Nagaland\u201d on 23 March 1956.\n\nThe Armed Forces (Assam and Manipur) Special Powers Ordinance 1958 was promulgated by President Dr. Rajendra Prasad on 22 May 1958. It was replaced by the Armed Forces (Assam and Manipur) Special Powers Act, 1958 on 11 September 1958.\n\nLater the territorial scope of the act also expanded to the seven states of the North-East \u2013 and the words \u201cThe Armed Forces (Assam and Manipur) Special Powers Act, 1958\u201d were substituted by \u201cArmed Forces (Special Powers) Act, 1958\u201d, getting the acronym of AFSPA, 1958.\n\nAlso read: ULFA: Understanding the Peace Pact\n\nThe Armed Forces (Punjab and Chandigarh) Special Powers Act, 1983:\n\nThe central government enacted the Armed Forces (Punjab and Chandigarh) Special Powers Act on 6 October 1983, to enable the central armed forces to operate in the state of Punjab and the union territory of Chandigarh during the militancy days.\n\nThe act was withdrawn in 1997, roughly 14 years after it came to force. Punjab was the first from where the act was repealed.\n\nThe Armed Forces (Jammu and Kashmir) Special Powers Act, 1990:\n\nThe act was enacted in Jammu and Kashmir due to extreme security instability in the area where it remains in force.\n\nSupreme Court verdict, 1998:\n\nIn the case of\u00a0Naga People\u2019s Movement of Human Rights vs. Union of India, the validity of AFSPA was challenged before the Supreme Court and the five-judge bench concluded that the act cannot be considered as a violation of the Constitution and the powers conferred under the section 4 and 5 of the act are not arbitrary and unreasonable and therefore not in violation of the provisions of the Constitution.\n\nThe Jeevan Reddy Committee:\n\nOn November 19, 2004, the Central government appointed a five-member committee headed by\u00a0Justice BP Jeevan Reddy to review the provisions of the act in the northeastern states.\n\nThe Committee had recommended a complete repeal of the law. \u201cThe Act is a symbol of hate, oppression, and an instrument of high-handedness,\u201d it said.\n\nThe committee submitted its report in 2005, which included\u00a0the following recommendations:\n\nAFSPA should be repealed and appropriate provisions should be inserted in the Unlawful Activities (Prevention) Act, 1967\nThe Unlawful Activities Act should be modified to specify the powers of the armed forces and paramilitary forces\nGrievance cells should be set up in each district where the armed forces are deployed.\n\nThe\u00a05th report of the Second Administrative Reforms Commission\u00a0on public order has also recommended the repeal of the AFSPA.\n\nIn 2016, the Supreme Court concerning internal security had ruled that the armed forces cannot escape investigation for excesses committed in the discharge of their duties even in \u2018disturbed areas\u2019. In other words, legal protection offered by the AFSPA cannot be absolute.\n\nThe AFSPA was repealed in Tripura in 2015, and the Centre also removed Meghalaya from the list, while also restricting its use in Arunachal Pradesh in 2018.\n\nWhat are the ground rules of the act?\nWhile the Act gives powers to security forces to open fire, this cannot be done without prior warning given to the suspect.\nThe Act further says that any suspects apprehended by security forces should be handed over to the local police station within 24 hours.\nIt says armed forces must act in cooperation with the district administration and not as an independent body.\nGovernor of a State and the Central Government are empowered to declare any part or full of any state as a disturbed area if according to their opinion that it has become necessary to disrupt the terrorist activity or any such activity that might impinge on the sovereignty of India or cause insult to the national flag, anthem or India\u2019s Constitution.\nSection (3)of AFSPA provides that, if the governor of a state issues an official notification in The Gazette of India then the Central government has the authority to deploy armed forces for assisting the civilian authorities. Once a region is declared \u2018disturbed\u2019 then it has to maintain the status quo for a minimum of three months, as per The Disturbed Areas Act of 1976.\nWhy is the AFSPA being opposed?\n\nThe Act has been called draconian as it gives sweeping powers to the armed forces. It allows them to open fire\u2019, even causing death, against any person in contravention to the law or carrying arms and ammunition.\n\nIt gives them powers to arrest individuals without warrants, based on \u201creasonable suspicion\u201d, and also search premises without warrants.\n\nThe Act further provides blanket immunity to security personnel involved in such operations: There can be no prosecution or legal proceedings against them without the prior approval of the Centre.\n\nPoints in favor of the AFSPA:\nThe AFSPA is applied to an area only when the ordinary laws of the land are found to be inadequate to deal with the extraordinary situation perpetrated by insurgents spreading terror.\nInsurgent movements in India have more or less been proxy-wars being waged against India by external actors and this makes the deployment of armed forces in a counter-insurgency role with enhanced legal protection necessary.\nThe army has, repeatedly, made it clear that it cannot operate without the AFSPA as it needs special powers to tackle home-grown and as well as foreign terrorists.\nWay forward:\n\nThe status quo of the act is no longer the acceptable solution due to numerous human rights violation incidents that have occurred over the years. The AFSPA has become a symbol of oppression in the areas it has been enacted. Hence the government needs to address the affected people and reassure them of favourable action.\n\nThe army fights high-intensity conflicts hence it is important to garner support from the people of the region to fight terrorism and insurgent activities. The armed forces must build the necessary trust amongst the locals to ensure their support in countering insurgency.\n\nThe state bureaucracy, army, and the grass-root civil society organization should come together in the developmental activities of the state hence making the law a positive aspect for the society there.\n\nThe government should consider the imposition and lifting of AFSPA on a case-by-case basis and limit its application only to a few disturbing districts instead of applying it for the whole state. The government and the security forces should also abide by the guidelines set out by The Supreme Court, Jeevan Reddy Commission, and the NHRC."

            "[CONTENT]": "The pro-talks faction of the United Liberation Front of Asom (ULFA) signed a tripartite peace deal with the Centre and the Assam government on December 29, 2023. Read here to learn about the significance of the deal and the history of ULFA.\n\nWhen six young men met at the Rang Ghar on April 7, 1979, to join the United Liberation Front of Asom (ULFA), peace was probably the furthest thing from their minds. Armed conflict is how they plan to achieve a \u201csovereign socialist Assam.\u201d\n\nThe six were Golap Baruah, alias Anup Chetia, Samiran Gogoi, alias Pradip Gogoi, Bhadreshwar Gohain, Bhimkanta Buragohain, Rajiv Rajkonwar, alias Arabinda Rajkhowa, and Paresh Baruah.\n\nTable of Contents\n\nUnited Liberation Front of Asom (ULFA)\nAttempts at Dialogue and Internal Divisions\nPeace Initiatives (2019 Onward)\nPeace pact with ULFA\nWhat more can be done?\nConclusion\nUnited Liberation Front of Asom (ULFA)\n\nULFA was formed on April 7, 1979, by Paresh Baruah, Arabinda Rajkhowa, Anup Chetia, and other Assamese nationalists. The group emerged as a response to the perceived economic and political marginalization of Assam by the Indian government.\n\nThe primary goal of ULFA was to establish a sovereign, independent state called \u201cAsom\u201d for the Assamese people.\nThe leaders claimed that Assam\u2019s resources were being exploited by the Indian government without adequate development in the region.\n\nIt was initially a by-product of the anti-foreigners Assam Agitation that began in 1979 and ended with the signing of the Assam Accord in August 1985.\n\nThe protest had been sparked by the concern that one day \u201cillegal immigrants\u201d (people from Bangladesh) would drive away the Assamese and other indigenous populations from their land.\nWhile local unions and student groups chose to protest, ULFA adopted violent tactics, including bombings, assassinations, and armed attacks, to press its demands for Assamese independence.\nULFA sought support from external sources, including allegations of receiving assistance from neighboring countries. This led to strained relations between India and those countries.\nAttempts at Dialogue and Internal Divisions\n\nCeasefire (1992): In 1992, the Indian government initiated a ceasefire with ULFA, opening the door for negotiations. However, the talks did not result in a lasting resolution.\n\n\ud83d\udc49 Which year are YOU targeting for success in the IAS/IPS/IFS Exam? \ud83d\ude80\n\n(1) \u21d2 UPSC 2025: Prelims cum Mains\n\n(2) \u21d2 UPSC 2026: Prelims cum Mains\n\n(3) \u21d2 UPSC 2027 Prelims cum Mains\n\nTip: Know more about ClearIAS Courses (Online/Offline)\n\nInternal Divisions (mid-1990s): Internal divisions within ULFA led to a factional split. Some leaders, including Arabinda Rajkhowa and Anup Chetia, engaged in peace talks with the Indian government, while others, led by Paresh Baruah, continued armed resistance.\n\nThe government responded in 1990 with an offensive codenamed Operation Bajrang and banned the ULFA. Assam was declared a disturbed area with the imposition of the Armed Forces (Special Powers) Act.\n\nIn the 2010s, ULFA shifted its strategy, emphasizing peaceful negotiations over armed struggle. The group expressed willingness to engage in talks with the Indian government.\n\nPeace Initiatives (2019 Onward)\n\nIn recent years, there have been renewed efforts for peace talks between the Indian government and ULFA leaders.\n\nIn 2019, the Assam Accord was amended to include provisions for safeguarding the cultural, social, and linguistic identity of the Assamese people.\n\nPeace pact with ULFA\n\nNegotiations between ULFA, the Indian government, and the Assam state government began in 2011.\n\nFinally, the pro-talk faction of the United Liberation Front of Assam (ULFA) signed a tripartite peace deal with the Centre and the Assam government.\n\nThe key terms of the pact are:\n\nFor ULFA to:\n\nRenounce violence and disband their organization.\nJoin the democratic process.\nSurrender weapons and camps.\n\nFor the government to:\n\nAddress ULFA\u2019s concerns regarding Assamese identity, culture, and land rights.\nA \u20b91.5 lakh crore investment for Assam\u2019s holistic development\nFollowing the principles applied for the 2023 delimitation exercise for future delimitation exercises in Assam\n\nLegislative Safeguards:\n\nThe pact aims to restrict non-indigenous communities\u2019 representation in the Assam Assembly and seeks exemptions from specific sections of the Citizenship Act of 1955.\nWhat more can be done?\n\nResolving the issues related to the United Liberation Front of Asom (ULFA) cordially requires a comprehensive and multifaceted approach that addresses the root causes of the conflict.\n\nSince only the pro-talk faction of the front has signed the pact, the other faction still remains as an issue. The government should engage in sustained and inclusive dialogue with all relevant stakeholders, including both factions of ULFA.\nThe socio-economic issues that fueled the insurgency should be addressed by implementing and expediting development projects in Assam.\nDevolving more administrative, political, and financial powers to the state government of Assam. This may involve reviewing the existing administrative structures and providing greater autonomy to address regional concerns.\nProtection of Assamese cultural, linguistic, and social identity. This could involve constitutional guarantees and legal provisions to safeguard the unique identity of the Assamese people.\nRehabilitation programs for former militants, offering them opportunities for education, skill development, and integration into mainstream society. This approach has been successful in other conflict resolution processes.\nEnsuring that security operations are conducted in compliance with human rights standards. Investigation of any allegations of human rights abuses to build confidence and trust among the affected communities should be carried out.\nOffering conditional amnesty to former militants, provided they renounce violence and engage in the peace process. Develop a legal framework that allows for the rehabilitation and reintegration of those willing to return to mainstream society.\nA comprehensive review of the Assam Accord to address the political and constitutional status of Assam. This may involve constitutional amendments and legal reforms to address the specific demands of the region.\nConclusion\n\nIt\u2019s important to note that achieving a peaceful resolution to the issues related to ULFA will require a sustained commitment from all parties involved. Flexibility, compromise, and a genuine understanding of the concerns and aspirations of the people of Assam are essential for building a lasting peace in the region.\n\nThere is a great chance for Assamese peace and growth because of the new peace agreement with ULFA. However, a long-lasting peace in the area can only be established by resolving underlying issues, promoting economic development, and guaranteeing social integration.\n\nRelated articles:\n\nNorth-East India: Insurgency and other issues\nTeesta River dispute\nUAPA\n\n-Article by Swathi Satish"

The impact of social media and traditional/digital media has grown dramatically as a result of the data and digital revolution.\n\nThe media and social networking sites play a significant role in internal security challenges.

In reality, it has expanded the scope of risks to India\u2019s security environment.\n\nWhat part does media play in ensuring national security?\n\nThe fourth estate is referred to as media. It has a history of independence struggles and has consistently represented societal transformation.\n\nIts skilled reporting during trying times has aided in fostering national consciousness and solidarity.\nWhether it is a welfare issue or a security issue, the establishment has been kept on its toes because it has spoken the truth to power. Severe corruption in the defense industry was exposed by the Bofors probe.\nBy bringing up concerns about infrastructure shortages, defense readiness, and other issues through its reporting, it has engaged in a critical study of the state of internal security challenges. Policy formulation has benefited from early policy discussions on media regulation.\nIt has revealed the specifics of when and where the security forces atrocities occurred. It held the government and security forces responsible in this way.\nIt has aided in societal resentment\u2019s release and judicial repression.\nThe media consistently aids in the proper exposure of societal resentment and reduces the establishment\u2019s susceptibility to uprisings.\nThe core tolerant and democratic civilizational and constitutional ethos has always been supported by the entertainment media, including movies, television, and other forms of art.

According to many social activists, the recent community instances and how the media handled them were extremely divisive. This sows social enmity, which works as a social tension time bomb ready to blow.\nThe accuracy of the media\u2019s coverage of terrorism has occasionally been questioned. It makes one group the target of blame, encourages war, and sways public opinion in favor of sometimes unwise, quick, dramatic actions to combat terrorism.\nThe media\u2019s coverage of the events on 26/11 came under fire for disclosing important information in the pointless TRP race.\nThe post-truth media rests its arguments on feelings rather than just the truth, leaving it open to attack from the enemy and manipulation.\nInstitutions of democracy are harmed by the politicization of the news media and skewed reporting.\nA significant worry has been the Fourth Estate\u2019s lack of independence.\nInternal security and social networking sites\n\nIdeas advance dramatically daily in the Internet of Things, and disruption is the norm. The introduction of social media is one such disruption that has completely revolutionized how information is shared in real time.\n\nIt has upended information hierarchies, widened access, and created a brand-new information exchange ecology. Social media\u2019s disruptive nature also poses numerous internal security challenges.\n\nAlso read: Virtual Private Network\n\nIn what ways do social networking sites compromise internal security?\n\nSocial networking sites create the following challenges to internal security.\n\nFake news\n\nWith the growth of social media, the false news phenomenon has exploded. News channels have mostly been overtaken by social media as a source of information. The first news sources for the digital generation are Facebook, Twitter, and other social media websites.\nFor instance, the repercussions of fake news were seen when a crowd in Maharashtra launched false reports of child lifting.\n\nWar on propaganda\n\nFacebook pages and WhatsApp groups are being exploited as propaganda tools in social media.\nThey serve as radicalism\u2019s echo chambers and radicalize the populace.\n\nSocial Media and Terrorism\n\nISIS and other terrorist groups are rapidly recruiting new members through social media.\nUnrestricted social media platforms develop into comparatively safer channels of interaction for these terrorist groups.\n\nPlatform with no restrictions\n\nThe social media platform is not constrained by territorial restrictions. This has caused outside parties to meddle in domestic matters.\n\nIntolerant religious behavior on social media\n\nFundamentalism in religion is being spread via social media more and more. The country\u2019s social fabric is being harmed by the proliferation of false history and news.\nThrough social media, hate speech can be spread quickly.\nWhat problems do policing and regulating social networking sites face?\n\nSocial media go beyond conventional censorship and regulating systems.\n\nNational governments find it challenging due to social media\u2019s global nature.\nSocial media data storage raises jurisdictional concerns when attempting to combat criminality online.\nPrivate firms, who control a large portion of the infrastructure, view security precautions and routine auditing as superfluous expenses that make it harder to protect individuals from social media-related crimes.\nThe impact of social media problems cannot be controlled because smartphones and the internet have reached every aspect of life.\nWhat are the legal controls over social networking sites?\nInformation Technology Act 2000 (IT Act 2000) is the primary law connected with cyber security in India.\nThe Information Technology Act of 2000 and its intermediate regulations, which were published under the IT Act of 2011, apply to social networking networks.\nNumerous clauses in the IT Act, most notably Sections 69A and 79, can be utilized to restrict internet content.\nSecurity organizations keep an eye on social media sites for threats and work to reduce them. By working along with those sites, several offensive social media platforms have been removed.\nA Summary\n\nHere\u2019s an overview of the roles of media and social networking sites in internal security challenges:\n\nDissemination of Information:\n\nPositive Role: Media and social networking sites are essential channels for disseminating information about security threats, emergencies, and government actions. They can help raise public awareness and facilitate timely responses to crises.\nNegative Role: Misinformation and disinformation can spread rapidly through these platforms, causing panic and confusion during crises. False or misleading information can also undermine public trust in authorities and institutions.\n\nRadicalization and Extremist Propaganda:\n\nPositive Role: Authorities can monitor social media for signs of radicalization and extremism, enabling them to identify potential threats and take preventive measures.\nNegative Role: Extremist groups use social networking sites to recruit, radicalize, and spread propaganda. This can lead to incidents of terrorism and political violence.\n\nPrivacy and Surveillance:\n\nPositive Role: Media and civil society can play a vital role in highlighting issues related to government surveillance and infringement on individual privacy rights. Advocacy and reporting can lead to policy changes to protect civil liberties.\nNegative Role: Social networking sites and communication apps can be used for surveillance by governments and malicious actors. Personal data and communication can be compromised, posing threats to individual privacy.\n\nCybersecurity Threats:\n\nPositive Role: Media can report on cybersecurity threats and educate the public about safe online practices, helping individuals and organizations protect themselves from cyberattacks.\nNegative Role: Cybercriminals use social networking sites and communication networks for phishing, malware distribution, and cyberattacks. Media reports on high-profile cyberattacks can cause panic and damage a country\u2019s reputation.\n\nManipulation of Public Opinion:\n\nPositive Role: Media and social networking sites can provide a platform for citizens to express their opinions and participate in democratic processes.\nNegative Role: Malicious actors, including foreign governments, can use social media to spread disinformation, manipulate public opinion, and interfere in elections, potentially undermining the democratic process and creating social unrest.\n\nReporting on Security Operations:\n\nPositive Role: Media serves as a watchdog, reporting on security operations, government actions, and human rights abuses. This can lead to accountability and transparency in security matters.\nNegative Role: Premature or inaccurate reporting can compromise security operations, put lives at risk, and hinder law enforcement efforts.\n\nCybersecurity Awareness:\n\nPositive Role: Media can raise awareness about cybersecurity threats, encouraging individuals and organizations to adopt best practices for online safety.\nNegative Role: Media outlets can inadvertently provide information or details about cyber vulnerabilities and exploits, potentially aiding malicious actors.\n\nCommunication During Emergencies:\n\nPositive Role: Social networking sites and messaging apps can be crucial tools for communication during emergencies, enabling people to connect with authorities, loved ones, and emergency services.\nNegative Role: Overuse of communication networks during emergencies can strain infrastructure and lead to network congestion, hindering response efforts.\nWay forward\n\nMedia has become a deadly weapon against the opposition and the general public in a globalized world. Information functions as a strategic tool within the framework of grand strategy as a component of soft power. Social media should be used responsibly.\n\nHowever, we will need to consider taking action to prevent its exploitation from endangering the nation\u2019s internal security. Social media is undoubtedly a blessing to our world, with all of its advantages and possibilities for growth, but misuse or careless use can have detrimental impacts on internal security.\n\nTo combat the threat, the national government must modernize its security infrastructure.\n\nSocial media should be used correctly for creative or constructive reasons to be progressive for humanity and society as a whole rather than regressive, as we must guard against its negative effects.\n\nAlso read:\u00a0Creator economy\n\nArticle Written By: Aryadevi"

This group NSCN-K was responsible for an ambush on the Indian Army that had killed 18 soldiers in Manipur. It signals that the \u201cwar of ideas against the establishment\u201d is no longer covert, but aims to inspire recruits overtly.\nThe Case of \u201cFacebook Militant\u201d Burhan Wani has serious consequences for India\u2019s national security as seen in the resurgence of unrest in the state of Jammu and Kashmir in July 2016. The mass violence was triggered in the aftermath of the killing of Burhan Wani, the Hizbul Mujahideen commander who was infamously known as the \u201cFacebook Militant\u201d in mass media. His idea of \u2018\u2019Khilafat\u2019\u2019 propaganda videos went viral on social media and placed the Kashmir rebellion in the larger discourse of Islamist movements across the world.\n\nSocial media seems to be their weapon of war.\n\nThese incidents snowballed into a cyber-security challenge and exposed a facet of the medium that could be exploited by anti-national elements and required immediate attention.\n\nIn addition, we are also witnessing the growth of the \u201cNew Media Phenomenon\u201d where conventional media (mainly television) is increasingly relying on social media to feed its 24-hour news cycles and picking content and coverage led by social media trends.\n\nThe convergence of various forms of media\u2014television, social, and online networks have doubled the impact and acted as instruments of information that replicate the threat to law and order as well as security.\n\nThis needs to be tapped by security and law enforcement agencies against the perpetrators of crimes.\n\nIndian agencies are aware of the looming challenge. Apart from online surveillance to isolate influencers and prevent mishaps, emphasis has been made on instituting a de-radicalization program that addresses the issue at three levels:\n\nthrough preventive arrests\ncounter-narratives to discourage the youth and give incentives to renounce violence\nto work at the micro level with individuals.\nLegal Challenges\n\nDuring times of crisis, governments find themselves in a spot, because social media service providers like Facebook, Google (YouTube, Blogspot), Twitter, etc., provide web and social media services from their servers installed in their home countries, and hence they ought to comply only with their nation\u2019s laws.\n\nCyber security experts in India have been pressing the government to formulate laws that clarify the legal position on whether the law of the land or the law of the countries where the Internet companies are headquartered will take precedence in cyberspace.\n\nSocial networking sites need to conform to local laws and sensitivities when it comes to blocking Web content\n\nRevision of the legal regime is mandatory since the IT Act 2000 conceived 16 years ago was meant to promote e-commerce and is incapable of resolving the challenges put forth by the rapid explosion of new technologies like social media.\n\nThe National Cyber Security Policy doesn\u2019t have any provisions to deal with social media. Hence, a macro-level implementation has to be adopted at the earliest.\n\nRead: Cyber security in India\n\nChallenges to Internal Security Through Communication Networks\n\nHere are some key challenges related to internal security through communication networks:\n\nCyberattacks:\n\nCyberattacks encompass a wide range of activities, including hacking, malware distribution, and distributed denial of service (DDoS) attacks. These attacks can disrupt critical infrastructure, steal sensitive data, and compromise the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of information.\n\nData Breaches:\n\nData breaches occur when unauthorized individuals or groups gain access to confidential information, such as personal data, financial records, or classified documents. These breaches can lead to identity theft, financial fraud, and espionage.\n\nPhishing and Social Engineering:\n\nPhishing attacks involve tricking individuals into revealing sensitive information by posing as a trustworthy entity. Social engineering tactics manipulate people into divulging confidential data, making it challenging to protect against these threats.\n\nMalware and Ransomware:\n\nMalware, including ransomware, is malicious software designed to infiltrate computer systems and encrypt or steal data. Ransomware can lock users out of their systems until a ransom is paid, causing significant disruption.\n\nFake News and Disinformation:\n\nCommunication networks can be used to spread fake news and disinformation, which can incite violence, sow discord, and influence public opinion negatively. This poses a significant challenge to social cohesion and national security.\n\nRadicalization and Extremism:\n\nExtremist groups and individuals use communication networks to radicalize and recruit followers. Online platforms and social media enable the dissemination of extremist ideologies and propaganda.\n\nCyber Espionage and State-Sponsored Attacks:\n\nNation-states engage in cyber espionage and cyberattacks to steal sensitive information, disrupt critical infrastructure, or gain a strategic advantage. These attacks can have severe national security implications.\n\nIoT Vulnerabilities:\n\nThe proliferation of Internet of Things (IoT) devices has introduced new security vulnerabilities. Weaknesses in IoT security can be exploited to gain access to networks, potentially compromising critical systems.\n\nSupply Chain Attacks:\n\nAttackers may compromise the supply chain of communication network equipment, software, or services. This can lead to the introduction of malicious components into network infrastructure.\n\nPrivacy Concerns:\n\nThe collection and misuse of personal data by organizations and governments can erode privacy rights. Privacy breaches can lead to public outrage and legal challenges.\n\nLaw Enforcement and Surveillance Balancing Act:\n\nBalancing the need for surveillance and law enforcement with individuals\u2019 privacy rights is an ongoing challenge. Striking the right balance while maintaining civil liberties is crucial.\nWay forward\n\nThe way forward is walking the tightrope on privacy concerns and balancing security imperatives. Such unprecedented developments in Information Communication Technologies (ICTs) provide immense potential for successful participative governance initiatives in India.\n\nBut technology is a double-edged sword. It also throws up new challenges in the realm of law and order. We see that Social Networks facilitate the act of engagement between like-minded people, groups, or communities.\n\nThe Department of Electronics and Information Technology (DeitY) drafted the \u201cFramework and Guidelines for Use of Social Media for Government Organisations\u201d that states social media in recent times has become synonymous with social networking sites like Facebook, YouTube, and micro-blogging sites like Twitter.\n\nThe National Cyber Security Policy, 2014, envisions the creation of centers of excellence for various capacity-building exercises including assistance to law enforcement agencies some provisions can be included to impart personnel training and develop techniques dedicated to social media technologies.\n\nRevising data scientists\u2019 curricula in universities, who are experts in extracting intelligence from the media effectively.\nCollaborations with international agencies to learn from their experiences must be encouraged.\nEspecially in situations where conflict is triggered by the misuse of social media, it has been suggested that the government work with social media service companies. This helps in creating mechanisms where in case of emergencies, provisions for 24\u00d77 responses to complaints are available.\nIt is also suggested that an independent, autonomous, and proactive privacy commissioner be established to make the process more transparent and monitor and prevent misuse of any information.\nAlong with the technology, the conceptualization and adoption of law and order framework policies are a steep learning curve, but it is time to recognize our shortcomings deal head-on with the challenges, and engage with the opportunities that technology has brought to our doorstep.\n\nArticle written by: Sulochana Anu"

What are the measures to combat these challenges?\n\nThe act of maintaining peace within the boundaries of a sovereign state or other self-governing areas is known as internal security, and it is typically accomplished by preserving the law of the land and fending off threats to internal security.\n\nPolice, paramilitary groups, and in rare cases, the military may be in charge of maintaining domestic security.\n\nFor India, internal security has become of utmost importance. The security concerns are getting more complicated and intensified as India advances to take the top spot in the international community.\n\nIndia\u2019s internal security is facing multiple challenges from state and non-state actors. State actors include the foreign government representative and their agencies. Non-state actors may consist of NGOs, multinational companies, terrorist and religious groups, hackers, etc.\n\nTable of Contents\n\nImportant Aspects of Internal Security\nChallenges\nChallenges Created by External State Actors\nChallenges Created by Non-State Actors\nMeasures to Combat the Challenges of Internal Security\nConclusion\nImportant Aspects of Internal Security\nUpholding the rules and laws made by the authority.\nAccepting the sovereign power of people.\nProtecting India\u2019s national sovereignty.\nSecuring the territorial integrity of India.\nPromoting India\u2019s rise to its rightful place in international affairs.\nEnsuring a peaceful internal environment within India.\nCreating a climate for our citizens that is just, equitable, prosperous, and shields them from risks to life and livelihood.\n\nThe 43rd Report to the concerned Parliamentary Standing Committee, the Ministry of Home Affairs has brought out that \u201c210 of the 535 districts in the country are affected by serious internal security problems or public disorders\u201d and almost 40 percent of areas facing serious disorders of one or the other kind.\n\n\ud83d\udc49 Which year are YOU targeting for success in the IAS/IPS/IFS Exam? \ud83d\ude80\n\n(1) \u21d2 UPSC 2025: Prelims cum Mains\n\n(2) \u21d2 UPSC 2026: Prelims cum Mains\n\n(3) \u21d2 UPSC 2027 Prelims cum Mains\n\nTip: Know more about ClearIAS Courses (Online/Offline)\n\nChallenges\n\nIndia faces various challenges to its internal security including Naxalism, Terrorism, insurgency, Separatist Movement, Illegal Migration, Cyber-driven crimes, Drug trafficking, Communalism and Growing Regional Assertiveness, Money Laundering, etc.\n\nIndia\u2019s eight northeastern states comprise 4 percent of the national population and 8 percent of India\u2019s land mass. 96 percent of the borders of these eight states are international borders with China, Bangladesh, Nepal, and Bhutan.\nThis fact gives the region, great strategic significance, well beyond its size. The creation of a conducive environment that fosters peace and security in the region is one of the topmost priorities of the Government.\nSince gaining its independence, India has fought five wars: four with Pakistan and one with China. Due in significant part to historical legacies, India\u2019s land borders are still open to external threats.\nAlong with defending its land borders, the country must also defend its extensive coastline and island holdings as they are prone to several threats by external states and non-state actors.\nChallenges Created by External State Actors\n\nA few of India\u2019s surrounding nations provide finance, training, or coordination to the insurgency organizations. For instance, it is alleged that China aids insurgents in the Northeast. Eg. ideological support by Pak Military and Islamists and Chinese support to NE groups.\n\nIn some cases, state actors have been in charge of waging cyber warfare through hacking and other forms of espionage.\n\nTo promote internal unrest and degrade India\u2019s reputation on international forums, state actors also finance their proxies inside and outside of India.\n\nPakistan: India\u2019s most significant external security challenge comes from Pakistan. The long-standing conflict over the disputed region of Jammu and Kashmir has led to a protracted insurgency. Pakistan has been accused of supporting and providing safe havens for militant groups that operate in Indian-administered Kashmir. This has resulted in terrorist attacks and cross-border infiltration.\nChina: India shares a contested border with China in the Himalayan region. Disputes over the border, particularly in areas like Doklam and Ladakh, have led to occasional tensions and skirmishes. China\u2019s assertive behavior in the region can pose a security challenge for India.\nProxy Warfare: Both Pakistan and China have been accused of using non-state actors and proxy groups to further their interests in India. These groups can carry out acts of terrorism and violence, contributing to internal security concerns.\nChallenges Created by Non-State Actors\n\nDestroying India\u2019s Unity in Diversity concept for some mere political gains and luring the population to fulfill their agenda.\n\nMultinational Corporations (MNCs) may pose a threat to national security, particularly in the areas of data security and cyberspace, as well as by influencing the laws of the countries in which they operate. It is the cause of the recent blocking of various Chinese apps in India.\n\nPotential risks to India\u2019s peaceful internal security environment include non-state organizations with anarchic and fundamentalist ideas that are incompatible with the country\u2019s reputation for secularism.\n\nBy tearing apart the socio-religious fabric of India and encouraging riots, propaganda is managed and supported by enemy nations and other non-state actors (NGOs and civil society organizations).\n\nTerrorist Organizations: Various terrorist groups, such as Lashkar-e-Taiba (LeT), Jaish-e-Mohammed (JeM), and Hizbul Mujahideen, operate in India. These groups have links to external state actors and are responsible for attacks on Indian soil. They aim to create instability and undermine India\u2019s security.\nInsurgency Movements: India faces several domestic insurgency movements in states like Jammu and Kashmir, the Northeastern states, and areas affected by left-wing extremism (Naxalism). These movements often receive support or inspiration from external non-state actors and benefit from cross-border sanctuaries.\nCyber Threats: Non-state actors, including hacktivists and cyber criminals, can pose a significant security threat in the digital domain. Cyberattacks, data breaches, and disinformation campaigns can have wide-ranging implications for India\u2019s internal security.\nTransnational Crime: Non-state criminal organizations involved in drug trafficking, human smuggling, and arms smuggling can contribute to instability and insecurity in India. These criminal networks often operate across borders and can be difficult to counter.\nReligious and Communal Extremism: Extremist groups promoting religious or communal violence can pose internal security challenges. Some of these groups have ideological or financial ties to external entities.\nEnvironmental and Climate Factors: While not typically considered non-state actors, environmental changes and natural disasters can also have security implications. Climate change-induced events, such as floods, droughts, and resource scarcity, can lead to social unrest and displacement, creating security challenges.\nMeasures to Combat the Challenges of Internal Security\n\nAddressing these challenges to India\u2019s internal security requires a multifaceted approach, including diplomatic efforts to manage relations with neighboring countries, intelligence, and law enforcement operations to counter terrorism and insurgency, cybersecurity measures to protect critical infrastructure, and efforts to address the root causes of extremism and social unrest.\n\nInternational cooperation and intelligence sharing are also crucial in countering threats from external actors and non-state entities.\nThe cooperation and communication between intelligence and law enforcement services must be effective.\nTo stop any attempts at cyberattacks, sound cybersecurity procedures must be implemented.\nFor India, a comprehensive national security doctrine needs to be established so that, even in the event of a change in leadership, there will be no ambiguity.\nThe capability of police forces to manage internal security must be improved.\nThe equipment and facilities used by the border patrol forces need to be improved.\nDelivering the right concept of nationalism to the masses so they can protect themselves from the trap of vicious activities for any kind of gain and not let them fight over non-relevant incidents.\nThe demographic balance must be preserved while illegal immigration should be minimized.\nCorruption must be eradicated with efficiency, and the right use of money allocated for development must be ensured.\nGovernment, media, and the general people should work together to facilitate the rapid and effective disclosure of information regarding questionable activities to law enforcement agencies.\nConclusion\n\nThe role of external state and non-state actors in creating challenges to internal security is immense and requires numerous multipronged actions at both national and international levels.\n\nA serious threat to the country is posed by the deterioration of the federal government, rising economic inequality, and the spread of communalism. The only way to guarantee that India is protected from both internal and external vulnerabilities is by leading the people along the path of development and secularism.\n\nMoreover, we need to have a broad understanding of national security rather than just a limited military perspective. While it is crucial to protect our borders and bolster our diplomatic efforts, we also need to keep an eye out for various non-state actors who come in hidden forms. In this hour, a national internal security doctrine is required to address a variety of issues.\n\nClick here to read more internal security notes.\n\nArticle Written By: Priti Raj"

Read further to know.\n\nRecently, the Inter-Services Organisations (Command, Control, and Discipline) Bill, 2023 was introduced in Lok Sabha.\n\nThe bill aims to provide designated military commanders with enhanced powers to ensure discipline among soldiers, irrespective of their service affiliation.\n\nThis move is particularly significant as it comes in anticipation of the establishment of integrated or joint commands, which will be under the operational control of a single three-star general from the Indian Army, Navy, or Air Force.\n\nTable of Contents\n\nKey Provisions of Inter-Services Organisations Bill\nImportance 0f Inter-Services Organisations Bill\nCurrent Status of Indian Armed Forces\nWhy Reforms in the Indian Army is Important?\nRecent news\nKey Provisions of Inter-Services Organisations Bill\n\nThe key provisions of the Inter-Services Organisations Bill are:\n\nEstablishment of Integrated Theatre Commands: The proposed legislation will ensure the requisite command and control of the existing inter-services organizations as well as the proposed integrated theatre commands that are set to be created in the coming months.\nEmpowering Military Commanders: The Bill seeks to empower the Commander-in-Chief or the Officer-in-Command of an inter-service organization to maintain discipline and ensure the proper discharge of duties of all personnel from the army, navy, and IAF serving under their command.\nEnabling Provision for Joint Services Organisations: The new bill is an enabling provision for joint services organizations, where personnel from all three services are posted. It will ensure greater coordination and communication between different military services and their commands.\nSimplification of Military Governance: At present, military personnel are governed by different acts and rules of their respective services, such as the Air Force Act, of 1950, the Army Act, of 1950, and the Navy Act, of 1957. The proposed legislation seeks to simplify military governance by establishing a uniform set of rules and regulations for all personnel serving under the Commander-in-Chief or the Officer-in-Command of an inter-service organization.\nImportance 0f Inter-Services Organisations Bill\n\nThe Inter-services Organisations Bill is important for the following reasons:\n\nIt empowers the central government to constitute an Inter-services Organisation, which may include a joint services command, comprising units or service personnel of the Air Force, Army, and Navy.\nIt allows placing these units or service personnel under the command of the Commander-in-Chief or the Officer-in-Command, streamlining command and control.\nIt solves the problem of personnel serving in inter-service organisations needing to be reverted to their parent Service units for any disciplinary or administrative action, which is time-consuming and financially cumbersome.\nIt avoids multiple proceedings under the respective Service Acts, expediting the disposal of cases, and maintaining a higher standard of discipline.\nIt leads to greater integration and joint manship among Armed Forces personnel, while also saving time and public money.\nCurrent Status of Indian Armed Forces\n\nAt present, the Indian armed forces have 17 commands, with 7 commands each of the Army and the Air Force, and 3 commands of the Navy. Each command is headed by a 4-star rank military officer.\n\n\ud83d\udc49 Which year are YOU targeting for success in the IAS/IPS/IFS Exam? \ud83d\ude80\n\n(1) \u21d2 UPSC 2025: Prelims cum Mains\n\n(2) \u21d2 UPSC 2026: Prelims cum Mains\n\n(3) \u21d2 UPSC 2027 Prelims cum Mains\n\nTip: Know more about ClearIAS Courses (Online/Offline)\n\nOne of the notable developments in recent years has been the establishment of joint commands in the Indian armed forces. The Andaman and Nicobar Command is the first tri-service theatre command of the Indian Armed Forces, based at Port Blair in the Andaman and Nicobar Islands of India.\nThe command is responsible for the security of the Andaman and Nicobar Islands and has the mandate to provide security in the Bay of Bengal and the eastern part of the Indian Ocean. The Strategic Forces Command (SFC) is the other tri-service command, which looks after the delivery and operational control of the country\u2019s nuclear assets.\nHowever, there are still challenges in integrating the armed forces. Soldiers from their respective services are governed by different Acts of Parliament, with the Navy Act of 1957, the Air Force Act of 1950, and the Army Act of 1950.\nIn a current joint services setup, an army soldier commanded by a navy officer would have to be sent back to his parent unit for any disciplinary proceedings. The navy officer does not have administrative powers over the said soldier.\nThere is an urgent need to build integrated war-fighting machinery within budgetary constraints through the creation of joint commands.\nIn addition to these joint commands, there are also some tri-service organizations such as the Defence Intelligence Agency, Defence Cyber Agency, and Defence Space Agency, which provide crucial support to the Indian armed forces in their operations.\nWhy Reforms in the Indian Army is Important?\n\nModernization: The Indian Army is still reliant on outdated equipment and technology, which puts it at a disadvantage compared to other armies. Reform is important to modernize the army and bring it up to date with the latest technology and equipment.\n\nIntegration: The Indian Army operates in silos, with the three branches \u2013 Army, Navy, and Air Force \u2013 functioning independently. Reform is important to create a more integrated and coordinated force, which can work together seamlessly to achieve common objectives.\n\nProfessionalism: The Indian Army has a reputation for being a highly professional and disciplined force. However, there have been instances of misconduct and corruption, which have tarnished its image. Reform is important to strengthen the accountability and transparency of the army, and ensure that it maintains its high standards of professionalism.\n\nHuman Resource Management: The Indian Army is facing a shortage of officers and a high attrition rate. Reform is important to address these challenges and create a more efficient and effective system for the recruitment, training, and retention of officers.\n\nStrategic Planning: The Indian Army needs to develop a long-term strategic vision that takes into account the evolving geopolitical landscape and emerging threats. Reform is important to create a more forward-looking and strategic planning process, which can help the army anticipate and respond to future challenges.\n\nJointness: The Indian Army needs to work more closely with the other branches of the armed forces, as well as with other agencies such as intelligence and law enforcement. Reform is important to create a more joint and collaborative approach, which can leverage the strengths of different agencies and create a more effective response to security challenges.\n\nRecent news\n\nThe Inter-Services Organisations (Command, Control and Discipline) Act has been notified through a Gazette Notification to be enforced with effect from May 10, 2024.\n\nTo bolster effective command, control and efficient functioning of Inter-Services Organisations (ISOs), the bill was passed by both Houses of Parliament during the Monsoon Session of 2023. The Bill received the assent of the President on August 15, 2023.\nThe Act empowers Commanders-in-Chief and Officers-in-Command of ISOs to exercise control over Service personnel, serving under them, for effective maintenance of discipline and administration, without disturbing the unique service conditions of each Service.\nWith the notification, the Act will empower the Heads of ISOs and pave the way for expeditious disposal of cases, avoid multiple proceedings and will be a step towards greater integration & jointness among the Armed Forces personnel.\n\nArticle Written By: Priti Raj"

Read here to know more about the women in the Indian armed forces.\n\nWhile seeking a job in the military, a person\u2019s gender will not stand in the way of their application. Being physically strong is less useful in modern combat than possessing the appropriate abilities and understanding.\n\nGiven that both recruiting and retention rates appear to have declined, the Indian Armed Forces are in desperate need of a robust mixed-gender force. This may be fixed by permitting women to work in combat positions.\n\nThe Indian Army decided to forbid women from holding commanding officer positions due to the dearth of women in leadership positions.

In the motherland of Rani of Jhansi, Capt. Laxmi Sehgal, Sarojini Naidu, and many others it is a matter of time about creating feminist power in the Armed Forces as well.\n\nThe founding of the Indian Military Nursing Service in 1888 was a turning point for the advancement of women\u2019s roles in the Indian Armed Services.\n\n\ud83d\udc49 Which year are YOU targeting for success in the IAS/IPS/IFS Exam? \ud83d\ude80\n\n(1) \u21d2 UPSC 2025: Prelims cum Mains\n\n(2) \u21d2 UPSC 2026: Prelims cum Mains\n\n(3) \u21d2 UPSC 2027 Prelims cum Mains\n\nTip: Know more about ClearIAS Courses (Online/Offline)\n\nIndian Army nurses participated in numerous roles during World War I.\nMoreover, the Women\u2019s Auxiliary Corps was created to enable women to work in non-combat positions like administration and communications.\nWomen spies were quite successful during the second world war.\nWhen Subhash Chandra Bose founded the Azad Hind Fauj, women could only serve in non-combat capacities in the British Indian Army.\n\nThe Army Act of 1950 forbade women from being appointed to regular commissions.\n\nThe Indian Army\u2019s Medical Corps was the first military institution to regularly appoint female troops on November 1st, 1958. Throughout the 1980s and 1990s, women were also permitted to serve on short-service commissions.\n\nThe Indian Army began inducting women in 1992. They were commissioned for five years in certain chosen streams such as the Army Education Corps, Corps of Signals, Intelligence Corps, and Corps of Engineers.\n\nBy 2020, women are not allowed to serve as combat troops in Special Forces such as the Parachute Regiment. They can still join other non-combatant wings such as the signal corps and engineers.\n\nWomen in Armed Forces\n\nCombat role in the Indian Army has for long been an exclusive domain for men. India will be among the few countries globally to have broken the gender barrier. Women have been serving in administrative and technical roles in various corps, but combat role for them, initially in the Military Police, is a new beginning.\n\nThe recent Supreme Court judgment has finally accepted gender parity in the Armed by allowing women officers in command positions.\n\nA two-decade fight to reach this milestone ended on February 17, 2020, with the Supreme Court\u2019s ground-breaking decision enforcing gender-neutral terms and conditions of service in the armed services.\nThe Supreme Court\u2019s directives are currently being carried out by the government and military forces.\n\nThe debate on women in combat roles in the Armed Forces comes up at regular intervals, although women have been in such roles in other countries earlier too.\n\nArmy\n\nThe combat employment philosophy of women in the Armed Forces is a continuously evolving process and is regularly reviewed by the Indian Army.\n\nAt present, women are being commissioned in Indian Army in ten Streams viz. Corps of Engineers, Corps of Signals, Army Air Defence, Army Service Corps, Army Ordnance Corps, Corp of Electronics and Mechanical Engineers, Army Aviation Corps, Intelligence Corps, Judge Advocate General Branch, and Army Education Corps in addition to the Armed Forces Medical Services as Doctors and Military Nurses which is a woman only entry.\nNew Avenues such as the grant of permanent commission to SSC women officers, induction of women cadets in NDA, and recruitment of Women as Provost JCOs/OR.\nNavy\n\nThe induction of women as officers in the Indian Navy commenced in the year 1991.\u00a0 Since then the Indian Navy has gradually opened all branches to women officers including induction through NDA.\n\nFor the first time women are also being recruited for sailors\u2019 entries under the Agnipath Scheme with effect from 2022 and 20% of vacancies are reserved for women.\nThe Navy has also started inducting women officers on frontline ships, earlier a no-go zone for women officers.\nAir Force\n\nOfficers\u2019 recruitment in the IAF is gender-neutral. Women officers are inducted in all the branches and streams of IAF.\n\nOpportunities for a career in IAF service are widely publicized through print/ electronic media and special publicity drives.\nAn opening has also been provided through NCC Special Entry for flying SSC (Women) from 2017 onwards.\nThe experimental scheme to induct women officers in all combat roles, initiated by the IAF in 2015 has now been regularised into a permanent scheme.\nSuch a gender-neutral approach is facilitating the employment of women officers of IAF in all combat roles without any restrictions.\nRecent developments for women in the armed forces\n\nThe military is poised to break new ground by allowing women to command teams on par with males.\n\nA Special Number 3 Selection Board convened in January 2023 screened 108 female officers out of 224 from the 1992 to 2006 batches to promote them to the rank of Colonel.\nThose chosen will soon begin holding command positions.\nIn response to the Supreme Court decision giving parity for permanent commission and promotion with their male counterparts, this selection board was created as a one-time solution to clear the backlog.\nFuture selection panels will be gender-neutral.\n\nDirect admittance as officers through the National Defence Academy and enlistment in the Corps of Military Police and Assam Rifles have also been given a slow start.\n\nAccess has been granted to the artillery, another fighting branch.\nSix female officers have completed the esteemed Defense Services Staff Course (DSSC) and Defense Services Technical Staff Course (DSTSC).\nCurrently working at Siachen Glacier is the first female officer.\nWomen have started enlisting in the military under the Agnipath program as well.\n\nHowever, women are still not allowed to join the fighting forces, including the Armoured Corps, Infantry/Mechanized Infantry, Special Forces, and merit-driven competitive entry, which would allow women to join the military on an equal footing with men as officers and soldiers as opposed to the vacancy-based entry that they can currently do.\n\nChallenges\n\nAccording to various global data, the women\u2019s labor force participation rate is about 25% compared to the global average is 47%.\n\nThe biggest challenge before the armed forces is best expressed in the observations of the Supreme Court \u2013 \u201cSeventy years after the birth of a post-colonial independent state, there is still a need for change in attitudes and mindsets to recognize the commitment to the values of the Constitution.\u201d\u00a0\n\nEquality of opportunity:\n\nThe law of the nation now mandates equal chances for men and women in the armed services.\nEducation of all ranks to embrace the change is thus the first step.\nThe military would do well to conduct a thorough investigation to establish a policy for female enlistment, training, terms and conditions, and management that takes into account the knowledge and best practices of all contemporary militaries.\n\nGender neutrality:\n\nIn addition to commanders, the armed services will need to start direct recruiting for soldiers, sailors, and airmen.\nThe ultimate objective should be a merit-based entrance system that is gender-neutral.\nGender quotas may need to be established at first for administrative reasons to build the appropriate infrastructure and promote women.\n\nPhysical fitness standards:\n\nThe physical fitness standards for women are another debatable area.\nThe armed forces need to carry out scientific studies to chalk out gender-specific or gender-neutral physical fitness standards for men and women.\nThe fact that women stand to lose a good amount of service period due to pregnancy, post-partum recovery, and motherhood, also is viewed as a disadvantage in women assuming combat roles.\n\nSexual harassment:\n\nThe armed forces will be confronted with the problem of sexual assault and harassment of women.\nDue to the masculine \u201cwarrior mentality,\u201d which does not view women as equals, this social issue expresses itself more visibly in the armed services.\nThe issue is only made worse by the proximity of men and women in the 20- to 40-year-old age range who live, train, and engage in combat.\nAccording to military experience, sexual offenses against women account for a disproportionately high proportion of all crimes.\nThe government must carry out a detailed study based on its own experience and that of other militaries to lay down policies, rules, regulations, and laws.\nWay forward\n\nThe inclusion of more women in leadership roles is one of the most crucial things that the nation should take into account while trying to solve its problems.\n\nThe nation, which aspires to be a rising power, needs to confront the ongoing problem of gender discrimination in the armed forces. In every element of their job, women should get equal treatment.\n\nThe administrative and institutional regulations concerning maternity leave and transfers should also get continuous scrutiny. India needs to change its perspective on women if it wants to accelerate economic development and enhance its standing in the world. Also, doing so will support the empowerment of women.\n\nThey would be able to interact with other countries using their foreign language abilities in addition to being able to carry out their tasks as translators. This is because the country\u2019s military is seeking individuals who are fluent in various languages.\n\nIndia has historically given rise to various notable female leaders and independence fighters. It\u2019s time for the military to build a feminist culture by following their lead. The country\u2019s military services will now be allowed to provide women the same privileges and possibilities as their male colleagues following the Supreme Court\u2019s decision to let women serve longer tenures and get promotions.\n\nTo advance gender equality and preserve the nation\u2019s security, society must undergo a constructive transformation. India will improve as a result of doing this.\n\n-Article written by Swathi Satish"

Self-loading rifles (SLR) have been used in place of their older ones.303 rifles, and the Indian Army and Jammu and Kashmir Police are conducting training exercises.\nSeven people were killed in two terrorist attacks in Rajouri, Jammu and Kashmir\u2019s Dhangri hamlet, and requests were made to resurrect Village Defense Committees (VDCs).\nIn response to the calls, the government provided self-loading rifles (SLRs) to the locals in the Jammu region and began preparing the villagers for self-defence.\nA group of people known as the Village Defense Committees is armed and prepared to fight off attackers until security authorities arrive.\nThe Union Ministry of Home Affairs authorised the new plan to establish VDGs in J&K\u2019s vulnerable districts in March 2022.\nWhat distinguishes VDGs from Village defence communities?\n\nThe Village Defence Guards currently go by the name of VDCs (VDG). The Union Ministry of Home Affairs authorised the revised plan to establish VDGs in J&K\u2019s vulnerable districts in March of last year.\n\nEach VDG will receive a gun and 100 rounds of ammo, much like a VDC member. Both the VDG and the VDC are citizen defence units that have been given weapons and ammunition to fight off attackers until security forces can arrive.\n\nThe government would pay the VDG leaders Rs 4,500 per month under the new programme, while the others will receive Rs 4,000 each. Only the Special Police Officers (SPOs) in charge of the VDCs received a monthly salary of Rs 1,500.

According to officials, the SP/SSP of the relevant district would oversee the operation of the VDGs.\n\nWhy the Village defence communities were created?\nThe 1965 and 1971 Indo-Pak Wars, when the government armed former service members and young, physically strong people in surrounding villages to stop espionage infiltration from Pakistan, served as inspiration for the idea.\nThe insurgency that began in Kashmir at the beginning of the 1990s had spread to the adjacent Doda region by the middle of the decade.\nThe Kashmiri Pandits were forced to flee the state in the early 1990s due to an increase in massacres, which pushed Hindus to move from villages to nearby towns. The Home Ministry decided to build the VDCs in 1995 to stop this migration.\nThe strategy was later expanded to other areas of the Jammu division as terrorist activity grew in the districts of Udhampur, Reasi, Rajouri, Poonch, Kathua, and Samba.\nBy the middle of the 1990s, the militancy that had started in Kashmir in the early 1990s had expanded to the nearby Doda area. Following the 1993 slaughter of 13 people in Kishtwar, there was a call for arming civilians. The Home Ministry decided to establish the VDCs in 1995 to curb this exodus after Kashmiri Pandits were forced to leave the state in the early 1990s as the killings grew and caused Hindus to move from villages to surrounding towns.\nLater, as terrorists increased their operations in the districts of Udhampur, Reasi, Rajouri, Poonch, Kathua, and Samba, the plan was extended to other parts of the Jammu division.\nVillage defence community composition\nEach VDC contained at least 10 to 15 former service members, ex-police officers, and physically fit neighbourhood kids who joined voluntarily.\nVia the district superintendent of police, at least five of them received offers of 303 rifles with 100 bullets apiece.\nThe number of firearms distributed may increase based on the volunteers\u2019 qualifications, the village\u2019s population, and its security needs as determined by the district magistrate and SSP.\nWhat was the contribution of Village defence communities in the fight against militants?\nThe VDCs were crucial in battling militancy when it peaked in most areas of the Jammu Division.\nIn locations where weak road networks prevented the entrance of security troops, they were the most feared armed organisations among insurgents.\nBecause they were familiar with the terrain, the villagers prevented numerous insurgent attacks and assisted in the capture and execution of the militants.\nThe VDCs were instrumental in battling militancy during its height in the majority of the Jammu division, particularly in areas that fell under the Chenab Valley and Pir Panjal regions, the hills of Udhampur, and the Reasi and Kathua districts.\nIn locations where weak road networks prevented the entrance of security troops, they were the most feared armed organisations among insurgents.\nBecause they were familiar with the terrain, the villagers prevented numerous insurgent attacks and assisted in the capture and execution of the militants.\nControversies relating Village defence communities\nThe VDCs had to cope with claims of extortion, murder, rape, and other crimes in addition to human rights violations in addition to their triumphs.\nFollowing the restoration of peace, there were calls for the VDCs to be dissolved in 2002 in some places.\nDue to their involvement in a criminal case or the government taking away their guns once they turned 60, the number of VDC members has substantially decreased. In addition to this, numerous VDC members have given up their guns in the absence of payment.\nBy official statistics presented on the floor of the former J&K Legislative Assembly in 2016, there were 4,248 VDCs around the state employing 27,924 citizens.\nFollowing the restoration of peace, there were calls for the VDCs to be dissolved in 2002 in some places.\nThe number of VDC members has steadily decreased over time, either as a result of their involvement in legal proceedings or the government confiscating their weapons once they reached the age of 60.\nSalwa Judum was ordered by the Supreme Court to stop receiving support from the state government and alms in 2008. (anti-Naxalite militia mobilised by the Chhattisgarh State). According to SC, it is unlawful for the state government to give a citizen access to weapons and let him kill another person.\nConclusion\nThe Village Defence Guards currently go by the name of VDCs (VDG). The Union Ministry of Home Affairs authorised the new plan to establish VDGs in J&K\u2019s vulnerable districts in March 2022. The Senior Superintendent of Police (SSP) or Superintendent of Police (SP) of the relevant district would be in charge of the VDGs\u2019 operations.\nMinorities and foreigners have been the targets of recent terrorist assaults in J&K. This targeted assassination is intended to sow discord among communities and foster an atmosphere of dread, which has given minority communities a sense of mass emigration.\nNearly all terrorists who have recently joined the ranks or are preparing to do so have killed civilians. . Formerly, full-time militants would either vanish from their areas or promote themselves online.\nHence, it was simple to find them. On the other side, it can be challenging to find these part-timers. These hybrid terrorist neo-recruits defeat surveillance with sporadic attacks, which aids Pakistan-based masterminds in maintaining their plausible deniability.\nThe majority of murders of civilians were committed using pistols. Drones were used to transport these weapons across the border. These neo-recruits received the pistols from Pakistani handlers, particularly for the attacks, and they afterwards received them back.\nThis made it convenient for them to go back to their houses in populated areas.\n\nArticle written by Aseem Muhammed"

Accommodating strategy India has taken in refugees since 1947 despite not being a signatory to the 1951 Refugee Convention. This includes Afghans, Bangladeshis, Tibetans, and so on.\nIndia\u2019s multi-religious, multicultural, and multi-ethnic nature fosters strong social ties with many foreigners. For instance, during the civil war, the Tamilian Bond led Sri Lankan Tamils to consider emigrating to India. Similarly, the affinity between Manipur and Myanmar is drawing migrants from Myanmar to India.\nAlthough not have a direct impact, they make it easier to go to India. The open border allowed a large number of people from Myanmar to enter India.\nThe government\u2019s instruction to stop the flow of refugees from Myanmar was not carried out successfully. With only three battalions, the Assam Rifles were unable to properly patrol the border.\nThe vast majority of Myanmar refugees are remaining in the area governed by the Free Movement Regime. According to an agreement between the two countries, there is unfettered access to a territory of 16 km on either side.\nSince their founding, India\u2019s neighbouring nations have been dealing with a variety of issues.\nIn Sri Lanka, for instance, human rights violations now occur after the civil war. Similar events include the Bangladesh Liberation War and the military dictatorship that followed.\nArguments for permitting the Refugee Influx\nIndia is implicitly required by the UDHR to defend non-citizens\u2019 human rights as well. As a result, refugees who face persecution should be permitted entry into India.\nArmed rebel groups have threatened the Myanmar military with reprisal if the atrocities continue. More animosity will be created if India sends the Myanmarese back, maybe starting a civil war.\nThe nation\u2019s aspiration to be a responsible regional and global force necessitates taking a welcoming attitude toward refugees.\nIt is the duty of the biggest democracy in the world to defend the rights of those who risk their lives to safeguard democracy.\nCounter arguments for allowing the Refugee Inflow\n\nThe influx of refugees presents various difficulties for India\u2019s internal security. This comprises,\n\nSocial repercussions of accepting refugees: Indigenous people may experience an identity crisis as a result of the refugees. For instance, the native population of Assam and Arunachal is in danger of being replaced by Bangladeshi refugees.\nAfter a few years, it is challenging to locate them and deport them back to their country. The Rohingya refugees, for instance, entered through the Northeast. Later, though, they expanded to every state.\nIncreased state financial accountability. In 2014, there were more than 200,000 refugees in India, according to a UNHCR report. India currently lacks the financial resources necessary to meet all of its fundamental demands.\nLowers domestic wage levels and displaces natives Due to their need for food and shelter, illegal immigrants and refugees also work in settlement areas for extremely little pay.\n\u00a0Since governments have not welcomed them, these refugees are at risk of working for and receiving money from terrorist organisations.\n\nAlso read: Brain Drain: The Great Indian Migration\n\nIndia\u2019s Current Legal Framework for Handling Refugees\n\nAccording to the Foreigners Act of 1946, India treats all foreigners equally, whether they are legal immigrants, refugees, or asylees, or have overstayed their visas:\n\nThe Central government is given the authority to find, arrest, and deport unauthorised foreign nationals under Section 3.\nArticle 258(1) of the Indian Constitution allows for the removal of an unlawful foreigner by force, according to Section 5 of the Passport (Entry into India) Act, 1920.\nAll foreign nationals (except Indian citizens living abroad) entering India on a long-term visa (more than 180 days) are required by law to register with a registration officer within 14 days of their arrival. This is in accordance with the Registration of Foreigners Act of 1939.\n1955\u2019s Citizenship Act included citizenship renunciation, termination, and deprivation provisions.\nAdditionally, the Citizenship Amendment Act, 2019 (CAA) aims to offer citizenship solely to immigrants who were persecuted in Bangladesh, Pakistan, and Afghanistan who are Hindu, Christian, Jain, Parsi, Sikh, or Buddhist.\nIdeas for addressing the refugee issue\nFirst and foremost, India should present its persuasive justifications for the Myanmar coup at the impending UNSC conference. Here, it is possible to suggest that Myanmar be subject to international sanctions.\nA thorough refugee strategy is also required in order to distinguish between refugees and illegal immigrants with better clarity.\nIt is possible to appoint a National Immigration Commission to draught India\u2019s National Migration Policy and National Refugee Policy.\nThirdly, the government must reinforce the Foreigners Act of 1946 and arrange bilateral deportation agreements with nearby nations.\nFourth, the states need to work with the centre to solve the refugee issue. Because international relations go under the Union list while law and order are listed under the state list.\nFifth, the states must use the Ministry of Home Affairs 2018 standards to find illegal immigrants.\nRestrictions on illegal immigrants in certain areas in accordance with the legislation.\nObtaining their biographical and biometric information.\nRenewal of fake Indian documents.\nStarting legal processes, such as deportation proceedings, in accordance with the law.\nConclusion\n\nPeople who are requesting shelter are in a difficult position and perceive a sliver of hope in a welcoming and open nation. Given this, there should be a refugee intake, but not at the expense of the local population. Therefore, it is imperative that India establish a defined refugee policy.\n\nArticle Written By: Atheena Fathima Riyas"

Individuals, organizations, institutions, and governments can be victims of an attack.\n\nModes of Cyber Attack\nLock data and processes, and demand a ransom.\nRemove vital information to cause serious harm.\nSteal information.\nPublicly expose private information.\nHalter vital business processes and systems from running, to cause disruption and malfunction.\nCyber Security\n\nCybersecurity refers to technologies, processes, and training that protect systems, networks, programs, and data from cyberattacks, damage, and unauthorized access.\n\nCyber Threat Landscape\n\nThe digital landscape is usually the entry point for a cyberattack. These can include:\n\nEmail\nSocial media\nMobile devices\nThe organization\u2019s technology infrastructure\nCloud services\nCitizenry\nAttack vectors\n\nAn attack vector is an entry point or route for an attacker to gain access to a system.\n\nSecurity breaches come in different forms:\n\nSocial engineering attacks\n\nAttackers use social engineering to exploit or manipulate users into granting them unauthorized access to a system.\n\nIn social engineering, impersonation attacks happen when an unauthorized user (the attacker), aims to gain the trust of an authorized user by posing as a person of authority to access a system.\n\nFor example, a cybercriminal pretending to be a support engineer tricks a user into revealing their password to access an organization\u2019s systems.\n\nBrowser attacks\n\nSecurity vulnerabilities in a browser can have a significant impact because of their pervasiveness.\n\nFor example, if a user is working on an important project with a looming deadline. They want to figure out how to solve a particular problem for their project and find a website that they believe will provide a solution.\n\nThe website asks the user to make some changes to their browser settings so they can install an add-on. The user follows the instructions on the website thus making the browser compromised. The attacker can now use the browser to steal information, monitor user behavior, or compromise a device.\n\nPassword attacks\n\nA password attack is when someone attempts to use authentication for a password-protected account to gain unauthorized access to a device or system. Attackers often use software to speed up the process of cracking and guessing passwords.\n\nThe brute force attack and is one of many ways in which a cybercriminal can use password attacks.\n\n\u00a0Data Breach\n\nA data breach is when an attacker successfully gains access or control of data similar to that person getting access to, or stealing, vital documents and information inside the building:\n\nHere, the victim\u2019s data could be abused in many ways. For example, it can be held as ransom or used to cause financial or reputational harm.\n\nMalware\n\nMalware comes from the combination of the words malicious and software. It\u2019s a piece of software used by cybercriminals to infect systems and carry out actions that will cause harm. This could include stealing data or disrupting normal usage and processes.\n\nMalware has two main components:\n\nPropagation mechanism\nPayload\nWhat is a propagation mechanism?\n\nPropagation is about how the malware spreads itself across one or more systems.\n\nfew examples of common propagation techniques:\n\nVirus\n\nIn biology, a virus enters the human body, and once inside, can spread and cause harm.\n\nTechnology-based viruses depend on some means of entry, specifically a user action, to get into a system. Say, a user might download a file or plug in a USB device that contains the virus, and contaminates the system. You now have a security breach.\n\nWorm\n\nIn contrast to a virus, a worm doesn\u2019t need any user action to spread itself across systems. Instead, a worm causes damage by finding vulnerable systems it can exploit. Once inside, the worm can spread to other connected systems.\n\nFor example, a worm might infect a device by exploiting a vulnerability in an application that runs on it. The worm can then spread across other devices in the same network and other connected networks.\n\nTrojan\n\nA trojan horse attack gets its name from classical history, where soldiers hid inside a wooden horse that was gifted to the Trojans. When the Trojans brought the wooden horse into their city, the soldiers emerged from the wooden horse and attacked.\n\nIn the context of cybersecurity, a trojan is a type of malware that pretends to be genuine software. When a user installs the program, it can pretend to be working as mentioned, but the program also secretly performs malicious actions such as stealing information.\n\nPayload\n\nThe payload is the action that malware performs on an infected device or system.\n\nSome common types of payload:\n\nRansomware\nIt\u2019s a payload that locks systems or data until the victim has paid a ransom.\nA cybercriminal can exploit this to access and then encrypt all files across this network.\nThe attacker demands a ransom in return for decrypting the files.\nThey threaten to remove all the files if the ransom hasn\u2019t been paid by a set deadline.\nSpyware\nIt spies on a device or system.\nThe malware may install keyboard scanning software on a user\u2019s device, collect password details, and transmit them back to the attacker, without the user\u2019s knowledge.\nBackdoors\nA backdoor is a payload that enables a cybercriminal to exploit a system or device to bypass existing security measures and cause harm.\nIt\u2019s a backdoor that the cybercriminal could use to hack into the application, the device in which it\u2019s running on, and even the organization\u2019s and customers\u2019 networks and systems.\nBotnet\nA botnet joins a computer, server, or another device to a network of similarly infected devices that can be controlled remotely to carry out some nefarious action.\nA common application of botnet malware is crypto-mining. In this case, the malware connects a device to a botnet that consumes the device\u2019s computing power to mine or generates cryptocurrencies.\nA user might notice their computer is running slower than normal and getting worse with time.\nMitigation strategy\n\nTo defend against cyberattacks, technological and organizational policies and processes can be designed and implemented.\n\nMany different mitigation strategies are available to an organization:\n\nMultifactor authentication\n\nConventionally, if someone\u2019s password or username is compromised, this allows a cybercriminal to gain control of the account. But multifactor authentication was introduced to combat this.\n\nMultifactor authentication works by requiring a user to provide multiple forms of identification to verify that they are who they claim to be.\n\nThe most common form of identification used to verify or authenticate a user is a password which represents something the user knows.\n\nTwo other authentication methods provide something to the user such as a fingerprint or retinal scan (a biometric form of authentication), or provide something the user has, such as a phone, hardware key, or other trusted device. Multifactor authentication employs two or more of these forms of proof to verify a valid user.\n\nFor example, a bank might require a user to provide security codes sent to their mobile device, in addition to their username and password, to access their online account.\n\nBrowser security\n\nWe all rely on browsers to access the internet to work and carry out our daily tasks. As the attackers can even compromise poorly secured browsers. Organizations can protect against these types of attacks by implementing security policies that:\n\nPrevent the installation of unauthorized browser extensions or add-ons.\nAllow only permitted browsers to be installed on devices.\nBlock sites using web content filters.\nKeep updating browsers\nEducate\n\nSocial engineering attacks rely on the vulnerabilities of humans to cause harm.\n\nOrganizations can defend against social engineering attacks by educating their staff.\n\nUsers should learn how to recognize malicious content they receive or encounter, and know what to do when they spot something suspicious. For example, organizations can teach users to:\n\nIdentify suspicious elements in a message.\nAvoid responding to external requests for personal information.\nLock devices when they\u2019re not in use.\nStore, share, and remove data according to the organization\u2019s policies.\nThreat intelligence\n\nThe threat landscape can be vast.\n\nOrganizations need to take as many measures as possible to monitor, prevent, defend against attacks, and even identify possible vulnerabilities before cybercriminals use them to carry out attacks.\n\nHence, the users need to use threat intelligence.\n\nThreat intelligence enables an organization to collect systems information, details about vulnerabilities and information on attacks\nThe organization can then implement policies for security, devices, user access, and more, to defend against cyberattacks.\nThe collection of information to gain insights, and respond to cyberattacks, is known as threat intelligence.\nOrganizations can use technological solutions to implement threat intelligence across their systems.\nThe threat intelligent solutions automatically collect information, and even hunt and respond to attacks and vulnerabilities.\n\nThese are just some of the mitigation strategies that organizations can take to protect against cyberattacks.\n\nMitigation strategies enable an organization to take a robust approach to cybersecurity.

            "[CONTENT]": "What is money laundering and what are its preventive methods? What are the challenges in the prevention of money laundering? Read here to know more about this topic.\n\nMoney Laundering is a heinous crime that not only affects the social and economic fabric of the country but also tends to promote other serious offenses like terrorism and drug trafficking etc.\n\nIt is a growing problem that needs to be addressed and the Prevention of Money Laundering Act was enacted in response to India\u2019s global commitment to combat the menace of money laundering.\n\nTable of Contents\n\nWhat is Money laundering?\nSome of the common methods of money laundering are:\nMeasures for prevention of Money laundering\nStatutory framework\nPrevention of Money Laundering Act (PMLA) 2002\nThe objective of the Act\nIts salient features include:\nEnforcement apparatus\nInstitutional framework\nInternational Cooperation\nEffects of Money Laundering\nChallenges in the prevention of Money laundering\nWay forward\nConclusion\nWhat is Money laundering?\n\nMoney laundering is the process of making large amounts of money generated by criminal activity \u2013 such as drug trafficking, terrorist funding, corruption, etc \u2013 appear to have come from a legitimate source.\n\nThe basic money laundering process has three steps:\n\nPlacement: At this point, the launderer deposits the dirty money into a legitimate financial institution. This is frequently in the form of cash as bank deposits. This is the most dangerous stage of the laundering process because large amounts of cash are visible, and banks must report high-value transactions.\nLayering: This entails sending money through various financial transactions in order to alter its form and make it difficult to track. Layering can include several bank-to-bank transfers, wire transfers between different accounts in different names in different countries, making deposits and withdrawals to constantly vary the amount of money in the accounts, changing the currency of the money, and purchasing high-value items (boats, houses, cars, diamonds) to change the form of the money. This is the most complicated step in any laundering scheme, and it all revolves around making the original dirty money as difficult to trace as possible.\nIntegration: At the integration stage, the money appears to come from a legal transaction and re-enters the mainstream economy. A final bank transfer into the account of a local business in which the launderer is \u201cinvesting\u201d in exchange for a cut of the profits, the sale of a yacht purchased during the layering stage, or the purchase of a $10 million screwdriver from a company owned by the launderer are all examples of this. The criminal can now use the money without being caught. If there is no documentation from the previous stages, catching a launderer during the integration stage is extremely difficult.\nSome of the common methods of money laundering are:\nSmurfing: This method involves dividing large sums of money into smaller, less suspicious amounts. The money is then deposited into one or more bank accounts over time by multiple people (smurfs) or by a single person.\nOverseas banks: Money launderers frequently transfer funds through various \u201coffshore accounts\u201d in countries with bank secrecy laws. Hundreds of bank transfers to and from offshore banks can be involved in a complex scheme. The Bahamas, Bahrain, the Cayman Islands, Hong Kong, Panama, and Singapore are among the \u201cmajor offshore centers,\u201d according to the International Monetary Fund.\nShell companies: These are fake companies that exist solely to launder money. They accept dirty money as \u201cpayment\u201d for ostensible goods or services but provide none; they simply create the appearance of legitimate transactions through forged invoices and balance sheets.\nInvesting in legitimate businesses: Launderers will sometimes wash dirty money in otherwise legitimate businesses. They may use large businesses, such as brokerage firms, where the dirty money blends in easily, or they may use small, cash-intensive businesses, such as bars, car washes, strip clubs, or check-cashing stores. These companies could be \u201cfront companies\u201d that provide a good or service but their true purpose is to clean the launderer\u2019s money. This method typically works in one of two ways: the launderer can combine his dirty money with the company\u2019s clean revenues, in which case the company reports higher revenues from its legitimate business than it actually earns; or the launderer can simply hide his dirty money in the company\u2019s legitimate bank accounts in the hopes that authorities will not compare the bank balance to the company\u2019s financial statements.\nHawala: A different or parallel remittance system is hawala. It exists and functions independently from or concurrently with \u201ctraditional\u201d banking or financial channels. The majority of money-laundering schemes use a combination of these techniques. This crime is challenging to eradicate due to the variety of tools available to money launderers.\nMeasures for prevention of Money laundering\n\nThere are various statutory frameworks to prevent money laundering such as PMLA, SAFEMA, NDPSA, FEMA, COFEPOSA etc. Everything will be discussed below.\n\nStatutory framework\n\nBefore the Prevention of Money Laundering Act of 2002 (PMLA) was passed in India, the main statutes that included measures to address the issue of money laundering were:\n\n\ud83d\udc49 Which year are YOU targeting for success in the IAS/IPS/IFS Exam? \ud83d\ude80\n\n(1) \u21d2 UPSC 2025: Prelims cum Mains\n\n(2) \u21d2 UPSC 2026: Prelims cum Mains\n\n(3) \u21d2 UPSC 2027 Prelims cum Mains\n\nTip: Know more about ClearIAS Courses (Online/Offline)\n\nThe Income Tax Act, 1961\nThe Conservation of Foreign Exchange and Prevention of Smuggling Activities Act, 1974 (COFEPOSA)\nThe Smugglers and Foreign Exchange Manipulators Act, 1976 (SAFEMA)\nThe Narcotic Drugs and Psychotropic Substances Act, 1985 (NDPSA)\nThe Benami Transactions (Prohibition) Act, 1988\nThe Prevention of Illicit Traffic in Narcotic Drugs and Psychotropic Substances Act, 1988\nThe Foreign Exchange Management Act, 2000, (FEMA)\nPrevention of Money Laundering Act (PMLA) 2002\n\nThe Prevention of Money Laundering Bill was introduced in 1998 and passed in 2002 in response to the urgent need for the adoption of comprehensive legislation for the prevention of money laundering and related activities, confiscation of proceeds of crime, the establishment of agencies and mechanisms for coordinating measures for combating money laundering, etc. Taking effect on July 1st, 2005, the Act was put into law.\n\nThe objective of the Act\nTo prevent money laundering.\nTo provide for confiscation of property derived from, or involved in, money laundering.\nFor matters connected therewith or incidental thereto.\nIt forms the core of the legal framework put in place by India to combat money laundering.\nIts salient features include:\nDefines Money laundering.\nExpanded the reach of the Act by adding many more crimes under various legislations: It lists specific offenses that would fall under this Act\u2019s purview under the IPC, the Narcotic Drugs and Psychotropic Substances Act, the Arms Act, the Wild Life (Protection) Act, the Immoral Traffic (Prevention) Act, and the Prevention of Corruption Act.\nIn instances of cross-border money laundering, it enables the Central Government to implement the UN Convention against Corruption\u2019s provisions by returning the confiscated property to the requesting nation.\nIt aims to include certain financial institutions in the Act\u2019s reporting requirements, including Full Fledged Money Changers, Money Transfer Services, and Master Card.\nEnforcement apparatus\nAdjudicating Authority: The Act gives the Central Government the authority to establish an adjudicating authority with a chairman and two other members and to specify the authority\u2019s mandate and other terms of service. The Authority has been given independent authority to control its adjudicating process.\nAdministrator: The property laundered will be taken care of i.e. managed after confiscation by an Administrator who will act in accordance with the instructions of the Central Government.\nAppellate Tribunal: An Appellate Tribunal established by the Central Government will hear all appeals from decisions made by the Adjudicating Authority. It will have two members, and the chairman will be in charge.\nSpecial Courts: An Appellate Tribunal established by the Central Government will hear all appeals from decisions made by the Adjudicating Authority. It will have two members, and the chairman will be in charge.\nBanking companies, financial institutions, and intermediaries are required by the PMLA and the rules thereunder to confirm the identity of their clients, keep records, and provide information to FIU-IND.\nInstitutional framework\nEnforcement Directorate: Investigation and prosecution of cases under the PMLA have been entrusted to Enforcement Directorate.\nFinancial Intelligence Unit \u2013 India (FIU-IND): established in 2004 to serve as the primary national organization in charge of gathering, analyzing, and disseminating data about improbable financial transactions. As part of its mission to further the international fight against money laundering and related crimes, FIU-IND is also in charge of coordinating and bolstering the efforts of national and international intelligence, investigation, and enforcement agencies.\nInternational Cooperation\nThe Financial Action Task Force (FATF): The G7 summit in Paris in 1989 led to the creation of the FATF, an intergovernmental organization. The Financial Action Task Force (FATF) is a \u201cpolicy-making body\u201d that works to create the political will needed to bring about national legislative and regulatory reforms in order to combat money laundering, terrorist financing, and other related threats to the integrity of the global financial system.\nThe Asia/Pacific Group on Money Laundering (APG) was a self-contained regional anti-money laundering organization. The APG\u2019s mission is to facilitate the adoption, implementation, and enforcement of internationally accepted anti-money laundering and anti-terrorist financing standards outlined in the Financial Action Task Force\u2019s recommendations (FATF).\nThe Vienna Convention/ United Nations Convention against Illicit Trafficking in Drugs and Psychotropic Substances: In December 1988, it was the first major initiative in the prevention of money laundering. By requiring member states to criminalize the laundering of money from drug trafficking, this convention laid the groundwork for efforts to combat money laundering.\nThe Council of Europe Convention: In 1990, this convention established a common policy on money laundering. It establishes a common definition of money laundering as well as common measures to combat it.\nBasel Committee Minimum standards: The Basel Committee on Banking Regulations and Supervisory Practices is made up of representatives from the central banks and supervisory authorities of eleven major industrialized nations as well as Luxembourg. In 1998, the committee issued a statement of principles aimed at combating money laundering.\nEffects of Money Laundering\nSocio-cultural effects: Money laundering success encourages criminals to continue their illegal schemes\u2014more fraud, more drugs on the streets, more drug-related crime, and so on.\nTerrorism: Money laundering is a major source of terrorism financing. Terrorists have demonstrated adaptability and opportunism in meeting their funding needs.\nOrganized crime can infiltrate financial institutions, acquire control of large sectors of the economy through investment, or offer bribes to public officials and indeed governments.\nEconomic effects\nIt\u2019s estimated that money launderers scrub as much as $2 trillion (or 5 per cent of the world\u2019s GDP) every year.\nMassive influxes of dirty cash into particular areas of the economy that are desirable to money launderers create false demand.\nLegitimate small businesses cannot compete with money-laundering front companies that can afford to sell a product at a lower price because their primary goal is to clean money rather than make a profit.\nChallenges in the prevention of Money laundering\nIncreased use of digital currency: The rise of cryptocurrency allows money launderers to conceal their illicit funds. Estimates suggest that criminals have used the hyper-connected cryptocurrency ecosystem to launder more than $2.5 billion in dirty Bitcoin since 2009.\nPreference for cash over digital payments for transactions: The use of cash will ease the process of \u201clayering\u201d.\nLack of awareness about the seriousness of crimes of money laundering: Instead of going through lengthy paperwork transactions in banks, the poor and illiterate prefer the Hawala system, which has fewer formalities, little or no documentation, lower rates, and anonymity.\nLenience from banks: Increasing competition in the financial market is forcing banks to lower their guards, allowing money launderers to use it illicitly in furtherance of their crime.\nCollusion by employees of financial institutions: Financial institutions are supposed to check the source of funds, monitor account activity, and track irregular transactions, but the involvement of financial institution employees makes laundering easier.\nLack of comprehensive enforcement agencies: Money laundering is no longer limited to a single area of operation, but has broadened to include many different areas of operation. In India, there are separate wings of law enforcement dealing with money laundering, terrorist crimes, economic offenses, and so on, and they lack coordination.\nThe widespread act of smuggling: There are a number of black market channels in India for the purpose of selling goods, with many imported consumers buying goods such as food, electronics, and so on. Black merchants conduct cash transactions and avoid customs duties, allowing them to offer lower prices than regular merchants.\nTax Heaven Countries: Strict financial secrecy laws by tax heaven countries incentivize the creation of anonymous accounts in these countries by launderers.\nWay forward\nMeasures are needed to address the risk of cryptocurrency in money laundering.\nTax heavens need to build a balance between financial confidentiality and this confidentiality turning to a money-laundering haven.\nSensitize the masses about the ill effects of laundering.\nPrior to the launch of new products, business practices, or the use of new or developing technologies, financial institutions should conduct a risk assessment.\nImplement FATF Recommendations which sets out a comprehensive and consistent framework. Some of them are:\nIdentify the risks; develop policies and domestic coordination to mitigate money laundering and terrorist financing risks.\nMoney laundering should be criminalized in accordance with the Vienna Convention and the Palermo Convention, which ensure that financial institution secrecy laws do not impede the implementation of the FATF Recommendations.\nApply the crime of money laundering to all serious offenses, with a view to including the widest range of predicate offenses.\nImplement targeted financial sanctions regimes to comply with UN Security Council resolutions on the prevention, suppression, and financing of terrorism.\nExamine the sufficiency of laws and regulations governing non-profit organizations, which the country has identified as vulnerable to terrorist financing abuse.\nApply preventive measures for the financial sector and other designated sectors.\nFinancial institutions should be required to keep all necessary records on domestic and international transactions for at least five years in order to respond quickly to information requests from competent authorities.\nEstablish authorities\u2019 powers and responsibilities (e.g., investigative, law enforcement, and supervisory authorities), as well as other institutional measures.\nCountries should have anti-money laundering policies and should designate an authority that is responsible for such policies.\nProvide mutual legal assistance in the case of money laundering and effectively carry out extradition requests in the case of money laundering and terrorist financing.\nConclusion\n\nThe threat posed by this scheme necessitates advanced laws to prevent it from occurring, such as the use of AI and large intelligence databases at the government level.\n\nThis is not a threat that is limited to national borders but affects the entire world, so both national and international stakeholders must work together to tackle it.\n\nRead: Extradition Treaties of India\n\nArticle Written by: Remya"

It has changed how we interact with others, make new acquaintances, share information, engage in entertainment, and shop.\n\nThe majority of our daily activities are being impacted by them.\u00a0We virtually communicate with billions of online users around the world through cyberspace.\n\nCybercrimes including cyberstalking, cyberbullying, cyberharassment, child pornography, rape content, etc., targeting women and children, in particular, are fast rising along with the usage of cyberspace.\n\nEducation is one of the major sectors for dissemination of information on the prevention of cyber-crimes and reaffirmed that students can act, as a force multiplier to establish an ecosystem for cyber security and to prevent cyber crimes.\n\nAlso read: Atomic Clocks: One-Nation One-Time\n\nTable of Contents\n\n\ud83d\udc49 Which year are YOU targeting for success in the IAS/IPS/IFS Exam? \ud83d\ude80\n\n(1) \u21d2 UPSC 2025: Prelims cum Mains\n\n(2) \u21d2 UPSC 2026: Prelims cum Mains\n\n(3) \u21d2 UPSC 2027 Prelims cum Mains\n\nTip: Know more about ClearIAS Courses (Online/Offline)\n\nWhat is Cyber Warfare?\nCyber-attacks in India\nIndia\u2019s cyber security\nChallenges to India\u2019s cyber security\nGovernment Initiatives Related to Cyber Security\nWay forward\nWhat is Cyber Warfare?\n\nSubscribe to the ClearIAS YouTube Channel for more informative videos on UPSC preparation, tips, and strategies. Stay updated with our latest content and enhance your exam readiness.\n\nA cyberattack or series of attacks that target a nation is typically referred to as cyberwarfare. It can destroy civilian and governmental infrastructure and interfere with vital processes, causing harm to the state and possibly even fatalities.\n\nThe majority of the time, nation-states engage in cyber warfare by attacking other nations, but occasionally, terrorist groups or non-state actors carry out the assaults to further the objectives of an adversary state.\n\nThere have been many reported instances of cyber warfare in recent years, but there is no established definition of what constitutes an act of war in the context of a cyber strike.\n\nThere are 7 main types of cyber warfare attacks:\n\nEspionage: Refers to monitoring other countries to steal secrets. In cyber warfare, this can involve using botnets or spear phishing attacks to compromise sensitive computer systems before exfiltrating sensitive information.\nSabotage: Government organizations must determine sensitive information and the risks if it is compromised. Hostile governments or terrorists may steal information, destroy it, or leverage insider threats such as dissatisfied or careless employees, or government employees with affiliation to the attacking country.\nDenial-of-service (DoS) Attacks: DoS attacks prevent legitimate users from accessing a website by flooding it with fake requests and forcing the website to handle these requests. This type of attack can be used to disrupt critical operations and systems and block access to sensitive websites by civilians, military and security personnel, or research bodies.\nElectrical Power Grid: Attacking the power grid allows attackers to disable critical systems, disrupt infrastructure, and potentially result in bodily harm. Attacks on the power grid can also disrupt communications and render services such as text messages and communications unusable.\nPropaganda Attacks: Attempts to control the minds and thoughts of people living in or fighting for a target country. Propaganda can be used to expose embarrassing truths, spread lies to make people lose trust in their country, or side with their enemies.\nEconomic Disruption: Most modern economic systems operate using computers. Attackers can target computer networks of economic establishments such as stock markets, payment systems, and banks to steal money or block people from accessing the funds they need.\nSurprise Attacks: These are the cyber equivalent of attacks like Pearl Harbor and 9/11. The point is to carry out a massive attack that the enemy isn\u2019t expecting, enabling the attacker to weaken their defenses. This can be done to prepare the ground for a physical attack in the context of hybrid warfare.\nCyber-attacks in India\nRecently, the servers of Delhi AIIMS were compromised due to a ransomware cyber-attack. The personal data of millions of patients in the top premier medical institute is at risk after a ransomware attack on its servers.\nIn February 2022, Air India experienced a major cyberattack that compromised approximately 4.5 million customer records. Passport, ticket, and some credit card information were compromised.\nIn 2020, approximately 82% of Indian companies suffered ransomware attacks.\nIn 2021, A high-profile India-based payment company, Juspay, suffered a data breach impacting 35 million customers. This breach is very noteworthy because Juspay handles payments for online marketplaces, including Amazon and other big players.\nIn May 2017, the top five cities in India (Kolkata, Delhi, Bhubaneswar, Pune, and Mumbai) got impacted due to the WannaCry ransomware attack.\nIndia\u2019s cyber security\n\nA simultaneous surge in cyber risks has grown more worrisome as India\u2019s internet base expands, with over 900 internet users anticipated by 2025. With the development of digital technology, cybercrimes are becoming more sophisticated as well.\n\nIndia must therefore carefully assess the vulnerabilities in its cyberspace and address them holistically through a more thorough Cyber-Security Policy.\n\nA cyber and information security division operates under the aegis of the Ministry of home affairs which deals with matters relating to Cyber Security, Cyber Crime, National Information Security Policy & Guidelines (NISPG), and implementation of NISPG, NATGRID, etc.\n\nIt has the following wings:\n\nCoordination wing\nCyber-crime wing\nInformation security\nMonitoring unit\nCyber-crime coordination center\nChallenges to India\u2019s cyber security\nDevices used for internet access are not all the same:\nNot everyone in India can buy pricey phones due to the wide range of economic levels.\nApple holds a market share of nearly 44% in the US. Less than 1% of mobile users in India, despite the greater security standards, use iPhones.\nIt is becoming increasingly difficult for regulators to define legal and technical requirements for data protection due to the growing security gap between high-end mobile devices like the iPhone and less expensive ones.\nLack of a national-level architecture for cybersecurity:\nThe military has its firefighting organizations, while critical infrastructure is owned by the commercial sector.\nTo analyze the nature of any danger and effectively counter it, all of these agencies must work together as part of a national security architecture, which does not yet exist.\nThe Prime Minister\u2019s Office has established a position in support of this cause, although India still lacks the required infrastructure.\nLack of separation:\nUnlike countries or governments, cyberspace has no borders, making it possible for cyberattacks to come from anywhere on the armed forces, digital assets of ONGC, banking operations, etc.\nThis might lead to national security lapses that cost money, property, or even lives.\nThere is a need for a technically advanced multi-agency organization that can base its judgments on policy inputs and a strong strategy to respond to potential threats to the nation\u2019s most valuable resources.\nLack of awareness:\nSince there is no national regulatory policy in place for cybersecurity, both businesses and individuals lack awareness.\nOnly in the presence of a regulated and overseen legislative framework can domestic internet users defend themselves and receive protection from cyberattacks.\nGovernment Initiatives Related to Cyber Security\nIndian Cyber Crime Coordination Centre (I4C)\nIndian Computer Emergency Response Team (CERT-In)\nCyber Surakshit Bharat\nCyber Swachhta Kendra\nNational Cyber Security Coordination Centre (NCCC)\nNational Cyber security policy 2013\nWay forward\n\nThe government must harness and refocus efforts on the strategic use of India\u2019s highly qualified IT workforce.\n\nIf the government offered incentives to the sector, the private sector would be more likely to invest in a national cybersecurity agency. Future Indian firms will be more competitive on a global scale and build a safer digital India with enhanced cybersecurity defenses.\n\nAll public and commercial organizations that deal with personal data should be forced to follow strict data protection guidelines.\n\nThe young population can work as a force multiplier to be conscious of their participation in cyberspace, establish an ecosystem for cyber security, and prevent cybercrimes, which is why education is one of the crucial sectors for disseminating knowledge on the prevention of cybercrimes.\n\n-Article written by Swathi Satish"

The recent increase in hate crimes has also triggered debates about the need for separate legislation to protect minorities against lynching and hate crimes.\u00a0\n\nSome of the main problems faced by minorities in India are as follows:\u00a0\n\nThe problem of identity- Because of the differences in socio-cultural practices, history, and backgrounds, minorities have to grapple with the issue of identity everywhere which gives rise to the problem of adjustment with the majority community.\nThe problem of Security: Different identity and their small number relative to the rest of society develops a feeling of insecurity about their life, assets, and well-being. This sense of insecurity may get accentuated at times when relations between the majority and the minority communities in society are strained or not very cordial.\nThe problem of equity:- The minority community in society may remain deprived of the benefit of opportunities for development as a result of discrimination. Because of the difference in identity, the minority community develops the perception of the sense of inequity. Religion is a complex phenomenon in India. Though India is declared a \u2018secular\u2019 state, the problem of secularism looms large here. Conversion to Islam and Christianity has been a controversial issue over the last couple of decades.\nVaried reasons:\u2014ranging from poverty to perceived discrimination resulted in the alienation of Muslims and Christians in India. The Government of India constituted a committee on 9th March 2005 under the chairmanship of Justice Rajendra Sachar to enquire and analyze the problems faced especially by Muslims in India.\nEconomic reasons Indian socio-economic fabric is very complex because it is much affected by caste, religion, and the more regional/linguistic differentials. At the same time, the Indian economic, social, and political institutions which are persisted for centuries have a historical basis also. These factors have given a unique character to Indian society. It has become a conglomeration of various layers and segments divided and sub-divided.\nBackwardness:- Minority communities are unable to join the mainstream of society. Sachar Committee which was constituted in 2005 has placed Muslims below the scheduled castes, and scheduled tribes.\nThe problem of Representation:- In terms of religious composition, 90.4% of MPs in Loksabha are Hindus. 5.2% are Muslims and another religious community represents 4% MPS. Muslims contribute only 2.5% of the Indian bureaucracy.\nLack of Clear definition:- There was no clear definition for the minority which creates a huge flaw. Inclusion and exclusion error occurs in the implementation of Government schemes. Recently a PIL was filed in the Supreme Court regarding this matter.\n\nAll of the above problems generate a trust deficit between the Minorities, which is harmful to the Unity and integrity of the country\n\nAlso read: Welfare Schemes for Minorities in India\n\nConstitutional Provisions for Minorities in India\n\nThe Constitution of India lists down a few important mandates with regard to Minorities in India. Discussed below are the same in brief:\n\nProtection under Fundamental Rights:\nArticle 15 (1) & (2) \u2013 Prohibition of discrimination against citizens on grounds of religion, race, caste, sex or place of birth\nArticle 16(1)&(2) \u2013 Citizens\u2019 right to equality of opportunity in matters relating to employment or appointment to any office under the State\nArticle 25(1) \u2013 People\u2019s freedom of conscience and right to freely profess, practice and propagate religion \u2013 subject to public order, morality and other Fundamental Rights\nArticle 28 \u2013 People\u2019s freedom to attend religious instruction or religious worship in educational institutions is wholly maintained\nArticle 30(1) \u2013 Right of all religious and linguistic minorities to establish and administer educational institutions of their choice\nArticle30(2) \u2013 Freedom of minority-managed educational institutions from discrimination in the matter of receiving aid from the State\nProtection under Part XVII (Official language):\nArticle 347- Provide special provisions relating to the language spoken by a section of the population.\nArticle350A \u2013 Deals with the provision of facilities for instruction in the mother tongue\nArticle 350B\u2014 Provision for a special officer for linguistic minorities and defines its duty.\nLegislative protection:\nThe National Commission of Minority Act 1992\u2014this act led to the foundation of the National Commission on Minorities by the Union Government. It consists of a chairperson and 6 members, provided at least 5, including the chairperson, should belong to the minority community.\nWaqf Act\u2014This act deals with donations in the Muslim community. The central waqf council, a statutory body, manages the administration of waqfs in India. Waqf is the permanent dedication of movable or immovable properties given by Muslim philanthropists for a religious, pious, or charitable purpose. The grant is known as Musrat-Ul-Khidmat and the person who makes such dedication is known as Waqif.\nCitizenship Amendment Act\u2014This act gives citizenship to persecuted minorities from Pakistan, Bangladesh, and Afghanistan within 6 years in place of 12 years. Hindus, Christians, Sikhs, Jains, Buddhists, and Parsis( all are minorities in India excluding Hindus) who migrated before 2014 are eligible.\nExecutive Privilege:\n\nIn addition to a legislative measure, the central government gives many special privileges to minorities through its ministries, departments, and commissions. , as listed below\n\nThe ministry of minority affairs was formed in 2006 to ensure a focused approach to issues related to minorities\nThe Ministry of External Affairs deals with matters relating to the Haj committee.\nThe Ministry of Human Resource and Development deals with schemes for quality education in madrasahs, and with infrastructure development for minority institutions.\nOther bodies:\nNational Commission for Minority Educational Institutions:- It is a statutory body to protect and safeguard educational institutions established by religious minorities in India.

There are certain special advantages that these communities are entitled to by the Constitution of India as well as various other legislative and administrative measures.\nArticle 30 of the Indian Constitution upholds the right of religious and linguistic minorities to establish and administer educational institutions of their choice. Hence, statement 1 is correct. There is no provision for the President of India to automatically nominate a member of a minority religious community to the Lok Sabha. This provision was earlier available for members of the Anglo-Indian community under Article 331 of the Constitution. Hence, statement 2 is not correct.\nReligious minorities can derive benefits from the Prime Minister\u2019s 15-Point Programme. The programme was launched in 2005 to ensure the welfare of minorities in the fields of education, skill development, employment and prevention of communal conflicts. Hence, statement 3 is correct. Therefore, option (c) is the correct answer.\n\nArticle written by Aseem Muhammed"

            "[CONTENT]": "What is meant by Mob Lynching? What are the causes and issues of Mob Lynching? Are there any government initiatives in this regard? To answer these questions, read further.\n\nMob lynching refers to killing someone for an alleged offense without a legal trial. It is a form of aggression in which a mob, under the guise of administering justice without a trial, punishes and tortures a presumed offender, sometimes resulting in mass killings.\n\nThe mob believes they are punishing the victim for doing something wrong and they take the law into their own hands to punish the alleged accused without following any rules of law.\n\nThe recent lynching occurrences recorded in Amritsar and Kapurthala concerned the former chief minister of Punjab. It has again highlighted the issue of mob lynching still persisting in the country.\n\nTable of Contents\n\nCauses of mob lynching\nIssues from mob lynching\nGovernment Initiatives\nWay Forward\nCauses of mob lynching\n\nLittle awareness among the masses and the low penetration of education pave the way for the easy spread of fake news, resulting in mass destruction and unrest. There is a lack of trust and deep fissures prevailing in society.\n\nThe high rate of unemployment existing among the youth leaves millions of youth unengaged and these young idle brains are often misguided and brainwashed through various ideologies and propaganda.\n\n\ud83d\udc49 Which year are YOU targeting for success in the IAS/IPS/IFS Exam? \ud83d\ude80\n\n(1) \u21d2 UPSC 2025: Prelims cum Mains\n\n(2) \u21d2 UPSC 2026: Prelims cum Mains\n\n(3) \u21d2 UPSC 2027 Prelims cum Mains\n\nTip: Know more about ClearIAS Courses (Online/Offline)\n\nThere is poor law enforcement. Additionally, there is an insufficient implementation of minority laws to protect the weaker groups, and law enforcement organizations fail to uphold the public\u2019s trust.\n\nThere is no specific data concerning lynching, the mob has no face which leads the mob to take extreme steps, and this results in a lack of accountability and conviction.\n\nPolice officers play an essential part in protecting people\u2019s lives and maintaining social harmony, but because of their ineffective investigation procedures, hate crime is on the rise.\n\nNowadays the spread of information, misinformation, and propaganda through social media platforms is very fast and uncontrolled. These days social media platforms are used to spread hatred among people and anonymity makes it difficult to find the real perpetrator of fake news.\n\nThe political class too sometimes becomes part of it. For example, the exploitation of communal cleavages by the political class for a narrow agenda.\n\nMob lynching is a hate crime that is on the rise as a result of biases or prejudices among various castes, groups, and religions. Biases are based on many identities such as caste, class, and religion.\n\nIssues from mob lynching\n\nIt is against the concept of diversity and fraternity and leads to an atmosphere of lack of trust among the people, especially the marginalized and the vulnerable. As a result, there is a loss of peace, harmony, and an atmosphere of fear. It can also destabilize communal harmony. For example cow vigilantism.\n\nIt can also hurt tourism as foreigners will now fear visiting India because of the prevailing fear of mob lynching and loss of peace.\n\nMob lynching is against the rule of law. It shows the prevailing eroded faith of the public in the judicial system and the legal procedures of the country. It is quite difficult to hold anyone accountable.\n\nMob lynching violates human dignity, Article 21 of the Constitution, and is a flagrant violation of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights. Such incidents violate Articles 14 and 15 of the Indian Constitution, which guarantees equality and prohibit discrimination.\n\nHowever, it is nowhere mentioned in the law and is thus simply referred to as murder because it has not yet been incorporated into the Indian Penal Code.\n\nGovernment Initiatives\n\nThe Supreme Court in the Tehseen Poonawalla vs Union of India case issued directions on the preventive, punitive, and remedial measures to be adopted by the central and state governments.\n\nSchemes like Ek Bharat Shrestha Bharat also help strengthen communal harmony and reduce such tensions\u2019 incidence.\n\nIn Telangana the police officers engaged with the masses to spread awareness and also keep a vigil on the spread of fake news through Whatsapp, similar initiative was taken by the West Bengal police which took the help of Twitter to dispel the rumors.\n\nStates were ordered to establish designated fast-track courts in each district to deal solely with cases involving mob lynching. The court had also proposed forming a special task force to gather intelligence on those involved in spreading hate speeches, provocative statements, and fake news that could lead to Mob Lynching.\n\nVictim compensation schemes were also established to provide relief and rehabilitation to victims. Only three states, Manipur, West Bengal, and Rajasthan, have laws prohibiting mob lynching.\n\nWay Forward\n\nThe directions given by the Supreme Court need to be strictly followed. There is a need for coherent law to tackle the menace of mob lynching and the recommendations of the Rajiv Gauba Committee need to be taken into account.\n\nThe committee urged that social media sites including Facebook, WhatsApp, YouTube, and Twitter ought to take action against fraudulent content in a \u201ctime-bound\u201d way, hold social media companies liable for failing to remove harmful posts and videos after becoming notified of them, top representatives of these sites may face legal action if they disobeyed government directives by filing a formal complaint.\n\nThere is an urgent need for social and attitudinal change among the masses by increasing the level of education and awareness and the spirit of communal harmony. The use of civil societies and NGOs to create awareness and social media literacy can be a good option.\n\nThe role of technology can prove to be a boon regarding mob lynching and trying to aware people regarding it. We can hold social media platforms accountable and identify the tracking to curb the spread of rumors. For example, the Delhi government initiative to verify WhatsApp forwards.\n\nIn the shorter run, the data and trends regarding mob lynching need to be properly recorded and monitored, and further analyzed to find the solution, and in the longer run, police reforms and the criminal justice system reforms can prove to be beneficial.\n\nThere is a need to strengthen the law and order, administration, and governance to instill public faith in law and order, punish wrongdoers, and set the right example.\n\nLynching is a heinous crime that has no place in a democratic society. Every time there is an honor killing, hate crime, witch hunt, or mob lynching, we demand special legislation to address these crimes. However, the existing provisions under the IPC and CrPC are inadequate to deal with such crimes.\n\nWe are adequately prepared to deal with mob lynching if the guidelines established in Poonawala\u2019s case are followed. Several preventive, corrective, and punitive strategies to cope with lynching and mob violence were outlined in Poonawala v. UOI. However, we lack proper enforcement of existing laws and accountability of enforcement agencies.\n\nArticle written by Chetna Yadav."

Rawat was named Chief of Defence Staff in January 2020, he met with the vice chiefs of the armed forces to brainstorm potential designs for these commands.\n\nThe Air Defence Command, the first of three commands, may be established by the end of 2020, according to a prediction made by Gen. Rawat in early 2020. However, several issues, notably the Covid-19 epidemic, have caused the procedure to be delayed.\n\nCurrent commands in India\nThe Indian armed forces currently have 17 commands.\nThere are seven commands each of the Army (Northern, Eastern, Southern, Western, Central, South-western and Army Training Command)\nThe Air Force has seven commands (Western, Eastern, Southern, Southwestern, Central, Training and Maintenance).\nThe Navy has three commands (Western, Eastern and Southern).\nA four-star military commander is in charge of each command.\n\nNeed of Integrated Theatre Commands\n\nThe goal of the theatre command system is to increase cooperation between the three components of the armed forces. A unified command will be established and headed by a single commander in place of separate commands for the army, navy, and air force.\n\nAn integrated theatre command facilitates the combining of the three services\u2019 resources under a single commander to secure a specific geographic area.\n\nThe commander can utilise the logistics of all three services when conducting combined training.\n\nAdvantages of Integrated Theatre Commands\n\nImproved troop acclimatisation to the given battle zone will help them understand the operational requirements in the designated area of operation.\n\nThe distribution of military hardware, such as weapon systems, command, control, communication tools, and combat support elements, will be theatre-specific and lead to resource optimization.\n\nUnderstanding the training needs and administrative requirements of the troops will enable specialisation and appropriate improvement of war drills at all levels.\n\nFor speedy mobilisation and appropriate use during the anticipated, brief, high-intensity combat, the equipment can be purchased, maintained, and pre-positioned.\n\nChallenges of Integrated Theatre Commands\nExperts claim that the structure itself\u2014specifically, who reports to whom and how the chain of command is organized\u2014is the main obstacle to successfully integrating the three services under the theatre command system. These include concerns with asset operational command and control.\nTo enable the construction of a seamless theatre command system, it has also been noted that budgetary allocations and the distribution of finances are aspects that must be properly worked out.\nAccording to reports, the Indian Air Force is concerned about its assets becoming dispersed throughout the several theatre commands due to the perception that it has fewer resources. It has also been advised that more clarification be sought on issues related to operational control.\nThe division of such meagre resources will reduce combat efficiency at the point of decision. Alternatively, these resources will have to be replicated for each theatre command. The cost of the same will be prohibitive, especially when the country is going through tiring\neconomic times.\nThe synergy between the services may be hampered by each service\u2019s obsessive management of its resources and pursuit of a larger portion of the defence budget and power.\nDue to India\u2019s little experience with integrated theatre commands, certain course modifications may be necessary as these commands develop.\nThe need for single-point military advice for India\u2019s civilian political masters cannot be over-emphasized. If the three service chiefs have a different perspective on military operation or other strategies, then the political leadership would be in a difficult situation.\nConclusion\n\nAccording to lessons learned from the US, Russia, and China, the decision to establish integrated theatre commands must be made at the political level before being carried out by the armed forces.\n\nA country\u2019s response to problems with national security and its strategy for waging war is essentially determined by its military doctrine, which is a collection of ideas and convictions.\n\nThe new joint doctrine will achieve its purpose if India rapidly moves towards integrated military structures and undertakes long-term strategic planning to systematically build military capabilities in tune with its geopolitical aspirations.\n\nArticle Written by: Remya"

An eco-friendly means of freight transportation is coastal shipping and inland canal transit.\nInstitutional Framework of the Program:\n\nThe programme was created with platforms for collaboration between federal, state, and municipal authorities and was intended to be executed along the lines of cooperative federalism.\nThe Public-Private Partnership (PPP) approach is primarily used to carry out projects.\n\nThe National Sagarmala Apex Committee:\nIt is chaired by the Union Minister of Shipping.\nIt also comprises Cabinet Ministers from other ministries with stakes in the program and the Chief Ministers or Ports\u2019 Ministers of the maritime states.\nSagarmala Coordination and Steering Committee:\nIt is chaired by the Cabinet Secretary.\nIt also comprises stakeholder ministries\u2019 Secretaries and the maritime states\u2019 Chief Secretaries.\nState Sagarmala Committee:\nThese are chaired by the respective state\u2019s CM or the Minister of Ports.\nSagarmala Development Company:\nSagarmala Development Company (SDC), which was set up under the Companies Act, 2013, comes under the administrative control of the Ministry of Shipping.\nIt provides equity support to the project Special Purpose Vehicles (SPVs) and funding support for the residual projects under the Sagarmala Programme.\nThe SDC would identify port-led development projects and assist project SPVs in project development and structuring activities, bidding out projects for private sector participation, putting suitable risk management measures in place for strategic projects, cutting across multiple states/regions and obtaining requisite approvals and clearances.\nWhy is port-led development crucial for India?\nIndia has a vast coastline of more than 7,500 kilometres and is situated along important global trade routes in the Indian Ocean.\nHowever, capacity issues and a lack of modern facilities at Indian ports significantly extend the time it takes to carry products into and out of the nation, which has limited India\u2019s contribution to global commerce.\nCreating inland canals out of rivers can also reduce domestic logistical expenses.\nBy 2025, Sagarmala may increase India\u2019s exports of goods to $110 billion and provide an estimated 10 million new jobs (four million in direct employment).\nThe Sagarmala Project will enable India to improve its game in terms of commerce, logistics, and port development.\nThe Sagarmala Project will assist in establishing a network of roads, trains, and waterways. It will ultimately drive down the cost of various goods since water transportation is 5%\u20136% less expensive than other means of transportation. Additionally, it will contribute to an increase in India\u2019s GDP.\nThe Sagarmala Pariyojna can provide more than a million people with assistance and full-time employment near ports and beaches.\nThe initiative will make it easier for those who live close to ports to make a good income. The funding will aid in the development of rural communities close to ports or beaches. Additionally, more accessible transport choices will boost tourism at these important locations.\nEnhanced port connectivity and infrastructure will increase marine security. Furthermore, China\u2019s Maritime Silk Road makes it strategically important. China has enduring difficulties. India must thus have a hold and a link between ports that can permanently fix such problems.\nHaving inland waterways will help encourage domestic logistics cost reductions. Overall transportation expenses will go down as a result.\nThe turnaround time taken is about 4 days, which is about 2 days at the global level. Hence, the Sagarmala Project is a game-changer in the field of logistics as it cuts down the turnaround time and costs related to it.\nApart from the turnaround time, the last mile connectivity is also an issue, as it is necessary to ensure the easy movement of cargo, which will eventually lead to economic growth and increased productivity.\nThe participation of inland waterways cargo is reduced as it counts up to only 6%, which is much less than other countries like China, the USA, etc.\nOther Coastal Developments by GOI under Sagarmala Project\n\nIn the 72 districts close to the shore, about 18% of Indians are said to reside. Furthermore, 12% of the population of mainland India resides in these districts.\n\nThe Sagar Mala Project, which the GOI (Government of India) is implementing, includes coastal improvements like fisheries, maritime tourism, and skill development for locals.\n\nAdditionally, a significant initiative undertaken to boost employment prospects and economic growth is the expansion of cruise tourism.\n\nFisheries Business\nThe Sagarmala Programme calls for the collection of money by the Central Ministries and State Governments for the provision of infrastructural facilities, social development projects, fisheries business, aquaculture, cold chain development, and other purposes related to their governing.\nTourism in Coastal Areas\nUnder Sagarmala Pariyojna, the Ministry of Tourism and the developmental tourism departments are promoting marine tourism. Such as Coastal circuit development under the Swadesh Darshan Scheme (Ministry of Tourism), the Promotion of cruise tourism, Creating several National Maritime Heritage Museums in the Complex locally and the Building of underwater galleries and restaurants at Beyt Dwarka.\nAdditionally, the Sagarmala Project just began conducting skill gap analyses in over 21 Indian coastal regions.\nThe Deen Dayal Upadhyaya Grameen Kaushalya Yojana, which is administered by the Ministry of Rural Development, has established goals that the skill development programmes are achieving.\nCommunity Skill Development\nThe ministries adopt an integrated strategy as part of the Sagarmala Scheme to raise the standard of living for everyone who lives close to the shore.\nPeople are given instruction and skill development so they can make a sufficient living.\nTheir efficiency would be increased by training so they may readily assist Sagarmala\u2019s development initiative.\nWhat are the challenges?\nAn ICRA assessment claims that the programme is suffering from a lack of timely financial support and investment mobilisation.\nCreating a business-friendly atmosphere and real incentives to draw in the private sector are additional challenges.\nIn certain places, there has been opposition from local fishing communities and environmentalists. Following concerns from the neighbourhood fisherman, the Karnataka High Court has halted construction on the Karwar Port.\nThe Sagarmala Program benefited from the centre\u2019s decision to weaken the Coastal Regulation Zone Notification at the end of 2018, however, it was extremely risky for the delicate coastal ecology.\nThis is because of the fact that Sagarmala and Bharatmala were designated as \u201cstrategic projects,\u201d hence free from the requirements of CRZ. This suggests that land from environmentally delicate CRZ-I zones can be recovered and highways developed there.\nIn addition, there have been cases when Sagarmala projects hastened coastal erosion and increased pollution from industrial clusters.\nPort expansions need extensive seabed dredging, which damages long areas of productive fishing grounds and topples jetties.\nOver time, fishing port access has been restricted, there is less room for storing small artisanal boats, and fishing harvests are unreliable. The effects of living adjacent to mineral handling facilities and groundwater exhaustion are already having a considerable negative influence on the fishing communities, who are also suffering as a result of this.\nThe project\u2019s coastal community development pillar has received less funding than desired.\nThe fishing community is also concerned that this ambitious scheme would result in displacement and have a negative impact on their industry.\nFishermen believe that the initiative has been created to displace them from their hamlets and privatise the sea.\nThe trade initiatives that serve as the foundation for the Sagarmala programme have been significantly impacted by the COVID-19 problem. Fresh blueprints are now required as a result of this (Maritime Vision 2030).\nThe Sagarmala Project, a tremendously expensive undertaking, links the ports of several Indian towns.\nFor all Indian ports to overcome operational issues, sufficient infrastructure is needed. Even while Indian ports\u2019 operational efficiency increased with time, there was still a long way to go before it was up to par with international norms.\nThe TAT (Turnaround Time) at primary ports for India is 2 and a half days. This exceeds by a gap of 24 hours compared to the global average time of only 1 to 1.5 days.\nIt takes longer for merchandise to reach its destination since ports along the Indian coastline are not properly linked. This causes extra delays due to traffic on the maritime routes, which slows down the overall operation. Additionally, even though roads and railroads are usually solid options for moving things, doing so raises the cost of logistics and the cost of the items themselves.\nThe price of industrial goods like coal, iron ores, cement, steel, etc. will decrease along with transportation costs if there is greater interconnecting for cargos transported over inland waterways.\nConclusion\n\nThe Sagar Mala Project\u2019s intensive and efficient port operations and coastal community development have the potential to dramatically increase India\u2019s GDP. It has already given residents of 72 districts along the coastal area growth, jobs, and essentials of life.\n\nBy 2035, it is anticipated that all Sagarmala Project objectives would have been accomplished. The government has been incredibly successful in reaching its goal thus far thanks to the Programme\u2019s quick daily progress, and we have great faith in its capabilities, strength, and power.\n\nAlthough coastal development is important for economic growth, it shouldn\u2019t come at the expense of thousands of marginalised people\u2019s livelihoods and environmental deterioration. Therefore, the project must receive the required finance and adjustments to make it more accessible and environmentally sustainable.\n\nArticle written by: Aseem Muhammed"

They can identify objects as small as a few centimetres across, depending on the satellite\u2019s technology and orbit. These images are used for a variety of purposes, including assessing military deployments, disaster response, and monitoring infrastructure.\nRadar Imaging Satellites: Unlike optical satellites, radar imaging satellites can operate day and night, regardless of weather conditions. They use synthetic aperture radar (SAR) to create images by emitting radio waves and measuring the reflection back from the Earth\u2019s surface. This capability makes them particularly valuable for surveillance in cloud-covered or foggy areas.\nSignals Intelligence (SIGINT) Satellites: SIGINT satellites are designed to intercept transmissions between people, aircraft, ships, and other vehicles. They can gather data from communications signals, radar and other electronic systems, helping to decode and understand foreign communication and electronic systems.\nElectronic Intelligence (ELINT) Satellites: These satellites focus specifically on non-communication signals, such as radar. They are used to identify, monitor, and analyze radar frequencies to gather information about radar-equipped vehicles and installations.\nApplications of Reconnaissance Satellites\nMilitary Operations: They are critical for gathering intelligence on enemy movements, fortifications, and activities. This information can determine military strategies and preparedness.\nTreaty Verification: Reconnaissance satellites help verify compliance with arms control treaties by monitoring nuclear test sites and missile bases.\nEnvironmental Monitoring: While not their primary function, these satellites can also track environmental changes and natural disasters, providing critical data for response and recovery efforts.\nBorder and Maritime Security: They monitor borders and maritime approaches to detect illegal activities, such as smuggling, trafficking, and piracy.\nWay Forward\nThe necessity of a strong legal framework: existing space laws should be revisited to develop a new legal framework to address concerns about the weaponization of outer space.\nSpace situational awareness: To increase situational awareness of space objects already in space, states should submit valid information to international institutions.

Read to know more.\n\nTechnology is a collection of human knowledge, abilities, skills, experiences, and methods that can be used to alter, modify, and make use of our available resources to develop tools, machines, goods, and services that satisfy our needs and desires.\n\nTechnology today has a special place in everyone\u2019s life because it not only contributes to the growth of the individual but also to that of the nation and the entire planet. It already conquered all sectors of life, including our country\u2019s law enforcement.\n\nWhen we take the case of Indian Law Enforcement, the actual police strength in India is 150 officers per lakh people after accounting for vacancies. However, the UN recommends 222 police officers for every 100,000 people.\n\nConsequently, an average police officer ends up with a massive workload and long working hours, which hurt his effectiveness and performance. However, there are ways that the Law Enforcement Agencies (LEAs) can utilise technology to improve their efficacy and efficiency. The technology could be used as a force multiplier here.\n\nAmazing new digital technologies are revolutionising how police protect and serve the public, enabling organisations to fight crime more quickly and effectively. It is important to stay current with technology that aids law enforcement worldwide and employ them as appropriate for the Indian setting.\n\nTable of Contents\n\nSmart Policing in India\nSmart Policing index\nRole of technology in law enforcement and investigation\nCrime Detection and Crime Prevention\u00a0\nBiometrics:\nPredictive Policing:\nIntegration of Data:\nSurveillance and Monitoring\nCCTV:\nGlobal Positioning Aid (GPS):\nEnhanced Body-Worn Cameras\nAutomatic License Plate Recognition (ALPR):\nDrones:\nThe\u00a0Drone\u00a0Regulations\u00a0in\u00a0India\nOther technologies that can be used in crime investigation\nVoice Technology:\nRobots:\nShotSpotter\nThermal Imaging\nArtificial Intelligence (AI):\nFacial recognition software:\nThe Call Detail Record (CDR)\nMobile Forensics:\nThe Benefits and Challenges of using technology in Law enforcement\nThe advantages of using technology in law enforcement in India:\nThe challenges of using technology in law enforcement in India:\nSuggestions for better use of Technology in Law Enforcement and Investigation\nThe Role of New Technologies in Law Enforcement: Conclusion\nSmart Policing in India\n\nThe idea of \u201cSmart Policing,\u201d promoted by the government, is a redesigned strategic approach that uses cutting-edge applications of analysis, technology, and evidence-based methods to integrate more \u201cscience\u201d into police operations.\n\n\ud83d\udc49 Which year are YOU targeting for success in the IAS/IPS/IFS Exam? \ud83d\ude80\n\n(1) \u21d2 UPSC 2025: Prelims cum Mains\n\n(2) \u21d2 UPSC 2026: Prelims cum Mains\n\n(3) \u21d2 UPSC 2027 Prelims cum Mains\n\nTip: Know more about ClearIAS Courses (Online/Offline)\n\nIt described the structural adjustments to make the Indian Police more effective, modern, accountable, trustworthy, and trained with the help of cutting-edge technology.\n\nIndian Prime Minister presented this idea of Smart Police at a gathering of DGPs from State and Central Organizations in Guwahati in 2014.\n\nSmart Policing index\n\nAccording to a national poll by the Indian Police Foundation (IPF), when it came to the perception of \u201csensitivity,\u201d the police in Bihar and Uttar Pradesh received the lowest scores of any State.\n\nThe IPF survey\u2019s goal was to learn more about how the SMART policing project was perceived by the public.\n\nOn most enforcement metrics, the southern states outperformed the northern states. Andhra Pradesh, Telangana, Assam, Kerala, and Sikkim are the top five states in terms of overall policing. Bihar, Uttar Pradesh, Chhattisgarh, Jharkhand, and Punjab are listed as the lowest in policing.\n\nRole of technology in law enforcement and investigation\n\nAs crime has changed over time and has become increasingly sophisticated and difficult to solve, technology today plays a significant role in enabling law enforcement agencies. The main role of technology in law enforcement is as follows:\n\nCrime Detection and Crime Prevention.\nSurveillance and Monitoring.\u00a0\nCrime Detection and Crime Prevention\u00a0\n\nCrime Detection is the recognition of a crime as having been committed, the identification of a suspect, and the gathering of adequate evidence to bring the suspect before a court are indeed the three distinct stages of crime detection. On the other hand,\n\nCrime prevention is the foreseeing, identification, and evaluation of a crime risk and the beginning of the measures to eliminate or diminish it.\n\nThe police and other law enforcement agencies are responsible for the detection and prevention of crimes in India. The use of technology in crime detection and crime prevention will ease the burden on law enforcement agencies. The following are some of the technological tools that can be utilised by police to detect and prevent crime:\n\nBiometrics:\n\n\u00a0A biometric is a measurable biological (both anatomical and physiological) and behavioural characteristic that can be used for automated recognition. For more than a century, police have used fingerprints to identify suspects. Law enforcement and the intelligence community are now using an ever-expanding range of biometric (and behavioural) features in addition to facial recognition and DNA. They are heartbeats, speech recognition, wrist veins, iris recognition, gait analysis, and even palmprints.\n\nPredictive Policing:\n\nThe use of mathematics, predictive analytics, and other analytical approaches by law enforcement to spot possible criminal conduct is known as predictive policing. To make the best use of resources or to have the highest chance of deterring or preventing future crimes, predictive policing analyses data on the times, locations, and nature of past crimes to inform police strategists about where and when police patrols should patrol or keep a presence.\n\nThe methods of predictive policing could be divided mainly into four. They are:\n\nthose who anticipate crimes,\nthose that anticipate offenders,\nthose who anticipate the identities of the perpetrators,\nthose that anticipate victims.\n\nSome of the examples of predictive policing are as follows:\n\nTo pinpoint \u201ccrime hotspots,\u201d or places where crimes are most likely to occur, Delhi\u2019s CMAPS (Crime Mapping Analytics and Predictive System) collects information every three minutes from satellites operated by the Indian Space Research Organization, historical crime data, and the \u201cDial 100\u201d helpline.\nThe information from the \u201cIntegrated People Information Hub\u201d is used by the Hyderabad police to identify persons who are more inclined to conduct crimes, this hub comprises information such as family details, biometric details, passport details, address, and even bank transaction details.\nPredPol of the U.S is an example of the effective use of predictive policing in law enforcement. makes forecasts using a machine-learning system. The three data points \u2013 the Crime type, crime location, and crime date/time are utilized in the prediction calculation of the crime. PredPol manages patrol operations using a data-driven strategy. It determines the most likely locations and times for specified crimes to occur. PredPol proactive patrolling helps to lower crime and victimization rates.\nThe mission of Europol, the law enforcement arm of the EU, is to make Europe safer by supporting national law enforcement organisations in EU member states. One hundred of Europe\u2019s best-trained criminal analysts work with Europol. It now has one of the EU\u2019s highest concentrations of analytical capacity as a result. Modern tools are regularly used by analysts to aid in the investigations of national authorities.\nIntegration of Data:\n\nThe most important components of any investigation are data and information. Big data can be used to combine data from a variety of sources, including social media platforms, financial institutions, travel records, hotel stays, call detail records\u00a0(CDRs), and\u00a0criminal\u00a0histories. This\u00a0can\u00a0aid\u00a0in\u00a0giving\u00a0a\u00a0complete\u00a0picture\u00a0of\u00a0the\u00a0offender\u00a0and\u00a0establishing\u00a0connections\u00a0with\u00a0criminal\u00a0associates.\n\nSurveillance and Monitoring\n\nThe term \u201csurveillance\u201d refers to the close observation of an individual or group, particularly one that is being investigated or is being observed. India, a developing nation, has made several reforms to its information technology policy, but much more must be done.\n\nCrime analysis and monitoring combine information from several governmental organisations that is gathered from numerous heterogeneous sources in various formats and from various platforms, such as NCRB, India. Police forces need the newest systems for analysis, monitoring, and management in order to efficiently regulate crime.\n\nThere are many legitimate ways for the government to undertake surveillance. The Indian Telegraph Act of 1885, which addresses call interception, and the Information Technology (IT) Act of 2000, which addresses data interception, are the laws that control this. Both statutes prohibit private parties from conducting surveillance, only allowing it to be done under specific conditions by the government.\n\nAdditionally, the IT Act clearly forbids hacking. Theft of data and hacking are respectively considered civil and criminal offences under Sections 43 and 66 of the IT Act. Punishment for dishonestly receiving a computer resource or communication that has been stolen is covered in Section 66B. The penalty entails a period of jail that may last up to three years.\n\nOnly government agencies like the Intelligence Bureau, Research and Analysis Wing (RAW), Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI), National Investigation Agency (NIA), Central Bureau of Direct Taxes (CBDT), and Narcotics Control Bureau will have access to the data gathered by the Central Monitoring System (NCB). However, it is unclear who granted this permission or when such surveillance will take place. Although the Indian legal system provides procedures for electronic surveillance, they are ineffective.\n\nAdditionally, the government has attempted to define privacy, outline the conditions under which it has the authority to undertake surveillance, and outline the penalties for misusing data collected through surveillance in the Right to Privacy Bill, 2011, which was presented to the parliament. According to this bill, the Home Secretary of India\u2019s Ministry of Home Affairs is the only person who can authorise monitoring.\n\nCCTV:\n\nThe use of CCTVS is widely prevalent in India\u2019s major cities. If these are operational, they can help law enforcement quite successfully. By observing suspect movement, CCTV cameras placed along roads and at toll booths have also assisted in solving crimes. The CCTV coverage of public places like markets, banks, hospitals, theatres, hotels, airports, railways, bus stations, etc., can identify suspects and suspicious activity like the placement of bombs and IEDs.\n\nFor example, in a recent case in Noida involving a veteran Army Colonel who was allegedly assaulted, detained, handcuffed, and tortured on false charges by an ADM, Muzaffarnagar, and his wife under the SC/ST Act, the officer was granted bail during the first hearing after six days because CCTV footage amply demonstrated the arrogance of the ADM, his aides, and the police.\nGlobal Positioning Aid (GPS):\n\nThe number of GPS applications being used by law enforcement is growing. Police can more quickly and effectively help individuals by pinpointing the location of a call and figuring out the fastest and safest path to it using GPS technology.\n\nIn order to better target their enforcement efforts at reducing the frequency of traffic crashes, police can map the locations of the traffic stops and crash investigations they conduct.\n\nCrime analysts can also employ GPS technology to better organise shift staffing and patrol assignments, as well as to detect new patterns in crime locations.\n\nEnhanced Body-Worn Cameras\n\nA camera device known as a \u201cbody-worn system\u201d records both audio and video while being fixed to an officer\u2019s uniform\u2019s torso.\n\nPolice personnel in the US and the UK both utilize body-worn cameras. The US Bureau of Justice Statistics claims that the practice started there in 2013.\n\nA body-worn cam\u2019s functions include recording public interactions, incidents involving law enforcement personnel, and gathering evidence at crime scenes.\n\nBody-worn cam use is advantageous for several reasons. According to some studies, a body-worn camera system helps in observing how the police behave.\n\nA trend of a fall in the number of violent events There is a decrease in citizen complaints against police. They encourage good, civilized, and proper conduct.\n\nIt also helps in obtaining information for use in investigations, and the video can be utilised for self-evaluation and training purposes. The body-worn camera gives a greater sense of safety.\n\nAccording to a recent draft notification, the Narendra Modi administration is considering providing police officers with body-worn cameras and dashboard cameras in order to enable stricter enforcement of traffic laws and to monitor \u201cmalpractices\u201d by enforcement officials in India.\n\nThe Central Motor Vehicle Rules, 1989 were amended by the ministry\u2019s draft notification, Electronic Monitoring and Enforcement of Road Safety.\n\nIt has been mentioned in the notification that \u201cBoth the video and audio features of the body camera shall only be active when the law enforcement officer is on duty and the official shall warn the subjects that they are being recorded by the body camera.\u201d\n\nThe proposal states that these body-worn cameras can be utilised to capture an event\u2019s processes and as proof in court against someone who violates traffic safety regulations. Additionally, they can \u201cassure that the law enforcement officer has punished the offending driver or person in accordance with the law\u2019s provisions.\u201d\n\nIn order to act as early evidence even before the forensic units arrive and assist avoid potential legal issues later, Lal Bazar (the headquarters of Kolkata Police)has urged all police officers responding to unnatural death situations to record the initial spot findings in their body cameras or cellphones. The cops are required to attach the camera to their uniforms while on duty and turn it on each time they stop a suspicious car or question a suspect. Additionally, they have been instructed to document any tense exchanges or conflicts amongst residents. The Kolkata Police has allocated approximately 1 crore to purchase 500 body cams for police stations. Most police stations currently have one or two cameras.\nAutomatic License Plate Recognition (ALPR):\n\nAutomatic Number Plate Recognition (ANPR), commonly referred to as Automatic License Plate Recognition (ALPR), is software that automatically reads automobile licence plates by conducting complex optical character recognition on photographs.\n\nAutomated licence plate readers (ALPRs) are quick, computer-controlled camera systems that are frequently mounted on street poles, lamps, overpasses, mobile trailers, or tethered to police cruisers. ALPR cameras are frequently employed with automated speed and red-light enforcement systems, as well as to collect tolls on roads and bridges.\n\nThere are Mobile ALPR cameras. These are frequently mounted on police patrol cars, enabling officers to collect information from licence plates as they move throughout the city during their shifts. These cameras are typically switched on at the start of a shift and left on until the end of the shift. Mobile ALPR cameras are efficient at capturing licence plates of parked cars in addition to taking pictures of passing vehicles. For instance, a patrol car may move around a public parking lot and quickly record the licence plates of hundreds of automobiles.\n\nTypical ANPR solutions accept an image as an input and output the decoded car plate, timestamp, and algorithm confidence level. For real-time surveillance, the image is examined in as little as 20 to 50 milliseconds.\n\nAll visible licence plate numbers, as well as the time, date, and place, are automatically recorded by ALPRs. The information is subsequently uploaded to a central server, which may include pictures of the car\u2019s occupants.\n\nThis programme can be used to look for stolen vehicles, determine whether a vehicle is insured, determine whether it has a pollution certificate that is active and valid, determine whether a vehicle is blacklisted, and obtain the owner\u2019s name and contact information in the event of an accident.\n\nIn 2021, the Gurugram (Haryana) police recovered more than 50 stolen vehicles with the help of ANPR technology.\nDrones:\n\nDrones, also known as Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs), are being utilised more frequently by police to gather aerial perspectives for work at crime scenes, search and rescue operations, accident reconstruction, crowd monitoring, and other purposes. Some of the more advanced models can be fitted with thermal imaging or 3D mapping tools to provide areas being surveyed with GPS-enhanced precision.\n\nZoom cameras are a common feature on police drones and UAVs, making them very useful for providing actionable, real-time intelligence in high-risk, \u201carmed and dangerous\u201d scenarios.\n\nThe usage of drone technology by Indian law enforcement organisations has grown steadily:\n\nThe Delhi Police has acknowledged using drones purchased from open markets during the February 2020 deadly riots in the city and the Delhi Assembly elections.\nDrones were employed to keep an eye on potential demonstrations during the construction of the Ram temple in Ayodhya, and the Indian Railways recently bought some to keep a close eye on railway facilities.\nIn order to make sure individuals were adhering to lockdown guidelines during the COVID-19 Pandemic, the Delhi police employed drones to perform surveillance and collect data in the form of photographs and videos. These surveillance drones could transmit a live feed to the police person controlling the drone and record video on SD cards.\nDrones have been used by the Mumbai police and the Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation to monitor curfew infractions in residential areas like Andheri and Dharavi.\nWhen the Punjab police in Amritsar utilised drones to spot people less than 6 feet apart, the drones employed a combination of artificial intelligence, location mapping, and high-definition cameras to send notifications to the closest police officer.\nSimilar drone programmes were started in Kerala and Hyderabad, where private individuals were even engaged to fly hired drones as part of the surveillance efforts.\nThermal imaging and video were both captured by drones in Kerala, and the data was sent right to the local police\u2019s phones.\nIn Chennai, the usage of drones in a monitoring capacity has persisted even after the termination of lockdowns.\nThe\u00a0Drone\u00a0Regulations\u00a0in\u00a0India\n\nAny drone ownership without a current Unique Identification Number (UIN) will be deemed illegal as of April 1, 2022, and will be subject to legal penalties.\n\nThe Operators of recreational and commercial drones must request the UIN using the Digital Sky site. Logging into your portal account is necessary, as are the dashboard\u2019s Unmanned Aircraft System (UAS) Serial Number and an INR 100 application cost.\n\nOther technologies that can be used in crime investigation\nVoice Technology:\n\nA new voice command system that enables officers to operate numerous vehicle features while driving and carrying out other patrol responsibilities is one of the most recent advances being put into police cars.\n\nThese voice systems\u2019 capabilities vary from car to other vehicles, but most of them can respond to requests to run the licence plate or activate the siren.\n\nThe voice command technology in police cars are the most advanced and promising feature that will make filing reports considerably simpler \u2013 officers may dictate their notes, which are then directly filed into their agency\u2019s RMS system.\n\nA senior CBI officer urged that lenders employ voice analysis technology to identify such fraudsters and stop such offences considering the recent case where the chairman of a Mumbai-based private firm was charged in a 231-crore cheating case.\nAt a workshop hosted by the Centre for Advanced Financial Research and Learning (CAFRAL), a subsidiary of the Reserve Bank of India, Keshav Kumar, joint director of the CBI in Mumbai, engaged in conversation with senior executives of many private and public banks (RBI). He explained to them how Layered Voice Analysis (LVA) is a useful method for detecting fraud. The LVA software analyses speech and emotion to determine if a person is telling the truth or lying during interviews and can detect deception.\nIn the closed network of Crime Criminal & Networking Systems (CCTNS), on which all works of investigation, beginning with the filing of FIR, writing case diaries, submitting charge sheets, etc. are done across the country, the Delhi Police has now introduced a phonetic keyboard system with a Hindi voice typing facility. The system has enhanced police functioning in terms of storing accurate digital data quickly, accurately, and efficiently. For the staff using the CCTNS, it has been a huge relief and a turning point in the inquiry process.\nRobots:\n\nTo provide visual and audio monitoring of prospective crime sites that may be too dangerous or difficult for officers to reach, several law enforcement agencies are increasingly deploying next-generation robotic cameras. The Ford Motor Company has applied for a patent for a self-driving police vehicle with AI. These cutting-edge cruisers are made to catch drivers who break the law or who are intoxicated by relaying information to human cops or by transporting an optional passenger officer who may make an arrest.\n\nThe ever-expanding robot capabilities to collect surveillance data, take police reports, and conduct communications in environments where the safety of human officers would be jeopardised.\n\nChina is currently creating a robot called \u201cAnBot\u201d to monitor banks, airports, and schools.\n\nDubai Police has unveiled its first robot officer, assigning it to patrol the city\u2019s shopping centres and tourist hotspots.\u00a0By tapping a touchscreen on its chest, people will be able to utilise it to report crimes, pay fines, and acquire information.\u00a0The robot\u2019s data collection will also be shared with the traffic and transportation authorities.\u00a0The government stated that by 2030, robotics will make up 25% of the force, but they would not take the place of people.\n\nThe human-like robot \u201cKP-BOT\u201d was created by Asimov Robotics and Kerala Police Cyberdome, the technology research and development Centre of the Kerala Police Department, and it was unveiled in the state. The Robot is referred to as a humanoid because it can move independently. It contains a camera with facial recognition software. According to Kerala Police, KP-BOT would be used for responsibilities including attending receptions, showing visitors around police stations, and scheduling appointments. Once all the data is entered, it can even identify and apprehend criminals. In the future, humanoids might also be utilised to control traffic or investigate crimes\nShotSpotter\n\nAlthough hearing \u201cshots fired!\u201d from witnesses or patrolling police officers is not unusual, finding the precise location of the gunfire takes valuable time when every second matters.\n\nShotSpotter technology, which employs sensors to detect gunfire and analysts to follow the data and immediately report it to police, is now being used in an increasing number of places. This technology allows police to respond to an incident faster than ever before.\n\nShotSpotter was used dramatically in 2017 in Fresno, California when police used it to capture a murderous offender. With the use of technology, authorities were able to track the murderer\u2019s whereabouts and capture him in 4 minutes, and 13 seconds.\n\nThermal Imaging\n\nA crucial tool in police technology today, thermal imaging is especially useful at night. From search and rescue operations to fighting fires, such technology can save lives.\n\nInfrared imaging is used by thermal image cameras, some of which are small hand-held devices, to identify heat radiated by various things, including people and animals, and to produce a \u201cheat picture\u201d or \u201cheat map\u201d of the environment under consideration.\n\nCyriac Pius, the CEO and MD of Ozak Technologies, a Keralite firm that makes Panther, the state\u2019s first thermal imaging surveillance system, has attracted the attention of both the Indian Army and the Kerala Police. \u201cPanther, the Thermal Weapon Sight, is an all-weather and all-terrain 24-hour system that gives a soldier on duty night vision that is superior to day vision. The heating device is made with ergonomics in mind and is quite lightweight. Panther provides the exceptional ability to switch between weapons and shooters without losing accuracy. With its three available lenses, it can identify objects at distances between 1 and 2.2 kilometres.\nThe Bangalore-based Electronics & Radar Development Establishment (LRDE) of the Defence Research and Development Organization (DRDO) has created a through-barrier imaging radar known as \u201cDivyachakshu\u201d (divine eye), which is currently undergoing development testing. Using thermal imaging, it is possible to see through walls that are 20\u201330 cm thick and constructed of any material. This technology may be a huge help to the Indian troops in handling hostage situations\nThe first infrared sensors for thermal imaging in India have recently been developed by a team of scientists from IIT-Bombay.\u00a0The Defense Project and Development Organization and the Indian Space Research Organization provided funds for the research, which began in 2010.\nArtificial Intelligence (AI):\n\nMany more police technologies, including some of those already listed, including ShotSpotter, facial recognition, and biometrics, are supported by AI.\n\nIt can also be used for crime mapping, which involves processing data to more precisely identify high-crime regions so that law enforcement can watch them more closely and provide more resources.\n\nAnother application of artificial intelligence is \u201ccrime predicting.\u201d Programmers may train computers to evaluate data from a wide range of sources and categories to anticipate when and where crimes are likely to occur by using so-called \u201cdeep learning\u201d techniques. This enables organizations to distribute resources effectively and raises the probability that cops will be present when they are needed.\n\nAI and facial recognition technology are used in Indian policing. Facial recognition technology (FRTs) has become more prevalent in India in recent years and is increasingly used in law enforcement. This is consistent with how the world is moving toward using artificial intelligence (AI).\n\nFacial recognition software:\n\nA facial recognition system, which is often used to verify individuals through ID verification services, works by identifying and measuring facial features from a given image. It may match a human face from a digital image or a video frame against a database of faces.\n\nThe purpose of facial recognition software is to help increase safety and security in various situations. The police in India are using it more frequently for identifying purposes and in criminal investigations.\n\nA few examples were the police departments of India using facial recognition technology systems are:\n\nTSCOP and Crime and Criminal Tracking Network & Systems (CCTNS) in Telangana, Punjab Artificial Intelligence System (PAIS) in Punjab, Trinetra in Uttar Pradesh, Police Artificial Intelligence System in Uttarakhand, Automated Facial Recognition System (AFRS) in Delhi, and Automated Multimodal Biometric Identification System (AMBIS).\nThe Delhi police used a facial recognition system for over 100 of the 1,818 arrests they made during the riots against the Citizen Amendment Act in December 2019. Thousands of Indian citizens came out to protest this new law that is believed to be discriminatory towards Muslims and other marginalized communities.\nIn another situation, the police used facial recognition technology along with CCTV footage to arrest over 200 protesters who were protesting an agriculture reform that favoured corporations over farmers at Delhi\u2019s Red Fort.\nThe Call Detail Record (CDR)\n\nThe Call Detail Record (CDR) is a thorough log of each telephone call that travels through a phone exchange or other piece of telecommunication device. It has information regarding subscribers\u2019 active or passive use of the network for different communication activities.\n\nCDR analysis is utilised extensively worldwide by various law enforcement agencies since it is a very valuable tool for tracking down and investigating criminals.\n\nThe widespread use of mobile devices makes it challenging to manually analyse these records. Tools for CDR analysis can be used to trace the movements of criminal associates and track down missing people as well as identify call patterns, the most frequently called numbers, and geolocation.\n\nSubject to certain clearances, both federal and state law enforcement agencies, including the CBI, Income Tax Department, intelligence agencies, police, and counter-terrorism organizations like the NIA and the ATS, are permitted access to CDR during an investigation.\n\nMobile Forensics:\n\nUsing technology, it is possible to identify a criminal\u2019s digital footprint. Critical data can be recovered via mobile forensics, including contacts, images, SMS, videos, emails, site browser history, location data, and social media messages.\n\nThe Benefits and Challenges of using technology in Law enforcement\n\nEverything has two sides. The police have benefited from technology, which has made them stronger in conducting criminal investigations. But we also can\u2019t ignore the issues it has brought forth.\n\nThe advantages of using technology in law enforcement in India:\nTechnology helps in increasing the productivity and efficiency of Law Enforcement Agencies. A strong partnership between police and technology would facilitate quick criminal investigations, greatly reduce crime, and help to uphold law and order.\nTechnological assistance helps the police to reduce the burden of daily manual tasks.\nBig Data can be quite useful in identifying crime trends and hotspots. The smartphone apps are connected to centralized databases and give the investigating officer real-time access to data on missing individuals, vehicles, bodies, and criminal histories very quickly.\nReduce Malpractices: The use of technology like body-worn cameras will reduce the scope of malpractices by the officers on duty.\nTechnology helps in bridging the gap between the public and the police. The digital services provided by police may help the public to make use of these services from the comfort of their house. For example, in Punjab Police\u2019s SAANJH, people can submit their concerns online using the State public grievance redressal portal for the state police. The main goal of this portal is to allow citizens to file complaints online, track their progress, and receive reports in a timely manner while sitting at home.\nTechnology can ensure integrated data gathering from the five pillars of the criminal justice system \u2013 police, court, prosecution, jails and forensics which helps the police with their investigation.\nA technologically advanced law enforcement agency is a valuable addition to the national security of our country.\n\nAlso read: India\u2019s Intelligence and Investigation Agencies\n\nThe challenges of using technology in law enforcement in India:\nThe lack of proper data security legislation may result in data breaches and the subsequent use of this data for terrorism and other illegal acts.\nThe unequal distribution of infrastructure across India\u2019s rural and urban environments makes widespread adoption of technology difficult. Remote places might not have adequate internet penetration to access the technology made available to the public by law enforcement authorities.\nThe failure of present police reforms to teach the effects of technology and incorporate it into crime investigation.\nBudget\u00a0constraints\u00a0are\u00a0a\u00a0problem\u00a0at\u00a0many\u00a0police\u00a0stations\u00a0around\u00a0the nation,\u00a0making\u00a0the\u00a0deployment\u00a0of\u00a0new\u00a0equipment\u00a0financially\u00a0impractical.\nDue to a lack of adequate training and access to this technology, the Indian law enforcement authorities are unable to keep up with the rapid developments in technology, which has resulted in a large technological gap.\nMany agencies lack the necessary mobile or software tools to enhance interagency collaboration or maintain officers in the community.\nIn certain cases, police personnel could not be sufficiently motivated or willing to pick up on the complexities of modern technologies.\nThere is the\u00a0possibility of using technology for inappropriate political purposes. For example, the\u00a0police\u00a0might\u00a0be\u00a0utilised\u00a0by\u00a0the\u00a0ruling\u00a0party\u00a0to\u00a0conduct\u00a0widespread\u00a0surveillance\u00a0on\u00a0their\u00a0political\u00a0rivals\u00a0and\u00a0dissidents.\nMost of the general population is not aware of these Law Enforcement apps and portals.\nSuggestions for better use of Technology in Law Enforcement and Investigation\nStrict and clear digital legislation should be made to address the privacy issues of public and the data security.\nTechnology-friendly police reforms must be implemented: The changes should be implemented in such a way that the legal enforcement agency receives early training on the technology and its implementation in the public.\nOfficers\u2019 technological gaps might be filled by scheduling frequent training sessions.\nImprove the digital evidence management records: Police officials must make investments in technologies to support the long-term preservation, regulated distribution of evidence, and integration with record management systems now that law enforcement has started to gather and analyse digital evidence in practically every investigation. Digital evidence requires the same criteria for archiving, protection, and retention as physical evidence.\nResearch and development should be done regarding the technology, how to reduce the expenditure of these technologies and its training.\nIntroduce computer cafes or corresponding support systems to fill the inequity of infrastructure in rural India. Thereby the citizen of rural areas can also enjoy the technological advancements from the comfort of their home.\nThe appointment of an officer who will oversee technological components, their operation, training, and effective execution is necessary.\nAdapting and learning about more technologies from other countries to ease crime investigation.\nDigital ethics is also a need of the hour. To build digital trust in society, it is necessary to imbibe digital ethics, which is a larger framework made up of technology, open data, and digital ethics.\nIt\u00a0is\u00a0necessary\u00a0to\u00a0create\u00a0a\u00a0system\u00a0of\u00a0feedback\u00a0from\u00a0the\u00a0police\u00a0officers and the citizens\u00a0who\u00a0use these\u00a0technologies\u00a0so\u00a0that\u00a0improvements\u00a0can\u00a0be\u00a0made\u00a0to\u00a0the\u00a0machinery that is\u00a0now\u00a0in\u00a0use.\nConducting public education and awareness programs regarding the available citizen-friendly law enforcement apps and portals and training regarding the same can be done to reduce the technological gap among the general population.\nThe Role of New Technologies in Law Enforcement: Conclusion\n\nThe police have benefited from technology, which has made them stronger in conducting criminal investigations. But we also can\u2019t ignore the difficulties it has brought forth.\n\nTechnology has greatly reduced manual labour and digitalized data, making it simpler to retrieve older files and comprehend a criminal\u2019s or accused\u2019s past.\n\nEven social media has contributed to our understanding of a person\u2019s history. Because of the development of technology, the criminal investigative procedure has now become more transparent.\n\nA connection between the public and the police is also made possible through technology. It aids law enforcement in defending public safety and property. Complaints from the public can be handled efficiently and quickly.\n\nA robust partnership between police and technology would facilitate quick criminal investigations, greatly reduce crime, and aid to uphold law and order.\n\nSo, for better and faster law enforcement, we must continue to upgrade technology.\n\nAlso read: Digital Personal Data Protection\n\nArticle written by: Priyanka Sunil"

But the intelligence failure in the Sino-Indian War of 1962 and the Indo-Pakistan war of 1965, the need for a separate external intelligence agency was realized.\n\nIn 1968, India\u2019s first foreign intelligence agency, the Research and Analysis Wing was established.\n\nOther child agencies such as the Radio Research Center and the\u00a0Electronics & Tech. Services\u00a0were added to R&AW in the 1970s and 1990s.\n\nIn 1971, the Government set up the\u00a0Aviation Research Centre\u00a0(ARC). The ARC\u2019s job was\u00a0aerial reconnaissance. It replaced the\u00a0Indian Air Force\u2019s old reconnaissance aircraft.\n\nIn 2004 Government of India added yet another signal intelligence agency called the\u00a0National Technical Facilities Organisation\u00a0(NTFO), which was later renamed as National Technical Research Organisation (NTRO).\n\nObjectives of RAW\nMonitoring the political, military, economic, and scientific developments in countries that have a direct bearing on India\u2019s national security and the formulation of its foreign policy.\nMolding international public opinion and influencing foreign governments.\nCovert Operations to safeguard India\u2019s National interests.\nAnti-terror operations and neutralizing elements pose a threat to India.\nMonitors the political and military development in the neighboring countries, which have a direct bearing on India\u2019s national security and in the genesis of its foreign policy.\nActivities of RAW\n\nRAW was instrumental during the Bangladesh liberation war of 1971 and was responsible for supplying information, providing training, and heavy ammunition to Mukti Bahini.\n\nRAW has trained intelligence officers of many independent African countries.

related to the transfer and postings of officials in the vigilance units of government organizations by restricting their tenures to three years in one place.\n\nConclusion\n\nThe Central Vigilance Commission is often limited in its powers as it is treated as an advisory body with no power to register cases. Even though it is an independent agency, it lacks the resources and power to take action on complaints.\n\nSuch shortcomings of the systems need to be addressed to curb the menace of corruption in the rapidly growing economy."

The institution should have checks and balances and audits regularly to demand honest functioning.\n\nSuch agencies usually get caught in the center-state tussle hindering their functioning- this should be dealt with carefully. The central law can be replicated by states as well so that the burden of increasing cases can be shared.\n\nThe social and public reputation of CBI needs to be regained; hence functional reforms will be needed. There is also a need of bringing gender parity into the organization."

But if needed, the tenure can be extended for three more years.\nThis will require three separate annual extensions.\nHowever, no extension can be granted to an ED chief after five years.\nHistory of Enforcement Directorate\n\nThe origin of this Directorate goes back to 1st May 1956, when an \u2018Enforcement Unit\u2019 was formed in the Department of Economic Affairs for handling Exchange Control Laws violations under Foreign Exchange Regulation Act, 1947 (FERA \u201947).\n\nThis Unit with Delhi as Headquarters was headed by a Legal Service Officer, as Director of Enforcement, assisted by an Officer drawn on deputation from Reserve Bank of India (RBI) and 03 Inspectors of Special Police Establishment.\nThere were two branches in Bombay and Calcutta.\nIn 1957, this Unit was renamed as \u2018Enforcement Directorate\u2019, and another branch was opened at Madras.\nIn 1960, the administrative control of the Directorate was transferred from the Department of Economic Affairs to the Department of Revenue under the Ministry of Finance.\n\nWith the onset of the process of economic liberalization, FERA 1973, which was repealed and in its place, a new law- the Foreign Exchange Management Act, 1999 (FEMA) came into operation in June 2000.\n\nFurther, in tune with the International Anti-Money Laundering regime, the Prevention of Money Laundering Act, 2002 (PMLA) was enacted, and ED was entrusted with its enforcement from July 2005.\n\nWith the increase in the number of cases relating to economic offenders taking shelter in foreign countries, the Government has passed the Fugitive Economic Offenders Act, 2018 (FEOA), and the Enforcement Directorate is entrusted with its enforcement with effect from April 2018.\n\nStatutory functions of ED\n\nThe statutory functions of the Directorate include enforcement of the following Acts:\n\nThe Prevention of Money Laundering Act, 2002 (PMLA):\u00a0\n\nIt is a criminal law enacted to prevent money laundering and to provide for confiscation of property derived from, or involved in, money laundering and for matters connected therewith or incidental thereto.\nED has been given the responsibility to enforce the provisions of the PMLA by conducting an investigation to trace the assets derived from proceeds of crime, provisionally attach the property, and ensuring the prosecution of the offenders and confiscation of the property by the Special court.\n\nThe Foreign Exchange Management Act, 1999 (FEMA):\n\nIt is a civil law enacted to consolidate and amend the laws relating to facilitating external trade and payments and to promote the orderly development and maintenance of the foreign exchange market in India.\nED has been given the responsibility to conduct an investigation into suspected contraventions of foreign exchange laws and regulations and to adjudicate and impose penalties on those adjudged to have contravened the law.\n\nThe Fugitive Economic Offenders Act, 2018 (FEOA):\u00a0\n\nThis law was enacted to deter economic offenders from evading the process of Indian law by remaining outside the jurisdiction of Indian courts.\nIt is a law whereby the Directorate is mandated to attach the properties of the fugitive economic offenders who have escaped from India warranting arrest and provide for the confiscation of their properties to the Central Government.\n\nThe Foreign Exchange Regulation Act, 1973 (FERA):\u00a0\n\nThe main functions under the repealed FERA are to adjudicate the Show Cause Notices issued under the said Act up to 31.5.2002 for the alleged contraventions of the Act which may result in the imposition of penalties and to pursue prosecutions launched under FERA in the concerned courts.\n\nSponsoring agency under COFEPOSA:\n\nUnder the Conservation of Foreign Exchange and Prevention of Smuggling Activities Act, 1974 (COFEPOSA), this Directorate is empowered to sponsor cases of preventive detention about contraventions of FEMA.\n\nFor the trial of an offense punishable under section 4 of PMLA, the Central Government (in consultation with the Chief Justice of the High Court), designates one or more Sessions Court as Special Court(s).\n\nThe court is also called PMLA Court and any appeal against any order passed by the PMLA court can directly be filed in the High Court for that jurisdiction.\n\nBut unlike CBI, ED cannot register a case on its own. It is required by the agencies such as CBI or state police to register an offense based on which the Case Information Report is filed by Enforcement Directorate.\n\nRecently, the Supreme Court upheld the power of the Enforcement Directorate to arrest under PMLA.\n\nThe SC bench held that the power given to ED for making arrests, conducting search and seizures, and attaching proceeds of crime are constitutionally valid and do not suffer from the vice of arbitrariness."

It operates under the\u00a0Ministry of Defence.\n\nThe coast guard force was proposed by the Indian Navy in the 1960s when the sea-borne smuggling of goods was increasingly threatening the Indian economy.\n\nThe\u00a0Nagchaudhuri Committee was constituted with participation from the Indian Navy and the\u00a0Indian Air Force\u00a0to study the problem. In August 1971, the committee identified the requirement to patrol India\u2019s vast coastline.\n\nBy 1973, India had started a program to acquire the equipment and started deputing personnel from the Indian Navy for these anti-smuggling and law enforcement tasks.\n\nIn 1972, the United Nations Convention on the Laws of the Sea (UNCLOS) awarded Exclusive Economic Zones (EEZ) to all coastal states. Thereafter the Union of India, enacted the Maritime Zones of India Act 1976 to claim sovereign rights over the vast sea area of the Exclusive Economic Zone.\n\nIn one stroke, India acquired 2.01 million sq km of the ocean for extensive exploitation of all living and non-living resources, and this vast area needed to be policed.\n\nThe discovery of oil in Mumbai (then Bombay) High, and the consequent development of high-value offshore installations, also necessitated measures for protection and disaster response in this extremely vital area of India\u2019s industrial and economic interests.\n\nIn 1977, Union Cabinet approved the setting up of a Coast Guard\u2019 with two frigates and five patrol boats transferred from the Indian Navy.\n\nThe duties and functions of the service were formally defined in the\u00a0Coast Guard Act, which was passed by India\u2019s parliament on 18 August 1978 and came into immediate effect.\n\nThe first Indian Coast Guard Ship ICGS Kuthar was transferred from the Indian Navy to the Indian Coast Guard in 1978.\n\nThe Indian Coast Guard inducted Chetak helicopters in 1982 as the standard Search and Rescue helicopter due to their vastly proven safety record. The helicopter is being manufactured in India by HAL since 1965.\n\nOrganization of Indian Coast Guard\n\nThe organization is headed by the Director-General of Indian Coast Guard (DGICG) exercising his overall command and superintendence from the Coast Guard Headquarters (CGHQ) located in New Delhi.\n\nAt CGHQ, he is assisted by four Deputy Director Generals of the rank of Inspector General, and other senior officers heading various staff divisions.\n\nFor effective command and control, the Maritime Zones of India are divided into five Coast Guard Regions, namely:\n\nNorth-West ( Regional Headquarters in Gandhinagar)\nWest (Regional Headquarters at Mumbai)\nEast (Regional Headquarters at Chennai)\nNorth-East (Regional Headquarters at Kolkata)\nAndaman & Nicobar (Regional Headquarters at Port Blair)\n\nThe Coast Guard Regions are commanded by Officers of the rank of Inspector General.\n\nThe regions are further divided into twelve Coast Guard \u2018Districts\u2019, one each for the nine coastal states on the mainland, two in the Andaman & Nicobar Region, and one at Kavaratti in the Lakshadweep and Minicoy Islands.\n\nEach Coast Guard District comprises one or more Coast Guard Stations.\u00a0 In addition, there are Coast Guard Air Stations (CGAS) and Air Enclaves (CGAE) for air operations from various locations along the coastline.\n\nMissions of the ICG\nSafety and protection of artificial islands, offshore terminals, and other installations\nProtection and assistance to fishermen and mariners at sea\nPreservation and protection of\u00a0marine ecology\u00a0and environment including pollution control\nAssistance to the Department of Customs and other authorities in anti-smuggling operations\nLaw enforcement in\u00a0territorial\u00a0as well as\u00a0international waters\nScientific data collection and support\nNational defence during hostilities (under the operational control of the Indian Navy)\nAdditional responsibilities of the Indian Coast Guard\nOffshore Security Coordination Committee (OSCC)\nNational Maritime Search and Rescue Coordinating Authority (NMSARCA\nLead Intelligence Agency (LIA) \u2013 For coastal and sea borders\nCoastal Security \u2013 The Director-General of the Indian Coast Guard is the commander of coastal command and is responsible for overall coordination between central and state agencies in all matters relating to coastal security.\nIndian coast guard units\nOffshore patrol vessels\n\nVikram class:\n\nVigraha\nVikram\nVijaya\n\nSamarth class\n\nSamarth\nShoor\nSarathi\nShaunak\nShaurya\nSujay\n\nSamar class\n\nSamar\nSangram\nSarang\nSagar\n\nSankalp class\n\nSankalp\nSamrat\n\nVishwast class\n\nVishwast\nVijit\nVaibhav\nPollution control vessels\nSamudra prahari\nSamudra paheredar\nSamudra pavak\nFast patrol vessels\n\nPriyadarshini class\n\nRazia sultana\n\nSarojini Naidu class\n\nSarojini Naidu\nSubhadra kumari chauhan\nDurgabai Deshmukh\nMeera Behn\nKasturba Gandhi\nSavitri Bai Phule\nAruna Asaf Ali\n\nRani abbakka class\n\nRani abbakka\nRani avantibai\nRani durgavati\nRani gaidinliu\nRani roshmoni\n\nRajshree class\n\nRajshree\nRajratan\nRajtarang\nRajdoot\nRajkiran\nRajveer\nRajkamal\nRajdhwaj\n\nAadesh class\n\nAadesh\nAchook\nAmeya\nAnmol\nAbheek\nAgrim\nAmogh\nApoorva\nAbhinav\nAmal\nAnagh\nArinjay\nAbhiraj\nAmartya\nAnkit\nArnvesh\nArush\nAryaman\nAtulya\nAyush\nAircraft\nDornier 228\nHAL Dhruv\nHAL Chetak\nRecent developments\n\nPay Roll Automation for Disbursement of Monthly Allowances (PADMA), an automated Pay & Allowances module for the Indian Coast Guard was\u00a0launched recently.\n\nPADMA is an automated platform leveraging the latest technology that will provide seamless and timely disbursal of Pay & Allowances to around 15,000 Indian Coast Guard personnel."

Organized crime can be motivated by political agendas as well apart from terrorist groups, rebel forces, and separatists.\n\nThere are various terms used for criminal organizations like a gang, mafia, mob, ring, or syndicate. There have been sociological studies on the oldest Sicilian mafia along with the economic studies of organized crime groups like the Russian mafia, the Chinese triads, the Hong Kong Triads, and the Japanese Yakuza.\n\nOrganized crime is considered to be a changing and flexible phenomenon. Many of the benefits of globalization such as easier and faster communication, movement of finances, and international travel, have also created opportunities for transnational organized criminal groups to flourish, diversify and expand their activities.\n\nTraditional, territorial-based criminal groups have evolved or have been partially replaced by smaller and more flexible networks with branches across several jurisdictions. In the course of an investigation, victims, suspects, organized criminal groups, and proceeds of crime may be located in many States.\n\n\ud83d\udc49 Which year are YOU targeting for success in the IAS/IPS/IFS Exam? \ud83d\ude80\n\n(1) \u21d2 UPSC 2025: Prelims cum Mains\n\n(2) \u21d2 UPSC 2026: Prelims cum Mains\n\n(3) \u21d2 UPSC 2027 Prelims cum Mains\n\nTip: Know more about ClearIAS Courses (Online/Offline)\n\nMoreover, organized crime affects all States, whether as countries of supply, transit, or demand. As such, modern organized crime constitutes a global challenge that must be met with a concerted, global response.\n\nTerrorism\n\nAccording to Interpol, terrorism encompasses a range of complex threats: organized terrorism in conflict zones, foreign terrorist fighters, radicalized \u2018lone wolves, and attacks using chemical, biological, radiological, nuclear (CBRN), and explosive materials.\n\nInternational terrorism: Violent, criminal acts committed by individuals and/or groups who are inspired by, or associated with, designated foreign terrorist organizations or nations (state-sponsored).\n\nDomestic terrorism: Violent, criminal acts committed by individuals and/or groups to further ideological goals stemming from domestic influences, such as those of a political, religious, social, racial, or environmental nature.\n\nMany factors have contributed to the evolution of the terrorism threat on both the international and domestic fronts, such as:\n\nLone offenders:\u00a0Terrorist threats have evolved from large-group conspiracies toward lone-offender attacks. These individuals often radicalize online and mobilize to violence quickly. Without a clear group affiliation or guidance, lone offenders are challenging to identify, investigate, and disrupt.\nThe Internet and social media:\u00a0International and domestic violent extremists have developed an extensive presence on the Internet through messaging platforms and online images, videos, and publications. These facilitate the groups\u2019 ability to radicalize and recruit individuals who are receptive to extremist messaging. Social media has also allowed both international and domestic terrorists to gain unprecedented, virtual access to people.\nDifferences between organized crimes and terrorism:\n\nThe differences between them rest on means and ends:\n\nTerrorism aims to overthrow the existing government by altering the status quo. Organized crime, on the other hand, aims to form a parallel government while coexisting with the existing one.\nSecondly, terrorism primarily uses violent means, whereas theoretically organized crime prefers to be non-violent but not always.\nThird, terrorism is driven purely by political objectives despite the exploitation of regional, national and religious sentiments to achieve their ends; while, economic objectives are the core of operations of organized crime.\nLinkages of organized crimes with terrorism\n\nOrganized crimes and terrorism exist because of ineffective governance and weak law and order set up in a country.\n\nTerrorists can benefit from organized crime as a source of financing or logistical support through the illicit trafficking of arms, persons, drugs, artifacts, and cultural property.\n\nBut terrorist groups can also benefit from the illicit trade in natural resources and wildlife, the abuse of legitimate commercial enterprise, donations, and proceeds of criminal activity, including kidnapping for ransom, extortion, and bank robbery, as well as piracy.\n\nTransnational organized criminal groups seek to exploit legitimate activities for criminal purposes. How they are reaping profit is becoming more creative.\n\nAs organized crime groups join ever more complex networks spanning the globe, the crimes become increasingly transnational and the types of crime they can commit become diversified.\n\nNew threats to global security are emerging, meaning that people can fall victim to organized crime in an increasing number of ways, in an increasing number of places.\n\nMany factors help the growth of organized crime which eventually aids the larger realm of terrorism-\n\nIncreasing demands for illegal goods in the global market like the trade of Human organs, endangered wildlife, drugs, etc.\nGeographical terrain\u00a0and open borders.\nGlobalization had brought new opportunities and markets for illegal activities of such groups.\nIllegal relations between politicians, bureaucrats, and criminals\nThe criminalization of politics.\nTechnology also helped them to operate safely.\nThe globalization of the economy has helped crime syndicates carry out their illegal activities across the borders with great ease. This has been further facilitated by the phenomenon of digital money. Such organizations, very conveniently find safe havens outside the country.\nLinkages between organized crimes and terrorism in India\n\nIn India, the linkages between the two exist at national and transnational levels. At the national level, both terrorists and those involved in organized crime are within India. At the international level, collaboration exists between transnational syndicates and terrorists from inside and outside India.\n\nIndia\u2019s proximity to drug-producing regions like Golden Crescent in the West and Golden Triangle in the East has always been a cause of worry.\nIn the Northeast, extortion is the fundamental basis for funding all forms of terrorism. In addition to this, kidnapping has been used extensively for spreading terror and raising funds. Human trafficking, drug trafficking, and gun-running are some of the other criminal activities that have been common in these areas.\nIn J&K, counterfeit currency has been a major source of funding for terrorism.\nIn the Maoist terror movements, extortion is yet again a common phenomenon. They have also indulged in robberies of banks to fund their movement. There have also been reports of cuts being enforced on drug-yielding crops in the region.\nThe Indian Mujahideen have also resorted to crime to raise funds. This includes robberies, kidnappings, etc.\n\nThere are also several insurgent groups that over some time have morphed into crime syndicates. What began as an ideological movement is now merely a means of generating profit. This is especially the case with insurgent groups in Northeast India.\n\nAnother significant relationship between organized crime and terrorism, especially in Kashmir, is through the spread of counterfeit currency. Terrorists are the main couriers of Indian counterfeit currency inside Kashmir, which then spreads all over India. Even guides for the militants from across the border are paid with counterfeit money.\n\nGlobal efforts to curb organized crimes and terrorism\n\nThe Conference of the Parties to the United Nations Convention on Transnational Organized Crime (UNTOC) identified cybercrime, identity-related crimes, trafficking in cultural property, environmental crime, piracy, organ trafficking, and fraudulent medicine as new and emerging crimes of concern. The emergence of these new crime types gives rise to the need for law enforcement response to adapt its efforts and capacities accordingly.\n\nThe Convention represents a major step forward in the fight against transnational organized crime and signifies the recognition by the Member States of the seriousness of the problems posed by it, as well as the need to foster and enhance close international cooperation to tackle those problems.\n\nStates that ratify this instrument commit themselves to take a series of measures against transnational organized crime, including the creation of domestic criminal offenses (participation in an organized criminal group, money laundering, corruption, and obstruction of justice);\nThe adoption of new and sweeping frameworks for extradition, mutual legal assistance, and law enforcement cooperation;\nAnd the promotion of training and technical assistance for building or upgrading the necessary capacity of national authorities.\n\nAddressing the linkages between organized crime and terrorism has become an increasing priority for the international community. The UN has adopted several resolutions focused on addressing the links between terrorism and various forms of organized crime.\n\nUNODC supports links between organized crime and terrorism through a variety of projects. This includes initiatives on improving border management, such as profiling high-risk passengers and cargo, facilitating international cooperation, and combating the financing of terrorism.\n\nIn 2019, the Security Council adopted\u00a0resolution 2482, which urged Member States to address the links between terrorism and organized crime, by adopting policy measures.\n\nGreat strides have been made to better understand the linkages between terrorists and organized criminal groups owing to the adoption of Resolution 2482 with the emphasis on the following measures:\n\nRatifying relevant legal instruments, including the global counter-terrorism instruments, the Convention against Transnational Organized Crime, and the international drug control conventions;\nFighting money-laundering, terrorist financing, and corruption by firming up Financial Intelligence Units, following relevant United Nations instruments and resolutions and Financial Action Task Force (FATF) recommendations, as well as building public-private partnerships;\nStrengthening border security and international coordination, for example by collecting and analysing API/PNR passenger data;\nImplementing comprehensive responses to drug demand and illicit drug trafficking;\nImproving prison management, to prevent radicalization to violence and recidivism; and\nDeveloping strategies incorporating whole-of-society approaches to prevent and counter violent extremism.\n\nThese can facilitate the legislative, policy, and operational responses.\n\nChallenges\nIndia has no legal framework to punish organized crimes in\u00a0 India,\u00a0 some of the states have but that is not sufficient enough.\nThe existing general conspiracy laws and Act are inadequate as it targets individual only, we don\u2019t have laws for criminal groups.\nIt is very difficult to find proof, that organized crime groups are structured hierarchically,\u00a0 it is not possible to have the actual perpetrators, and there is no legal backing for witnesses, as there is no law for the protection of witnesses against these organized gangs.\nThe witness doesn\u2019t provide the actual details of the incident, there is a lack of details and training for the police officers to catch hold of these gangs we have a lack of staff in the police stations.\nWe have a poor criminal justice system, and most of the states don\u2019t have enough resources to fund the agencies, there is no power agency for the investigation of organized crimes.\nMoreover, India doesn\u2019t have any national-level organization to coordinate the work of the state, city police as well as central executive agencies, there is also no agency to gather, \u00a0accumulate, or investigate, \u00a0documents related to organized crimes, and lack of exchange of information, followed by lack of corporate framework, there is problems of coordination between the central and the state government or between states, viewpoint clashes, etc.\nConclusion and Way Forward\n\nThe linkages between organized crimes and terrorism are not absolute as in most developed nations organized crimes thrive with few or are independent of terrorist activities.\n\nThe linkages exist in regions of poor governance and order. While organized crime involves many activities, its linkages with terrorism stem from the illegal trafficking of drugs, arms, and human beings and money laundering. Terrorist groups, whether indigenous or sponsored by outside states, need arms and money for their fight against the security forces.\n\nOrganized crime is not only a national-level threat but has emerged as an international threat, where all the countries must come together and globally respond to it. The police department should be well equipped with trained staff, modern weapons, and increased manpower, we need to increase our cyber security safety, \u00a0along with increasing coastal security, with registration on wooden boats which is an easy way for terrorists to enter\u00a0 India.\n\nThe government should introduce hi-tech software to track organized crime groups. Technology, Manpower, and intelligence must work together to organized crime in India, and especially agencies should be formed for this matter.\n\nRead:\u00a0Extradition Treaties of India"

It involves creating an ecosystem to design, develop and manufacture different types of equipment indigenously.\n\nA country like India with its immense potential and strategic location requires to be self-reliant, hence it is important to pursue the idea of indigenisation for:\n\nSelf-defence: The presence of hostile neighbours like China and Pakistan makes it improbable for India to boost its self-defence and preparedness.\nStrategic advantage: Self-reliance will make India\u2019s geopolitical stance strategically stronger as a net security provider.\nTechnological advancement: Advancement in the defence technology sector will automatically boost other industries hence catapulting the economy further ahead.\nEconomic drain: India spends around 3% of GDP on defence and 60% of that is spent on imports. This leads to an immense economic drain.\nEmployment: Defence manufacturing will need the support of numerous other industries which generate employment opportunities.\nWhy indigenisation?\nThe Stockholm International Peace Research Institute (SIPRI) reported that\u00a0 India was the world\u2019s second-largest importer of\u00a0major arms in 2014-18 and accounted for 9.5% of the global total and India\u2019s military expenditure rose by 3.1%.\nC&AG report, 2011 to the Parliament, highlighted the 90% import dependency of Hindustan Aeronautics Ltd (HAL) for \u2018raw materials and bought-out items for the production of indigenous equipment.\nIndia has been spending around\u00a04% of its GDP on\u00a0defence.\nThe\u00a0Self-Reliance Index (SRI) (the ratio of indigenous content of defence procurements to the total expenditure on defence procurements in a financial year) is at a low of 0.3.\nHistory of the Indian defence sector\n\nThe conflict with China in 1962 alerted India of her under-preparedness for war which led to increasing the defence expenditure to 2.3% of GDP.\n\nIn the Indo-Pak war of 1965, the US imposed an embargo on the export of arms led to the defence ties with the soviet union intensifying.\n\n\ud83d\udc49 Which year are YOU targeting for success in the IAS/IPS/IFS Exam? \ud83d\ude80\n\n(1) \u21d2 UPSC 2025: Prelims cum Mains\n\n(2) \u21d2 UPSC 2026: Prelims cum Mains\n\n(3) \u21d2 UPSC 2027 Prelims cum Mains\n\nTip: Know more about ClearIAS Courses (Online/Offline)\n\nBut over the years, the overdependence on the Soviet Union for defence equipment had forced a change in India\u2019s approach to defence industrialization from license-based production to indigenous design-based production.\n\nIn the mid-1980s, the government started pumping resources into research and development\u00a0to help DRDO to undertake high-profile projects.\n\nThe most relevant development in defence indigenization was made in 1983 when the government-sanctioned the Integrated Guided Missile Development Programme (IGMDP)to develop five missile systems:\n\nPrithvi (surface-to-surface)\nAkash (surface-to-air)\nTrishul (the naval version of Prithvi)\nNag (anti-tank)\nAgni Ballistic missiles with different ranges, i.e. Agni (I, II, III, IV, V)\n\nIn 1990\u00a0Self Reliance Review Committee(SRRV) under A.P.J.

It was divided into four commands- Punjab (Northwest Frontier), Bengal, Madras (with Burma), and Bombay (with Sindh, Quetta, and Aden).\n\n1912: The Prince of Wales Royal Indian Military College was established at Dehradun to provide education to the wards of aristocratic and well-to-do Indian families and to prepare selected Indian boys for admission into the Royal Military College, Sandhurst. Cadets were given a King\u2019s commission, after passing out, and were posted to one of the eight units selected for Indianisation.\n\n1914-18: World War I saw 1.3 million Indian soldiers participate, out of which 74,187 were killed or missing in action. They contributed to European, Mediterranean, Middle Eastern, and African war theatres.\n\n1939-45: During World War II, the Indian soldiers fought with the Allies. India had been pulled into war without the consent of the Indians. This has led to demands for complete independence in return.\n\nMany Indian soldiers deflected during the war to support the independence movement from outside. This led to many joining the Free India Legion in Germany. The Indian POWs joined the Indian National Army in Singapore which was led by Subhash Chandra Bose.\n\nIndian army after independence\n\nAfter the independence and partition in 1947, four of the ten Gurkha regiments were transferred to the British Army. The rest of the British Indian army was divided between the newly created nations of India and Pakistan.\n\n1947: Indo-Pak war of 1947 or the First Kashmir War saw the Indian army playing a crucial role. An intense war was waged across the state borders. Pakistan suffered significant losses and was stopped on the line formed which is now called the Line of Control (LOC).\n\n1948: After partition, the Nizam of Hyderabad chose to remain independent and maybe join Pakistan later on. The Indian Army troops were ordered by then Deputy Prime Minister Saradar Vllabhai Patel to secure Hyderabad state after the talks between Nizam and the government of India reached a stalemate. The Indian army was backed by the Indian Air Force.\n\n1950: The Indian Army sent its 60th Parachute Field Ambulance unit to aid UN troops during the Korean War (1950-53).\n\n1961: The Army participated in Operation Vijay launched to secure Goa Daman and Diu from the Portuguese.\n\n1962: The Sino- Indian war broke out in the Aksai Chin region (now under Chinese control) and Arunachal Pradesh. The Chinese and Indian troops made incursions beyond the disputed McMahon Line increasing the tensions. However India lost footing in the war because of poor coordination among various divisions of the Indian Army, and the late decision to mobilize the Indian Air Force gave China a crucial tactical and strategic advantage over India. The Line of Actual Control (LAC) came into being after this.\n\nThe LAC is generally divided into three sectors:\n\nThe western sector between\u00a0Ladakh on the Indian side and the\u00a0Tibet\u00a0and\u00a0Xinjiang\u00a0autonomous regions on the Chinese side.\nThe middle, mostly undisputed sector between Uttrakhand and Himachal Pradesh on the Indian side and the Tibet autonomous region on the Chinese side.\nThe eastern sector is between Arunachal Pradesh on the Indian side and the Tibet autonomous region on the Chinese side. This sector generally follows the McMahon line.\n\n1965: The Indo-Pak War of 1965 saw the Indian army in all its glory as they launched major and successful offensives. The infamous tank battle, the battle of Asal Uttar, and the largest tank battle, the battle of Chawinda after World War II saw the Indian Army\u2019s victory.\n\n1967: The Cho La incident or the Sino-Indian skirmish was a military conflict between the Indian army and the Chinese People\u2019s Liberation Army in Sikkim. Indian army convincingly ousted the PLA from Sikkim.\n\n1971: The president\u2019s rule of 1971 saw the launch of counter-insurgency Operation Steeplechase by the Indian army and police against Naxalites in the Red Corridor.\n\nThe Bangladesh Liberation War of 1971 had heavy involvement of the Indian Armed forces. The Indian army battalions were engaged in clashes on both the eastern and western front, with air support from the Indian Air Force. Many famous battles like the Battle of Longewala were fought.\n\n1984: The Indian army participated in Operation Meghdoot to secure the Siachen glacier from Pakistani incursions. \u00a0An entire battalion of the Kumaon Regiment was airlifted to the glacier. The Indian Army continues to control all of the Siachen Glacier and its tributary glaciers, which is one of the harshest and inhospitable conditions for the troops to be posted in.\n\nIndian army has played important roles in many counter-insurgency operations over the years, such as Operation Blue Star and Woodrose against Sikh insurgents in the 1980s and Operation golden bird in 1995 in the northeast.\n\n1999: The Pakistani army had captured major vantage points in Kashmir. Once the scale of the Pakistani incursion was realized, the Indian Army quickly mobilized about 200,000 troops, and Op Vijay was launched. However, since the heights were under Pakistani control, India was at a clear strategic disadvantage. But by the end of the Kargil War, all the enemy-occupied areas were back under Indian army control. This war gave rise to many brave and gallant stories of bravery and sacrifice by the Indian army.\n\n2016: The Indian Army carried out surgical strikes in PoK in the terrorist launch pads in response to the terrorist attack on Indian army soldiers in Uri. The final ceasefire was reached in 2018 between both countries.\n\n2017: The Doklam crisis was a border stand-off between the Indian Army and the Chinese PLA over the Chinese construction of a road in Doklam, a trijunction between India, China, and Bhutan. Indian army has launched op juniper to stop the Chinese.\n\nMajor exercises of the Indian Army\n\nOp. Brasstacks (1986): It was launched by the Indian Army to simulate a full-scale war on India\u2019s western border. The exercise was the largest ever conducted in India. It included nine infantry, three mechanized, three armored divisions, and one air assault division, as well as three independent armored brigades.\n\nEx. Nomadic Elephant: The\u00a0army has been conducting training exercises with the Mongolian army since 2004.\n\nEx. Yudh Abhyas: The Yudh Abhyas exercise is an ongoing series, since 2005.

Shakti: The Shakti exercise is an ongoing series, since 2011, of joint exercises between the Indian and French armies. The exercise is conducted to practice and validate anti-terrorist operations in snowbound and mountainous areas.\n\nStructure of the Indian Army\n\nThe Army is operationally and geographically divided into seven commands, with the basic field formation being a division. Below the division level are permanent regiments that are responsible for their recruiting and training.\n\nFuture of the army\n\nThe theme of the year 2022 is \u201cIn stride with the Future\u201d, which signifies the army\u2019s commitment to empowering the force through re-structuring and induction of modern weapon systems for future conflicts.\n\nEmerging technologies, such as Artificial Intelligence, Cyber Warfare, Robotics, and Aerospace, which have the potential for Military application and a disruptive impact on modern-day warfare are being explored and inducted.\n\nTo confront multifarious security challenges, the Indian Army is\u00a0\u201cIn Stride with the Future\u201d, fully committed to modernization with an impetus to indigenous solutions.\n\nF-INSAS (Future Infantry Soldier As a System) is the Indian Army\u2019s principal infantry modernization program, which aims to modernize the army\u2019s 465 infantry and paramilitary battalions by 2020.\n\nIndia is also reorganizing the mechanized forces to achieve strategic mobility by progressively deploying more Arjun main battle tanks (MBT).

This was stipulated by the Indian Air Force Act of 1932.\n\nThe first aircraft flight came into being on 1st April 1933 when its first squadron of 4 Westland Wapiti airplanes was commissioned. It included 5 Indian pilots led by a British officer.\n\nDuring World War II, the IAF played a key role in stopping the Japanese advance in Burma. Arjan Singh was a flight lieutenant during this mission and went on to become India\u2019s first and only Marshal of the Air Force.\n\nIn 1943, the first flying school was established in Ambala to provide basic and advanced training for IAF pilots.\n\nIAF after independence\n\nImmediately after independence, during partition, the Royal Indian Air Force provided effective logistics support and transport to Indian troops. But there was no direct air-to-air combat with the Pakistani air force.\n\n1960: IAF activated the No. 5 Squadron to support the United Nations operation in Congo when Belgium\u2019s 75-year rule ended abruptly causing widespread violence.\n\n1961: IAF played a very important role in the annexation of Goa from the Portuguese. This was called Operation Vijay, where IAF provided support to the ground forces.\n\n1962: During the Sino-Indian War of 1962, India ended up losing significantly Chinese as the military planners failed to effectively use the IAF.\n\n1965: IAF engaged the enemy air force quite effectively during the Indo-Pak war of 1965 or the Second Kashmir War. The IAF was successful in preventing the Pakistan Air Force from gaining air superiority.\n\nThe IAF changed to improve its capabilities after the 1965 war. The Para Commandos regiment was created in 1966 to increase its logistics supply and rescue operations ability. India started to put more stress on the indigenous manufacture of fighter aircraft.\n\n1971: During the Indo-Pak War of 1971 or the Bangladesh Liberation War, the role of the IAF was very crucial. IAF carried out numerous sorties and even supported the Indian Navy in the Bay of Bengal and Arabian Sea. IAF has complete air superiority during the conflict.\n\nAfter the 1971 war with Pakistan, the IAF received the highest award for gallantry in India, the Param Vir Chakra which was awarded posthumously to Flying Officer Nirmal Jit Singh Sekhon.\n\n1984: India launched Operation Meghdoot to capture the Siachen Glacier in the contested Kashmir region. In Op Meghdoot, IAF\u2019s Mi-8, Chetak, and Cheetah helicopters airlifted hundreds of Indian troops to Siachen.\n\n1987: Operation Poomalai or Eagle Mission 4 was the codename assigned to a mission undertaken by the IAF for airdropping supplies over the besieged town of Jaffna in Sri Lanka on 4 June 1987 to support the Tamil Tigers during the Sr Lankan civil war.\n\nOperation Pawan was the operation in which the air force supported the Indian peacekeeping forces (IPKF) in northern and eastern Sri Lanka.\n\n1988: IAF also provided support to the Maldives in Operation Cactus or the Maldives coup d\u2019etat attempt.\n\n1999: Operation Safed Sagar, as the air operations in the Kargil area were called, was a milestone in the history of military aviation, as this was the first time that airpower was employed in such an environment.\n\nAfter the Kargil conflict, IAF has been actively guarding the Indian air space and numerous events have been recorded of their proficiency.\n\n2019: The Balakot Airstrike was carried out after the 2019 Pulwama attack carried out by Jaish-e-Mohammad (JeM) killing 46 CRPF personnel.

India used anti-ship missiles for the first time during this operation to destroy the Pakistani destroyer ship PNS Khaibar. Three more warships of The Indian Navy, INS Nipat, INS Nirghat, and INS Veer, played an important role in the attack.\n\nHistory of the Indian Navy\n\nThe maritime history of India goes back to about 6000 years. The art of navigation has been recorded since the Indus Valley Civilisation. Then on the Indians have leaped ahead continuously in maritime trade and expansions. Since ancient times India\u2019s trade relations with countries of the Pacific and Indian oceans have been recorded. From the Kalinga empire in 5-10 CE to the Chola empire in 984-1042 CE, naval expeditions have reached far and beyond Malaya and Sumatran islands as well.\n\nDuring the 14th and 15th centuries, Indian shipbuilding skills and maritime ability were so sophisticated that they could produce ships with a capacity to carry over a hundred men along with large quantities of goods for trade.\n\nThe advent of Europeans in India started sowing seeds of the decline of the Indian naval power. Even though there were few instances of strong naval forces throughout history, like with the Mughals, Gujarat kingdom, and the Marathas.\n\nThe Royal Indian Navy\n\nThe formation of the Royal Indian Navy can be traced back to 1612, when the British and Portuguese engaged in a naval encounter, hence forcing the British to regularly maintain a naval fleet on the west coast of India.\n\nIn 1834, the navy which was earlier named the Bombay Marine became the Her Majesty\u2019s Indian Navy. The navy participated in the First Opium War of 1840 and the Second Anglo-Burmese War in 1852.\n\nIt was called Her Majesty\u2019s Indian Marine in 1877. Later, in 1892 the Marine was rechristened the Royal Indian Marine which participated in World War I.\n\nIn 1934, the Marine was upgraded to a full naval force, thus becoming the Royal Indian Navy (RIN), and was presented the King\u2019s colors in recognition of its services to the British Crown.\n\nThe RIN participated in World War II with a small fleet but suffered causalities too. The RIN was dominated by British officers, and no Indian held a high rank, even after World War II.\n\nThis situation along with racial discrimination and poor communications led to the Royal Indian Navy mutiny in 1946. But the revolt failed as it did not receive support from the Indian Army the leaders of Congress or the Muslim League.\n\nPost-independence status of the Indian Navy\n\nThe 1961 liberation of Goa from the Portuguese was the first engagement of the Indian Navy post-independence. The navy also played important roles in the Indo-Pak War of 1965 and the Indo-Pak War of 1971.\n\nOver the years, the Indian Navy has executed several operations and relief operations in various parts of the world.\n\nFrom the 21st century onwards, the Indian Navy has played a crucial role in maintaining peace on the maritime front. It has been deployed for humanitarian relief in times of natural disasters and crises across the globe, as well as to keep India\u2019s maritime trade routes free and open.\n\nRecent news about the Indian Navy\nThe Indian Navy\u2019s firepower got a major boost with the induction of INS Visakhapatnam, one of the four stealth guided-missile destroyer ships under Project 15B, at the Western Naval Command in Mumbai on Sunday.\nINS Visakhapatnam is packed with an array of weapons and sensors, which include supersonic surface-to-surface and surface-to-air missiles, medium and short-range guns, anti-submarine rockets, advanced electronic warfare, and communication suits.\nThe scorpene-class submarine, INS Vela, the fourth submarine under P75 has been commissioned into the Indian Navy.\nProject 15B\n\nThe Project 15B class of guided-missile destroyers, an improved variant of the Kolkata-class destroyers, are being built by Mazagon Dock Limited (MDL) for the Indian Navy.\n\nThe four ships in the project are:\n\nINS Vishakapatnam (commissioned)\nINS Mormogaon (ready for trials)\nINS Imphal (advanced stage of outfitting)\nINS Surat (to be launched in 2022)\nFeatures of the ships\nThese ships are amongst the most technologically advanced Guided Missile Destroyers in the world, with state-of-the-art weapon/sensor packages, advanced stealth features, and a high degree of automation.\nThey are equipped with\u00a0Brahmos supersonic cruise missiles and long-range surface-to-air Missiles (SAM).\nThe ship has several indigenous weapons systems like\u00a0medium-range Surface-to-Air missiles (SAMs), indigenous torpedo tube launchers, anti-submarine indigenous rocket launchers, and a 76-mm super rapid gun mount.\nThe destroyers will feature multiple fire zones, battle damage control systems (BDCS), and distributional power systems for improved survivability and reliability in emergent conditions.\nThe total atmospheric control system (TACS) onboard the vessel will protect the crew from chemical, biological and nuclear threats.\n\nIt is one of\u00a0the Indian Navy\u2019s paramount responsibilities\u00a0to safeguard the large coastline of 7516 Kms and almost 1100 offshore islands with 2.01 million sq km EEZ (exclusive economic zone). The current geopolitical scenario has only intensified the need for more vigilance.\n\nDestroyers like the P-15B class will\u00a0play an important role\u00a0in the oceans of the\u00a0Indo-Pacific,\u00a0making the Indian Navy a powerful force.\n\nThe guided-missile Destroyers are deployed for various responsibilities like escort duties with the Carrier Battle Group\u00a0to protect the Naval fleet against any air, surface, and underwater threats.\n\nOther projects of the Indian Navy\nProject 75\n\nProject 75 (P75) involves the acquisition of six ships of the Kalvari-class diesel-electric attack submarines. The submarines have been ordered by the Indian Ministry of Defence (MoD) for the Indian Navy.\n\nThe P75 Kalvari-class diesel-electric / air-independent propulsion (AIP) submarines are based on the Scorpene-class submarines, which were designed by French naval shipbuilding firm Naval Group (formerly known as DCNS) in partnership with Spanish shipbuilding firm Navantia.\n\nThe new\u00a0submarines\u00a0are being built by Mazagon Dock Shipbuilders (formerly known as Mazagon Dock) in Mumbai, India, using the technology and training provided by the Naval Group.\n\nThe six scorpene class submarines under P75 are:\n\nINS Kalvari (commissioned in 2017)\nINS Khanderi (commissioned in 2019)\nINS Karanj (commissioned in 2021)\nINS Vela (commissioned in 2021)\nINS Vagir (launched in 2020)\nINS Vagsheer (expected launch in 2021)\n\nThe Indian Navy intends to use the submarines for missions including area surveillance, intelligence gathering, anti-submarine warfare, anti-surface warfare, and minelaying operations.\n\nProject 75I (India)\n\nThe\u00a0Project 75 (India)-class submarines, or\u00a0P-75I, for short, are a planned class of diesel-electric\u00a0submarines, which are to be built for the\u00a0Indian Navy. The P-75I class is a follow-on of the\u00a0P-75 class submarines\u00a0of the\u00a0Indian Navy.\n\nThis project envisages\u00a0the indigenous construction of submarines equipped with a state-of-the-art\u00a0air-independent propulsion system.\n\nUnder this project, the Indian Navy intends to acquire six conventional,\u00a0diesel-electric\u00a0attack submarines, which will have advanced features like\u2013\n\nAir-independent propulsion (AIP)\nISTAR(intelligence,\u00a0surveillance,\u00a0target acquisition, and\u00a0reconnaissance)\nSpecial Operations Forces (SOF)\nAnti-ship warfare\u00a0(AShW)\nAnti-submarine warfare\u00a0(ASW)\nAnti-surface warfare\u00a0(ASuW)\nLand-attack capabilities\u00a0and other features.\n\nProject 75 (I), is part of the Indian Navy\u2019s 30 year Plan for indigenous submarine construction.\n\nIt will be the first under the strategic partnership model which was promulgated in 2017 to boost indigenous defence manufacturing.\nThe strategic partnership model allows domestic defence manufacturers to collaborate with leading foreign defence companies to produce high-end military platforms to reduce import dependence.\n\nAll six submarines are expected to be constructed in India, under the\u00a0Make in India\u00a0initiative.\n\nIndian Navy\u2019s 30-year Plan\n\nThe 30-year submarine-building plan was approved by the\u00a0Cabinet Committee on Security, in June 1999, which included\u00a0the construction of 24 conventional submarines indigenously by 2030.\n\nA total\u00a0of 24 submarines\u00a0are to be built in India,\u00a0and 6\u00a0of them will be\u00a0nuclear-powered.\n\nIndia has one nuclear submarine only at this point- INS Arihant. The\u00a0INS Arighat, also a nuclear-powered ballistic missile submarine, is to be commissioned soon.\n\nINS Chakra, a nuclear submarine, was taken on lease from Russia and is being returned.\n\nNew Naval insignia\n\nThe Prime Minister introduced the new Naval Ensign \u201cNishaan\u201d during the commissioning of the indigenous aircraft carrier INS Vikrant.\n\nThe Indian Naval Ensign was redesigned to shed the colonial past and honor the rich Indian maritime tradition.\n\nThe previous ensign carried the Saint George\u2019s Cross with the Tricolour in the canton (top left corner of the flag).\n\nThe St. George\u2019s Cross, which has a red cross on a white backdrop, serves as the previous Indian Naval Ensign. When India gained independence, the Union Jack was replaced with the Indian flag in the corner of the cross. The famous Maratha Emperor Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj was the inspiration for the new naval ensign.\n\nRead:\u00a0Sonobuoys: How are they crucial in Anti-Submarine Warfare?"

Read to know more.\n\nThe Nagaland Cabinet on December 2021 recommended that the Armed Forces Special Powers Act (AFSPA), 1958 be repealed from the state after the incident in Mon district in which security forces gunned down 13 civilians.\n\nThis has been a long-standing demand in the Northeastern states. After the firing, Nagaland Chief Minister Neiphiu Rio and Meghalaya Chief Minister Conrad Sangma have both called for the repeal of AFSPA.\n\nTable of Contents\n\nWhat is AFSPA, 1958?\nHistory:\nThe Armed Forces (Assam and Manipur) Special Powers Act, 1958:\nThe Armed Forces (Punjab and Chandigarh) Special Powers Act, 1983:\nThe Armed Forces (Jammu and Kashmir) Special Powers Act, 1990:\nSupreme Court verdict, 1998:\nThe Jeevan Reddy Committee:\nWhat are the ground rules of the act?\nWhy is the AFSPA being opposed?\nPoints in favor of the AFSPA:\nWay forward:\nWhat is AFSPA, 1958?\n\nThe Armed Forces Special Powers Act, 1958 is an act of Parliament that gives the armed forces the power to maintain public order in \u201cdisturbed areas\u201d. It gives the armed forces the authority to use force or even open fire after warning a person who is found to be in contravention of the law.\n\nA disturbed area\u00a0is one where the \u201cuse of armed forces in aid of civil power is necessary\u201d. Under section 3 of the AFSPA, any area can be declared disturbed due to differences or disputes between members of different religious, racial, language, or regional groups or castes or communities. The power to declare any territory \u201cdisturbed\u201d initially lay with the states, but passed to the Centre in 1972.\n\nThe Act also allows the forces to arrest a person and enter and search premises without a warrant.\n\n\ud83d\udc49 Which year are YOU targeting for success in the IAS/IPS/IFS Exam? \ud83d\ude80\n\n(1) \u21d2 UPSC 2025: Prelims cum Mains\n\n(2) \u21d2 UPSC 2026: Prelims cum Mains\n\n(3) \u21d2 UPSC 2027 Prelims cum Mains\n\nTip: Know more about ClearIAS Courses (Online/Offline)\n\nThe AFSPA also protects security forces from legal proceedings unless cleared by the centre. The Act applies not only to the three armed forces but also to paramilitary forces such as the Central Reserve Police Force (CRPF) and the Border Security Force.\n\nThis controversial law is in place in Nagaland, Assam, Manipur (excluding seven assembly constituencies of Imphal), and parts of Arunachal Pradesh, besides Jammu and Kashmir. Tripura and parts of Meghalaya were removed from the list.\n\nAlso read: Violence in Manipur\n\nHistory:\n\nThe Armed Forces Special Powers Ordinance of 1942 was promulgated by Viceroy Linlithgow for the\u00a0British colonial government\u00a0on 15 August 1942 to suppress the\u00a0Quit India Movement.\n\nLater during the Partition of India in 1947, four ordinances- the Bengal Disturbed Areas (Special Powers of Armed Forces) Ordinance; the Assam Disturbed Areas (Special Powers of Armed Forces) Ordinance; the East Bengal Disturbed Areas (Special Powers of Armed Forces) Ordinance; the United provinces Disturbed Areas (Special Powers of Armed Forces) Ordinance was invoked by the Indian government to deal with the internal security situation in the country.\n\nArticle 355 of the Constitution of India confers power to the Central Government to protect every state from internal disturbance.\n\nThe Armed Forces (Assam and Manipur) Special Powers Act, 1958:\n\n1951: There was a boycott of the first general election of 1952 by the Naga National Council, which later extended to a boycott of government schools and officials.\n\nTo deal with the situation, the Assam government imposed the Assam Maintenance of Public Order (Autonomous District) Act in the Naga Hills in 1953 and intensified police action against the rebels.\n\nAs the situation worsened, Assam deployed the\u00a0Assam Rifles\u00a0in the Naga Hills and enacted the Assam Disturbed Areas Act of 1955, providing a legal framework for the paramilitary forces and the armed state police to combat insurgency in the region. But the Assam Rifles and the state armed police could not contain the Naga rebellion and the rebel Naga Nationalist Council (NNC) formed a parallel government \u201cThe Federal Government of Nagaland\u201d on 23 March 1956.\n\nThe Armed Forces (Assam and Manipur) Special Powers Ordinance 1958 was promulgated by President Dr. Rajendra Prasad on 22 May 1958. It was replaced by the Armed Forces (Assam and Manipur) Special Powers Act, 1958 on 11 September 1958.\n\nLater the territorial scope of the act also expanded to the seven states of the North-East \u2013 and the words \u201cThe Armed Forces (Assam and Manipur) Special Powers Act, 1958\u201d were substituted by \u201cArmed Forces (Special Powers) Act, 1958\u201d, getting the acronym of AFSPA, 1958.\n\nAlso read: ULFA: Understanding the Peace Pact\n\nThe Armed Forces (Punjab and Chandigarh) Special Powers Act, 1983:\n\nThe central government enacted the Armed Forces (Punjab and Chandigarh) Special Powers Act on 6 October 1983, to enable the central armed forces to operate in the state of Punjab and the union territory of Chandigarh during the militancy days.\n\nThe act was withdrawn in 1997, roughly 14 years after it came to force. Punjab was the first from where the act was repealed.\n\nThe Armed Forces (Jammu and Kashmir) Special Powers Act, 1990:\n\nThe act was enacted in Jammu and Kashmir due to extreme security instability in the area where it remains in force.\n\nSupreme Court verdict, 1998:\n\nIn the case of\u00a0Naga People\u2019s Movement of Human Rights vs. Union of India, the validity of AFSPA was challenged before the Supreme Court and the five-judge bench concluded that the act cannot be considered as a violation of the Constitution and the powers conferred under the section 4 and 5 of the act are not arbitrary and unreasonable and therefore not in violation of the provisions of the Constitution.\n\nThe Jeevan Reddy Committee:\n\nOn November 19, 2004, the Central government appointed a five-member committee headed by\u00a0Justice BP Jeevan Reddy to review the provisions of the act in the northeastern states.\n\nThe Committee had recommended a complete repeal of the law. \u201cThe Act is a symbol of hate, oppression, and an instrument of high-handedness,\u201d it said.\n\nThe committee submitted its report in 2005, which included\u00a0the following recommendations:\n\nAFSPA should be repealed and appropriate provisions should be inserted in the Unlawful Activities (Prevention) Act, 1967\nThe Unlawful Activities Act should be modified to specify the powers of the armed forces and paramilitary forces\nGrievance cells should be set up in each district where the armed forces are deployed.\n\nThe\u00a05th report of the Second Administrative Reforms Commission\u00a0on public order has also recommended the repeal of the AFSPA.\n\nIn 2016, the Supreme Court concerning internal security had ruled that the armed forces cannot escape investigation for excesses committed in the discharge of their duties even in \u2018disturbed areas\u2019. In other words, legal protection offered by the AFSPA cannot be absolute.\n\nThe AFSPA was repealed in Tripura in 2015, and the Centre also removed Meghalaya from the list, while also restricting its use in Arunachal Pradesh in 2018.\n\nWhat are the ground rules of the act?\nWhile the Act gives powers to security forces to open fire, this cannot be done without prior warning given to the suspect.\nThe Act further says that any suspects apprehended by security forces should be handed over to the local police station within 24 hours.\nIt says armed forces must act in cooperation with the district administration and not as an independent body.\nGovernor of a State and the Central Government are empowered to declare any part or full of any state as a disturbed area if according to their opinion that it has become necessary to disrupt the terrorist activity or any such activity that might impinge on the sovereignty of India or cause insult to the national flag, anthem or India\u2019s Constitution.\nSection (3)of AFSPA provides that, if the governor of a state issues an official notification in The Gazette of India then the Central government has the authority to deploy armed forces for assisting the civilian authorities. Once a region is declared \u2018disturbed\u2019 then it has to maintain the status quo for a minimum of three months, as per The Disturbed Areas Act of 1976.\nWhy is the AFSPA being opposed?\n\nThe Act has been called draconian as it gives sweeping powers to the armed forces. It allows them to open fire\u2019, even causing death, against any person in contravention to the law or carrying arms and ammunition.\n\nIt gives them powers to arrest individuals without warrants, based on \u201creasonable suspicion\u201d, and also search premises without warrants.\n\nThe Act further provides blanket immunity to security personnel involved in such operations: There can be no prosecution or legal proceedings against them without the prior approval of the Centre.\n\nPoints in favor of the AFSPA:\nThe AFSPA is applied to an area only when the ordinary laws of the land are found to be inadequate to deal with the extraordinary situation perpetrated by insurgents spreading terror.\nInsurgent movements in India have more or less been proxy-wars being waged against India by external actors and this makes the deployment of armed forces in a counter-insurgency role with enhanced legal protection necessary.\nThe army has, repeatedly, made it clear that it cannot operate without the AFSPA as it needs special powers to tackle home-grown and as well as foreign terrorists.\nWay forward:\n\nThe status quo of the act is no longer the acceptable solution due to numerous human rights violation incidents that have occurred over the years. The AFSPA has become a symbol of oppression in the areas it has been enacted. Hence the government needs to address the affected people and reassure them of favourable action.\n\nThe army fights high-intensity conflicts hence it is important to garner support from the people of the region to fight terrorism and insurgent activities. The armed forces must build the necessary trust amongst the locals to ensure their support in countering insurgency.\n\nThe state bureaucracy, army, and the grass-root civil society organization should come together in the developmental activities of the state hence making the law a positive aspect for the society there.\n\nThe government should consider the imposition and lifting of AFSPA on a case-by-case basis and limit its application only to a few disturbing districts instead of applying it for the whole state. The government and the security forces should also abide by the guidelines set out by The Supreme Court, Jeevan Reddy Commission, and the NHRC."

We shall see each of them with the remedies.\n\n1. Food security\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\u201cWhen all people, at all times, have physical and economic access to sufficient, safe and nutritious food to meet their dietary needs and food preferences for an active and healthy life\u201d (UN definition)\n\nChallenges\nIndia\u2019s population is still growing and will not stabilize until 2050/2060.\nRanked among least developed nation when it comes to the problems of malnutrition and stunning.\nRemedies\nWe can learn from countries in Latin America, who have adopted short and long-term policy choices, categorized as consumer, producer and trade orientated policy approaches to national food security.\nThe holistic approach includes political dialogue not only at national levels but intergovernmental levels encompassing the various government departments to effectively implement PDS.\nCommunity-based Management of Acute Malnutrition (CMAM) programme based on the micro-planning basis at the district level of Rajasthan can be replicated.\n2. Climate Change and Environment Pollution\n\nChallenges\nIndia\u2019s development trajectory has had to contend with increasing environmental challenge. Ex- Indian cities are ranked among the most polluted cities in the world.\nRemedies\nA successful example of Netherlands and France based on raising taxes on polluting inputs which are then invested in sustainable infrastructural development rather than to merely raise revenue can be implemented.\nIndia\u2019s National Action Plan on Climate Change (NAPCC)\u00a0problem of lack of transparency can tackle through Brazilian model involving a ranging number of stakeholders under the umbrella group Inter-Ministerial Committee on Climate Change (CIM).\n3. Water Scarcity and Contamination\nChallenges\nWith a huge population, there is pressure on scarce water resources despite having abundant rain.\nUnsustainable water harvesting structure.\nRemedies\nDenmark model which a focuses on collaborating research institutions adjoin to national universities in which the government awarded grants to follow up on clean water technologies.\nCollaboration with Israel in water technology can open new water conservation technique.\n\n4.\u00a0Energy Security Issues\nChallenges\nAn energy-hungry nation with high GDP growth rate and high dependency on the imported petroleum from the unstable Middle East.\nRemedies\nLaws like Tunisia\u2019s \u201cenergy conservation system\u201d law should be passed which relies on the National Fund for Energy Management to encourage renewable energy investment and enhance skills capacity in the sector.\nLearning from China can be a great help based on looking beyond its neighbourhood and imports fuel from far and wide using a combination of economic diplomatic tools, and various other financial incentives.\n\n5. Public health issues \u2013 infectious diseases, epidemics etc\nChallenges\nPoor health infrastructure, high out of pocket expenditure. Ex- Gorakhpur BRB Hospital case, which led to the death of many children.\nRemedies\n\u2018Chilean Model\u2019 based on Explicit Guarantees and Universal Access (AUGE) programme, which commits to providing universal health care for all citizens made through its two-tier system of Public Health care should be adopted.\n\n6. Disasters\nChallenges\nRegular floods, droughts, landslides, cyclones need a 360-degree preparation. Ex- Bihar, Assam floods.\nUrban floods Ex- Chennai, Mumbai.\nRemedies\nCan be learnt from Japan.\n\n7. International Terrorism\n\n\u201cDeliberate creation and exploitation of fear through violence or threat of violence in pursuit of political change.\u201d\n\nChallenges\nState-funded terrorism by Pakistan through separatist movement in Kashmir valley,\nThe insurgency in Nagaland, Manipur.\nRemedies\nAs per UNESCO, \u201cViolence begins from the mind\u201d, therefore re-engineering of minds of individuals by taking them away from the culture of violence and bringing them closer to the culture of peace is required.\nIndia should use the international platform to make the voice of consensus on the definition of the terrorism.\nCollaboration with Israel would be of great help in surveillance and spying.\n8. Illegal Migration\nChallenges\nBangladeshi illegal immigrants, recent issue related to Rohingya Muslims, etc.\nRemedies\nEncourage legal immigration through redefining citizenship act, reforming laws to inspire from the US immigration laws.\nBilateral cooperation among neighbouring nations to have documentation of illegal immigrants and to have a decent solution.\n9. Organized crimes \u2013 national and transnational\nChallenges\nUse of counterfeit currency, the finding of linkages between terrorists and underworld. Ex- Mumbai terror attack.\u00a0(Terrorist groups such as the Shining Path (Peru) also tap into the organized crime network in order to set up a highly successful drugs smuggling network to fund their terrorist campaigns.)\nNational and transnational crimes like piracy, smuggling and drugs.\nRemedies\nBasic changes have to be made in substantive laws, investigative processes, and police organization.\nLocalize programs- the comprehensive programme like Brazil\u2019s Pronasci to tie up a lot of elements that were drivers of violence in the country, building local frameworks, gun-free zones and fostering the civic culture to reduce violence.\n\n10. Human Security Issues\nChallenges\nIt is the combination of threats associated with war, genocide, and the displacement of populations. At a minimum, human security means freedom from violence and from the fear of violence.\nRemedies\nThe focus should be on early prevention to minimize the impacts of insecurity, to engender long-term solutions.\n\n11.\u00a0Poverty\nCauses of poverty (Challenges)\nPoor agriculture.\nGrowing population.\nThe gap between the rich and the poor.\nCorruption and black-money.\nRemedies\nFarmers must get all facilities for irrigation.\nThey should be trained and educated.\nAgriculture must be made profitable.\nFamily planning schemes should be introduced.\nMore and more industries should be set up to meet the needs of our country.\nCorruption must end. Our offices should work efficiently.\n12. Nuclear Security Issues\nChallenges\nThe legal architecture for radioactive materials is weak.\nLack of universal coverage and implementation of the Code of Conduct.\nUnsecured and open facilities pose a security challenge.\nCradle-to-grave controls on radioactive materials remain weak.\nTracking radioactive sources is a major challenge. Ex- Goi\u00e2nia accident, Brazil: In the late 1980s, a widely publicized incident in Brazil highlighted the importance of properly securing dangerous radiological sources.\nProblems related to a rogue nation like North Korea having a nuclear arsenal.\nThe possibility of non-state actors possessing a nuclear weapon in future because of instability in the international scenario.\nRemedies\nStrengthen the role of the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA).\nAdopting India\u2019s stand of complete nuclear disarmament.\nBroaden universal coverage for the Code of Conduct.\nIncrease voluntary actions.\n13. Proliferation of weapons chemical and biological weapons\nChallenges\nUse of these weapons in Syrian Civil War.\nThe USA used Agent Orange in Vietnam War.\nRemedies\nStrengthening Chemical Weapons Convention (1992) and the Biological Weapons Convention (1975).\nStrengthening export control regime.\n14. Economic security Issues\n\nIt is the condition of having a stable income or other resources to support a standard of living now and in the foreseeable future.\n\nChallenges\nBlack money.\nHigh cash to GDP ratio.\nCounterfeit currency.\nTrade imbalance.\nRemedies\nFacilitating the rapid deployment of civilian technologies.\nThe increasing tax base.\nReducing import through indignation.\n15. Religious extremism\n\nReligious extremism \u201cdescribes faith-based actions that are deliberate attempts to cause harm to other people.\u201d\n\nCauses of extremism\nPersonal causes.\nReligious beliefs and fundamentalism.\nAn abhorrence of sexuality and a reaction to gender equality.\nBroken families.\nSocial causes.\nReactions to multiculturalism.\nSecularization.\nDisordered civic life, poor governance.\nA negative reaction to a dominant culture and modernism.\nSectarianism and faith schools.\nChallenges\nDay to day riots. Ex- Shamali riots, Saharanpur riots.\nRemedies\nReligious Cure\u2013 Instead of giving severe punishments to extremists, they must be debated intellectually and counselled to reach a solution.\nSocial Cure-youths engagement in constructive work.\nMedia\u2013 A platform where all scholars can gather to debate and discuss religious issues can be arranged so that individual differences can be avoided.\nLegal Cure: In the efforts to curb extremism, a legal cure is necessary. This means making laws concerning extremist activities, amending the Religious Unity Act and terrorism laws.\n16. Information Security Issues\n\nIt is the state of being protected against the unauthorized use of information, especially electronic data.\n\nChallenges\nConfidentiality.\nPrivacy.\nData theft/cyber-attack:\u00a0Stuxnet like attack can cripple the vital infrastructure is part of cyber terrorism.\nWannaCry, a crypto-ransomware can stop public life dependent on digital infrastructure.\nA weak IT Act which has become redundant due to non-exploitation and age-old cyber laws.\nLack of awareness and the culture of cybersecurity at the individual as well as institutional level.\nLack of trained and qualified manpower to implement the countermeasures.\nRemedies\nProtection of Critical Information Infrastructure through Public-Private Partnership.\nHarmonizing the National Legal Regime with the International Legal Regime. Ex- the U.S.-India Cyber Relationship Framework.\nSetting up national cyber-security architecture will be of great help.\nCreation of a National Cyber Security Agency (NCSA) to assess the nature of cyber threats and respond to them effectively can be the answer.\nActs like Singapore\u2019s proposed Cyber Security Bill will offer a great safety measure to critical infrastructure.\nIndia\u2019s response towards these issues and the way forward\n\nIndia has a long history of being sensitive to concerns relating to poverty, environment, population growth, socio-economic irregularities, etc. Over the last few decades, the Indian government has launched numerous schemes aiming towards these issues.\n\nHowever, these issues were regarded as developmental issues and not security issues. Even today, the government is reluctant to regard climate change as a security issue.\n\nIt is felt, with some justification, that securitization of developmental issues will be counterproductive. While the government has focused on climate change, energy security, etc. as developmental issues, the security implications of non-traditional challenges cannot be ignored. What is needed is a holistic approach in addressing these non-traditional security issues.\n\nArticle by: Skand Kumar"

            "[CONTENT]": "The Rohingya refugee crisis refers to the mass migration of Rohingyas (Rohingya Muslim people) from Myanmar (Burma) to Bangladesh, Malaysia, Thailand and Indonesia. In this article, we discuss the Rohingya Refugee Crisis and the concerns of India.\n\nTable of Contents\n\nWho are Rohingyas?\nThrough the timeline of crisis\n2012\n2015\n2016-17\nThe legal status of Rohingyas\nWhat is being done to handle the refugee crisis?\nThe UN Response\nThe ASEAN Response\nBangladesh\nThe United States\nIndia\u2019s response towards Rohingya Refugees\nWhy does India try to keep away from the issue?\nHow the refugee crisis affects India\u2019s interests and values\nWho are Rohingyas?\n\nRohingyas are indigenous to Rakhine state (also known as Arakan) in Myanmar settled since the 15th century.\nCollectively they fall under the Muslim Indo-Aryans, a mixture of pre-colonial and colonial immigrations.\nHowever, according to Myanmar government, they are illegal immigrants migrated to Rakhine following Burmese independence and Bangladesh liberation war.\nThey are victims of an organized genocide and are one of the world\u2019s most persecuted minorities.\nThe population of Rohingyas was around 1.1 to 1.3 million before the 2015 crisis.\nThe crisis received international attention followed to Rakhine state riot in 2012, Rohingya crisis in 2015 and 2016-17 military crackdown.\nAt present 40000 Rohingyas have their second home in India.\nThrough the timeline of crisis\n2012\nThe crisis first started on June 10th of 2012 in northern Rakhine between ethnic Rakhine Buddhists and Rohingya Muslims.\nThis resulted in gang rape and murder of a Rakhine women by Rohingyas and killing of ten Burmese Muslims by Rakhines. In return, Rohingya burned a Rakhine\u2019s Buddhist and their houses.\nAs of August 22nd,\u00a02012 it is officially estimated as the total of 88 causalities including 57 Muslims and 31 Buddhists. Nearly 90000 peoples lost their home and around 2500 houses were burned in the crisis.\n2015\nThe government of Myanmar systematically isolates the ethnic minority.\nThis resulted in the migration of thousands of Rohingyas to Bangladesh, Malaysia, Indonesia and Thailand by rickety boats (hence called boat people).\nAccording to United Nations from January to March in 2015, approximately 25000 people have been taken by boats to different countries and many of them died.\n2016-17\nThe Myanmar Military started exploitation against Rohingyas in 2016.\nIn the initial attack, many of them died and many were arrested. This resulted in the migration of Rohingyas towards Bangladesh as refugees.\nIn November, approximately 1500 refugee houses in border villages of Myanmar was burned by special forces.\nThe scenarios after this were even worse. Many Rohingya women were gang raped, men and kids killed. The refugee boats in Naf river were under gun fire by Military.\nIn March 2017, 423 detainees were put arrested which includes women and children.\nThe crisis resulted in the displacement of nearly 92000 people from their home land. (Reference: TheDailyStar)\nThe legal status of Rohingyas\nThe Myanmar government never allowed a citizenship status to Rohingyas. Hence the majority of them do not have any legal documentations, making them stateless.\nUntil recently, they have been able to register as temporary residents with identification cards known as white cards which began issuing in the 1990s.\nThese cards gave some basic rights to Rohingyas such as the right to vote. But they were never recognized as a proof of citizenship.\nThese cards get cancelled in 2015 which effectively put an end to their right to vote.\nIn 2014, UN held a census, which was the first in Myanmar in 30 years. Initially, the Muslim minority were allowed to register as Rohingya. But after Buddhist threatened to boycott the census, the government issued a statement that Rohingyas can register only if they are identified as Bengalis.\nWhat is being done to handle the refugee crisis?\nIn November 2015, Myanmar\u2019s first civilian government led by National League for Democracy (NLD) party were reluctant to talk for Rohingyas because of their interest to gain support from Buddhist nationalities.\n\nThe UN Response\nIn August 2016 UN established a nine-person commission led by former UN Secretary \u2013 general Kofi Annan to discuss the options to propose a solution.\nThe committee submitted its final report to the Myanmar Government on\u00a0Augst 23, 2017.\nThe committee\u2019s final report included recommendations to reduce communal tension and support much-needed development efforts in the impoverished state.\nThe ASEAN Response\nThere has been no coordinated response to the Rohingya problem from the ASEAN. The nature of the response indicates a divided region.\nTill now, there remains a notable lack of pressure on Myanmar from the ASEAN.\nUnlike the 1989 Comprehensive Plan of Action on Indochinese Refugees, which oversaw cooperation between recipient countries of 275000 Vietnamese refugees, no agreement has been made among the four largest destination countries of refugees from Myanmar.\nAt first, Malaysia refused to provide any kind of refuge to the people reaching its shore but agreed to \u201cprovide provisions and send them away\u201d. Later, Malaysia and Indonesia agreed to provide temporary refuge to the Rohingya. Thailand said, it would provide humanitarian assistance and would not turn away boats that wish to enter its waters.\nBangladesh\nBangladeshi Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina called her own country\u2019s economic migrants \u201cmentally sick\u201d and said that they could have better lives in Bangladesh, and complained they were discrediting Bangladesh by leaving.\nShortly thereafter, the Bangladeshi Government announced plans to relocate the 32,000 registered Rohingya refugees who have spent years in camps near the Myanmar border.\nThe 200,000 unregistered other refugees were not officially part of the government\u2019s relocation plan.\nInitially, Thengar Char, an island 18 miles east of Hatiya Island was reportedly selected for the relocation. A subsequent report put the location as 200 hectares selected on Hatiya Island, a nine-hour, the land-and-sea journey from the camps.\nThe United States\nThe State Department of United States expressed its intent to take in Rohingya refugees as part of international efforts.\nSince 2002 the United States has allowed 13,000 Myanmar refugees. Chicago, home to \u2018RefugeeOne\u2019, has one of the largest populations of Rohingyas in the United States.\nIndia\u2019s response towards Rohingya Refugees\n\nNearly 40000 Rohingyas have their home in India now. India has been receiving Rohingya refugees and allowing them to settle in the different parts of the country over the years, especially after the communal violence in the state of Rakhine in 2012.\nIn 2012 December, India\u2019s external affairs Minister\u00a0visited Rakhine and donated 1 million dollars for relief.\nHowever, India considers the refugee crisis as an internal affair of Myanmar.\nOn August 9, 2017, Rajya Sabha MP Rajeev Gowda posed several questions to Union minister of state for home affairs Kiren Rijiju. The questions pertained to the condition of Rohingya refugees in the country and were framed as follows: (a) whether the (home) ministry has framed a policy with regard to Rohingya refugees in India; (b) if so, whether it involves other stakeholders, such as our neighboring countries; (c) whether reports stating that government plans to deport the 40,000 Rohingya refugees are true; and (d) if so, the reasons for such plans?\nThe minister\u2019s response was to outline a plan to deport around 40,000 Rohingya, or \u201cillegally staying foreign nationals\u201d, from India. He said that the central government had directed the state governments to set up district task forces to \u201cidentify and deport\u201d the foreign nationals.\nSince India is not a signatory to the United Nations Convention on Refugees, refugee status granted by the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) to the Rohingya was irrelevant to their deportation.\nAccording to the Government of India, there are no refugee camps established for either Bangladeshis or Rohingyas in India and there were only schemes of assistance for Tibetan and Sri Lankan refugees.\nWhy does India try to keep away from the issue?\nIndia considers the issue as an internal affair of Myanmar.\nIndian believes that ASEAN has an undeniable responsibility to resolve this crisis.\nIndia does not want a conflict of interests with the new regime in Myanmar-Myanmar has a key role in India\u2019s Look East Policy.\nIndia already has several issues like poverty, unemployment etc for her own people.\nHow the refugee crisis affects India\u2019s interests and values\nIndia holds a strong history of welcoming refugees from Srilanka, Tibet, Afghanistan, Pakistan, Bangladesh and still they enjoy the freedom and rights here. The Rohingyas are now the most genocided community in recent past in South Asia, they are stateless and no place got to go.\n16500 Rohingya refugees in India holds United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR)\u2019s identity card and India consider it as irrelevant, and as far as they are illegal immigrants to India, they will be subjected to deport.\nThe refugees have to face the same situations like in the past if India sends them back, which will question India\u2019s policies in the global front. It considered as will rather die in India than return to Myanmar for Rohingyans.\nAdding to this, recently an insurgent group \u2013 Haraquah Al-Yaqin formed in Saudi Arabia commanded by Rohingyas on the ground with tactical training and guerrilla operation skills. India had a history of Lankan refugee issue which eventually ended up in the Assassination of Rajiv Gandhi.\nAlong with security issue, it may lead to political, governance and economic problems in the country.\n\nArticle by: Amal Jose"

From the very onset, the institution has been one that inspires discipline and moral uprightness.\n\nCultivating an environment of peace and security so that the nation grows to its fullest potential makes the Indian army a noble profession. Enrolling into the service is naturally seen as a matter of pride by the citizens.\n\nHowever, the recent past has seen the institution catching headlines for some not so good reasons. This is particularly true in the context of the recent video blogs which shows mistreatment of soldiers by higher officers. Here we analyse some of the major points of concern with respect to Indian Army and attempt to resolve them through amicable solutions.\n\nTable of Contents\n\nIndian Army \u2013 An Overview\nStructure of Indian Army\nFunctional Divisions of the Indian Army\nIndian army: Issues and Grievances\nSkewed Promotions Trends \u2013 Bypassing seniority\nService related bias \u2013 Favour towards one service wing\nRegiment bias\nNutritional Issues \u2013 Quality and Quantity concerns\nLeave policy \u00a0\u2013 Discrimination\nContinuation of certain colonial practices\n1.

However, he was made the Chief, bypassing protocol/convention. Although there is no legal basis to challenge the same, the move has raised eyebrows both within and outside the Army circles. Those unhappy with the decision put forth a host of arguments.\nMerit and experience in combat as deciding parameters in the appointment is inconclusive. Army is not meant to be only a counter-insurgency force. Hence a greater experience in that domain shouldn\u2019t put a candidate at an advantage.\nIt would set a bad precedent for future appointments in the Army and other institutions. The increased politicization might lead to a politico-army nexus which might see the army officials play to the gallery rather than be objective with their policies.\nA Muslim officer was second in line. Given the anti-minority attitude allegations against the government, this move only adds fuel to the fire.\nService related bias \u2013 Favour towards one service wing\nThe claim that there exists intra-Army bias lopsided in favour of certain services is another worry.\nIt is evidenced by the fact that the last four Army chiefs have all been from the same service wing-Infantry.\nA clear preference for Infantry over Artillery, which in-turn supersedes Engineers and Signals have also been observed in promotions. This preference is observable in the time-frame for promotion in different services \u2013 Infantry \u2013 2 years, Artillery \u2013 2.5 years and Engineers and Signals \u2013 3 years.\nThis differential promotion criterion was established by the Ajai Vijay Singh Committee recommendations, which were upheld by the Supreme Court in Feb 2016.\nRegiment bias\nTo add to the misery, a preference for personnel from own regiment has also been observed\nNutritional Issues \u2013 Quality and Quantity concerns\nIt was Napoleon who quoted the right words \u2013 an army marches on its stomach.\nIn this light, the video blogs highlighting poor and unhealthy diet being served to the army personnel is disheartening.\nThe claimants have pointed out that rations that reach them are merely 40% of that mandated on paper.\nLeave policy \u00a0\u2013 Discrimination\nThere have been instances of discrimination in allowing leaves as well.\nReluctant leave policies that are rooted in mistrust and corruption do no good to the institution either.\nThere have been alarming reports like that of leave being denied for 10 months to an army personnel. This clearly reflects the apathetic attitude that our heroes are challenged with\nContinuation of certain colonial practices\nAlthough we have left behind our dark colonial past, the past seems to have been ingrained into our societies so deeply that cultural colonialism of those days still persists. This was manifested in revelations about the existence of certain practices within the Army that were aimed at mistreating the Indian soldiers during the colonial era.\n1. SAHAYAK SYSTEM\nAs the name suggests, soldiers in this system are forced to do domestic chores for senior officers, acting as their \u2018sahayaks\u2019.\nThis includes petty chores like washing clothes, polishing shoes, walking the officer\u2019s dogs etc.\n2. BUDDY SYSTEM\nAlthough the intent of this approach, which is also being emulated in corporates, is easy integration of new joiners, the system has been exploited by higher officials for selfish interests.\nSoldiers are deputed to senior officers to learn better, but they end up serving them, doing their personal chores instead.\nRising suicides and fratricides\nIt is no secret that cases of suicides and fratricides are common in the Army.\nStatistics revealed by Parliamentary Standing Committee on Defence, 2003-2013, for instance, point out disturbing numbers: 1666 suicides and 109 fratricides (killing/shooting comrades)\nNo proper grievance redress mechanism\nThere have also been complaints of court martial being used as a tool to harass complainants.\nVictimization of the accused rather than bringing him to justice seems to be the undertone.\nExistential crisis\nWhile the Indian Army, the Navy and the Air Force are under the Defence Ministry, the 7 paramilitary forces are under the Home Ministry.\nThis has resulted in certain peculiar distinctions where paramilitary personnel seem to be given step-motherly treatment.\nFor instance, there is no grievance redress mechanism for the paramilitary. The Armed Forces Tribunal (2007) comes under the Defence Ministry and hence, excludes the 7 paramilitary forces.\nInstead, paramilitaries follow Security Force Court (a court martial like system). This court can also pronounce death sentences, although no appellate mechanism is supported except a petition.\nBesides, constitutional limitations like those enlisted in Article 33 impose limitations on usage of writ petitions as well.\nReform reports kept out of public\n\nIt isn\u2019t that the need for reforming the Indian Army wasn\u2019t evident earlier, many studies and reports have been focused in this direction. However, despite multiple studies for reforms, the reports have not been made public. This has given leeway to the slow progress in this regard as the identified issues are kept out of public domain.\n\n\ud83d\udc49 Which year are YOU targeting for success in the IAS/IPS/IFS Exam? \ud83d\ude80\n\n(1) \u21d2 UPSC 2025: Prelims cum Mains\n\n(2) \u21d2 UPSC 2026: Prelims cum Mains\n\n(3) \u21d2 UPSC 2027 Prelims cum Mains\n\nTip: Know more about ClearIAS Courses (Online/Offline)\n\nShekatkar Committee Recommendations\n\nThe military reforms committee \u2013 under Lt General (retired) DB Shekatkar \u2013 was set up by then defence minister Manohar Parrikar in 2015.\n\nThe 11-member committee was established with a mandate for \u201cEnhancing Combat Capability and Rebalancing Defence Expenditure\u201d.\n\nThe committee submitted its report on December 21, 2016.\n\nShekatkar committee had made recommendations on enhancing the combat potential of India\u2019s three armed forces, rationalising the defence budget, and improving the teeth-to-tail ratio.\n\nThough the Shekatkar committee recommendations do not connect with all the grievances we discussed before, the\u00a0committee had apparently exceeded its brief with some 200 recommendations.\n\nThe defence ministry whittled it down to 120, of which some 90 were approved by Defence Minister Arun Jaitley. The ministry expects all the proposals to be implemented in the next two years. (Reference: Hindustan Times)\n\nThe panel wants the military to move out of non-core areas such as the National Cadet Corps (NCC), remove duplicity among the three services, and make institutions such as the Defence Research and Development Organisation (DRDO) and ordnance factory boards more accountable through project audits and by shelving outdated concepts.\n\nA major recommendation is that the defence budget should be 2.5% to 3% of the GDP.\n\nWay Forward\n\nPolitical oversight without politicization must be the approach that the governments should adopt. This would check the adverse threat of politicization of the armed forces.\nIntra-service victimhood would only deteriorate the institution from within and snowball into a National Security concern. Therefore, a balanced approach rather than the Ajai Vikram Singh Committee based differential promotion parameters must be adopted. A feeling of equality amongst the services is essential for cohesion to thrive.\nGrievance redress mechanisms must be strengthened. Steps like keeping feedback/complaint boxes without victimizing complainants and access to appellate mechanisms is a must.\nLeave policy must be synchronized on the lines of other organizations with a clear casual/earned leave split-up and guidelines for filing the same. Moreover, it must be ensured that timely approvals are mandated for the leaves with written reasons for denial whenever the case be so.\nPolicy on social media usage to counter the threat to national security must be rolled out. This, to cater to concerns that video blogs have compromised sensitive locations like borders, camps. In the era of twitter governance, it is hard to keep people outside the folds of social media. Better regulation rather than a blanket ban, therefore, could be a rational course of action.\nBetter sensitization within the establishment is required to address genuine concerns related to nutrition, hygiene, leave, compensation etc.\nActing against acts like Sahayak System could help regain the confidence of enrolled as well as aspiring soldiers.\nBoosting troop morale by acting on reports from reform related studies and not keeping them under the table in the name of secrecy is another must-do in this case.\nThe paramilitary forces must be brought at par with the other armed forces. Achieving this transition, however, may or may not need the transfer of loyalties from Home Ministry to Defence Ministry. A positive step in this regard was the recently launched app for grievance redress that provides a direct line of contact with Home Ministry bypassing the officers in command, for complaints by jawans.\nBureaucratic intervention (at the administrative level) may continue but must be overhauled to be on the lines of bipartisan selection committees like the ones for CVC and CBI chief selections. This could help settle the friction with the civilian administration.\nMoreover, it isn\u2019t the time to shoot the messengers, rather bringing them on board is the viable way ahead. The people who bring to light inherent issues must be seen as whistle-blowers rather than rebels. Nevertheless, it would be a wise step to direct such grievances by developing efficient internal grievance redress mechanisms that also provide for internal whistle-blowing avenues, without bringing bad name to either the complainant or the institution as a whole\nConclusion\n\nAt a time when the geopolitical challenges, especially with escalations along the border by Pakistan and China combined (To know about India-China border dispute, click here), are already a worry, a weakly bound army is the last thing we would want on our plate.\n\nWeakness from within withers even the strongest of forces. A weak army, therefore, would only add to our vulnerabilities and be a threat to National Security. Our history is a testimony to how petty internal fights and grievances left us unguarded against the colonial powers. To let this mighty force that unites India fall prey to similar follies would be unfortunate. It is the cohesion within the force and the will to defend the nation by standing shoulder-to-shoulder that inspires might.\n\nBy letting issues, such as the ones discussed above, permeate, we are letting a slow poison eat into our strengths. It is, therefore, the moral responsibility of all the stakeholders to ensure that corrective measures are taken immediately and the army reformed from within. For it may be a molehill now, but if let go unchecked there is no stopping it from snowballing into a mountain that would be hard to dispel.\n\nArticle by: Shuja Shabir"

Here, in this article, we are discussing in detail about the Gorkhaland Movement, its background, causes, the current situation, etc.\n\nTable of Contents\n\nWhat is the Gorkhaland Issue?\nWhy is there a demand for separate statehood for Gorkhaland?\nThe story behind the rise of Gorkhaland \u2013 Chronology and Cause\nHow Darjeeling came into existence?\nChronology of \u2018demands for autonomy\u2019\nMajor Post-Independence Movements related to Gorkhaland\n2017 Darjeeling Agitation\nWhy Gorkhaland Movement Matters?\nPossible Resolution -Division of the state of West Bengal, to create Gorkhaland\nConclusion\nWhat is the Gorkhaland Issue?\nGorkhaland consists of Nepali-speaking people of Darjeeling, Kalimpong, Kurseong and other hilly districts of West-Bengal. The people belonging to these areas have ethical, cultural and language differences with the Bengali community of West-Bengal.\nThe demand of Darjeeling as a separate administrative region dates back to 1907. But, the term \u201cGorkhaland\u201d was coined recently, in the 1980s, by Subhash Ghising, the founder of Gorkha National Liberation Front (GNLF).\nThe Gorkhaland Movement is a movement mainly focused in the Darjeeling Hills of West Bengal, which demands the creation of a separate state of Gorkhaland.\nThe area covers Duars and Terai region of West Bengal. And is famous for its tea and beauty, which are the main sources of its income.\nWhy is there a demand for separate statehood for Gorkhaland?\nThe main reason for the separate Gorkhaland movement is due to the differences in ethnicity, culture and language.\nThe people of Nepali-Indian Gorkha ethnic origin on the Northern part of\u00a0West Bengal\u00a0demands a state on basis of their cultural identity, which is very different from Bengali culture.\nIn addition to an identity crisis, there is also an issue of poverty, under-development and politicisation of the issue.\nAccording to Rajat Ganguli\u00a0(author of \u2018Poverty, Malgovernance and Ethnopolitical Mobilization: Gorkha Nationalism and the Gorkhaland Agitation in India\u2019). It was a failure of governance combined with politicisation that bred the Gorkhaland issue. He cites the historical trend, especially post-independence, where the issue erupts only when it\u2019s pampered by political aspirations.\nThe story behind the rise of Gorkhaland \u2013 Chronology and Cause\n\nHow Darjeeling came into existence?\nPrior to 1780s the area was ruled by Chogyal of Sikkim\nAround 1780 the Gorkhas had captured Sikkim and most parts of the North East including Darjeeling.\nIn 1814,\u00a0the\u00a0Anglo-Gorkha war broke out, which ended with the\u00a0Treaty of Segoulee in 1815 (ratified in March 1816).\nAs per the treaty, British East India Company took all the territory that Gorkha annexed from Chogyal of Sikkim.\nIn 1817, through the\u00a0Treaty of Titalia, the British reinstated Chogyal of Sikkim and gave back all the territory annexed by Gorkhas back to Chogyals.\nThough in 1835, through Deed of Grant, they took possession of the hills of Darjeeling from Sikkim.\nBritish added Bengal Duars and Kalimpong to Darling hills in 1864 via Treaty of Sinchula, signed between the British and Bhutan.\nThus the present district of Darjeeling came into existence in 1866.\nChronology of \u2018demands for autonomy\u2019\nIn 1907, The demand for a separate administrative unit in Darjeeling was raised for the first time by the Hillmen\u2019s Association of Darjeeling.\nIn 1941, it demanded exclusion of Darjeeling from Bengal and to make it a chief commissioner province.\nThe undivided Communist Party of India, in 1947 submitted a memorandum to the Constituent Assembly demanding the formation of Gorkhasthan comprising Darjeeling district and Sikkim.\nIn 1952, Akhil BharatiyaGorkha League (ABGL) meets Prime Minister and demands separation from Bengal.\n1977- 81:\u00a0The West Bengal government passes a unanimous resolution supporting the creation of an autonomous district council consisting Darjeeling and related areas.\n1980: Subhash Ghising forms Gorkha National Liberation Front (GNLF).\nGNLF launches a most violent agitation in Gorkhaland movement history in 1986.\nIn 1988, Darjeeling Gorkha Hill Council accord is signed by GNLF, the state of Bengal and the Centre. Darjeeling Gorkha Hill Council came into action. GNLF drops the demand for the separate state.\nIn 2005, the same parties signed an in\u2013principle memorandum of settlement to include Darjeeling in the Sixth Schedule of the Indian Constitution, which addresses the administration of tribal areas.\nCalling \u2018the Sixth Schedule solution\u2019 a betrayal to Gorkhaland, Bimal Gurung launched Gorkha Janmukti Morcha (GJM) in 2007. The same year witnessed a\u00a0rise in agitations for the separate Gorkhaland demand.\nIn 2011 the memorandum of agreement for the formation of a Gorkhaland Territorial Administration (GTA), a semi-autonomous administrative body for the Darjeeling, passed by\u00a0 West Bengal legislative assembly to calm the GJM.\nMajor Post-Independence Movements related to Gorkhaland\nThe All India Gorkha League (AIGL) came into existence in 1943 as the first political party in the Darjeeling hills. After India\u2019s independence, it demanded the addition of Darjeeling to Assam and started \u2018Assam Chalo\u2019 movement. It worked on petitions, like the moderates, and had submitted memorandums to the President of India and the Prime Minister of India. It was never violent, except few exceptions.\nThe biggest and most violent agitation took place in 1986 under the banner of GNLF, led by Subhash Ghising. Between 1986-88, Darjeeling witnessed most violent phase in its post-independence history of India. As per one estimate, more than 1200 people lost their lives. It ended with DGHC accord (discussed above).\nIn 2004, the fourth elections for DGHC didn\u2019t take place. Instead, in 2005, Darjeeling was added to the sixth schedule and a tribal council was set up with Ghising as its head. It leads to revolt by Bimal Gurung, who launched GJM in 2007. Thereby, the second biggest agitation in Gorkhaland movement took place. As evident from the turn of events, it was a politically motivated rather than identity driven.\nIn 2010-2011, the Gorkhaland agitation saw a new turn after local leaders fought among themselves as one of the leader of the Akhil Bharatiya Gorkha League (ABGL), was allegedly stabbed to death by GJM supporters.\nIn 2013, the demand for separation rose high again due to the division of Andhra Pradesh. The movement was peaceful under the leadership of GJM. GJM adopted the innovative method of protest called \u201cJanta Bandh\u201d.\u00a0People were told to voluntarily stay inside on 13th\u00a0and 14th August. There was no force used but the silence on streets was an evident sign of revolt. It was portrayed as an embarrassment to the government.\n2017 Darjeeling Agitation\n\nCause\n\nWest Bengal government\u2019s decision to impose Bengali language in all the schools from Class I to IX.\n\nWhat made it worse?\n\nHeavy-handed response from state leading to the death of protestors.\nConsidered as an attempt by TMC (All India Trinamool Congress) to gain hold in Darjeeling. In 2017 municipal election, TMC won only 1 seat while GJM held 31 seats.\nGJM finds it as right opportunity to raise its importance.\nWhy Gorkhaland Movement Matters?\nIt is one of the oldest movement in India (began in 1907)\nWhat happens in Gorkhaland will affect India-Nepal relations too. How India treats the problems of the Nepali people of hill origin in Darjeeling will affect how Nepal deals with the people of Indian origin in Nepal, i.e. Madhesi in Terai.\nGorkhaland has a strategic location, it\u2019s vicinity to the chicken neck that connects rest of India with North East. Its stability is must for India\u2019s strategic and economic interests of the nation.\nDarjeeling is a tea and tourist hot-spot with a high level of poverty. It needs and has potential to become the economic engine of the East with a sustainable economic model. But such things will be possible only if there is stability in the region.\nPossible Resolution -Division of the state of West Bengal, to create Gorkhaland\n\nPros\n\nIt may create a stable and responsible government in Darjeeling.\nIt will end one of the longest movement for the creation of a separate state in India\n\nCons\n\nIt can lead to \u201cBalkanization\u201d of India.\nIt may legitimise violence as a way to meet demands.\nThe rise of agitation with the\u00a0rise of new outfits shows that politics plays the vital role. The division would be an extreme measure for a problem that can be resolved by political consensus like done in 1988 and 2011.\nDivision of state should be done on the criteria set by State Reorganisation Commission. Any diversion would only create a more dissension than the solution.\n\n2. Giving more powers to Gorkhaland Territorial Administration, creating a transparent and open election process. It must be realised that GJM rose due to the failure of the government to conduct 4th DGHC elections.\n\n\ud83d\udc49 Which year are YOU targeting for success in the IAS/IPS/IFS Exam? \ud83d\ude80\n\n(1) \u21d2 UPSC 2025: Prelims cum Mains\n\n(2) \u21d2 UPSC 2026: Prelims cum Mains\n\n(3) \u21d2 UPSC 2027 Prelims cum Mains\n\nTip: Know more about ClearIAS Courses (Online/Offline)\n\n3. The Parliament can amend the Constitution of India and insert autonomous district within West Bengal by adding a provision like 244 A, which provides for such method for Assam.\n\nConclusion\n\nImage Credit: Maximilian D\u00f6rrbecker (Chumwa) (Own work) [CC BY-SA 2.5], via Wikimedia Commons\nThe demands for separate statehood in India have been there even before India\u2019s Independence. Even after the state re-organization of 1956, there were demands from various corners of the country for the creation of a separate state. Linguistic, cultural, ethnic and economic distinctions can be traced as the core reasons behind these demands.\n\nHegel said, \u201cWe learn from history that we do not learn from history\u201d. The repetition of history in the Gorkhaland issue is the living proof. Especially in the post-independence, where the rise and fall of momentum in demand follow the rise and fall of the party involved. The solution lies in pleasing the population rather than the parties. Gorkhaland can become an epitome of decentralisation or a failed divided state. The choice is in the hands of people protesting. Are they protesting for the right cause?\n\nArticle contributed by: Alok Singh"
