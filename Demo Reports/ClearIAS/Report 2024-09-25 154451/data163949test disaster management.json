The Chennai Oil Spill resulted in irreversible environmental damage.\n\nThe spill has also underscored the incapacity of the state to handle such incidents and has raised many questions regarding our disaster management techniques.

There were many other incidents in the past as given below.\n\nSundarban: In 2014 Oil spill in Bangladesh created an environmental concern for India too. An oil tanker sank in Sela River which is an eco-sensitive region of Sundarban triggered the disaster. Indian wildlife too was badly affected.\nONGC Leak: In 2013 ONGC Uran plan developed a leak which resulted in 5,000 litres of the crude oil spill in the Arabian Sea.\nMumbai coast: In 2010 two ships collided off the Mumbai coast causing the oil spill. 800 tonnes of oil leaked before the leaked was plugged two days later.\nWhat are the main causes of Oil Spills?\n\nNote: Subscribe to the ClearIAS YouTube Channel to learn more.\n\nThe common causes of oil spills are as following:\n\n\ud83d\udc49 Which year are YOU targeting for success in the IAS/IPS/IFS Exam? \ud83d\ude80\n\n(1) \u21d2 UPSC 2025: Prelims cum Mains\n\n(2) \u21d2 UPSC 2026: Prelims cum Mains\n\n(3) \u21d2 UPSC 2027 Prelims cum Mains\n\nTip: Know more about ClearIAS Courses (Online/Offline)\n\nNatural causes: Tsunami, Cyclone, Thunderstorm etc.\nHuman Causes: War, attack, sabotage, human mistakes leading to a collision or some technical reasons.\nWhat are the major impacts of Oil Spill?\n\n1. On Marine life\nThe most affected organisms are those which floats near the surface like turtles, fishes, crabs etc.\nSea animals caught in an oil spill, on being exposed to toxic petroleum products often results in lower reproductive rates, organ damage, and death. The effects remain for a long period of time.\nFishes die due to inability to swim or breath.\nNote: This time was core breeding period for olive ridley turtles and due to oil slick sticking to the gut mother turtles may find it difficult to lay the eggs.\n2. On Birds\nMany birds die due to drowning or inability to eat due to oil sticking to their body.\n3. On Humans\nDirect exposure can have varying effects depending on the toxicity and chemicals involved in the spill.\nHumans get exposed to toxicity through breathing gaseous oil compounds and/or oil compounds adsorbed on particulate matter (dispersed through the air). Exposure can also happen due to the activities in the contaminated ground (e.g., soil) or through skin absorption when touching spilled material.\nThere is a huge economic cost attached with such disasters.\nIs there a law in India which cover an Oil Spill Disaster?\n\nIn India, there is no law covering oil spill as such and its consequential environmental damage.\nThese incidents are not covered as an oil spill but as an accidental discharge as defined in the Environment Protection Act (EPA) of 1986.\nUsually, FIRs are filed under EPA and according to IPC sections relating rash navigation and endangering the life of others.\nBut India has \u201cthe National Oil Spill Disaster Contingency Plan of 1996 (NOS-DCP)\u201d to handle such situations. The document was issued by the Ministry of Defense in 1996; it was last updated in March 2006.\nNational Oil Spill Disaster Contingency Plan\n\nThe salient features are:\n\nIt gives the Indian Coast Guard the mandate to coordinate with state departments, ministries, port authorities and environmental agencies to assist in oil spill cleaning operations.\nIt mandates that all major ports in India should have basic, minimum equipment, like inflatable booms and oil skimmers, to tackle oil spill.\nIt highlights the responsibilities for individual Ports.\n\nThe NOS-DCP was revised in 2015 to meet international standards.\n\nOnline Oil Spill Advisory System was set up.\nIt places India amongst the select few countries that have:\nAn indigenously developed capability of prediction of trajectory of oil spills\nMapping of environmental sensitivities in coastal zones.\nDeployment of aerial dispersant spray system.\nFacilitating regional oil spill contingency plans.\nInternational Convention on Civil Liability for Bunker Oil Pollution Damage, 2001 (Bunker Convention)\n\nIn 2015 India ratified the International Convention on Civil Liability for Bunker Oil Pollution Damage, 2001 (Bunker Convention). Convention ensures adequate, prompt and effective compensation for damage caused by oil spills.\n\nAn international forum on oil spill prevention, preparedness, response and restoration systems was constituted in 2011 viz. Oil Spill India (OSI).\n\nIn 2016 September there was a convention in Mumbai of OSI.\nThe theme was \u201cCommitment, Synergy, and Excellence (CSE)\u201d\nConvention showcases best practices in the world for oil spill preparedness.\nCivil Society and Public\n\nThe government agencies often pass the blame and responsibility to each other when asked about fixing liability and accountability.\n\nDuring recent Chennai disaster, Coast Guard men, engineering students, and fishermen were seen using their hands to clear the oil spill in the sea.\nAt least 1,000 volunteers were employed for physically removing blobs of oil deposited along the beaches.\nThough the participation from different quarters is necessary, precautions must be taken to protect the health of volunteers due to the exposure to toxic chemicals.\nCompanies can use their CSR obligations for better by helping capacity building or by sponsoring the necessary equipment during such drives.\nWhat are the problems faced in the oil-remedial processes?\n\n\nThe problems with oil-remedial processes are as following:\n\nPetroleum oils are complex mixtures of chemicals that are toxic, bioaccumulative and persistent in the environment. Some, like benzene, are known human carcinogens.\nThey enter the body through inhalation, ingestion and the skin.\nAn oil spill clean-up is a hazardous waste remediation exercise. Many traditional methods of cleaning oil spills, such as breaking up the oil with dispersants or skimming it off the surface, are expensive, slow, and unsafe \u2013 and often don\u2019t really work all that well anyway.\nDuring the recent disaster, authorities starting pumping oil sludge by city water pump but all in vain.\nLater on, volunteers skimmed off the oil using buckets in hand which can be very dangerous for individuals.\nWhat are the available technological solutions?\nOil Zapper is a cocktail of bacteria that feed on the oil and degrade the hydrocarbons.\nNewer methods and technologies like Nanosheets that could revolutionize oil spill clean ups and water purification needs to be deployed. It has following major benefits:\nRecyclable.\nabsorb 33 times their weight in oil.\nOne gram of nanosheets has the equivalent area as nearly 5.5 tennis courts \u2013 so a lot of surface for absorption.\nSaturated nanosheets can be simply heated in air for two hours for cleaning purpose. The absorbed oil burns off, leaving the nanosheets clean and free to absorb again.\nEasy to build and affordable.\nWhat is the aftermath of the Oil Spill accident?\nEven weeks after the accident, there is no clarity on the quantity and nature of the material that spilled on January 28.\nAfter the oil spill, another disaster is unfolding \u2013 by exposing volunteers to the unknown amount of toxicity. There is a hurry to declare the clean-up operation complete.\nNo advisories on the toxicity of the spilled material have been issued.\nNo protocols or defined procedures are adopted in the cleanup. Not just the water but rocks also need to be cleaned up using warm water or foam.\nIndia and Neighbourhood\n\nWith increased trade and energy demand in future, there is always some possibility of such disasters and India can provide such services on demand making it an area of expertise and gaining soft power.\n\nIndia has resources and manpower to handle such situations not for itself but also for the neighbours.\nAfter the tsunami in India, some preparedness may be in place; whether they are good for oil spills is another matter altogether.\nBut the ecological knowledge of this unit is the key.\nA good opportunity to establish India\u2019s importance came during Sundarban disaster but due to many reasons, nothing good was achieved.\nConclusion\n\nThe Chennai oil spill incident raises many questions. The true extent of the damage to the ecology and economy will be known only after some time. But it is apparent from the disarray that works done seems far from a contingency plan. The Indian government is endeavouring to increase its port capacity and connectivity through various schemes like Sagal Mala Yojana but disaster preparedness of ports remains in shadows.\n\nThere is an urgent need to increases preparedness for handling the responsibility that comes with large-scale coastal development and operations. To prevent such disaster in future, we need\u00a0contingency plan which can work on the ground too and not just in papers. The government of India and state government must coordinate and take hard steps for betterment. In the future, we need good management and credible timely information to manage the situations and thus minimising the exposure to an oil spill.\n\nArticle by: Jaidev Yadav"

            "[CONTENT]": "India is one of the worst flood-affected nations in the world. The frequency of urban floods due to high-intensity rainfall is increasing over the years. Flood management and flood governance are in the news often. In this post, let\u2019s analyse India\u2019s disaster response capabilities to tackle floods.\n\nTable of Contents\n\nWhat is a Flood?\nWhat are the factors responsible for floods?\nWhat are the types of floods?\nStatistics in India \u2013 What do they say about Flood Management?\nFlood Governance \u2013 What are the steps taken by the government?\nInitiatives to deal with floods\nFlood management\nFlood Protection Vs Flood Governance\nImportant recommendations of Task Force 2004 on Flood Management/ Erosion Control\nWhat is a Flood?\nFlood is such a high stage in a water course i.e. river, river tributary or a water retaining body i.e. lake, pond, reservoir, seas, ocean or other low-lying areas \u2013 the level at which water flows over its banks and inundates the adjoining areas.\nThey are one of the natural calamities that India faces almost every year in varying degrees of magnitude.\nWhat are the factors responsible for floods?\nThere are various factors, including wide variation in rainfall over time and space and inadequate carrying capacity of rivers.\nThe problems get accentuated due to silting, bank erosion, landslides, poor natural drainage, glacial lake outburst, etc.\nIndiscriminate development and encroachments on floodplain areas, improper planning and construction of roads, railway lines, etc. have also been responsible for the increase in flood damages.\nWith increased deforestation, the surface run-off has increased at the cost of infiltration, leading to tons of sediment being deposited on the riverbed on reaching the plains reducing carrying capacity further. Building dams will exacerbate this effect.\nWhat are the types of floods?\nCoastal (Surge Flood): As the name suggests, it occurs in areas that lie on the coast of a sea, ocean, or another large body of open water. It is typically the result of extreme tidal conditions caused by severe weather. Often produced when hurricanes and other storms push water onshore.\nFluvial (River Flood): This occurs when excessive rainfall over an extended period causes a river to exceed its capacity. Riverine flooding is further classified into two types i.e.\nOverbank flooding:\u00a0this is the most common type of flooding where the water level rises and breaches the banks over time.\nFlash flooding: is characterized by an intense, high velocity of water that occurs in an existing river channel with little to no notice.\nPluvial (Surface Flood): It is caused when heavy rainfall creates a flood event independent of an overflowing water body. It is widely believed that one must live near the water body to be at risk of flooding. Pluvial flooding debunks that myth, as it can happen in any urban area \u2014 even higher elevation areas that lie above coastal and river floodplains. There are two main reasons for pluvial flooding. First, torrential downpours make the urban drainage system saturated and make the roads flooded. The second one is run-off or flowing water from rain falling on hillsides that are unable to absorb the water.\nStatistics in India \u2013 What do they say about Flood Management?\nThis year, the official death toll has risen to 77 and around 12 lakh people have been displaced.\nThe vast stretch of alluvial plains across Uttar Pradesh, Bihar, West Bengal, and Assam account for 17% of India\u2019s geographical area but disproportionately account for 43%\u201352% of all flood-prone areas of the country.\nThe total cost of all the natural disasters in India during 2014-15 is estimated to be $9.8 billion out of which $7 billion is due to flooding.\nFlood Governance \u2013 What are the steps taken by the government?\nEmbankments were constructed to create a \u201csafe\u201d area for habitation and they provide these in areas where the embankments are new. But large populations continue to stay inside the embankment, that is, outside the \u201csafe\u201d areas, at the mercy of the imminent flood.\nIn 1980, the Rashtriya Barh Ayog (RBA) assessed the area of 40 mha in the country lying in 21 States and one Union Territory. Subsequently, a Committee constituted under the Chairman, Ganga Flood Control Commission (GFCC), Patna in February 2006 identified a total of 39 districts in the country as flood-prone.\nThe government\u2019s response to floods has been focused on massive structural interventions like dams, dredging of rivers, and porcupine structures to combat erosion. However empirical experience shows that dams often get silted quickly and to save the dam, water has to be released downstream, tending to cause flooding as a result of which bamboo porcupine structures get washed away.\nThe Union Government has also been providing central assistance to the State Governments for effective flood management in critical areas based on the recommendations of the Task Force 2004 on Flood Management/Erosion Control.\nInitiatives to deal with floods\nPolicy Statement 1954\nHigh-Level Committee on Floods \u2013 1957\nPolicy Statement of 1958\nNational Flood Commission (Rashtriya Barh Ayog) 1980\nExpert Committee to Review the Implementation of the Recommendations of National Flood Commission \u2013 2003 (R Rangachari Committee)\nNational Water Policy (1987/2002/2012)\nFlood management\nFlood management does not aim at total elimination or control of floods or providing total immunity from the effects of all magnitudes of floods.\nIt is a multipronged strategy ranging from modifying the floods using structural measures to learning to live with the floods using other nonstructural measures is well within pragmatic realism in flood management.\nEfficient flood management is a special case of water management and requires a holistic approach as it involves the management of thousands of micro-watersheds in both the catchment and the flood-prone areas.\nFlood Protection Vs Flood Governance\n\nFlood protection necessarily starts and ends with structural intervention and provision of relief. Flood governance would require an innovative combination of initiatives undertaken at various levels. At one level, it is important to conduct a \u201cstrategic environment assessment\u201d of all development activities in the ecologically pristine locations of the Eastern Himalayas and aim for river basin management.\n\nImportant recommendations of Task Force 2004 on Flood Management/ Erosion Control\nExpand the role of the Central Government in the Flood control sector \u2013 The flood control schemes should be funded through a Centrally Sponsored Scheme in the ratio of 90% Central and 10% State from the present 75:25.\nThe total investment for plan/flood Management may be at least 1% of the total plan outlay.\nEarmarking funds in the state sector as Additional Central Assistance for the maintenance of embankments.\nCreation of a revolving fund of Rs. 50 Crore, which may be available annually to the Ministry of Water Resources to take up emergent flood management schemes.\nStrengthening of the Ganga Flood Control Commission by the addition of a Member (Works) and appropriate field formation for investigation and execution of critical flood management works.\nStrengthening of Flood Management Organisation of the Central Water Commission by restoring the post of Member (Floods) abolished earlier and redeployment of posts of Chief Engineer, two Directors and other lower-level functionaries to have policy formulation and coordination amongst various agencies.\n\nRead: Early warning systems\n\nArticle by: Bharath\u00a0Prasath"

            "[CONTENT]": "PM CARES Fund is a public charitable trust set up in 2020 with the primary objective of dealing with any kind of emergency posed by the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\nThe PM CARES was formed on 28 March 2020 with Prime Minister Narendra Modi as its chairperson and senior cabinet members as trustees.\n\nOpposition parties are of the view that the new fund lacks transparency. They have questioned why it was created when the Prime Minister\u2019s National Relief Fund, which was set up in 1948, has a balance of 3800 crore rupees ($500m).\n\nTable of Contents\n\nWhat is a trust?\nTrusts in India\nWhat is the PM-CARES Fund?\nObjectives of PM-CARES Fund\nConstitution of the Trust\nWhat you should know about PM Cares Fund\nPrime Minister\u2019s National Relief Fund (PMNRF)\nPM Cares Fund vs PM National Relief Fund vs CM State Relief Fund vs SDMA\nIssues with PM-CARES Fund\nSuggestions regarding PM CARES Fund\nConclusion\nWhat is a trust?\n\nTrust as defined in section 3 of the Indian Trust Act, of 1882 means the transfer of property by one person (the settlor) to another (the trustee) who manages that property for the benefit of someone else (the beneficiary).\n\nTrusts in India\nThere are two types of trusts in India: private trusts and public trusts.\nPrivate trusts are governed by the Indian trusts Act, 1882\nPublic trusts which include charitable and religious trusts are governed by statutes like The Charitable and Religious Trust Act, of 1920, The Religious Endowments Act, of 1863, The Charitable Endowments Act, of 1890, and The Bombay Public Trust Act, of 1950.\n\u2018Charitable purpose\u2019 as defined under Section 2(15) of the Income Tax Act includes relief to the poor in the form of education, medical aid, or any other object of public utility.\nWhat is the PM-CARES Fund?\nStands for Prime Minister\u2019s Citizen Assistance and Relief in Emergency Situations Fund.\nLaunched by Prime Minister Narendra Modi in the aftermath of the coronavirus outbreak.\nIt is a dedicated national fund for dealing with any kind of emergency or distress situation.\nIt is a public charitable trust.\nObjectives of PM-CARES Fund\nTo provide relief or assistance of any kind relating to a public health emergency or any other kind of emergency, including the creation or upgrade of healthcare or pharmaceutical facilities, other necessary infrastructure, funding relevant research, or any other type of support.\nTo render financial assistance, provide grants and other steps as determined by the Board of Trustees to the affected population.\nTo undertake any other activity, which is not inconsistent with the above objects.\nConstitution of the Trust\nThe Prime Minister is the ex-officio Chairman of the PM CARES Fund.\nMinister of Defence, Minister of Home Affairs, and Minister of Finance are ex-officio Trustees of the Fund.\nThe Prime Minister shall have the power to nominate three trustees to the Board of Trustees who shall be eminent persons in the field of research, health, science, social work, law, public administration, and philanthropy.\nWhat you should know about PM Cares Fund\nThe fund consists entirely of voluntary contributions from individuals/organizations.\nAny person appointed a Trustee shall act in a pro bono capacity.\nIt does not get any budgetary support.\nPM CARES Fund\u00a0will not be\u00a0audited\u00a0by the Comptroller and\u00a0Auditor\u00a0General (CAG) of India. PM CARES Fund will be audited by independent auditors who will be appointed by the trustees\nDonations to the fund would qualify for 80G benefits for 100% exemption under the Income Tax Act, of 1961.\nDonations will also be counted as Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) expenditure under the Companies Act, 2013.\nA separate account for receiving foreign donations has been opened and the fund has also got an exemption under the FCRA (Foreign Contribution and Regulation Act), 1976.\nPM Cares fund can accept donations and contributions from individuals and organizations based in foreign countries. PM CARES Fund has received an exemption from the operation of all provisions of the Foreign Contribution (Regulation) Act, 2010. This is similar to the Prime Minister\u2019s National Relief Fund (PMNRF). PMNRF has also received foreign contributions as a public trust since 2011.\nPrime Minister\u2019s National Relief Fund (PMNRF)\nPrime Minister\u2019s National Relief Fund (PMNRF) was established in the year 1948 to assist displaced people from Pakistan after the partition of India.\nNow the fund is used primarily to provide immediate relief to families of those killed in natural calamities, to the victims of the major accidents and riots.\nAssistance from PMNRF is also given for medical treatment like heart surgeries, kidney transplantation, cancer treatment, acid attacks, etc.\nThe fund consists entirely of public contributions and does not get any budgetary support.\nPMNRF has not been constituted by the Parliament but is recognized as a Trust under the Income Tax Act\nContributions towards PMNRF are notified for 100% deduction from taxable income under section 80(G) of the Income Tax Act, 1961.\nThe Prime Minister is the Chairman of PMNRF and is assisted by Officers/ Staff on an honorary basis.\nPM Cares Fund vs PM National Relief Fund vs CM State Relief Fund vs SDMA\nUnlike the PM National Relief Fund, PM CARES, CM\u2019s Relief Funds and SDMAs are not dependent on donations.\nPM CARES and State Disaster Management Authorities (SDMAs) are governed by central laws, while CM\u2019s Relief Funds are governed by state laws.\nDonations to PM CARES Fund and State Disaster Management Authorities (SDMAs) qualify as CSR, but not to CM\u2019s Relief Fund.\nSDMAs are funded through a joint corpus of the Centre and states. The Centre\u2019s contribution to the corpus is 75%.\nIssues with PM-CARES Fund\nSeveral opposition leaders and other prominent people have questioned the need for establishing a new fund when PMNRF already exists.\nSome have questioned the opacity surrounding the PM-CARES fund as the trust deed has not been made public. It is not known whether all members of the trust have voting rights or not.\nCritics have also pointed out that the trustees of PM-CARES have a fiduciary duty towards the trust and the beneficiaries. The acronym also sends a political message and hence it is alleged that the character of the fund is incompatible with a public charitable trust.\nThe government\u2019s decision to accept foreign donations for PM CARES was also critically viewed as the government in the past had refused foreign donations to deal with the domestic crisis.\nSome critics also question whether due process was followed in registering the trust, obtaining exceptions under the Income Tax Act, accepting foreign contributions under FCRA, etc.\nCritics also flag the lack of transparency of the fund as the names of contributors and beneficiaries are not disclosed in this fund, and audits are held by those people who are appointed by trustees of the board.\nSuggestions regarding PM CARES Fund\nTo bring the fund within the ambit of the Right to Information Act and to make suo-moto disclosures regarding:\nThe trust deed of the PM CARES fund and all the documents that relate to the setting up of the fund as a public charitable trust.\nDisclose the details of the donors and the amounts contributed from time to time.\nDisclose the norms laid down for utilizing the fund and the institutional arrangement for complying with the norms.\nDisclose the\u00a0details of the amounts utilized from time to time and the purposes for which they are utilized\nFurther, to improve transparency and accountability, the operation of the fund has to be audited by the Comptroller & Auditor General (CAG) and make public disclosure of reports.\nFurther, there is a need for parliamentary oversight, as contributions from PSUs and MPLAD funds can go into the fund. MPLAD funds come from the Consolidated Fund of India and are governed by rules regarding its spending.\nAs an immediate response to COVID-19, the fund should be utilized for procuring Personal Protection Equipment (PPE) for medical and para-medical personnel, sanitation workers, and other front-line workers, providing health infrastructure including ventilators, and establishing testing facilities and isolation wards.\nDedicating the PM CARES fund for the COVID-19 pandemic and similar emergencies while continuing PMNRF for all types of natural disasters.\nConclusion\n\nPeople from all walks of life have contributed generously to the PM-CARES fund as it accepts micro-donations as low as Rs.10.\n\nIt is important to do justice to the faith of the citizens by making the administration of the fund accountable through prompt disclosures and periodical auditing.\n\n\ud83d\udc49 Which year are YOU targeting for success in the IAS/IPS/IFS Exam? \ud83d\ude80\n\n(1) \u21d2 UPSC 2025: Prelims cum Mains\n\n(2) \u21d2 UPSC 2026: Prelims cum Mains\n\n(3) \u21d2 UPSC 2027 Prelims cum Mains\n\nTip: Know more about ClearIAS Courses (Online/Offline)"

It results in widespread human, material, economic, or environmental losses which exceed the ability of the affected population to cope using its resources.\n\nTypes of Disasters\n\nDisasters can be broadly classified into two categories:\n\n\ud83d\udc49 Which year are YOU targeting for success in the IAS/IPS/IFS Exam? \ud83d\ude80\n\n(1) \u21d2 UPSC 2025: Prelims cum Mains\n\n(2) \u21d2 UPSC 2026: Prelims cum Mains\n\n(3) \u21d2 UPSC 2027 Prelims cum Mains\n\nTip: Know more about ClearIAS Courses (Online/Offline)\n\nNatural Disasters: These include events such as earthquakes, floods, hurricanes, tornadoes, volcanic eruptions, landslides, tsunamis, and droughts. Natural disasters are typically the result of natural phenomena and can have a devastating impact on life, property, and the environment.\nHuman-Made Disasters: Also known as man-made or anthropogenic disasters, these include events like industrial accidents, fires, nuclear explosions/radiation, chemical spills, and acts of terrorism. Human-made disasters result from human actions and can often be prevented through proper safety measures and regulations.\nDifference Between Disaster and Hazard\n\nIt\u2019s crucial to differentiate between a disaster and a hazard.\n\nA hazard refers to a potential event that may cause loss of life, injury, property damage, social and economic disruption, or environmental degradation. Hazards can be natural or human-made.\nA disaster occurs when a hazard impacts society or the environment severely or catastrophically. In essence, a hazard becomes a disaster when it meets vulnerability.\nDisaster Management\n\nDisaster management plays a vital role in minimizing the impact of unforeseen events. When disasters strike, it is crucial to have a well-prepared and coordinated response in place.\n\nDisaster management encompasses the range of activities designed to maintain control over disaster events and provide a framework for helping at-risk populations avoid or recover from the impact of a disaster.\nIt involves a systematic process of using administrative directives, organizations, and operational skills to implement policies, strategies, and coping capacities to lessen the adverse impacts of hazards.\nEffective disaster management strategies not only save lives but also help in the efficient allocation of resources and aid. With its comprehensive disaster management plans and dedicated teams, our organization is committed to safeguarding communities in times of crisis.\nBy employing proactive measures, conducting regular drills, and collaborating with local authorities, we strive to ensure a swift and effective response during emergencies.\nDisaster Management Cycle\n\nThe disaster management cycle highlights the ongoing process by which governments, businesses, and civil society plan for and reduce the impact of disasters, react during and immediately following a disaster, and take steps to recover after a disaster has occurred. It consists of four phases:\n\nMitigation: Efforts to reduce the impact of disasters.\nPreparedness: Planning how to respond.\nResponse: Efforts to minimize the hazards created by a disaster.\nRecovery: Returning the community to normal.\nDisaster Management Action Plan, Acts, Rules, and Mechanisms\n\nA comprehensive disaster management action plan includes identifying potential hazards, assessing vulnerabilities, creating emergency preparedness plans, implementing mitigation strategies, and developing recovery plans.\n\nLegislation plays a crucial role in disaster management. Many countries have enacted specific laws and regulations that outline the responsibilities of governments, non-governmental organizations, and communities in disaster response and management.\n\nThese acts and rules provide the legal and institutional framework for disaster management efforts.\n\nKey components include:\n\nEstablishment of Disaster Management Authorities: At national, regional, and local levels, these authorities coordinate and oversee disaster management activities.\nCommunity Involvement: Engaging communities in planning and decision-making processes to ensure that disaster management activities are relevant and effective.\nCapacity Building and Training: Developing skills and knowledge among responders and the community to effectively manage disasters.\nEmergency Communication Systems: Implementing robust communication systems to disseminate information quickly and efficiently during a disaster.\nResource Allocation: Ensuring that adequate resources (financial, human, and material) are available for disaster management activities.\nDisaster and Disaster Management in India\n\nIn India, a country prone to a variety of natural and human-made disasters, understanding disaster and disaster management is crucial for minimizing risks and enhancing resilience. Here are ten key aspects to consider:\n\nDiverse Geography: India\u2019s vast and varied geography makes it susceptible to different types of natural disasters, including cyclones, earthquakes, floods, and droughts, necessitating region-specific disaster management strategies.\nLegislative Framework: The Disaster Management Act of 2005 provides a legal and institutional framework for disaster management in India, establishing the National Disaster Management Authority (NDMA), State Disaster Management Authorities (SDMAs), and District Disaster Management Authorities (DDMAs).\nCommunity Participation: Effective disaster management in India emphasizes community participation, recognizing that local knowledge and involvement are critical for disaster preparedness, response, and recovery.\nIntegrated Approach: India adopts an integrated approach to disaster management that includes mitigation, preparedness, response, and recovery, ensuring a comprehensive strategy to manage disasters.\nTechnology and Innovation: The use of technology and innovation, including satellite communication, GIS mapping, and early warning systems, plays a significant role in disaster risk reduction and management.\nCapacity Building: Building the capacity of disaster management professionals and local communities through training and awareness programs is a priority to enhance disaster preparedness and response mechanisms.\nInternational Cooperation: India actively engages in international cooperation for disaster risk reduction, sharing best practices and learning from global experiences to strengthen its disaster management capabilities.\nFocus on Vulnerable Groups: Special attention is given to vulnerable populations, including women, children, the elderly, and people with disabilities, ensuring that disaster management efforts are inclusive and equitable.\nEconomic Impact Assessment: Assessing the economic impact of disasters is essential for planning recovery efforts and allocating resources efficiently to rebuild and rehabilitate affected communities.\nSustainable Development: Disaster management in India is increasingly aligned with sustainable development goals, recognizing that reducing disaster risk contributes to sustainable economic growth and development.\n\nUnderstanding these aspects helps in formulating effective strategies for disaster management in India, aiming at not only responding to disasters when they occur but also preparing for them in advance to mitigate their impact.\n\nConclusion\n\nDisaster and disaster management require coordinated efforts across multiple sectors and disciplines.\n\nBy understanding the nature of disasters, the difference between disasters and hazards, and implementing effective disaster management strategies, communities can enhance their resilience and reduce the impact of disasters.\n\nThe goal of disaster management is not only to respond efficiently to emergencies but also to build a society capable of withstanding and recovering from the inevitable challenges posed by such catastrophic events.\n\nRead: Early warning systems"

The audits identify potential fire hazards and recommend corrective measures.\n\nFire Safety Training: Fire safety training is essential for building occupants, employees, and the general public. Training includes fire drills, evacuation procedures, and the proper use of fire extinguishers.\n\nFire Prevention Measures: Fire safety measures include the installation of fire alarms, sprinkler systems, fire hydrants, and fire extinguishers in buildings and public spaces.\n\nRegular maintenance and testing of these systems are crucial to ensure their effectiveness.\nEnsuring that buildings adhere to occupancy limits and have sufficient and accessible fire exits is crucial for rapid evacuation during emergencies.\n\nPublic Awareness Campaigns: Public awareness campaigns are conducted by fire departments and other organizations to educate citizens about fire safety, preventive measures, and emergency response.\n\nIndustries and commercial establishments with high fire risk are required to follow additional safety measures and obtain necessary approvals from fire authorities.\nMany Indian cities are focusing on smart city initiatives that include integrating fire safety systems, using real-time data, and leveraging technology for efficient fire response.\nCauses of Urban Fires\n\nUrban fires can be caused by various factors, and their occurrence is often a result of a combination of these factors.\n\nThe causes of urban fires can be broadly categorized into accidental, human-induced, and natural causes. Some common causes of urban fires include:\n\nElectrical fires are a common cause of urban fires. Faulty wiring, overloaded electrical circuits, and malfunctioning electrical appliances can lead to electrical sparks and short circuits, igniting fires.\nCareless handling of open flames, such as candles, gas stoves, and bonfires, can lead to accidental fires. Improper disposal of cigarette butts and smoking in restricted areas can also cause fires.\nIntentional acts of arson, vandalism, or mischief by individuals can lead to destructive fires in urban areas.\nCooking-related fires are prevalent in urban settings. Unattended cooking, grease fires, and cooking accidents are common causes of kitchen fires.\nFires can occur due to the improper use or malfunction of heating equipment, such as space heaters, furnaces, and boilers.\nIn industrial areas, chemical spills, leaks, or improper storage of hazardous materials can result in fires and explosions.\nImproper storage or handling of combustible materials, such as flammable liquids or gases, can contribute to fire incidents.\nThe use of fireworks during festivals or celebratory events can sometimes lead to accidental fires.\nDuring periods of hot weather and drought, dry vegetation and increased fire hazards can lead to wildfires in urban fringe areas.\nOld and poorly maintained buildings may have faulty electrical systems, outdated wiring, or compromised fire safety measures, increasing the risk of fires.\nConstruction sites can be susceptible to fires due to welding sparks, electrical work, or improper handling of construction materials.\nChallenges to fire safety\n\nFire safety in India faces several challenges due to various factors, including rapid urbanization, inadequate infrastructure, lack of awareness, and limited resources. Some of the key challenges for fire safety in India are:\n\nMany Indian cities are characterized by high population density and overcrowded urban areas. Narrow streets, congested buildings, and a lack of open spaces make firefighting and rescue operations challenging during emergencies.\nThe presence of informal settlements and slums in urban areas often lacks proper infrastructure, making it difficult for fire engines and emergency services to access these areas promptly.\nSeveral old and poorly maintained buildings lack fire safety features and have outdated electrical systems, increasing the risk of fire incidents.\nWhile modern buildings may have fire safety features, compliance with fire safety regulations is not always strictly enforced. Many buildings lack proper fire exits, fire alarms, and sprinkler systems.\nThere is a lack of awareness among the general public regarding fire safety measures and emergency response procedures.\nTraining in fire safety and evacuation drills may not be widespread in many residential and commercial establishments.\nMany fire departments in India face challenges in acquiring modern firefighting equipment and maintaining an adequate number of trained firefighting personnel.\nSome areas may suffer from inadequate water supply, which can hinder firefighting efforts during emergencies.\nThe presence of industries and manufacturing units in urban areas can pose additional fire safety challenges, especially if proper safety protocols are not followed.\nThe use of fireworks and firecrackers during festivals and celebratory events can lead to accidental fires if not handled properly.\nClimate change and the urban heat island effect can contribute to extreme weather conditions and heat waves, increasing the risk of wildfires and urban fires.\n\nAlso read: Forest Fires: Causes, Types and Effects\n\nWay forward\n\nDespite these efforts, there is a need for continuous vigilance and improvement in fire safety practices in India. Rapid urbanization, high population density, and aging infrastructure pose ongoing challenges.\n\nRaising awareness, strict enforcement of fire safety regulations, and public cooperation are essential to mitigate fire risks and protect lives and property.\n\nPreventing urban fires requires a combination of fire safety measures, public awareness, and enforcement of fire safety regulations.\n\nProper building design, fire-resistant materials, fire safety equipment, and regular inspections are essential to minimize the risk of fires in urban areas. Education and awareness campaigns can also help in promoting fire safety practices among residents and businesses.\n\nAdditionally, strong enforcement of fire safety codes and regulations is crucial to ensure compliance and mitigate fire hazards in urban environments.\n\n-Article by Swathi Satish"

They could lead to property damage, environmental degradation, human and animal injury or death.\nSuch catastrophes can be categorised as:\n\u2018Routine\u2019 catastrophes: They are mostly understood by experts and pose the greatest hazard of industrial disaster. Issues can be handled with ease by following accepted guidelines and procedures.\nDisasters that come as a \u201csurprise\u201d: Examples of these include the Minamata disaster in Japan and the Chornobyl accident in Ukraine.\nAny of the production stages\u2014manufacturing, processing, transportation, storage, utilisation, or disposal\u2014can be affected by the risks that lead to such catastrophes.\nThese catastrophes have the potential to release a wide range of hazardous substances into the environment, including radioactive materials, toxic chemicals, radiation, and toxic radiation.\nIt may also result in fires, explosions, and other types of harm.\nIn India, there are about 1,861 MAH (major accident hazard) units. Thousands of additional dangerous factories and unorganised sector units also increase the likelihood of industrial disaster.\nChemical Disasters\nChemical catastrophes are the result of the emission, fire, or explosion of one or more hazardous chemicals during an industrial operation, such as handling, storing, or transporting the chemicals, or as a result of a natural disaster.\nThe NDMA develops recommendations for the various ministries and state authorities for the drafting of disaster management plans, while the Ministry of Environment and Forest (MoEF) serves as the nodal ministry for the management of chemical disasters.\nAs chemicals are at the core of contemporary industrial systems, the government, the commercial sector, and the larger community have severe concerns about disaster management.\nThe industrial plant, its staff, workers, people of surrounding villages, etc., are at the greatest risk from chemical mishaps.\nThe following three factors could be the main causes of chemical disasters: mistakes made by people, technology, and management\nSignificant losses of life, injuries, suffering, property damage, and environmental harm result from these accidents. There were other chemical mishaps in India even after the Bhopal tragedy.\nChemical Terrorism\nChemical terrorism is convenient for anti-national elements to use and is inexpensive. As they are implementing new strategies, they are also acting more aggressively. Terrorists mostly seek to terrify the populace, attract attention, or persuade an officially recognised government or group to take action or do nothing.\nChemical terrorism refers to the employment of chemicals to take lives, harm people and animals, and so spread fear, anarchy, and unrest.\nChemical terrorism agents can be solids or liquids with a variety of hazardous effects on people, pets, and plants. They can endanger the environment and humans by being sprayed from aircraft, dropped as bombs, or used in liquid form.\nWhy do industrial disasters occur?\nChemical disasters have several causes, some of which can be somewhat prevented. India\u2019s vulnerability to such disasters is somewhat lessened by the implementation of legal measures against Chemical Disaster Risk.\nUnsafe conditions, unsafe acts, and other acts are three major categories under which the causes might be grouped.\nThey can be divided into two categories:\nTechnical causes: the use of faulty machinery, tools, or materials; insufficient lighting and ventilation; storage without sufficient safety precautions; etc. might cause such accidents.\nWorking conditions: Such accidents may be caused by psychological factors such as monotony at work, exhaustion, working overtime, frustration, etc. It is also noteworthy that the majority of accidents (about one-third) take place in the sectors with the highest levels of risk.\nUnsafe acts: Some actions by employees, resulting from a variety of factors such as a poor attitude, physical limitations, or a lack of expertise or knowledge, might result in such accidents.\nunauthorised activity\ndangerous operation at high speeds\nsloppy disposal\nnot wearing PPE or other safety equipment\nDistractions, disputes, mistreatment, etc.\nAdditional causes include the presence of dust, pollutants, an unhygienic atmosphere, and climate factors like heat and humidity.\nFactors Causing Industrial disaster\nThe Indian chemical sector is more vulnerable to chemical disasters due to ageing process plants, design flaws, and a lack of actions to keep up with contemporary technologies.\nIn the chemical industry, fires and explosions are frequently caused by organic solvents.\nBecause Standard Operating Procedures aren\u2019t followed, human error accounts for the bulk of industrial accidents (SOPs).\nThe Piper Alpha tragedy, in which a worker mistakenly activates a pump during maintenance without a safety valve in place, resulting in a gas leak and subsequent explosion, is a classic illustration of how human error can cause chemical disasters.\nTerrorist activity and sabotage have escalated the threat. Natural catastrophes like floods and earthquakes have also resulted in significant\nEquipment that has not been properly maintained is another major factor in chemical catastrophes. It\u2019s crucial to do planned maintenance according to the manufacturer\u2019s instructions to maintain the equipment\u2019s efficiency and safety. The Flixborough tragedy, which resulted in 28 fatalities and several injuries, is a prime example of poor maintenance.\nMajor disasters have also occurred in various sites in India as a result of the lack of an emergency reaction team to prevent accidents during the shipment of hazardous chemicals.\nProcessing hazardous waste and disposing of it properly require extra care because they can also result in fires, explosions, and harmful releases into the environment.\nattack by terrorists or rioting that results in sabotage.\nWhat were the major industrial disasters in the past?\n\nIndia has witnessed several chemical disasters in the past few years, including the Vizag gas leak tragedy and Neyveli and Visakhapatnam disasters. According to the\u00a0National Disaster Management Authority (NDMA),\u00a0in the recent past, over 130 significant chemical accidents have been reported in the country.\n\nBhopal Gas Tragedy:\nThe greatest industrial accident in history is thought to have occurred in 1984 when a gas leak occurred at the Union Carbide India Ltd. pesticide facility.\nLike the breach in Vizag, this one happened in the early hours and had an impact on more than 5 lakh people.\nAccording to reports, the spill caused the deaths of over 3,700 people and crippled or rendered permanently incapacitated many more.\nMethyl isocyanate was found to be a hazardous substance. The gas produced cerebral oedema, liver damage, and kidney and lung damage, among other things. The incident saw a 300% spike in stillbirth rates and a 200% increase in infant deaths in the region.\nThe healthcare system was overburdened, and the staff wasn\u2019t ready for the emergency.\nChasnala Mining Disaster:\nIn 1975, a coal mine in Jharkhand experienced the Chasnala mining accident, one of the worst in India\u2019s mining history.\nA pocket of methane gas was ignited by malfunctioning equipment, which caused an explosion.\nThe mine collapse caused by the explosion allowed millions of gallons of water from a nearby reservoir to enter.\nDue to the explosion, mine collapse, or reservoir flooding, about 700 people died.\nJaipur Oil Depot Fire:\nThe oil store owned by the Indian Oil Company in Rajasthan had this industrial accident in 2009.\nIt caused 12 fatalities and further injuries. Over a week, which was required to put out the fire, 500,000 people were evacuated from the area.\nThe administration lacked a disaster management strategy, and the firefighters lacked the tools they needed to put out the fires.\nKorba Chimney Collapse:\nIn 2009, 45 construction workers were killed when a chimney for a thermal plant in Chhattisgarh that was under BALCO\u2019s contract fell. The rescue operations were hampered by extreme weather (torrential rainfall).\nThe use of subpar materials, technical design flaws, incorrect water curing, and supervisor incompetence were identified as the causes.\nMayapuri Radiological Incident:\nAn unused research irradiator was disassembled in 2010 at a scrapyard in Delhi\u2019s Mayapuri by workers who were not aware of its radioactive nature.\nThe scrapyard lacked radiation detectors and other essential tools for safe operation.\nBombay Docks Explosion:\nIn Mumbai\u2019s Victoria Port in 1944, a cargo carrying weapons exploded, killing about 800 people.\nThe crew was told to leave the freighter when the initial fire on the ship proved to be uncontrollable.\nFollowing the explosions that damaged neighbouring boats, including numerous navy warships, several nearby economically developed districts, and a shower of flaming debris that caused fires to erupt in the nearby slums.\nLegal Safeguards against Chemical/ Industrial disaster in India\n\nThe Indian Criminal Code (IPC) was the only applicable legislation defining criminal liability for such situations at the time of the Bhopal gas tragedy. Section 304: Guilty homicide that is not murder. The maximum penalty under Section 304A, which deals with negligent death, is two years in prison and a fine. The government quickly after the tragedy created several laws governing the environment, prescribing and defining precautions and penalties. These are a few of these laws:\n\n\ud83d\udc49 Which year are YOU targeting for success in the IAS/IPS/IFS Exam? \ud83d\ude80\n\n(1) \u21d2 UPSC 2025: Prelims cum Mains\n\n(2) \u21d2 UPSC 2026: Prelims cum Mains\n\n(3) \u21d2 UPSC 2027 Prelims cum Mains\n\nTip: Know more about ClearIAS Courses (Online/Offline)\n\nBhopal Gas Leak (Processing of Claims) Act, 1985:\nwhich gives powers to the central government to secure the claims arising out of or connected with the Bhopal gas tragedy. Under the provisions of this Act, such claims are dealt with speedily and equitably.\nThe Environment Protection Act, 1986:\nwhich gives powers to the central government to undertake measures for improving the environment and set standards and inspect industrial units.\nHazardous Waste (Management Handling and Transboundary Movement) Rules, 1989:\nIndustry-required to identify major accident hazards, take preventive measures and submit a report to the designated authorities\nManufacture, Storage And Import Of Hazardous Chemicals Rules, 1989:\nThe importer must furnish complete product safety information to the competent authority and must transport imported chemicals by the amended rules.\nThe Public Liability Insurance Act, 1991:\nwhich is an insurance meant to provide relief to persons affected by accidents that occur while handling hazardous substances.\nChemical Accidents (Emergency, Planning, Preparedness and Response) Rules, 1996:\nThe Centre is required to constitute a central crisis group for the management of chemical accidents; set up a quick response mechanism termed the crisis alert system. Each state is required to set up a crisis group and report on its work.\nThe National Environment Appellate Authority Act, 1997:\nunder which the National Environment Appellate Authority can hear appeals regarding the restriction of areas in which any industries, operations or processes or class of industries, operations or processes shall not be carried out or shall be carried out subject to certain safeguards under the Environment (Protection) Act, 1986.\nThe National Green Tribunal, 2010:\nprovides for the establishment of a National Green Tribunal for effective and expeditious disposal of cases related to environmental protection and conservation of forests.\nRecommendations of ILO on Industrial disaster\nTo strengthen the national system for preventing occupational accidents in certain industrial activities. The Ministry of Labour implemented the ILO\u2019s recommendations:\nA list of hazardous chemicals and flammable gases should be established, each having a specific quantity such that any factory handling any substance above the stated quantity should be a major hazard work black by definition.\nAn inventory of major hazard works should be obtained for each state.\nThe list of hazardous chemicals and the inventory of the major hazardous works should be maintained in a computerized data bank.\nNDMA Guidelines on Chemical/ Industrial disaster:\n\nThere are roughly 1,861 significant accident risk (MAH) units in all country zones, dispersed throughout 301 districts, 25 states, and three centrally controlled territories, according to the website of the National Disaster Management Authority.\nHowever, there are several unorganised sectors and thousands of recognised hazardous industries (below MAH norms) that deal with a wide variety of harmful products that offer serious and intricate catastrophic threats.\n\nThe National Disaster Management Authority (NDMA) has released specific recommendations for managing chemical disasters. These recommendations are intended to help state authorities, ministries, and departments create comprehensive disaster management strategies.\nThese recommendations offer a proactive, interdisciplinary, multi-sectoral, participative approach to various stages of catastrophe preparedness and response.\nEnhancing technical support services and strengthening the current regulatory framework to conform to the established national policies and ambitions\nEstablishing supportive, technology-neutral regulations\nLaws governing land use policy (buffer zone around the chemical industry)\nnational codes and practises uniformity\nThere is a focus on locating and choosing professional organisations, as well as on their accreditation and ongoing safety evaluations.\nChemical industry commissioning and decommissioning\nplanning for both on-site and off-site readiness\nroutine drill testing of emergency plans\nTo deal with specific chemical mishaps at the affected site, medical personnel and supplies are required.\nStrategies for Hospital Crisis Handling of Chemical Emergencies\nMobile hospital and mobile team concept\nResponse to public health concerns, medical rehabilitation, and negative consequences on the environment\ndocumentation and analysis following a disaster\nWay forward\nAlthough India has sufficient legislation to address industrial disasters, their efficacy needs to be reviewed.\nBuffer zones must be established around factories that handle dangerous materials. By doing so, calamities may be contained and fewer people and property would be lost.\nThe supreme court had underlined that financial compensation ought to serve as a deterrent against similar catastrophes. It must be in proportion to the violating enterprise\u2019s capabilities.\nThe local authorities need to be made aware of the disaster management plan, particularly because CBRN (chemical, biological, radiological, and nuclear) catastrophes call for a specific response.\nIt should be required of all such industrial facilities to maintain an effective disaster management plan. Through recurring safety drills, the person must also be informed of the plan and instructed on how to handle similar circumstances.\nThe local population must be informed of the industries\u2019 disaster management plans.\nBy gradually transferring industry away from populous regions, the \u201csitting of the industries\u201d problem can be resolved.\nMoreover, planning must be done to keep expanding cities away from such industrial facilities.\nGiven the rising frequency of natural disasters that hit India, infrastructure resilience needs to be improved. For instance, the 2001 Bhuj earthquake damaged a containment system for phosphoric acid sludge, while the 1991 super-cyclone in Odisha caused an ammonia gas leak from a fertiliser plant.\nUnder numerous efforts, such as Make in India, industrial expansion must be accompanied by proper safety precautions and regulations; in other words, growth must be sustainable.\nFollowing the gas spill in Vizag, the centre issued some instructions. The NDMA requested that businesses approach the first week of resuming operations following the lockout as a test period. High output goals for the first week were discouraged.\nAdditionally, it requested that the sectors teach their employees to recognise anomalies that can result in such mishaps. Complete safety audits should be conducted before restarting production.\nConclusion\n\nChemicals, which are at the core of modern industrial processes, have grown to be a major source of concern for disaster management in the public sector, the business community, and society at large.\n\nChemical disasters may have devastating impacts on people, including deaths as well as damage to the environment and property. The parties most at risk from a chemical mishap include the industrial plant, its personnel, hazardous chemical vehicles, residents of neighbouring towns, inhabitants of adjacent buildings, and the neighbourhood.\n\nIn the chemical business, disasters are uncommon, but carelessness or bad luck can easily have disastrous effects. A chemical disaster has impacts on communities that last for decades and are nearly irreparable, and the cost of that\n\nArticle written by Aseem Muhammed"

Small tremors to big buildings collapsing are all possible during an earthquake.\n\nEvery few minutes, there are small vibrations that create minor tremors, but larger earthquakes brought on by faulting (normal, reverse, and strike-slip) cause a lot of interruptions.\n\nWhat Makes India Susceptible to Earthquakes?\nThe Himalayan plate border, which has the potential for massive quakes, is particularly vulnerable to earthquakes in India because of its geography (magnitude 7 and above).\nThe Indian Plate colliding with the Eurasian Plate is the main reason for earthquakes in India.\nThe Himalayas were created as a result of this collision, and the area experiences frequent earthquakes as well.\nThere are observable seismic gaps along the Himalayan axis where the previous release of geological stress doesn\u2019t completely account for the strain that has built up, according to scientists.\nFor instance, compared to other regions, the Central Himalayas has historically experienced fewer earthquakes. So, it\u2019s one area where a major earthquake can be projected to occur in the future.\nThe term \u201cSeismic Gap\u201d refers to a section of an active fault that has had little to no seismic activity for an extended period, suggesting the building of tensions that are helpful in earthquake prediction.\nWhy some parts of India are more prone to earthquakes?\n\nThe Indian Plate colliding with the Eurasian Plate is the main reason for earthquakes in India.\n\nHimalayan belt:\nThe collision between the Java Sumatra and the Burma plates, as well as the Indo-Austral and Eurasian plates. The energy of the underlying rocks is greatly strained by this contact, and some of that energy is released as earthquakes.\nSubsurface rocks are under a great deal of stress as a result of the collision of two continental plates. The result of this stress is earthquakes.\nAndaman and Nicobar Islands:\nUnderwater volcanoes and seafloor movement alter the equilibrium of the earth\u2019s surface\nDeccan Plateau:\nSome geologists have proposed a theory explaining the origin of a fault line and energy buildup along the river Bhima (Krishna) fault line near Latur and Osmanabad (Maharashtra).\nIndia is a country with a significant earthquake risk due to its growing population and irrational land use for construction.\nWhat Steps can be Taken for India\u2019s Earthquake preparedness?\n\nSince it is impossible to prevent earthquakes, the best course of action is to prioritise disaster preparedness and mitigation over curative interventions like:\n\n\ud83d\udc49 Which year are YOU targeting for success in the IAS/IPS/IFS Exam? \ud83d\ude80\n\n(1) \u21d2 UPSC 2025: Prelims cum Mains\n\n(2) \u21d2 UPSC 2026: Prelims cum Mains\n\n(3) \u21d2 UPSC 2027 Prelims cum Mains\n\nTip: Know more about ClearIAS Courses (Online/Offline)\n\nBuilding Codes and Standards:\nIndia has set building regulations and requirements for construction that are quake-resistant.\nTo guarantee that new structures are constructed to withstand earthquakes, it is crucial to properly follow these laws and standards.\nRegular inspections and enforcement of current building codes are also necessary for this.\nModifying the types of homes and building designs in the most vulnerable locations, and discouraging the development of high-rise structures, huge industrial facilities, and sprawling urban centres there.\nLastly, requiring big construction projects in susceptible areas to utilise light materials and earthquake-resistant designs.\nRetrofitting and Reinforcement:\nMany older structures can be modified or reinforced to improve their seismic performance even though they may not currently fulfil earthquake-resistant criteria.\nEmergency Response Planning for India\u2019s Earthquake preparedness:\nMaking emergency response plans is essential for reducing the effects of earthquakes. This includes creating emergency shelters, creating evacuation plans, and instructing staff members on how to handle earthquakes.\nResearch and Monitoring:\nIt is possible to develop better techniques for forecasting and reducing the effects of earthquakes by investing in research and monitoring. This will help us understand earthquakes and their causes.\nThe establishment of earthquake monitoring centres (seismological centres) for ongoing observation and rapid information distribution among the public\nLand-Use Planning:\nWhen creating land-use policies, it\u2019s crucial to take earthquakes\u2019 possible effects into account.\nThis involves limiting construction in earthquake-prone locations and making sure that new construction is designed and built in a way that reduces the risk of damage.\nVulnerability map for India\u2019s Earthquake preparedness:\ncreating a map of the nation\u2019s vulnerabilities, informing the public about vulnerability risks, and teaching them how to minimise the negative effects of disasters.\nSome Important institutional measures to prevent and mitigate earthquake loss\n\nEarthquake preparedness, rather a disaster management, and preparedness was an evolutionary road.\n\nThe National Center for Seismology for India\u2019s Earthquake preparedness\nAn office under the Earth Sciences Ministry.

Read further to know more.\n\nAccording to recent UN research, 3,700 dams in India will lose 26% of their total storage capacity by 2050 as a result of sediment buildup, which could eventually jeopardize future water security, irrigation, and power generation.\n\nThe United Nations University Institute on Water, Environment and Health (UNU-INWEH), also referred to as the UN\u2019s think tank on water completed the study.\n\nChina, the country with the biggest dams in the world, has already lost nearly 10% of its storage and will lose an additional 10% by 2050.\n\nTable of Contents\n\nWhat is the State of Indian Dams?\nWhat are the Issues with Indian Dams?\nWhat are the Impacts of Dam Construction?\nDam Safety in India\nWhat are the concerns associated with the present system of Dam Management?\nGovernment initiatives\nWay Forward\nConclusion\nWhat is the State of Indian Dams?\n\nIn the world, India is third in the construction of major dams. About 1,100 of the more than 5,200 major dams that have been erected so far have reached the age of 50, and others are more than 120 years old. By 2050, there will be 4,400 of these types of dams, or 80% of the country\u2019s major dams, which will range in age from 50 to more than 150 years.\n\nSince the lifespan of hundreds of thousands of small and medium-sized dams is significantly shorter than that of huge dams, the situation is even more perilous.\n\nExamples: The Krishna Raja Sagar dam, which was constructed in 1931, is 90 years old. Similar to Mettur Dam, which was built in 1934 and is currently 87 years old.

This can lead to structural issues and an increased risk of failure.\nBuilt based on Rainfall Pattern: State of Indian dams are very old and were constructed based on the historical patterns of rainfall. They have been exposed recently by erratic rains.\nHowever, the government is outfitting the dams with informational systems like rainfall notifications and flood alerts and creating emergency action plans in order to prevent all manner of accidents.\nStorage Capacity Declining: As dams get older, the water in the reservoirs is replaced by dirt. As a result, it is not possible to say that today\u2019s storage capacity is equivalent to that of the 1950s and 1900s.\nReservoirs in India are losing storage space at a rate that is quicker than expected.\nEnvironmental impacts: Dams can have a significant impact on the environment, including the displacement of local communities, the destruction of ecosystems, and changes in water flow and quality.\nClimate change: Climate change has increased variability in the availability of water and uncertainty in the availability of water in the future.\nSafety concerns: There have been incidents of dam failures in India in the past, which have resulted in the loss of life and damage to property. This has raised concerns about the safety of India\u2019s dams.\nGovernance and management: The issue of dam governance and management is a complex one in India, as there are many stakeholders involved, including state and central government agencies, local communities, and private companies.\nSocio-economic impacts: Dams can have a significant impact on local communities, including displacement, loss of livelihood, and changes in access to water and other resources.\nInefficient use of water: The state of Indian dams are not used efficiently, which leads to the waste of water. This is a major concern in a country where water is a precious resource.\nLack of transparency: There is a lack of transparency in the operation and maintenance of dams in India, which makes it difficult for stakeholders to hold the relevant authorities accountable.\nWhat are the Impacts of Dam Construction?\nWater storage: Dams are built primarily to store water for irrigation, hydroelectric power generation, flood control, and other uses.\nCost: Constructing dams is an expensive undertaking that can strain both state and federal budgets.\nTransparency: When decision-making is not done in a transparent manner, the public may lose faith in dams and the organizations that run them.\nElectricity generation: It can be used to generate hydroelectric power, which can provide a clean and renewable source of energy.\nFlood control: Dams can be used to regulate water flow and reduce the risk of flooding downstream.\nNavigation: Can create reservoirs that can be used for navigation and transportation.\nRecreational opportunities: State of Indian Dams can create recreational opportunities such as fishing, boating, and swimming.\nEnvironmental impacts: These include the displacement of local communities, destruction of ecosystems, and changes in water flow and quality.\nSocio-economic impacts: Dam construction can have a significant impact on local communities, including displacement, loss of livelihood, and changes in access to water and other resources.\nLoss of biodiversity: Reservoirs created by dams can submerge and destroy habitats of many species, thereby leading to loss of biodiversity.\nSoil erosion: State of Indian Dams can also lead to soil erosion, landslides and earthquakes.\nConflict: Dam construction can lead to conflicts between different stakeholders, such as local communities, government agencies, and private companies.\nDam Safety in India\n\nDam safety in India is a concern as many of the country\u2019s dams were built several decades ago and are in need of maintenance and repair. Additionally, there have been incidents of dam failures in India in the past, which have resulted in the loss of life and damage to property.\n\nThe Central Water Commission (CWC) is the main agency responsible for dam safety in India. It is responsible for the surveillance, inspection, and maintenance of all centrally-funded dams in the country. Additionally, state governments are also responsible for the safety of dams under their jurisdiction.\n\nIn recent years, the Indian government has taken steps to improve dam safety in the country, such as:\n\nSetting up a National Dam Safety Organization (NDSO) in 2019, under the Ministry of Jal Shakti, to coordinate dam safety-related activities and policies in the country.\nThe nation has more than 5,200 sizable dams. While some dams are situated within a state, they are controlled by another state and do not have a defined maintenance schedule.\nThere are thousands of more small and medium-sized dams throughout the nation in addition to these ones. Of the overall number of big dams, 293 are older than 100 years and 1,041 are older than 50.\nThe safety and upkeep of so many dams are an issue in the absence of an appropriate regulatory framework. All designated dams in the nation must be monitored, thoroughly inspected, operated, and maintained according to the 2019 Dam Safety Bill.\nDeveloping a National Dam Safety Policy (NDSP) in 2018, which lays out guidelines for dam safety management and monitoring in India.\nCarrying out regular safety inspections of dams and taking action to address any deficiencies identified.\nProviding training and capacity building to dam safety personnel.\nPromoting the use of new technologies and best practices in dam safety management.\n\nHowever, the safety of dams in India still remains a concern due to a lack of regular maintenance, lack of transparency and lack of coordination between different agencies.\n\nIt is important to note that the majority of the dams in India are owned and operated by the state government and there are no comprehensive regulations for their safety.\n\nAlso, read the Dam safety act in India, 2021.\n\nWhat are the concerns associated with the present system of Dam Management?\n\nThe current system of dam management in India has several concerns, including:\n\nLack of maintenance: The state of Indian dams is aging and in need of maintenance and repair, but there is often a lack of funding and resources devoted to this purpose.\nLack of transparency: There is often a lack of transparency in the operation and maintenance of dams in India, which makes it difficult for stakeholders to hold the relevant authorities accountable.\nGovernance and management issues: The issue of dam governance and management is complex in India, as there are many stakeholders involved, including state and central government agencies, local communities, and private companies. This often leads to a lack of coordination and conflicting interests among stakeholders.\nLack of public participation: Local communities, who are most affected by dams, often have little input in the planning and operation of dams, leading to a lack of transparency, accountability, and mistrust.\nInefficiency in water usage: Many of India\u2019s dams are not used efficiently, leading to the wastage of water, which is a major concern in a country where water is a precious resource.\nLack of monitoring and surveillance: There is often a lack of monitoring and surveillance of dams, which makes it difficult to identify and address potential safety issues in a timely manner.\nEnvironment and Social Impact Assessment (ESIA) is not mandatory for all dams, leading to a lack of understanding of the impact of the dams on the environment and local communities\nLimited data availability: There is limited availability of data on the condition of dams, making it difficult to assess the risk of failure and plan for maintenance and repair.\nLimited resources: The government\u2019s resources are often limited, which can make it difficult to address these concerns in a comprehensive and effective manner.\n\nIt is important to note that while there are concerns associated with the present system of dam management in India, the government has taken steps in recent years to improve the situation, such as setting up a National Dam Safety Organization and developing a National Dam Safety Policy.\n\nGovernment initiatives\n\nThe Indian government has taken several initiatives and efforts to improve dam construction and safety in the country. Some of the key government initiatives and laws include:\n\nNational Dam Safety Policy (NDSP): In 2018, the Indian government created the National Dam Safety Policy (NDSP), which establishes standards for the administration and oversight of dam safety in India. The goal of the policy is to promote the use of innovative technology and best practices in managing dam safety while ensuring the safety of all dams, regardless of whether they fall under the purview of the federal or state governments.\nNational Dam Safety Organization (NDSO): The Indian government established the NDSO in 2019 under the Ministry of Jal Shakti to coordinate national policies and programs pertaining to dam safety. By encouraging the adoption of cutting-edge technologies and top dam safety management techniques, as well as by offering training and capacity building to those responsible for managing dam safety, the NDSO seeks to increase dam safety.\nCentral Water Commission (CWC): The Central Water Commission (CWC) is the principal organization in charge of ensuring the security of dams in India. It is in charge of keeping an eye on, checking on, and maintaining all of the nation\u2019s dams that are supported by the federal government.\nState Dam Safety Organizations (SDSOs): Dams under the control of state governments are likewise subject to their safety obligations. State Dam Safety Organizations (SDSOs) have been established by numerous state governments to manage the security of dams within their borders and to work in tandem with the CWC.\nDam Rehabilitation and Improvement Project (DRIP): With support from the World Bank, the Indian government started the Dam Rehabilitation and Improvement Project (DRIP) in 2012 to enhance the performance and safety of a number of the nation\u2019s dams.\nThe Water (Prevention and Control of Pollution) Cess Act, 1977, and the Water (Prevention and Control of Pollution) Act, 1974, lay down guidelines for pollution control and management of water resources, including dams.\nThe National Green Tribunal Act, of 2010: allows citizens to file complaints related to environmental damage caused by dams.\nThe National Green Tribunal (NGT) is a specialized court that deals with environmental matters, including those related to dams.\nThe Forest Conservation Act, of 1980: regulates the diversion of forest land for non-forestry purposes, including dam construction.\n\nIt is important to note that the laws, policies, and initiatives for dam safety are in place but the implementation of these laws, policies and initiatives is not always effective.\n\nWay Forward\n\nThe following duties associated with components of dam safety need to be strengthened:\n\nIt is necessary to develop new acceptability standards for both the existing and upcoming dams.\nDam safety assessments and MIS for Dams, including online databases for Dam registers.\nAcquisition and diffusion of technology on dam safety to state governments and organizations.\nStudies on dam breaks, glacial breaks, and the creation of emergency action plans\nObserving the application of the Dam Safety Law\nTechnology advancement for effective restoration of troubled dams\nEstablishing State and Central Dam Safety Services by legislation\nConclusion\n\nMaking informed judgments on dam safety requires a risk-based strategy. An essential component of a risk-based strategy for dam safety is dam failure analysis. A few of the institutional and technological underpinnings for developing a strong risk-based decision-making framework for this industry currently exist.\n\nIndia can create a more secure and bear-resistant dam industry by making a few legislative adjustments and utilizing already established tools (such as WRIS and the MoEF environmental clearance portal).\n\nArticle Written by: Remya"

This led to the enactment of the Disaster Management Act on December 26th, 2005. The National Disaster Management Authority (NDMA) was constituted to lay down the policies, plans, and guidelines for disaster management.\n\nThe Disaster Management Act has statutory provisions for the constitution of the National Disaster Response Force (NDRF) for the purpose of specialized response to natural and man-made disasters.\n\nAccordingly, in 2006 NDRF was constituted of 8 Battalions.\nAt present, NDRF has a strength of 15 Battalions with each Battalion consisting of 1149 personnel.\n\nIn the beginning, the personnel of NDRF was deployed for routine law and order duties also. In a meeting of the NDMA with the Prime Minister on October 25, 2007, the need for NDRF to be made a dedicated force was highlighted and accepted.\n\nOrganization\n\nThe Apex Body for Disaster Management in India is the National Disaster Management Authority (NDMA). The Chairman of the NDMA is the Prime Minister.\n\nThe head of the NDRF is designated as Director General. The Director Generals of NDRF are IPS officers on deputation from Indian police organizations. Director General is a three-star officer.\n\nAt present, National Disaster Response Force consists of 15 battalions from the BSF, CISF, CRPF, ITBP, SSB, and Assam Rifles.\nEach battalion has 18 self-contained specialist search and rescue teams of 45 personnel including engineers, technicians, electricians, dog squads, and medical/paramedics.\nThe total strength of each battalion is 1149.\nAll 15 battalions have been equipped and trained to respond to natural as well as man-made disasters.\nBattalions are also trained and equipped for a response during chemical, biological, radiological, and nuclear (CBRN) emergencies.\n\nThese NDRF battalions are located at 16 different locations in the country based on the vulnerability profile of the country and to cut down the response time for their deployment at the disaster sites.\n\nFunctions of the National Disaster Response Force\n\nThe National Disaster Response Force\u2019s mission is to create a safer and more disaster-resilient India through the creation of a comprehensive, pro-active, multi-disaster, and technology-driven disaster management plan.\n\nThis must be accomplished through the development of a culture of disaster preparedness, mitigation, and pre-order to provide a quick and effective response.\n\nThis national vision seeks, among other things, to instill a readiness culture among all stakeholders.\n\nBy conducting highly skilled rescue and relief operations, regular and intensive training and re-training, familiarisation exercises within the respective NDRF Battalions\u2019 areas of responsibility, and conducting mock drills and joint exercises with the various stakeholders, the NDRF has demonstrated its significance in achieving this vision.\n\nBesides the professionalism shown during rescue operations in floods and cyclones and collapsed structure search and rescue (CSSR) operations, NDRF has also acquired considerable expertise in facing CBRN (Chemical, Biological, Radiological & Nuclear) challenges.\n\nNDRF has also aided in international operations like the Japan tsunami of 2011 and the Nepal earthquake of 2015.\n\nNational Disaster Response Fund\n\nThe National Disaster Response Fund, constituted under Section 46 of the Disaster Management Act, 2005, supplements the State Disaster Response Fund (SDRF) of a State, in case of a disaster of severe nature, provided adequate funds are not available in SDRF.\n\nIt is placed in the \u201cPublic Account\u201d of the Government of India under reserve funds not bearing interest.\nExpenditures from it are not required to be approved by the Parliament.\nState Disaster Response Fund\n\nThe State Disaster Response Fund (SDRF), constituted under Section 48 (1) (a) of the Disaster Management Act, 2005, is the primary fund available to State Governments for responses to notified disasters.\n\nThe Central Government contributes 75% of SDRF allocation for general category States/UTs and 90% for special category States/UTs (NE States, Sikkim, Uttarakhand, Himachal Pradesh, Jammu, and Kashmir).\nThe annual Central contribution is released in two equal installments as per the recommendation of the Finance Commission.\nSDRF shall be used only for meeting the expenditure for providing immediate relief to the victims.\n\nDisasters covered under SDRF: Cyclones, drought, earthquakes, fires, floods, tsunamis, hailstorms, landslides, avalanches, cloudbursts, pest attacks, frost, and cold waves.\n\nLocal Disaster: A State Government may use up to 10 percent of the funds available under the SDRF for providing immediate relief to the victims of natural disasters that they consider to be \u2018disasters\u2019 within the local context in the State and which are not included in the notified list of disasters of the Ministry of Home Affairs.\n\nGovernment initiatives for disaster management\n\nNational Cyclone Risk Mitigation Project (NCRMP)\n\nRecurrent cyclones account for large-scale deaths, loss of livelihood opportunities, loss of public and private property, and severe damage to infrastructure.\nTo reduce the loss of life and properties in the event of future calamities, the National Cyclone Risk Mitigation Project (NCRMP) has been launched by the Ministry of Home Affairs, with support from the World Bank, in two phases, in the cyclone-prone coastal states and Union Territories.\nThe National Disaster Management Authority (NDMA) has been designated as the implementation agency.\n\nNational Disaster Response Reserve (NDRR)\n\nThe 13th Finance commission recommended for creation of a National Disaster Response reserve (NDRR) with a corpus of Rs.250 crore as a Revolving Fund to meet the immediate requirement of relief material/equipment after a disaster.\nThe purpose of creating the National Disaster Response Reserve (NDRR) is to mitigate the sufferings of the victims of the disaster which are beyond the coping capacity of the States.\n\nAapda Mitra Scheme\n\nThe NDMA has approved a Centrally Sponsored Scheme focusing on training community volunteers in disaster response in the 30 most flood-prone districts of 25 states in India.\nAim: To train community volunteers with the skills that they would need to respond to their community\u2019s immediate needs in the aftermath of a disaster, thereby, enabling them to undertake basic relief and rescue tasks for emergencies such as floods, flash floods, and urban flooding, when emergency services are not readily available.\n\nNational Disaster Management Services\n\nThe scheme has an integrated approach to provide reliable telecommunication infrastructure to disaster managers during times of non-disasters and in the event of disasters.\nIt is an NDMA pilot project being implemented to provide the failsafe communication infrastructure and technical support for Emergency Operation Centers (EOCs) at MHA, NDMA, NDRF, 36 States/Union Territories, and 81 most vulnerable districts.\n\nMobile Radiation Detection System (MRDS)\n\nNDMA, as part of a pilot project on national-level preparedness to cope with Radiological Emergencies, has taken an initiative to equip police and NDRF personnel for the management of radiological emergencies in the public domain.\nConclusion\n\nThe practice of \u201cproactive availability\u201d of the National Disaster Response Force to the States and that of \u201cpre-positioning\u201d, in a threatening disaster situation have immensely helped minimize damage, caused due to natural calamities in the country.\n\nThe first major test of disaster for NDRF was Kosi Floods in 2008, which was handled by the force on a war footing.\n\nNDRF has since its inception has shown great efficiency during and after major calamities. NDRF teams also assist the local administration by providing immediate relief and medical care to thousands of needy people.\n\nThe government of India also tries to strengthen disaster management and preparedness through international cooperation. India has numerous MoUs in the field of Disaster management with countries like Tajikistan, Mongolia, Bangladesh, Italy, Japan, SCO countries, Germany, SAARC countries, Russia, and, Switzerland.\n\n\u00ad-Article written by Swathi Satish"

However, the world has been undergoing a variety of changes, both slow and catastrophic. To investigate Natural Hazards and Disasters and strategies to deal with them in-depth, it is important to learn some basic concepts.\n\nTable of Contents\n\nHazards\nTypes of Hazards\nTypes of Hazards depending upon their causes\nNatural Hazards\nMan-made Hazards\nSocio-natural Hazards\nDisaster\nClassification of Disaster\nVulnerability\nNatural Hazards and Disasters in India\nYokohama Strategy and International Decade for Natural Disaster Reduction (IDNDR)\nHazards\n\nChanges that affect humans adversely are called hazards.\n\nA natural disaster pertains to a natural phenomenon that occurs in proximity and poses a threat to people, structures, and economic assets caused by biological, geological, seismic, hydrological, or meteorological conditions or processes in the natural environment.\n\nAs per the Disaster Preparedness Training Manual, Philippine National Red Cross 1954, hazards are defined as \u201cphenomena that pose a threat to people, structures or economic assets and which may cause a disaster. They could be either manmade or naturally occurring in our environment.\u201d\n\nTypes of Hazards\n\nHazards are generally\u00a0categorized according to their causes, mitigation strategies, or effects on societies. We will limit\u00a0the classification of disasters to those that are based\u00a0on their causes only.\n\n\ud83d\udc49 Which year are YOU targeting for success in the IAS/IPS/IFS Exam? \ud83d\ude80\n\n(1) \u21d2 UPSC 2025: Prelims cum Mains\n\n(2) \u21d2 UPSC 2026: Prelims cum Mains\n\n(3) \u21d2 UPSC 2027 Prelims cum Mains\n\nTip: Know more about ClearIAS Courses (Online/Offline)\n\nTypes of Hazards depending upon their causes\n\nHazards are classified as either natural or man-made. Socio-natural hazards are the third category of hazards that are brought on by both man and nature.\n\nNatural Hazards\n\nThese are brought on by natural causes, and man has no control over them. The primary example of natural hazards are as follows:\n\nEarthquakes\nVolcanic eruptions\nCyclonic storms\nTsunamis\nFloods Droughts\nLandslides\nMan-made Hazards\n\nThese are caused by the undesirable activities of man. Such hazards include:\n\nExplosions\nLeakage of toxic waste.\nPollution of air, water, and land Dam failures\nWar and Civil Strife Terrorism\nSocio-natural Hazards\n\nThese are the result of a combined force\u00a0of both human misconduct and\u00a0natural forces.\n\nFor example-\n\nthe uncontrolled destruction of trees, especially in the river catchment areas, may result in an increase in the frequency and severity of floods and droughts.\nThe risk of storm surges increases due to mangrove loss.\nAlthough landslides are normally caused by natural forces, yet, they\u00a0can be triggered and their frequency and impact can be increased because\u00a0of building roads in mountainous regions, excavating tunnels, and engaging in mining and quarrying.\nDisaster\n\nAn extreme form of hazard leads to disaster.\n\nDisaster (French des meaning \u2018bad\u2019 and aster meaning \u2018star\u2019) is a manmade or natural event that results in widespread loss of life and property.\n\nThus, disaster is defined as \u201cA serious disruption of the functioning of a society, causing widespread human, material or environmental losses which exceed the ability of the affected society to cope using its own resources.\u201d\n\nDisaster, according to the United Nations, is the occurrence of a sudden or significant catastrophe that impairs a society\u2019s (or community\u2019s) fundamental structure and daily operations.\n\nAccording to the World Bank, a disaster is an extraordinary, short-lived event that significantly disrupts a nation\u2019s economy. It is an event or a series of events that results in casualties, property damage, or a loss of essential services or sources of livelihood on a scale that is greater than what the affected communities are typically able to handle without assistance.\n\nHazards and disasters are closely connected and occasionally used interchangeably; a hazard is a threat, whereas a disaster is an event.\n\nClassification of Disaster\n\nDisasters are usually classified on the basis of their origin as-\n\nTectonic occurrence (earthquakes, volcanoes)\nTopographical occurrence (landslides. avalanches)\nMeteorological (hurricanes, cyclones, tornadoes, floods, droughts)\nInfestic (locust invasion of crops, epidemics), and\nHuman (industrial accidents, nuclear bombs).\nVulnerability\n\nThe terms like \u2018earthquake-prone\u2019, \u2018drought-prone\u2019, or \u2018flood-prone\u2019 areas are used to describe the distributional effect of the concerned hazards. People who live there are susceptible to a variety of dangers and calamities.\n\nThus, vulnerability is the extent to which an Individual or a community, or an area is exposed to the impact of a hazard.\n\nAccording to the National Institute of Disaster Management (formerly National Centre for Disaster Management), the definition of vulnerability is defined as \u201cthe extent to which a community, structure, service, or geographic area is likely to be damaged or disturbed by the effect of particular hazards due to either nature, construction, and proximity to hazardous terrain or disaster-prone area.\n\nNatural Hazards and Disasters in India\n\nBecause of its subcontinental dimensions, geographical situation, and behavior of the monsoon, India is exposed to various natural hazards and disasters like drought, flood, cyclones, earthquakes, etc year after year.\n\nFour major disasters which adversely affect different parts of the country are drought, flood, cyclone, and earthquake. Only one state (West Bengal), faces all four types of disasters.\n\nIt is not uncommon to experience more than one or two types of disasters affecting different parts of the country at the same time. For example, there may be floods in the Brahmaputra Valley, drought in Rajasthan, and cyclonic storms in some coastal areas.\n\nThe most alarming aspect is how frequently and violently these hazards and disasters are occurring in various sections of the country.\n\nNote-\n\n55% of the total area is in Seismic Zones III-IV and vulnerable to earthquakes.\n68% of the net sown area is vulnerable to drought.\n40 million hectares of land are vulnerable to floods.\n8% of the total land area particularly along the eastern coast and Gujarat coast is vulnerable to tropical cyclones.\nThe sub-Himalayan region and the Western Ghats are vulnerable to landslides.\nOut of the total 7,516 km long coastline, close to 5,700 km is prone to tropical cyclones and tsunamis.\nYokohama Strategy and International Decade for Natural Disaster Reduction (IDNDR)\n\nYokohama Strategy is a Plan of Action for a Safer World.\n\nWorld Conference on Natural Disaster Reduction happened in the city of Yokohama from May 23rd-27th 1994.\n\nIt recognized that society as a whole has grown more vulnerable to natural catastrophes and that the effect of disasters in terms of human and financial losses has increased recently.\n\nIn order to lessen the losses caused by these disasters, the conference established the Yokohama strategy as a guide.\n\nThe resolution of the World Conference on Natural Disasters Reduction is as mentioned below:\n\nEach country has a sovereign duty to safeguard its people from natural disasters.\ngiven top priority to\u00a0the developing nations, especially the least developed, landlocked nations, and small island developing states\nDevelop and enhance national capabilities, and if necessary, national legislation, for the mitigation, prevention, and preparedness of natural and other disasters.\nIt will encourage and strengthen sub-regional, regional, and international cooperation in efforts to prevent, lessen, and mitigate natural disasters and other calamities, with a focus on:\nstrengthening institutional and human capacity,\ntechnology sharing: the collection, dissemination, and utilization of information; and\nmobilisation of resources\n\nArticle Written By: Priti Raj"

Read here to know more about the causes of lightning, types of lightning and the hotspots of lightning.\n\nIn 2019\u201320, there were about 1.4 crore lightning strikes reported in India.\n\nIn 2020\u201321, there were 1.85 crore incidents.\n\nApproximately 1.49 crore strikes were reported nationwide in 2021\u20132022.\n\nLightning is unpredictable, making it difficult to give alerts in a timely manner.\n\nFurther, it is not generally considered a natural disaster, even though it can result in causalities.\n\nTable of Contents\n\nWhat is lightning?\nTypes of lightning\nWhat causes lightning?\nWhy it is a matter of concern?\nHow lightning causes deaths among people?\nWhere are the lightning hotspots around the world?\nWhat are the government initiatives to tackle this problem?\nWhat is lightning?\n\nLightning is an electrical discharge that occurs when there is an imbalance between the storm clouds and the earth or even within the clouds.\n\n\ud83d\udc49 Which year are YOU targeting for success in the IAS/IPS/IFS Exam? \ud83d\ude80\n\n(1) \u21d2 UPSC 2025: Prelims cum Mains\n\n(2) \u21d2 UPSC 2026: Prelims cum Mains\n\n(3) \u21d2 UPSC 2027 Prelims cum Mains\n\nTip: Know more about ClearIAS Courses (Online/Offline)\n\nClouds are where lightning typically occurs.\n\nTypes of lightning\nIntercloud or intra-cloud (IC):\u00a0 Harmless\nCloud to Ground (CG) lightning: Harmful as the \u2018high electric voltage and electric current\u2019 can lead to electrocution.\nWhat causes lightning?\n\nThe rising temperature causes water vapour to condense as it rises in the cloud. The water droplets become minute ice crystals as their temperature falls below zero degrees Celsius.\n\nThey keep expanding until they are so heavy that they start to tumble to the ground. This results in a system where smaller ice crystals are travelling up and larger crystals are coming down simultaneously.\n\nAfter a collision, electrons are released and triggered in a manner akin to the creation of electric sparks. A chain reaction happens as more collisions and electrons are produced as a result of the free electrons\u2019 movement.\n\nThe upper layer of the cloud becomes positively charged as a result of this process, whilst the middle layer becomes negatively charged. Between one billion and ten billion volts separate the two layers\u2019 electric potentials, which is a very significant difference.\n\nA massive current, between 100,000 and one million amperes, starts to flow between the layers in a matter of seconds.\n\nEarth is electrically neutral and a good conductor of electricity. It becomes positively charged in contrast to the cloud\u2019s centre layer, though. Because of this, 15% to 20% of the current is also directed toward the earth.\n\nWhy it is a matter of concern?\n\nData from the National Crime Records Bureau show that since 2005, lightning has been responsible for at least 2,000 fatalities annually.\n\nRural areas account for more than 96% of lightning-related fatalities.\n\nIt is not considered a natural calamity, thus unlike in the case of floods or earthquakes, the afflicted people are not entitled to government compensation.\n\nHow lightning causes deaths among people?\n\nAccording to the Annual Lightning Report 2020-2021, it has been noticed that deaths occur more frequently for farmers during the pre-monsoon to the first monsoon since they are out in the agricultural fields or in orchards.\n\nThe bulk of people passed away in their huts or while standing beneath big trees in the later portion of the year, from September on. In relation to 71% of lightning-related fatalities, people were huddled beneath trees.\n\nHowever, in Bihar, where there are no trees and large agricultural fields, lateral strikes account for more fatalities than direct hits (more than 50%).\n\nWhere are the lightning hotspots around the world?\n\nIt has been discovered by scientists at the Smithsonian Tropical Research Institute (STRI) in Panama that lightning strikes the tropics more than 100 million times a year.\n\nAsia, South America, North America, Australia, and Africa are the other continents having the highest concentration of lightning hotspots. According to experts, lightning strikes are expected to rise by 25\u201350% as a result of climate change.\n\nWhat are the government initiatives to tackle this problem?\n\nThe national disaster management authority has published comprehensive instructions that outline dos and don\u2019ts as well as actions that the general people should take during lighting.\n\nThe Common Alert Protocol (CAP) system has been released by the National Disaster Management Authority (NDMA) to alert citizens to imminent thunderstorms and lightning.\n\nLightning Alert System provides a location-specific forecast of thunder, lightning, strong winds, high winds, and hailstorm occurrences for up to 48 hours.\n\nFrom the INSAT-3DR satellite, which uploads data every 15 minutes, ISRO provides information about convective clouds. A GPS notification from the Damini app, which was created by the Indian Institute of Tropical Meteorology and Earth System Science Organization, alerts users when lightning is nearby and is between 20 and 40 kilometres away.\n\nBy 2022, the Lightning Resilient India programme hopes to reduce lightning-related fatalities to 1,200 annually. The Climate Resilient Observing-Systems Promotion Council (CROPC), the NDMA, the IMD, the Union Ministry of Earth Science, World Vision India, and UNICEF are all involved in the joint endeavour.\n\nArticle written by: Jis John Sebastian"

            "[CONTENT]": "The incidence of forest fires is increasing year by year. Read here to know the cause, effects, and mitigation efforts for it.\n\nWildfires are a natural occurrence within some forest ecosystems, but in a few years, the fires are becoming more extreme and widespread. Hotter and drier weather caused by climate change and poor land management create conditions favorable for frequent, larger, and high-intensity forest fires.\n\nThe fire in the Amazon rainforest during 2019-21 razed millions of acres of the world\u2019s largest tropical forest.\n\nTable of Contents\n\nForest fires\nCauses of forest fires\nTypes of forest fires\nCrown fires\nSurface fires\nGround fires\nConsequences of Wildfires\nForest fires in India\nMitigation measures by the government\nGlobal news on Forest fires\nRelated posts\nForest fires\n\nNote: Subscribe to the ClearIAS YouTube Channel to learn more.\n\nForest fires can be defined as any uncontrolled and non-prescribed combustion or burning of plants in a natural setting such as a forest, grassland, brushland, or tundra, which consumes the natural fuels and spreads based on environmental conditions (e.g., wind, topography).\n\n\ud83d\udc49 Which year are YOU targeting for success in the IAS/IPS/IFS Exam? \ud83d\ude80\n\n(1) \u21d2 UPSC 2025: Prelims cum Mains\n\n(2) \u21d2 UPSC 2026: Prelims cum Mains\n\n(3) \u21d2 UPSC 2027 Prelims cum Mains\n\nTip: Know more about ClearIAS Courses (Online/Offline)\n\nFuel, Oxygen, and heat sources help the spreading of wildfires:\n\nFuel is any flammable material surrounding a fire, including trees, grasses, brush, and even homes. The greater an area\u2019s fuel load, the more intense the fire.\nAir supplies the oxygen a fire needs to burn.\nHeat sources help spark the wildfire and bring fuel to temperatures hot enough to ignite.\n\nIn nature, especially in higher latitude forests, fires help maintain a healthy forest ecosystem by releasing important nutrients into the soil and aiding seed dispersal.\n\nIn tropical forests, local and indigenous communities have used fire for ages to clear land for agriculture.\n\nCauses of forest fires\nNatural causes like lightning can set fires on trees which may be spread by wind. Sometimes, High atmospheric temperatures and dryness (low humidity) offer favorable circumstances for a fire to start.\nMan-made causes are usually the ones that become dangerous. Fire is caused when a source of fire like naked flame, cigarette, electric spark, or any source of ignition comes into contact with inflammable material.\nOther human-led causes are land clearing and other agricultural activities, maintenance of grasslands for livestock management, extraction of non-wood forest products, industrial development, resettlement, hunting, negligence, and arson.\nTypes of forest fires\n\nThere are three basic types of fires:\n\nCrown fires\nThis type burn trees up their entire length to the top.\nThey burn through the canopy, spreading from treetop to treetop.\nThese are the most intense and dangerous forest fires as they are very difficult to contain.\nIt needs strong winds, steep slopes, and a heavy fuel load to continue burning.\nSurface fires\nThey burn only surface litter like dried leaves, twigs, and grasses.\nThese are the easiest fires to put out and cause the least damage to the forest.\nParched grass or fallen leaves often fuel\u00a0surface fires.\nGround fires\nThese are sometimes called underground or subsurface fires.\nThey occur in deep accumulations of humus, peat, and similar dead vegetation that become dry enough to burn.\nThese fires move very slowly but can become difficult to fully put out, or suppress.\nGround fires can smolder for a long time, even an entire season, until conditions are right for them to grow to a surface or crown fire.\nUnderground fires spread slowly and are hard to detect, hence they may burn for months destroying the vegetative cover of soil.\nConsequences of Wildfires\nWildfires emit billions of tonnes of carbon dioxide into the atmosphere which causes harm to climate and living organisms.\nThis can also impact the carbon cycle due to excess CO2 and loss of vegetation.\nHigh-intensity forest fires destroy flora and fauna.\nWildfires can impact the economy as many families and communities depend on the forest for food, fodder, and fuel.\nIt burns down the small shrubs and grasses, leading to landslides and soil erosion.\nIt can change the microclimate of the area with unhealthy living conditions\nExcessive forest fires can also add to the ozone layer depletion process.\nForest fires in India\n\nIndia has also witnessed several episodes of wildfires in recent times very recently Himachal Pradesh and Uttarakhand have had major wildfire breakouts.\n\nAssam, Madhya Pradesh, Maharashtra, Tripura, Mizoram, and Odisha also report frequent forest fires annually.\n\nMizoram has had the highest number of wildfire incidences in the last two decades, with more than 95% of its districts being forest fire hotspots.\n\nIn the Indian context, the causes of fire are a combination of natural and manmade-\n\nNatural causes such as lightning or rubbing of dry bamboo with each other can sometimes result in fires, but forest officials maintain that almost all forest fires can be attributed to human factors.\nSetting up a temporary hearth to cook food by the herdsman and minor forest produce gatherer may leave behind a smoldering fire which can develop into a forest fire.\nAlso, when people\u00a0burn their fields to clear them of stubble, dry grass or undergrowth, the fire sometimes spreads to the adjoining forest.\nA spark can also be produced when dry pine needles or leaves fall on\u00a0an electric pole.\nMitigation measures by the government\n\nThe incidence of forest fires in the country is on the increase and more area is razed each year. The major cause of this failure is the slow and gradual approach to the problem.\n\nBoth the national focus and the technical resources required for sustaining a systematic forest fire management program are lacking in the country.\n\nImportant forest fire management elements like strategic fire centers, coordination among Ministries, funding, human resource development, fire research, fire management, and extension programs are missing.\n\nTaking into consideration the serious nature of the problem, it is necessary to make some major improvements in the forest fire management strategy for the country.\n\nThe Ministry of Environment, Forests, and Climate Change has prepared a National Master Plan for Forest Fire Control. The Forest Survey of India (FSI) monitors the incidence of wildfires.\n\nThis plan proposes to introduce a well-coordinated and integrated fire management program that includes the following components:\n\nPrevention of human-caused fires through education and environmental modification. It will include silvicultural activities, engineering works, people participation, and education and enforcement.\nIt is proposed that more emphasis be given to people\u2019s participation through Joint Forest Fire Management for fire prevention.\nPrompt detection of fires through a well-coordinated network of observation points, efficient ground patrolling, and communication networks.\nRemote sensing technology is to be given due importance in fire detection.\nFor successful fire management and administration, a National Fire Danger Rating System (NFDRS) and Fire Forecasting System are to be developed in the country.\nFast initial attack measures and vigorous follow-up action.\nIntroducing a forest fuel modification system at strategic points.\nEnsuring the availability of Fire fighting resources\nGlobal news on Forest fires\nIn France, Greece, Portugal, and Spain, blazes destroy thousands of hectares of land.\nIt is the second heatwave engulfing parts of southwest Europe in weeks. Scientists blame climate change and predict more frequent and intense episodes of extreme weather such as heatwaves and drought.\nRelated posts\nFire Safety in India\nIndustrial and chemical disasters"
