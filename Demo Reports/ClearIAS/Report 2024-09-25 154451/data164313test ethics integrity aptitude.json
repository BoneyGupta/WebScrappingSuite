UPSC calls this paper General Studies Paper IV, and it deals with not only ethics but also integrity, attitude, aptitude and so many other important qualities expected from a civil servant.\n\nWhat is mentioned in the Syllabus for UPSC CSE General Studies Paper IV?\n\nGeneral Studies 4 Paper\u00a0Syllabus\u00a0for\u00a0UPSC\u00a0Civil Services Mains Exam consists of the below major areas: Ethics, Integrity, and Aptitude.\n\nThis paper will include questions to test the candidates\u2019 attitude and approach to issues relating to integrity, probity in public life and his problem-solving approach to various issues and conflicts faced by him in dealing with society. Questions may utilise the case study approach to determine these aspects.\n\nSo, what are the qualities that will be tested in this paper?\nAttitude to issues relating to integrity, probity in public life.\nApproach\u00a0to issues relating to integrity, probity in public life.\nProblem-Solving Approach to various issues and conflict faced by him in dealing with society.\nDoes it ring any bell?\n\nUsing this paper, UPSC is trying to find your problem-solving approach. That\u2019s their priority.\n\nApart from that, they will also check your ethics, integrity, aptitude, attitude, and your general understanding of the associated philosophies.\n\nProblem Solving Approach of Future Civil Servants \u2013 Yes, UPSC Focus on That!\n\nThe primary purpose of this paper is to check if the aspirants have the right problem-solving approach if they are put in the shoes of officers. For this, UPSC uses case-studies as well as the other types of questions.\n\n\ud83d\udc49 Which year are YOU targeting for success in the IAS/IPS/IFS Exam? \ud83d\ude80\n\n(1) \u21d2 UPSC 2025: Prelims cum Mains\n\n(2) \u21d2 UPSC 2026: Prelims cum Mains\n\n(3) \u21d2 UPSC 2027 Prelims cum Mains\n\nTip: Know more about ClearIAS Courses (Online/Offline)\n\nFor example, in 2014 UPSC asked about your problem-solving approach for issues connected with Migration (Question Number 14). You may note that this has nothing to do with your ethics, but UPSC is focusing on your problem-solving approach to issues around you.\n\nQn) In our country, the migration of rural people to towns and cities is increasing drastically. This is causing serious problems both in the rural as well as in the urban areas. In fact, things are becoming really unmanageable. Can you analyze this problem in detail and indicate not only the socio-economic but also the emotional and attitudinal factors responsible for this problem? Also, distinctly bring out why \u2013 (a)\u00a0educated youth are trying to shift to urban areas (b)\u00a0landless poor people are migrating to urban slums (c)\u00a0even some farmers are selling off the, land and trying to settle in urban areas taking , petty jobs.\nWhat feasible steps can you suggest which will be effective in controlling this serious problem of our country? (250 words)\u00a0(20 M)\n\nAttitude \u2013 The Next Important Item\n\nApart from questions which check your problem-solving approach, you can also expect questions which check your attitude. For instance, UPSC may check your attitude by asking a case-study which evaluates if you OK with corruption or NOT. Or it can be a direct question about changing the attitudes of people around you. Consider the question from 2016 UPSC Mains.\n\nQn) Our attitudes towards life, work, other people and society are generally shaped unconsciously by the family and the social surroundings in which we grow up. Some of these unconsciously acquired attitudes and values are often undesirable in the citizens of a modern democratic and egalitarian society. (a) Discuss such undesirable values prevalent in Today\u2019s educated Indians (b) How can such undesirable attitudes be changed and socio-ethical values considered necessary in public services be cultivated in the aspiring and serving civil servants? (150 words)\u00a0 10 marks\n\nAptitude \u2013 Do you have the right taste and talent?\n\nEveryone cannot be a Sachin Tendulkar. Or a Lata Mangeshkar. It\u2019s their taste and talent in the right field which sets them apart.\n\nDo you have the talent to be recognized as a brilliant IAS or IPS officer?\n\nIf yes, UPSC Civil Service Exam is for you. And this is the paper which checks your aptitude for Civil Services.\n\nConsider the question from UPSC CSE Mains 2015.\n\nQn) There is a disaster-prone state having frequent landslides, forest fires, cloudbursts, flash floods and earthquakes, etc. Some of these are seasonal and often unpredictable. The magnitude of the disaster is always unanticipated. During one of the seasons, a cloudburst caused devastating floods and landslides leading to high casualties. There was major damage to infrastructure like roads, bridges and power generating units. This led to more than 100000 pilgrims, tourist and other locals trapped across different routes and locations. The people trapped in your area of responsibility includes senior citizens, patients in hospitals, women and children, hiker, tourist, ruling parties, regional presidents along with his family, additional chief secretary of the neighboring state and prisoners in jail.\n\nAs a civil services officer of the state, what would be the order in which you would rescue these people and why? Give Justifications \u00a0(20 Marks) (200 Words)\n\nAnd finally, Ethics paper is also about Ethics as well\u2026Did we mention the Ethical Dilemma?\n\nThere will be a number of questions which check the ethics, probity, and integrity of aspirants. Particularly in the days when corruption is no longer a news, this is expected.\n\nTo deal with questions on ethics, you should understand the concepts of ethics first (including the difference between ethics and morals). Learn the different dimensions of ethics from the ClearIAS infographics. Human values are also an important topic, so, know the difference between ethics and values.\n\nConsider this questions from UPSC Mains 2016.\n\nQn) Explain how ethics contributes to social and human well-being. (150 words) 10 marks (b) Why should impartiality and non-partisanship be considered as foundational values in public services, especially in the present day socio-political context? Illustrate your answer with examples. (150 words)\u00a010 marks\n\nAlso, very often, an angle of Ethical Dilemma is included in the case studies in the GS Paper IV. Situations will be presented where there will be a conflict of interest. Here, in your problem-solving approach, the additional angle of Ethics should be included.\n\nIn the case of questions on Ethical Dilemma, try to come up with out of box thinking. Be innovative and different. This will help you score high marks.\n\nNo\u2026not over\u2026You need to add Philosophy!\nImage Credit \u2013 PictureQuotes.com\n\nYou need to prepare a little bit about prominent philosophers, leaders, and able administrators around. Otherwise, you would find it difficult to answer questions like the ones below.\n\n\u201cMax Weber said that it is not wise to apply to the public administration the sort of moral and ethical norms we apply to matters of personal conscience. It is important to realize that the state bureaucracy might possess its own independent bureaucratic morality.\u201d Critically analyze this statement. (150 words) 10 marks. \u2013 UPSC CSE Mains, 2016\n\nHow Should a candidate prepare for Ethics Paper? Should You prepare at all?\n\nGood question.\n\nYes, you should prepare.\n\nYou might be able to spontaneously answer a few questions if you have good creative thinking. But this may not be the case with every question.\n\nAs with every other thing, experience and practice help in this paper.\n\nAnd, believe me, Ethics can be taught \ud83d\ude42\n\nAs you now have clearly understood what exactly UPSC expect from a candidate, it\u2019s time to polish your \u2013\n\n(1) Problem Solving Approach\n(2) Attitude\n(3) Aptitude\n(4) Ethics and Integrity\n(5) Core Philosophies.\n\nStart from the basics.\n\nBuild your concepts.\n\nAnd then move on to case studies.\n\nMake sure you follow the notes and study materials on Ethics available on ClearIAS.com.\n\nGive Ethics Paper (Ethics, Integrity, and Aptitude Paper) it\u2019s the due credit!\n\nYou can ignore this paper only at your own peril!\n\nRather if you put the right kind of effort in this paper, you will be surprised at the results!\n\nIf you have a creative blend of mind, good language command, great speed of writing \u2013 the sky is the limit. There are aspirants who scored 140+ marks (out of 250) for this paper!\n\nTreat Ethics as a Subject in IAS Mains GS but focus on the Application Part and on NOT the Theory (too much)\n\nYes, this is how you should treat ethics for IAS Mains \u2013 treat it as a subject. Just like History, Geography or Polity, consider Ethics as a separate subject with more or less a definite syllabus.\n\nEthics as a subject has its roots in Philosophy, Psychology, Sociology and Public Administration. But the difference of Ethics in UPSC perspective is that \u2013 rather than concentrating on the theory part, you should focus on the application part \u2013 ie problem-solving approach.\n\nRemember that the requirement of UPSC is not to mug too many things for this paper \u2013 unlike the agenda propagated by many coaching institutes. UPSC does expect candidates to write a technical answer to ethics paper, as this paper is part of General Studies.\n\nA fresh writing style, clear thinking and wide reading are what you need to score high in ethics paper.\n\nConventional rote learning will not turn fruitful here.\n\nWhat one needs is awareness about himself/herself.\n\nDevote time for preparation and reading; that will make you better equipped\n\nLet\u2019s re-emphasize the requirement:\n\n\u201cThis paper will include questions to test the candidates\u2019 attitude and approach to issues relating to integrity, probity in public life and his problem-solving approach to various issues and conflicts faced by him in dealing with society. Questions may utilize the case study approach to determine these aspects.\u201d\n\nOriginal Thinking and Personal Examples are Better than Anything Else\n\nIt\u2019s easy to score very high marks in ethics if you get the idea of cracking this paper (explained above).\n\nUse personal examples, rather than the cliched examples you get from textbooks.\n\nBe original and simple.\n\nEthics, Integrity and Aptitude Paper Syllabus \u2013 Made Simple\nEthics and Human Interface: This is one area where you can expect theory questions covering the basics of ethics, human values and lessons from the life of great leaders.\nAttitude: Your attitude in relation to thought and behaviour.\nAptitude: Checks whether you have an aptitude for Civil Services.\nEmotional Intelligence: A crucial mental quality, don\u2019t confuse with IQ.\nThe contribution of moral thinkers and philosophers:\u00a0See the relationship of the ethics paper with Philosophy and Sociology.\nEthics in Public Administration: This is one major area where you can expect a lot of quality questions covering topics like Corporate Governance, Rules, Laws, Conflicts etc.\nProbity in Governance: RTI and related matters.\nClearIAS Ethics Course for UPSC CSE (Video Course)\n\nFor those seeking a quicker path to mastering Ethics, Integrity, and Aptitude through video instruction, ClearIAS offers a top-rated course.\n\nTo delve into the specifics of the ClearIAS Ethics Course designed for UPSC CSE, click here to learn more.\n\nBy enrolling in the ClearIAS Ethics Video Course, you\u2019ll easily grasp the fundamental concepts, philosophical underpinnings, and the optimal approach to tackling case studies.\n\nBooks to Prepare Ethics, Integrity, and Aptitude\n\nThough the entire problem-solving approach, attitude, and ethics cannot be learned from textbooks, they can really help.

As ethics is not a conventional area taught in most schools/ colleges, it is quite natural from the candidate\u2019s point of view to ponder about the questions to be asked from the same. But there is no need to panic and if properly handled, this area is really high scoring.\n\nIn fact,\u00a0UPSC used to check the decision making and problem-solving approach of candidates, much before the introduction of Ethics Paper in Mains. The Decision Making/Interpersonal Skills section seen at the last pages of Prelims CSAT Paper 2 (2011-2013), was to check the Ethics, Integrity, and Aptitude angle of Civil Services Aspirants. Now as a dedicated paper in Mains, GS Paper IV has much wider dimensions.\n\nA candidates attitude and approach is the focus area here \u2013 and you should always remember this."

This might involve participating in peaceful protests, engaging in acts of civil disobedience, or finding other ways to resist and draw attention to the injustice, despite the potential legal repercussions or societal disapproval.\n\nEthics vs Morals\n\nMany people use the words Ethics and Morality interchangeably. However, there is a difference between Ethics and Morals.\n\nAspect\tEthics\tMorals\n1\tDefinition: Ethics are the rules of human conduct recognized in a particular group, society, culture, etc.\tDefinition: Morals are principles on which one\u2019s judgments of right and wrong are based.\n2\tSource: Usually stems from external sources such as society, culture, religion, or profession.\tSource: Derived from an individual\u2019s personal beliefs, values, and principles.\n3\tFlexibility: Can be more flexible and adaptable to various situations.\tFlexibility: Tend to be consistent and unchanging over time for an individual.\n4\tScope: Often applies to groups or societies.\tScope: Generally applies to individuals.\n5\tExamples: Professional ethics in medicine dictate a standard of conduct for doctors.\tExamples: A person\u2019s morals might lead them to believe it is wrong to lie, regardless of the situation.\n6\tWho enforces: Often enforced by an external body or authority, such as professional organizations or laws.\tWho enforces: Enforced by personal conscience and reflection.\n7\tWhether Objective or Subjective: More objective, aiming for a common ground among members of the society or group.\tWhether Objective or Subjective: More subjective, varying significantly from one person to another based on personal belief systems.\n8\tWhether Public or Private: Public \u2013 Ethics are more visible and discussed within the context of society and specific groups.\tWhether Public or Private: Private \u2013 Morals are more about personal internal beliefs.\nThe individual may not be always right. Society too!\n\nEven though an individual may have their own personal belief systems, it may not be always right.\n\nIt may not be good for the society as a whole as well.\n\nSimilarly, even though Ethics is based on the collective reasoning of a group, that too may not be always right.\n\nA group can also go wrong.\n\nHowever, as Ethics involves the collective reasoning of a large group of people, Ethics can be said to be comparatively reliable and time-tested.\n\nHaving said that even within the scope of Ethics, personal decision-making is still needed to solve various ethical dilemmas.\n\nEthical Case Study: Confidentiality in Medical Ethics\n\nLet\u2019s take a special case connected with Confidentiality in Medical Ethics.\n\nSituation:\n\nA doctor treats a patient who has a condition that, while not immediately life-threatening, could potentially endanger the patient\u2019s family members if it is genetic.\n\nThe patient insists that this information remains confidential and not shared with their family.\n\nEthical Principle:\n\nThe principle of confidentiality in medical ethics dictates that information between a patient and a physician should be kept private, respecting the patient\u2019s autonomy and trust.\n\nHowever, this principle may conflict with the ethical obligation to prevent harm to others (non-maleficence) if the patient\u2019s condition poses a significant risk to family members.\n\nEthical Decision-Making:\n\nIn this case, there is a conflict of two ethical principles in action \u2013 (1) confidentiality in medical ethics and (2) avoiding harm to others.\n\nIn this scenario, the doctor must navigate the ethical dilemma by weighing the importance of maintaining patient confidentiality against the potential harm that might come to others if the condition is not disclosed.\n\nThis decision-making process would involve considering the severity of the potential harm, the likelihood of the harm occurring, and the patient\u2019s autonomy and wishes.\n\nOutcome:\n\nThe ethical course of action would vary depending on specific circumstances, such as the nature of the condition, the laws and guidelines governing patient confidentiality, and the availability of preventive measures for at-risk family members.\n\nThe doctor might seek guidance from ethical frameworks provided by medical ethics committees or professional guidelines, which could suggest a path that balances respect for patient confidentiality with the duty to prevent harm to others.\n\nThis example demonstrates how ethical principles are applied in complex, real-world situations, requiring professionals to navigate dilemmas where competing ethical values must be balanced to make justifiable decisions.\n\nLet\u2019s focus our attention towards ethics!\n\nAs I said before, morals are connected with personal belief systems about what is right or wrong.\n\nEven though it may be right and relevant, we are more bothered about the established principles and values of right and wrong of a larger group by a larger group for a larger group.\n\nExamples \u2013 Ethical standards for media persons, lawyers, doctors, civil servants, politicians etc.\n\nEthical Case Study: The Duty to the Public in Civil Service Ethics\n\nLet\u2019s try to solve another case study. This involves a whistleblower\u2019s dilemma connected with Civil Service Ethics.\n\nBackground:\n\nA civil servant named Alex works in a government agency responsible for environmental regulation.\n\nAlex uncovers evidence that a major corporation, which is a significant contributor to local employment and economic growth, has been secretly violating environmental laws by dumping toxic waste into a nearby river.\n\nThese actions pose a serious risk to public health and the environment but have been overlooked by some of Alex\u2019s superiors, possibly due to the corporation\u2019s influence and the economic benefits it brings to the region.\n\nContradictory Ethical Principles:\n\nDuty to the Public: As a civil servant, Alex has an ethical obligation to protect public interests, including health and environmental safety.\nLoyalty to the Organization: Alex is also expected to be loyal to their agency, which includes following internal protocols for reporting issues and not bringing negative attention to the organization or jeopardizing its relations with important stakeholders.\n\nThe Ethical Dilemma: Alex faces a dilemma between reporting the corporation\u2019s illegal activities, thereby protecting public health and the environment (duty to the public), and adhering to organizational loyalty by handling the matter internally, which has so far led to inaction and might continue to do so.\n\nSteps to Solve the Ethical Dilemma:\n\nGather Comprehensive Evidence: Alex ensures they have collected undeniable evidence of illegal activities and the potential harm to the public and environment.\nConsult Internal Policies and Legal Advisement: Before taking further action, Alex reviews the agency\u2019s policies on reporting misconduct and seeks advice from the legal department to understand the implications of whistleblowing, both for themselves and the organization.\nAttempt Internal Resolution: Alex tries to address the issue through internal channels, presenting the evidence to higher-ups not previously involved in the oversight, to give the organization a chance to correct the issue internally.\nEvaluate the Response: If the agency takes decisive action to investigate and mitigate the corporation\u2019s environmental violations, Alex\u2019s ethical dilemma might be resolved internally. However, if the response is inadequate or dismissive, Alex must reassess their options.\nExternal Whistleblowing (if necessary): Should internal efforts fail, Alex considers external whistleblowing as a last resort. This involves reporting the violations to external authorities, like environmental watchdogs or the media, understanding the potential risks to their career but prioritizing the duty to the public.\nSeek Protection and Support: If whistleblowing externally, Alex ensures to utilize legal protections for whistleblowers, seeking support from organizations that protect individuals in such situations.\n\nReflection:\n\nThis case study highlights the complex nature of ethical dilemmas faced by civil servants, who must often navigate between competing loyalties to their organization and their duty to the public.\n\nSolving such dilemmas requires a careful balancing of ethical principles, a thorough assessment of the potential impacts of different actions, and a commitment to acting in the best interest of the broader community.\n\nEthics = Moral Principles (Values) + Reasoning.\n\nTo put it in simple terms, Ethics = Moral Principles (Values) + Reasoning.\n\nTo have an ethical viewpoint, you should be able to give some reason for it. Yes, Ethics is Moral Philosophy, and Philosophy is all about reasoning \ud83d\ude42\n\nFor example, you might feel that it is wrong to steal, but have you ever thought about why it is wrong to steal?\n\nIf you have an ethical or moral viewpoint on it, it should be based on some sets of arguments and analysis about why it would be wrong to steal.\n\nEthics and Morals \u2013 An Analogy with a Car Driver and an Automobile Engineer\n\nLet\u2019s take the case of a car driver and an automobile engineer. The car driver knows how to drive a car, but he may not know the engine mechanism or design principles. However, an automobile engineer is concerned with how the car works, and the principles involved.\n\nConnecting the above example with ethics and morals, you can see that following something mechanically (blindly) is just like driving a car without understanding the working principles of the engine. But if you follow ethical or moral principles \u2013 you would be using reasoning and analysis (just like the automobile engineer in the above example) to understand the situation/case better. If the engine starts to create trouble, the engineer may be able to use the problem-solving approach as well.\n\nEthics and Human Interface \u2013 Topics Covered:\nEssence, determinants and consequences of Ethics in human actions\nDimensions of ethics\nEthics in private and public relationships\nEssence, determinants and consequences of Ethics in human actions\n\nEthics is all about reasoning about how one should act in a given circumstance \u2013 ie. how to do the right action.\n\nEssence of Ethics\n\nEthics is the study of morality. The essence of Ethics (the core of ethics) is to understand those philosophies which guide us in determining what is right or wrong.\n\nDeterminants of Ethics\n\nDeterminants are the sources from which the ethical standard arises. There are multiple determinants of ethics like\n\nReligion\nLaw\nSociety\nIndividual\nKnowledge\nTime\nConsequences of Ethics\n\nA consequence is the outcome of any act. Doing good with proper reasoning (being ethical) has many positive consequences like\n\nSafeguarding the society.\nFeeling good.\nCreating credibility.\nSatisfying basic human needs etc.\n\nHowever, being unethical has many negative consequences like\n\nLoss of trust.\nNepotism.\nCorruption.\nCrimes etc.\n\nRead more:\u00a0Essence, determinants and consequences of Ethics in human actions\n\nDimensions of Ethics\n\nEthics is not just a theoretical science, it has a lot of applications in day-to-day life. Being multi-dimensional in nature, ethics is divided into four main branches. They are:\n\nMeta-Ethics\u00a0(Ethics about Ethics)\nPrescriptive Ethics (Normative Ethics)\nDescriptive Ethics (Comparative Ethics)\nApplied Ethics.\n\nWe will see the different branches of ethics in detail, in the next post \u2013 Dimensions of Ethics.\n\nEthics in Private and Public relationships\n\nIndividuals should be ethical in both private and public relationships. In doing so, they should also try to achieve the right balance between private and public ethics.\n\nEthics in Private Relationships\n\nPrivate relationships largely involve relations with family and friends and hence are informal in nature. Private relationships are often driven by emotions and not by reasoning. This can result in unethical practices.\n\nFor example, helping your friend to cheat in an exam (unethical). Also, remember the Ramayana story where Kaikeyi tried to put her son Bharata on the throne, ahead of Rama \u2013 the elder son of Dasharatha (unethical).\n\nEthics in Public Relationships\n\nPublic relationships involve relations which are formal in nature. This can include co-workers, government officials, or strangers. There can be legal or social obligations as well.\n\nEthics in public relations can come into play at:\n\nSocial Ethics \u2013 tolerance towards other sections, peace and harmony etc.\nPolitical Ethics\u00a0 \u2013 constitutional ethics, national interest etc.\nOrganisational Ethics \u2013 impartiality, honesty, hard work, efficiency, corporate governance etc.\nInternational Ethics \u2013 ethics in diplomacy, respecting international treaties etc.\n\nRead more:\u00a0Ethics in Private and Public Relationships\n\nClearIAS Ethics Course for UPSC CSE (Video Course)\n\nIf your goal is to expedite your learning of Ethics, Integrity, and Aptitude through a video course, ClearIAS offers a highly popular course tailored for this purpose.\n\nTo gain deeper insights into the ClearIAS Ethics Course designed for UPSC CSE, click here for more details.\n\nBy enrolling in the ClearIAS Ethics Video Course, you can effortlessly grasp the principles, philosophical aspects, and effective strategies for tackling case studies."

            "[CONTENT]": "What are Human Values? What are the lessons from the lives and teachings of great leaders, reformers and administrators? Read to know more.\n\nValues\u00a0can be defined as those things that are valued by someone.\n\nIn other words, values are what is considered \u2018important\u2018 by an individual or\u00a0an organization.

That motivates people to act one way or another. \u201cEqual rights for all\u201d, \u201cMerit above all else\u201d, \u201cDignity of labour\u201d etc are representatives of values.\n\nValues have a major influence on a person\u2019s behaviour and attitude.\n\n\ud83d\udc49 Which year are YOU targeting for success in the IAS/IPS/IFS Exam? \ud83d\ude80\n\n(1) \u21d2 UPSC 2025: Prelims cum Mains\n\n(2) \u21d2 UPSC 2026: Prelims cum Mains\n\n(3) \u21d2 UPSC 2027 Prelims cum Mains\n\nTip: Know more about ClearIAS Courses (Online/Offline)\n\nValues (What is Important?) vs Ethics (What is Right?)\n\nValues determine what is important.\n\nEthics determine what is right.\n\nValues are ideals of someone (or a group) about what is good or bad (or desirable or undesirable).\n\nEthics is all about reasoning how to do the right action. (Don\u2019t miss our article on the dimensions of ethics)\n\nValues motivate, while morals and ethics constrain.\n\nThe conflict between Values and Ethics\n\nGenerally, people are predisposed to adopt the values that they are raised with. People also tend to believe that those values are \u201cright\u201d because they are the values of their particular culture.\n\nFor example, if making money is a value cherished by a society (most societies cherish that value!), and if the society is not that bothered about how that money is made, that can lead to unethical practices.\n\nEthical decision-making often involves weighing values against each other and choosing which values to elevate.\n\nA conflict between Values: Value \u2018A\u2019 vs Value \u2018B\u2019\n\nConflicts can also result when people have different values, leading to a clash of preferences and priorities.\n\nCan you think of an example?\n\nWhat if a person values honesty as his core ideal, while the other person values efficiency as the priority? Is there a chance of conflict?\n\nHuman Values vary among Individuals and Cultures, and Time\n\nJust like morals, values also vary among individuals and across cultures and time.\n\nFor example, for some people, their nation\u2019s flag may represent a sacred value. But for others, the flag may just be a piece of cloth.\n\nTypes of Human Values\n\nWe know that honesty, goodness, humility etc are values. They form a group of values called Moral Values.\n\nThere are other types of values as well \u2013 like Intelligence, Beauty, Power etc. Let\u2019s look at the type of human values.\n\n1. Moral Values\nMoral values are concerned with the principles of right and wrong.\nThey serve as the backbone of societal norms and ethics, guiding individuals in making decisions that are not just beneficial to themselves but also considerate of others.\nHonesty, integrity, kindness, and empathy fall under this category.\nMoral values are rated highest among all natural values.\nThese values encourage us to act ethically and responsibly, fostering trust and cooperation within communities.\n2. Social Values\nSocial values emphasize the importance of relationships and social harmony.\nThey include respect, tolerance, and compassion towards others.\nThese values underpin the importance of community and collective well-being over individual success.\nIn a world marked by diversity, social values help bridge differences, promoting peace and mutual understanding among people of various backgrounds.\n3. Cultural Values\nCultural values are shaped by the traditions, customs, and history of a community.\nThey reflect the identity and heritage of a society, including its language, art, and rituals.\nValues such as respect for elders, the significance of family, and the celebration of festivals are examples.\nCultural values are crucial for preserving a community\u2019s uniqueness and fostering a sense of belonging among its members.\n4. Spiritual Values\nSpiritual values explore the meaning and purpose of life beyond the material world.\nThey involve values like faith, inner peace, and enlightenment.\nThese values encourage individuals to connect with their inner selves and the universe, seeking harmony and understanding beyond physical existence.\nSpiritual values can lead to personal growth and fulfilment, often promoting compassion and empathy towards others.\n5. Personal Values\nPersonal values are individual beliefs that dictate how we conduct our lives.\nThey include ambition, courage, independence, and curiosity.\nThese values are subjective and vary greatly among individuals, shaping personal goals, preferences, and behaviours.\nPersonal values are essential for self-identity and autonomy, encouraging us to pursue our passions and live authentically.\n6. Professional Values\nProfessional values guide behaviour in the workplace and contribute to career success.\nThey include dedication, responsibility, innovation, and teamwork.\nThese values are crucial for creating a productive and positive work environment, fostering professional growth, and achieving organizational goals.\nPersonal Values vs Social Values\n\nPersonal Values \u2013 Important for Individual well-being. Examples of personal values \u2013 are self-respect, a comfortable life, freedom etc.\n\nSocial Values \u2013 Important for other people\u2019s well-being. Examples of social values \u2013 equality, social justice, national security, world peace etc.\n\nNote: A coordinated and balanced pursuit of both self-serving and other serving values will lead to a positive and fulfilling life.\n\nLessons from the lives and teachings of great leaders, reformers and administrators\n\nWe are fortunate to have many great leaders, reformers, and administrators who cherished noble values and ethics. They not only lived an ethical life but also taught\u00a0many human values.\n\nLet\u2019s have a quick look at the lessons from the lives of eminent persons. We shall deal with each of them in detail in the next posts.\n\nMahatma Gandhi:\u00a0What he valued \u2013 Simplicity, Minimalism, Satyagraha, Sarvodaya, Secularism, Ahimsa, Non-Violence, Truth, Forgiveness, Self-Sufficiency, Dignity of labour etc.\nJawaharlal Nehru: What he valued \u2013 democracy, institution building, consensus building, socialism, secularism, self-determination, internationalism etc.\nNelson Mandela: What he valued \u2013 service, dignity, self-belief, equality of the human race, freedom, fairness, justice,\u00a0 etc.\nAbraham Lincoln:\u00a0What he valued \u2013 humanism, equality of the human race, integrity, idealism, honesty, freedom etc.\nMartin Luther King Jr:\u00a0What he valued \u2013 self-belief, equality of the human race etc.\nRaja Rammohan Roy:\u00a0What he valued \u2013 social equality, equality of the human race, women empowerment, scientific thinking etc.\nSwami Vivekananda:\u00a0What he valued \u2013 self-belief, equality of the human race, patriotism, compassion etc.\nB R Ambedkar: What he valued \u2013 self-belief, equality of the human race, radical thinking, compassion etc.\nMother Teresa \u2013 What she valued \u2013 compassion, altruism, helpfulness, kindness, cleanliness, determination.\nVerghese Kurien \u2013\u00a0What he valued \u2013 self-belief, cooperative societies, entrepreneurship, innovation, farmer welfare etc.\nM.S. Swaminathan \u2013\u00a0What he valued \u2013 sustainable development, green revolution, poverty alleviation, farmer welfare etc.\nSam Pitroda \u2013\u00a0What he valued \u2013 self-belief, dreaming big, entrepreneurship, policy-making, innovation etc.\nE. Sreedharan:\u00a0What he valued \u2013 punctuality, self-belief, integrity, high-quality standards etc.\nExamples of Human Values from the lives and teachings of great leaders, reformers and administrators\n\nThroughout history, great leaders, reformers, and administrators have not only embodied human values but also imparted timeless lessons through their lives and teachings.\n\n1. Mahatma Gandhi: The Epitome of Non-violence and Integrity\n\nMahatma Gandhi\u2019s life is a testament to the power of non-violence and the pursuit of truth.\n\nHis principle of \u2018Ahimsa\u2019 (non-violence) was not just a strategy for political struggle but a universal value for human conduct.\n\nGandhi\u2019s commitment to living a life of simplicity and integrity underscores the importance of personal values in the quest for social and political change.\n\nHis famous adage, \u201cBe the change you wish to see in the world,\u201d urges us to embody the values we advocate for, emphasizing that true change begins with oneself.\n\n2. Nelson Mandela: Resilience and the Spirit of Forgiveness\n\nNelson Mandela\u2019s remarkable journey from a 27-year-long imprisonment to becoming the President of South Africa and a Nobel Peace Prize laureate exemplifies resilience and the spirit of forgiveness.\n\nMandela showed the world that holding onto bitterness and resentment holds us back, while forgiveness, even towards one\u2019s oppressors, can liberate a nation.\n\nHis leadership teaches us the value of reconciliation over vengeance, highlighting the strength required to forgive and the profound impact it can have on healing divided societies.\n\n3. Mother Teresa: Compassion in Action\n\nMother Teresa\u2019s life was a living embodiment of compassion and selfless service.\n\nShe dedicated her life to helping the poorest of the poor, seeing the face of God in everyone she served.\n\nHer work with the sick, the dying, and the destitute in the slums of Kolkata (Calcutta) was driven by profound love and empathy.\n\nMother Teresa believed that small acts of love and kindness could create ripples of change, teaching us that compassion is not merely feeling but action.\n\n4. Martin Luther King Jr.: The Dream of Equality and Justice\n\nDr. Martin Luther King Jr., a pivotal figure in the American civil rights movement, championed equality, justice, and the dignity of all human beings.\n\nHis eloquent speeches and non-violent protests against racial discrimination and segregation marked significant milestones in the fight for civil rights in the United States.\n\nKing\u2019s vision of a society where people are judged by the content of their character rather than the color of their skin remains a powerful call for fairness and unity in diversity.\n\n5. Abraham Lincoln: Leadership and the Pursuit of Freedom\n\nAs the 16th President of the United States, Abraham Lincoln led his country through its Civil War\u2014its bloodiest war and its greatest moral, constitutional, and political crisis.\n\nIn doing so, he preserved the Union, abolished slavery, strengthened the federal government, and modernized the U.S. economy.\n\nLincoln\u2019s leadership during one of the most tumultuous periods in American history exemplifies the values of resilience, justice, and commitment to the principles of democracy and freedom.\n\n6. Malala Yousafzai: The Courage to Advocate for Education\n\nMalala Yousafzai, a Pakistani activist for female education and the youngest Nobel Prize laureate embodies courage and the relentless pursuit of education for all.\n\nSurviving an assassination attempt by the Taliban, Malala didn\u2019t let fear deter her advocacy.\n\nHer steadfast commitment to education rights, especially for girls in regions where access to education is restricted, underscores the power of voice and courage against oppression.\n\nMalala\u2019s story teaches us the value of resilience and the right to education.\n\n7. Rosa Parks: The Strength of Quiet Determination\n\nRosa Parks is known for her pivotal role in the Montgomery Bus Boycott, which became a landmark event in the civil rights movement.\n\nBy refusing to give up her seat to a white passenger on a segregated bus, Parks demonstrated the strength of quiet determination and peaceful protest.\n\nHer actions showed that standing up for one\u2019s rights and dignity often requires courage in the face of injustice and that individual acts of defiance can spark significant social change.\n\n8. Confucius: The Importance of Ethics and Moral Rectitude\n\nThe teachings of Confucius, a Chinese philosopher and educator, have profoundly influenced East Asian thought and life.\n\nConfucius espoused values such as respect for elders, filial piety, benevolence, and the importance of ethics and moral rectitude in personal and public life.\n\nHis concept of \u2018Ren\u2019 (\u4ec1), often translated as humaneness or benevolence, promotes the idea that being virtuous is essential to a harmonious society.\n\nConfucius\u2019 emphasis on moral education and the cultivation of character continues to resonate today.\n\n9. Albert Einstein: Curiosity and the Pursuit of Knowledge\n\nAlbert Einstein, one of the most celebrated physicists in history, exemplified the values of curiosity and the relentless pursuit of knowledge.\n\nEinstein\u2019s contributions to science, including the theory of relativity, have not only advanced our understanding of the universe but also highlighted the importance of questioning and exploring the mysteries of the world.\n\nHis life reminds us that intellectual curiosity and the pursuit of understanding are fundamental to human progress.\n\nRole of Family, Society and Educational institutions in inculcating Values\n\nNow, we are living in an age where people don\u2019t have the right values or ethics. Family, society, and educational institutions can play a great role in inculcating values to the new generation.\n\nRole of Family in inculcating values\n\nThe family is the earliest and without question the most influential agent of socialization.\u00a0Socialization via the family goes from cradle to grave.\u00a0The father, mother, siblings, and grandparents become the immediate agents of socialization.\n\nChildren pick up behavioural traits from all those who are in his/her immediate environment.\u00a0Values are imbibed by children by observing what parents do (and not just what parents say).\n\nThe power of the family is strongest during infancy and toddler years. During the teenage, the influence of peer groups and media usually overshadows the power of the family. However, the family returns as a predominant agent of socialization during the adult years with the roles of marital partner and parents becoming prominent.\n\nThere can be differences in values between family to family based on their socio-economic statuses.\n\nRole of Educational Institutions in inculcating values\n\nSchools and Colleges are important agencies in the process of socialization and thus can help a lot in inculcating values.\n\nSchool is the first place where individual values get compared with the larger value system of society.\nThe curriculum imparts the values of accepted behaviour.\nA school student learns not only from the official curriculum but also from the social curriculum of peer groups. Values are also imbibed from the hidden curriculum (Eg: don\u2019t talk while a teacher is taking the class).\nThis is the place where one learns the values of punctuality and discipline.\nValues education is an explicit attempt to teach about values. There are five basic approaches to values education: inculcation, moral development, analysis, action learning, and values clarification.\nRole of Society in inculcating values\n\nSociety can also inculcate a lot of values in people. The elements of society that have a great influence on people include:\n\nFriends\nNeighbours\nMedia\nFilms\nReligion\nLeaders\nGovernment\nHuman Values: Conclusion\n\nHuman values are integral to the fabric of society, guiding individuals in their daily lives and interactions with others.\n\nValues form the foundation of our decisions, actions, and beliefs, influencing everything from personal development to global relations.\n\nThe lives and teachings of these great figures offer profound lessons on the importance of embodying human values.\n\nThey remind us that integrity, compassion, resilience, forgiveness, and commitment to justice are not just ideals but actionable principles that can guide our actions and influence the world around us.\n\nBy reflecting on these lessons and striving to live by these values, we can aspire to lead lives that not only enrich ourselves but also contribute to the betterment of society."

(Or even your own attitude?)\n\nYes.\n\nDue to the influence of society, we all develop positive, negative, and neutral attitudes towards many things. (Eg: I hate XYZ religion). If our negative or neutral attitude is undesirable in modern society, it should be changed to a positive attitude.\n\nThere are various techniques for changing a person\u2019s attitude. Yes, that\u2019s the beauty of this subject \ud83d\ude42\n\nWe shall deal with each of them in detail.\n\nAttitude: content, structure, and function\n\nAttitudes are often the result of social influence, experience or upbringing. Attitudes have a powerful influence over behaviour.\u00a0While attitudes are enduring, they can change, resulting in a change in behaviour as well.\n\nFor example \u2013 Only if the citizens of a country have a positive attitude towards cleanliness, campaigns such as Swatch Bharat Mission (Clean India Mission) will succeed. Here, by various campaigns (advertisements), the government is trying to change the attitude of citizens, and hence to stop their behaviour of throwing wastes in public, open-defecation etc.\n\nAttitude \u2013 Content\n\nCarl Jung, one of the founders of psychoanalysis, is of the opinion that the contents of the conscious and unconscious\u00a0part of the mind are usually different. Accordingly, attitudes are classified as explicit and implicit.\n\nExplicit Attitude (Conscious) \u2013 If a person is aware of his attitudes and how they influence his behaviour, then those attitudes are explicit. Explicit attitudes are formed consciously.\n\nImplicit Attitude (Sub-Conscious) \u2013 If a person is unaware of his attitudes (beliefs) and how they influence his behaviour, then those attitudes are implicit. Implicit attitudes are formed subconsciously.\n\nAttitude \u2013 Structure\n\nHow are attitudes formed? Let\u2019s say, for example, you like Honda cars. So you have a positive attitude towards Honda cars. How is this attitude formed?\n\nComponents of Attitude\n\nAs per experts, three components \u2013 learning, emotions, and past behaviour \u2013 come together, and on the basis of it, we form an attitude.\n\nThis multi-component model is known as the ABC Model or CAB Model. Let\u2019s see the components of the CAB model.\n\nCognitive Component \u2013 This involves the person\u2019s learning, knowledge, beliefs, and thoughts about the attitude-object (in our case, Honda cars). For example, if you have learned previously that Honda cars give more than 20 km/litre mileage on petrol \u2013 that can create a positive attitude towards the brand.\nAffective Component \u2013 This involves a person\u2019s feelings, emotions about the attitude object. For example, if owning a Honda car gives you pleasure and prestige, that will create a positive attitude about the brand.\nBehavioural Component\u00a0(Conative Component) \u2013 This involves the past behaviours or experiences regarding the attitude object. For example, if you have previously owned or driven Honda cars and felt comfortable driving the same, that will create a positive attitude towards the brand. People hate cognitive dissonance, and hence try to align the present behaviour with past behaviour as well.\n\nThus, in short, to change an attitude you need to touch all components of that attitude ie. Cognitive, Affective, and Behavioural.\n\nDimensions of Attitude: (1) Strength of Attitude\n\nSome attitudes are strong while some attitudes are weak.\u00a0The strength with which an attitude is held is often a good predictor of behaviour. The stronger the attitude the more likely it should affect behaviour.\n\nFor example, consider that Muthu from Tamil Nadu as well as Rahul from Uttar Pradesh like the Tamil Film Actor Rajnikanth. However, the strength of the positive attitude of Muthu may be very high (10/10 if rated on a scale). Rahul, even though likes Rajnikanth, his positive attitude\u2019s strength may not match the strength of the attitude of Muthu (6/10, if rated on a scale).\n\nThe very strong attitude of Muthu may get directly expressed in his behaviour in the form of hero-worship, intolerance of any negative comments, an extreme expression of emotions etc. However, even though\u00a0Rahul has a positive attitude towards the Film actor, as his attitude is not as strong as Muthu, he may not exhibit strong behaviour as Muthu.\n\nDimensions of Attitude: (2) Accessibility of Attitude\n\nThe accessibility of an attitude refers to the ease with which it comes to mind. In general, highly accessible attitudes tend to be stronger.\n\nDimensions of Attitude: (3) Attitude ambivalence\n\nThe ambivalence of an attitude refers to the ratio of positive and negative evaluations that make up that attitude. The ambivalence of an attitude increases as the positive and negative evaluations get more and more equal.\n\nOne dimensional view of attitude vs Two-dimensional view of the attitude\n\nThe one-dimensional view\u00a0\u2013 It postulates that the positive and negative elements are stored at opposite ends of a single dimension.\u00a0according to this one-dimensional perspective, the positive and negative elements are at opposite ends of a single dimension, and people tend to experience either end of the dimension or a location in between.\n\nThe two-dimensional view\u00a0\u2013 It postulates that positive and negative elements are stored along two separate dimensions.\u00a0If this view is correct, then people can possess any combination of positivity or negativity in their attitudes.\n\nAttitude \u2013 Functions\n\nAttitudes are important because they can guide thought, behaviour, and feelings. If you hold some attitudes, it might be useful to you. Attitudes help to mediate between a person\u2019s internal needs (Eg: self-expression) and the external environment. Thus, attitude helps people to achieve their basic goals.\n\nDaniel Katz classified attitudes into different groups based on their functions\n\nKnowledge function: knowing one\u2019s or other\u2019s attitude imparts knowledge.\nEgo-defensive function: attitudes can help people protect their self-esteem and avoid depression.\nEgo-expressive function: used to express one\u2019s core values or beliefs.\nInstrumental function: helps to choose what is rewarding (and also avoid punishment).\nSocial Acceptance function: adapt to the socially approved attitudes of a larger group.\n\nNow let\u2019s take a look at each of these functions in detail.\n\n1. Knowledge Function\n\nAs we discussed in the beginning, attitude is all about what a person likes or dislikes.\n\nKnowing a person\u2019s attitude helps us predict their behaviour. For example, knowing that a person is religious we can predict they will go to Church.\n\nAttitude thus allows us to\u00a0predict\u00a0what is likely to happen, and so gives us a sense of control. Attitudes can help us organize and structure our experience.\n\nThe knowledge function refers to our need for a world which is consistent and relatively stable.\u00a0In short, attitudes serves the function of providing meaning (knowledge) for life.\n\n2. Ego-defensive Function\n\nNot everyone can do everything. This is the truth.\n\nHowever, attitude (like/dislike), can mask this truth to protect your ego.\n\nFor example, you may not be able to play football like Messi. However, instead of accepting this truth, to protect your self-esteem you can say that you don\u2019t like football, and you are interested only in intellectual activities \ud83d\ude42\n\nPositive attitudes towards ourselves, just like the example above, have a protective function (i.e. an ego-defensive role) in helping us preserve our self-image. Otherwise, we might fall into depression.\n\n3. Ego Expressive Function (Value Expressive/Self Expressive)\n\nThe attitudes we express (what we like or dislike) helps to express who we are, what are our basic values, and what we stand for. This (1) help\u00a0communicate\u00a0who we are and (2) may make us feel good because we have asserted our identity.\u00a0 Self-expression of attitudes can be non-verbal too.\n\nTherefore, our attitudes are part of our identity.\n\n4. Instrumental Function (Utilitarian)\n\nPeople develop positive attitudes towards objects associated with rewards, and negative attitudes towards those associated with punishments.\n\nFor example, as tax-evasion attracts punishments, a person may not favour evading taxes, and start paying taxes properly.\n\nNote: Any attitude that is adopted in a person\u2019s own self-interest is considered to serve a utilitarian function.\n\n5. Social Acceptance Function (Identity/Adaptive)\n\nIf a person holds or expresses socially acceptable attitudes, other people will reward them with approval and\u00a0social acceptance.\n\nFor example, the decoration of the house with Diwali lights.\n\nAdaptive functions help us fit in with a social group. People seek out others who share their attitudes and develop similar attitudes to those they like.\n\nAttitude\u2019s Influence and Relation with Thought and Behaviour\n\nWe tend to assume that people behave according to their attitudes. However, social psychologists have found that attitudes and actual behaviour are not always perfectly aligned.\n\nCase 1 \u2013 Attitude \u2260 Behaviour\n\nFor example, take the case of elections. Plenty of people may support a particular candidate, but they may not take the pain to go out and vote for him, despite their names being there on the electoral roll.\n\nThere is another famous example in relation to this. It is connected with the prejudice (negative attitude) Americans once had against the Chinese.\n\nHere it is:\n\nIn the days when Americans were said to be prejudiced against the Chinese, Richard LaPierre, an American social\u00a0psychologist, conducted the following study.\n\nHe asked a Chinese couple to travel across the United States, and stay in different hotels. They were all given accommodation by the different hotels (there was only one instance during these occasions they were refused service by one of the hotels).\n\nSometime later, LaPierre sent out questionnaires to managers of hotels and tourist homes in the same areas where the Chinese couple had travelled, asking them if they would give accommodation to Chinese guests.\n\nA very large percentage (91%) said that they would not do so.\n\nThis response showed a negative attitude towards the Chinese, which was inconsistent with the positive behaviour that was actually shown towards the travelling Chinese couple.\n\nThus, attitudes may not always predict the actual pattern of one\u2019s behaviour. To be more precise, LaPierre\u2019s study shows that the cognitive and affective components of attitudes (e.g. disliking Chinese people) do not necessarily coincide with behaviour (e.g. serving them).\n\nCase 2 \u2013 Behaviour \u2260 Attitude\n\nBehavioural component (remember the CAB model) is generally the most visible component of our attitude. However, some people can hide the same. We have seen that in the American/Chinese case study example (above). Here a negative attitude was masked by people to show positive behaviour.\n\nThere can also be instances where a negative behaviour to co-exist with a positive attitude. This occurs usually when the positive attitude is not strong enough. For example, consider a person with a positive attitude of not to jump queues. However, when he sees everyone around him does the same, he may think he will lose, if not jump queues. Thus he may behave opposite to his original attitude \u2013 which we can call as weak positive.\n\nCase 3 \u2013\u00a0Attitude = Behaviour\n\nPsychologists have found that there would be consistency between attitudes and behaviour when:\n\nthe attitude is strong, and it occupies a central place in the attitude system.\nthe person is aware of her/his attitude.\nthere is very little or no external pressure on the person to behave in a particular way. For example, when there is no group pressure to follow a particular norm.\nthe person\u2019s behaviour is not being watched or evaluated by others.\nthe person thinks that the behaviour would have a positive consequence, and therefore, intends to engage in that behaviour.\n\nNote: Persons with high integrity usually show a direct relation between attitude and behaviour.\n\nCase 4 \u2013\u00a0Behaviour = Attitude\n\nPeople dislike Cognitive Dissonance. Cognitive dissonance\u00a0is a phenomenon in which a person experiences psychological distress due to conflicting thoughts or beliefs. In order to reduce this tension, people may change their attitudes to reflect their other beliefs or actual behaviours.\n\nThis means they prefer their attitude and behaviour to be aligned in the same direction. By giving incentives to behave contrary to the attitude,\u00a0Leon Festinger and James Carlsmith (study in 1954), proved that the first attitude can be changed to suit their external behaviour.\n\nHow can you change one\u2019s attitude (or your attitude)?\n\nAttitude change occurs anytime an attitude is modified. Thus, change occurs when a person goes from being positive to negative, from slightly positive to very positive, or from having no attitude to having one. The various theories that can be used include:\n\nLearning Theory of Attitude Change:\u00a0Classical conditioning, operant conditioning, and observational learning can be used to bring about attitude change.\n\n(1) Classical conditioning \u2013 create positive emotional reactions to an object, person, or event by associating positive feelings with the target object.\n\n(2) Operant conditioning \u2013 strengthen desirable attitudes and weaken undesirable ones.\n\n(3) Observational learning \u2013 let people observe the behaviour of others so that they change their attitude.\n\nElaboration Likelihood Theory of Attitude Change (The theory of persuasion):\u00a0This theory of\u00a0persuasion\u00a0suggests that people can alter their attitudes in two ways.\n\nFirst, they can be motivated to listen and think about the message, thus leading to an attitude shift.\n\nOr, they might be influenced by the characteristics of the speaker, leading to a temporary or surface shift in attitude. Messages that are thought-provoking and that appeal to logic are more likely to lead to permanent changes in attitudes.\n\nDissonance Theory of Attitude Change:\n\nAs mentioned earlier, people can also change their attitudes when they have conflicting beliefs about a topic (cognitive dissonance). In order to reduce the tension created by these incompatible beliefs, people often shift their attitudes. In the earlier example, the dissonance was created by giving an incentive to change the behaviour, and thus attitude was also changed accordingly.\n\nMoral and Political Attitudes\n\nMoral Attitudes are attitudes of individuals towards moral issues, while political attitudes are attitudes of individuals towards political issues. We shall see them in detail.\n\nMoral Attitude\n\nAttitude is about what you like, and morals are about (what society thinks as) right or wrong. So Moral Attitude is the attitude you hold towards moral issues (where society debates what is right or wrong).\n\nFor example \u2013 what is your attitude towards Euthanasia (mercy killing)? Do you think of it as right?\n\nThere are a lot of moral issues currently \u2013 reproductive cloning, surrogate motherhood, abortion, sex selection, pornography, prostitution, dance bars, euthanasia, capital punishment, homosexuality, live-in relationships, incest, divorce, honour killing, consumerism, owning personal weapons, gambling, prohibition etc being some of them. Your attitude towards these issues comes under the broad category of a moral attitude. (Don\u2019t miss our ethics notes \u2013 go to the dimensions of ethics, in where we deal with Applied ethics).\n\nPolitical Attitude\n\nPolitical attitude is the attitude you hold towards political issues or ideologies. For example, what is your view of the reservation? It is time that India should stop giving reservations? Your attitude towards reservation is a political attitude.\n\nLet\u2019s take another example. What is your view on Communism? Do you like the ideology of Communism? Do you prefer the concept of no-state and market control? Or do you prefer a free market?\n\nCan you think of some other examples of political issues or ideologies?\n\nAttitude towards patriotism, democracy, plebiscite, reservation for women, eunuchs, equality, secularism, socialism, communism, scheduled castes and other minorities in politics, communalism, ideals of transparency and accountability, corruption, voting, political parties etc. comes under the broad umbrella of political attitude.\n\nAlso, your attitude towards the basic politic spectrum \u2013 left or right \u2013 comes under your political attitude.\n\nSocial influence and persuasion\n\nThe study of social influence phenomena lies at the very heart of social psychology. Persuasion is one form of social influence. We shall discuss these topics in detail, as a separate post later. It\u2019s quite interesting to know how society influences us. Now let\u2019s focus on the key concepts.\n\nSocial Influence\n\nSocial influence refers to the ways people influence the attitudes, values, beliefs, feelings, and behaviours of others.\u00a0Each day we are bombarded by countless attempts by others to influence us.\n\nConsider our daily exposure to radio and television commercials, newspaper ads, direct requests, influence attempts by salespersons, politicians, and so forth.\n\nTheorists have broadly classified the social influence into three forms \u2013 conformity, compliance, and obedience. The key difference between them is as below.\n\nConformity \u2013 Behavior change in response to real or imagined social pressure.\nCompliance \u2013\u00a0 Behavior change in response to an explicit request to perform some action.\nObedience \u2013\u00a0Behavior change in response to an Extreme pressure demand to perform some action.\n\nSocial influence varies according to how much pressure is involved. Imitation involves no pressure, conformity involves peer pressure, compliance involves an explicit request to perform some behaviour, and obedience is a response to a direct order to perform some action.\n\nIn other words, Imitation is the behaviour change in the absence of social pressure. The pressure for a behavioural change increases from Conformity \u2192 Obedience. Obedience the most direct form of social influence, Conformity is the most indirect form of social influence; compliance is in-between the two.\n\nSocial Persuasion\n\nPersuasion refers to an active attempt to change another person\u2019s attitudes, beliefs, or feelings, usually via some form of communication.\u00a0Typically, persuasion is treated as a form distinct from that of the other three forms of social influence. As you can rightly guess, it is more related to conformity and compliance.\n\nPersuasion is an active form of influence and is internal in its focus. Change in people\u2019s beliefs or feelings is the goal of such influence.\n\nSystematic persuasion is the process through which attitudes or beliefs are leveraged by appeals to logic and reason. Heuristic persuasion, on the other hand, is the process through which attitudes or beliefs are leveraged by appeals to habit or emotion.\n\nTo sum up:\nAttitude is your view or belief about what you like or dislike.\nYou may note that attitude always comes with positive or negative emotion.\nAttitude has 3 components \u2013 cognitive, affective, and behavioural.\nThe affective (emotional) component may even overcome negative cognitive rationales (if any).\nIt\u2019s good to have positive attitudes \u2013 and it serves many functions.\nAttitude is internal while the behaviour is external.\nAttitudes and actual behaviour are not always perfectly aligned.\nIt is possible to change the attitude and thus behaviour.\nThe theories of learning, persuasion, or dissonance can be used to bring an attitudinal or behavioural change.\nSocial Influence and Persuasion can change the attitude or behaviour of people."

And what is there which still needs to be done? These are some of the questions we will be dealing with in the article.\n\nLet us understand it by a simple example.\n\nTwo friends Chiku and Meeku after completing their school decided to take admission to college. While chiku took subjects of his own choice, Meeku was forced to take the subjects that his father chose for him. Because the subject was not of his interest, despite being a topper in his school, Meeku was doing bad in college and his marks started decreasing. Then Meeku decided to change the subjects of his own choice and now he started getting good grades again and became one of the highest scorers.\n\nThe above example shows the importance of Aptitude.\n\nTable of Contents\n\nWhat is Aptitude?\nNature and characteristics of Aptitude\nTypes of Aptitude\nChanging nature of Aptitude\nImportance of Aptitude in Civil Services\nThe aptitude of a Civil Servant\nCriticism against Aptitude\nWhat is Aptitude?\n\nNote: Subscribe to the ClearIAS YouTube Channel to learn more.\n\n\ud83d\udc49 Which year are YOU targeting for success in the IAS/IPS/IFS Exam? \ud83d\ude80\n\n(1) \u21d2 UPSC 2025: Prelims cum Mains\n\n(2) \u21d2 UPSC 2026: Prelims cum Mains\n\n(3) \u21d2 UPSC 2027 Prelims cum Mains\n\nTip: Know more about ClearIAS Courses (Online/Offline)\n\nIt is an innate set of characteristics of an individual\u2019s ability to acquire adequate training with some knowledge base and a set of skills. It is a unique combination of abilities that predisposes a person to do better than another and increase his chances of success.\n\nIt is a present condition that is indicative of an individual\u2019s potential for the future.\n\nFor example, having an aptitude to understand melody and beats is a basic requirement to become a musician.\n\nAptitude deals with the ability to perform work and the capability and compassion required for it. For example, to be a civil servant you should have the basic knowledge to clear the civil services exam, can work hard, and have the desire to become a civil servant and serve the nation.\n\nNature and characteristics of Aptitude\n\nIt is a broad concept that means that aptitude embraces any concept and characteristics which contributes to intelligence, learning, achievement, personality, skills, interest, and so on.\n\nIt is a result of various combinations of factors and the interaction of heredity and environment. An individual is born with certain potentials. And after that the environment he interacts with helps or sometimes hinders these potentials. For example, you might have an inclination toward mathematics but this might not reflect in the future.\n\nIt predicts future ability and potential. When you say someone is good in academics it means that he will be successful in the future in academic activities as he is having scholastic aptitude.\n\nAptitude indicates the fitness of an individual for doing a particular task or work. For example, if a person doesn\u2019t have leadership qualities and does not have the aptitude of leading others, he might not become a good politician.\n\nAptitude is a quality that cannot be harnessed even after proper training. For example, if a person cannot differentiate between a pitch, tone, or rhythm that person will find it difficult to become a musician even after proper training.\n\nAptitude is not a proper or a concrete object or ability, it is an abstract noun that expresses a specific quality in the total personality of a person.\n\nTypes of Aptitude\n\nThere are different varieties of skills based on aptitude such as fast comprehension of situations, fast thinking, mathematical skills, and so on. These abilities are considered largely inborn. For example in India bowlers are largely medium.\n\nAptitude is significant for individuals as well as society as there are different aptitudes in different people which benefits human resource development and social needs all types and varieties of aptitude\u2013 doctors, engineers, clerks, civil servants, and so on.\n\nChanging nature of Aptitude\n\nTraditionally aptitude was considered more related to knowledge skills, intelligence, and so on. However, with changing society and enhancement of ideas like ethics, emotional intelligence, analyzing the behaviors of different people, administrators on one hand and changing aims of governance, on the other hand, the concept of holistic competence has emerged that is being propagated by the DoPT (Department of Personnel and Training) in their training manual on values and administration.\n\nCivil services are now not related to knowledge and skills only, but also values and ethics so that they can withstand even difficult situations.\n\nImportance of Aptitude in Civil Services\n\nIt is required to maintain the standards of civil services. As the civil services form the permanent structure and the backbone of the administrative system, a qualitative, professional, skilled workforce is a necessity.\n\nIn India, a civil servant is entrusted with a diverse set of responsibilities and hence it becomes very important for a civil servant to possess such diverse skills.\n\nThe administrators have to face different kinds of problems and challenges in their day-to-day life. They cannot rely on the traditional approaches when the environment in which they are dealing has changed now as every problem has new effects. In such situations, a civil servant needs to make spontaneous decisions and have critical thinking ability.\n\nThe new concept of e-governance with the aim of less government and more governance, demands transformational changes in the government machinery as well as the working style of the government. The civil servant must have the ability to adapt to new technologies and new styles and become the agents of change.\n\nIn a country like India civil servants need to know how to face complex and contrasting socio-economic dilemmas and challenges resulting in a deep sense of moral and ethical dilemmas. This demands aptitude to prevail over these contradictions and solve them.\n\nThe aptitude of a Civil Servant\n\nCriticism against Aptitude\n\nFew people argue that it is a complex task and very difficult to differentiate between what is the correct potential. Aptitude depends on the individual\u2019s social and cultural experiences. It thus is different for different people such as their upbringing, education, the environment they were brought up in, and so on.\n\nAptitude at best predicts the probability of performance or success. There is never a certainty that the prediction necessarily will result in a good performance as there are also other factors involved which contribute to success.\n\nWith the technological advancements and changing job descriptions, the requirements are also changing and new types of jobs are evolving making the task of aptitude more difficult.\n\nDue to the increasing demands and needs of society, there appears to be a gap between the aptitude held by civil servants and the aptitude desired for the services. This is one major factor in which India is not able to regulate, administer and progress with the global standards. Although the government is trying to overcome such gaps by lateral entry, consulting services, contracts, etc. these don\u2019t offer effective solutions unless aptitude as expertise comes from within, which demands structural, procedural, and behavioral reforms in civil services, be it recruitment, training or increasing the role of specialist and professional expertise.\n\nArticle written by Chetna Yadav."

Why is it needed? What is its significance for civil servants? To answer these questions, read further.\n\nEmotional intelligence is about the emotions of humans which should be regulated so that there is socially desirable behaviour.\n\nFormally, it is about knowing one\u2019s own emotions and understanding others\u2019 emotions, and behaving in a socially desirable way by regulating the emotions.\n\nIt is about emotional, social, and behavioural competency that a person is behaviourally competent in different social conditions.\n\nTable of Contents\n\nDefinition of Emotion Intelligence\nAbility model by Mayer and Salovey\nGoleman\u2019s Model\nEmotional Intelligence at an individual level\nEmotional intelligence for a civil servant\nNeed for Emotional Intelligence\nDefinition of Emotion Intelligence\n\nEmotion Intelligence has been defined by Peter Salovey and John Mayor as the ability to monitor one\u2019s own emotions and others\u2019 emotions to discriminate between the different emotions and label them appropriately and use them to guide critical thinking and behaviour. The amount and level of emotional intelligence in a person are known as the emotional quotient.\n\nThere is a difference between Classic Intelligence and Emotional Intelligence. Classic intelligence can be defined as what is measured by IQ tests. These tests are about the skills which are required to analyze and solve problems. However, implementing the solution requires emotional intelligence. Classical intelligence alone is not enough to produce consistent results. Intelligent actions are now a result of both emotions as well as reasoning. Emotional intelligence is about being intelligent about your emotions. IQ gets you hired whereas EQ gets you promoted.\n\n\ud83d\udc49 Which year are YOU targeting for success in the IAS/IPS/IFS Exam? \ud83d\ude80\n\n(1) \u21d2 UPSC 2025: Prelims cum Mains\n\n(2) \u21d2 UPSC 2026: Prelims cum Mains\n\n(3) \u21d2 UPSC 2027 Prelims cum Mains\n\nTip: Know more about ClearIAS Courses (Online/Offline)\n\nFor example, Suppose you are an SP handling a mob lynching situation in your district. Some of your men get injured while doing their duty. As you do not have orders from above you and your team are not left with many options. Here you would need emotional intelligence to handle the situation.\n\nEmotional Intelligence can be identified in people based on positive and negative characteristics of their behaviour, whether good or bad or high or low EI.\n\nAbility model by Mayer and Salovey\n\nEmotional perception: It is the ability to recognize emotional cues and help a person to gauge and understand problems through the application of emotions better. For example, if a person is sad he will show signs of discontent and underperformance at work.\n\nEmotional Reasoning: It is the ability to use emotions for application in thinking and organizing activities. For example, the policies of the government are enacted after proper reasoning and belief and taking the needs of every section of society into consideration.\n\nUnderstanding the emotions: It is important to understand the emotions of others and consider them as the causal factor. For example, understand that if your senior is angry at you, it may be because his mood is not good today or he might not is satisfied with his performance.\n\nManagement of emotions: It is important to manage emotions and show flexibility and optimism in the approach while dealing with situations.\n\nGoleman\u2019s Model\n\nEmotional Intelligence at an individual level\n\nIn today\u2019s world when everything is so fast and it is very easy to be excited and overwhelmed by professional duties which can affect mental health, thus emotional intelligence becomes important to prevent such situations and have a positive outlook. For example, it can help in dealing with anxiety and depression and keeping a negative outlook away.\n\nIt helps in creating a suitable work-life balance which is the need of the hour in this busy world with regard to professional and personal responsibilities. For example, time management will help in giving ample time to hobbies and family apart from the busy office schedule.\n\nThis helps in inculcating stronger relationships as it allows us to communicate more effectively and forge stronger relationships both at work and in our personal life. For example, taking emotional cues can help in better understanding colleagues and dealing with them with sensitivity.\n\nThere is a positive effect of emotional intelligence on the success of individuals at work and will help in better job performance. For example, a more motivated person will work efficiently without excuses, fatigue, and disinterest.\n\nEmotional intelligence for a civil servant\n\nAn administrator is expected to resolve conflicts more efficiently. For example, if there is a riot in his district, he will be able to understand the people\u2019s emotions and use law and order, he will also try to pacify people by using emotional intelligence.\n\nAn emotionally intelligent civil servant doesn\u2019t take anything personally while discharging his duties. For example, an administrator while doing his duties sometimes gets hurt with insults too and an emotionally intelligent administrator will associate it with professional obligation and will depersonalize with it.\n\nThe administrator needs to be empathetic while discharging their duties. For example, when a disabled person was unable to sit on a chair, IAS Kaustubh himself sat on the floor with him.\n\nIt helps in managing difficult situations while discharging duties during hard times. For example, during floods, an administrator has to take care of various things from managing the flood-affected areas to the people involved in it along with the proper care provided, such as temporary homes.\n\nIt helps an administrator to be true to the fundamental values and abide by the core values\u00a0even in difficult situations. For example, IAS Ashok Khemka exposed irregularities in the DLF group even after immense political pressure and bureaucratic harassment.\n\nRead: Utilities and application of Emotional Intelligence in administration and governance\n\nNeed for Emotional Intelligence\n\nAristotle has said that anyone can be angry which is easy but to be angry with the right person at the right time and for the right purpose is not within everyone\u2019s power and is not easy.\n\nWhen our emotional health is in a bad state so is our level of self-confidence and self-esteem. We have to slow down and deal with what is troubling us so that we can enjoy the simple joy of being happy and at peace with ourselves.\n\n\u2013 Jess C. Scott\n\nIt is often said that people don\u2019t care how much you know until they know how much you care. Emotional intelligence enables you to influence yourself first, then influence others, to enable a more stable and productive work environment.\n\nArticle written by Chetna Yadav."

These principles often include concepts such as fairness, justice, integrity, and respect for others.\nIndividual and Collective Morality: Ethics addresses both individual morality, guiding personal conduct, and collective morality, shaping societal norms and expectations.\n\nEthical Frameworks:\n\nDeontological Ethics: Focuses on the inherent nature of actions, emphasizing duty and moral rules.\nConsequentialist Ethics: Evaluates actions based on their outcomes, emphasizing the consequences of choices.\nVirtue Ethics: Centers on the development of virtuous character traits and moral excellence.\n\nRole in Decision-Making:\n\nGuidance in Dilemmas: Ethics provides a framework for decision-making, particularly in moral dilemmas where conflicting values or interests are at play.\nLong-term Consequences: Ethical considerations extend beyond immediate gains, encouraging individuals to reflect on the long-term impact of their choices.\nDeterminants of ethical behaviour\n\nThree main influences determine ethical behaviour and decisions:\n\nA) Individual personality traits: Individual value system, upbringing, education, religious beliefs, experiences, etc.\n\nB) Culture/ country of an individual,\n\nC) Organisation/ industry: prevailing ethics of the organization/industry an individual works for.\n\nEthics in human actions\nHumans are said to be evaluative.\nEthics is said to be a philosophical treatise that studies human behaviour and tries to determine whether the act performed was morally right or wrong.\nIt cannot content itself with registering facts, it attempts to reflect on the meaningfulness or meaninglessness of such facts, establish or reject them on a rational basis, understand their implications, draw relevant consequences, and, above all, intuit their ultimate cause.\nValues\nValues are the individual principles or qualities that guide the judgment and behaviour of a person or a group.\nValues are like an anchor in a ship. When a storm arrives, a ship is not swept away by strong currents but remains anchored to the shore.\nA person with strong values or character sticks to his principles and is not swept away, in crisis or under pressure.\nInculcating values\n\nVarious factors inculcating values are discussed below which are crucial aspects of ethics and human interface:\n\nRole of family\n\nFamily is the first and major agency of socialization that has great influence and bearing on the development of the child.\n\nIt has been shown by various studies that most of the children who are achievers and well-adjusted come from families where sustaining wholesome relationships exist.\n\nRole of society\n\nAdministrative morality is a part and parcel of the general morality of the community.\n\nFiner stated, \u201d The ethics of every profession will be found, on close analysis, to be not much higher and not much lower than the general decency of the nation as a whole.\n\nTheir nature, at best, is powerfully molded by the level of the surrounding and prevailing civilization\u201d.\n\nRole of Educational Institutes\n\nEducation is a process of initiating the learners into a firm of life that is considered desirable to preserve and promote.\n\nEducation involves the transmission of values.\n\nHowever, these changes are to be brought about by employing such procedures so as not to violate the freedom and autonomy of the learner.\n\nRead: Role of family, society, and educational institutions in inculcating values\n\nConsequences of Ethics in Human Actions\n\nTrust and Social Harmony:\n\nBuilding Trust: Ethical behaviour fosters trust among individuals, communities, and institutions, creating a foundation for social harmony.\nReducing Conflict: Ethical actions contribute to conflict resolution and the establishment of peaceful coexistence.\n\nPersonal Integrity and Self-Respect:\n\nPersonal Fulfillment: Acting under ethical principles enhances personal integrity and contributes to a sense of self-respect and fulfilment.\nMoral Identity: Ethical actions shape an individual\u2019s moral identity, influencing how they perceive themselves and are perceived by others.\n\nLegal and Professional Repercussions:\n\nLegal Compliance: Adhering to ethical standards helps avoid legal repercussions and sanctions.\nProfessional Reputation: Ethical behaviour is closely tied to professional reputation, impacting career advancement and success.\n\nSocietal Progress and Well-being:\n\nCollective Benefits: Ethical actions contribute to the overall progress and well-being of society by fostering fairness, justice, and cooperation.\nInnovation and Sustainability: Ethical considerations drive sustainable practices and innovative solutions to societal challenges.\n\nRead more: Essence, Determinants and Consequences of Ethics in Human Actions\n\nEthics and human interface through evolution\n\nThe Evolutionary nature of the human person and his human consciousness has long been recognized in one way or another.\n\nCharles Darwin gave the theory of evolution on a biological basis.\nAn Evolutionary view of the world and humans today is the basis of a great deal of scientific philosophical and theological thinking.\nThe thinking of such human persons as Pierre Teilhard de Chardin and Aurobindo comes spontaneously to mind.\nHerbert Spencer is perhaps the best-known Evolutionary ethicist.\n\nHe starts by observing that both human and animal conduct consists of acts adjusted to ends.\n\nThe higher we proceed in the scale of Evolution the easier it becomes for us to obtain evidence of purposeful actions directed toward the good either of the individual or the species.\nThis purposeful activity forms part of the struggle for existence waged between individual members of the same species or between different species.\n\nAccording to Spencer, this type of conduct is an imperfectly evolved conduct.\n\nIn perfectly evolved conduct which is ethical conduct in the proper sense of the word, this struggle for existence will yield a place for cooperation and mutual help.\nEgoism and altruism will be both transcended.\nThis leads Spencer to distinguish between absolute and relative ethics.\n\nAbsolute ethics is an ideal code of conduct formulating the behavior of a completely adapted human person in a completely evolved society.\n\nRelative ethics is the nearest approximation to this ideal according to the more or less perfectly evolved society in which a human person happens to find him/her.\n\nSpencer adopts the utilitarian ethical principle. He perceives happiness to be the ultimate end of life and measures the rightness or wrongness of actions by their conduciveness to this end.\n\nFrom a nascent state when this utilitarian principle was dependent on non-ethical (e.g. authoritarian) beliefs it gradually developed to become independent and as suggested by the theory of evolution, it will continue to evolve and reach an ideal limit.\n\nConclusion\n\nIn conclusion, ethics is a critical and complex subject that has a significant impact on our daily lives. It is concerned with how we ought to behave and make decisions in a way that is fair, honest, and respectful of others.\n\nEthics in the human interface is not a theoretical abstraction but a guiding force that shapes the character of individuals, communities, and societies. The essence of ethics lies in the principles that guide human actions, the determinants that influence ethical choices, and the profound consequences that result from those choices.\n\nAs individuals navigate the complexities of the human experience, the recognition and application of ethical principles become essential for fostering a just, compassionate, and harmonious world.\n\nArticle written by: Sulochana Anu"

considered right, just, and good.\n\nThis post delves into the essence of ethics, its determinants, and the consequences of ethical conduct in human actions.\n\nWe hope it provides insights into the profound impact ethics has on personal lives, societal norms, and global interactions.\n\nTable of Contents\n\nEssence of Ethics: What exactly is ethics?\n(1) The Nature of Ethical Judgments\n(2)

Social Harmony and Cooperation\n(3) Economic Prosperity\n(4) Environmental Sustainability\n(5) Global Justice and Peace\nEssence of Ethics: What exactly is ethics?\nEthics is about understanding the difference between what is right and wrong and choosing to do what is right.\nIt is a reflection of the values and principles that individuals and societies hold dear.\nAt its heart, ethics is concerned with human well-being, striving to ensure that actions contribute positively to the lives of individuals and the collective society.\nThe essence of ethics lies in its universal appeal to kindness, fairness, responsibility, and respect for others.\nThe essence of ethics transcends mere adherence to societal norms or legal requirements; it embodies the intrinsic human capacity for moral reasoning and the pursuit of the good life.\nEthics is not just about what actions are legally right or wrong, but about what is morally right or wrong.\nIt involves critical thinking about the principles that govern our lives and shape our interactions with others and the world around us.\n\nThis deeper exploration into the essence of ethics reveals its foundational role in human existence, guiding us through the complexities of life with a moral compass that seeks to balance individual freedoms with collective welfare.\n\n(1) The Nature of Ethical Judgments\nEthical judgments are not arbitrary.\nThey are grounded in reasoned argument, reflection on personal and societal values, and consideration of the consequences of our actions.\nUnlike preferences or tastes, ethical judgments can be subject to rational debate and justification.\nThis deliberative aspect of ethics reflects its essence as a domain where reason, emotion, and social interaction converge to guide decisions and actions.\n(2) Autonomy and Responsibility\nAt the heart of ethics lies the principle of autonomy\u2014 the recognition of each individual\u2019s right to make choices and the respect for the capacity of others to determine their course of action.\nHowever, this autonomy is coupled with responsibility; the acknowledgement that our actions have impacts on others and the environment, necessitating consideration of the broader consequences of our decisions.\nThis balance between autonomy and responsibility underscores the ethical commitment to do no harm and to contribute positively to the well-being of others.\n(3) Universal Principles and Contextual Sensitivity\nThe essence of ethics also involves a tension between universal moral principles and the sensitivity to contextual factors.\nPrinciples such as justice, fairness, and respect for human dignity offer a universal framework that transcends cultural and temporal boundaries.\nYet, the application of these principles must be sensitive to the specific contexts of different societies, cultures, and situations, reflecting the nuanced nature of ethical decision-making.\n(4) Ethical Virtues\nEthics is deeply intertwined with the concept of virtue \u2014 qualities of character that predispose individuals to act in morally commendable ways.\nVirtues like courage, temperance, justice, and wisdom are not just abstract ideals but practical attributes that guide individuals in making ethical decisions and leading morally exemplary lives.\nThe cultivation of these virtues is central to the essence of ethics, emphasizing the development of moral character as much as the adherence to moral rules.\n(5) The Quest for Meaning and Fulfillment\nThe essence of ethics is bound up with the human quest for meaning and fulfilment.\nEthical living is not merely about avoiding wrongdoing but about seeking a life that is rich in purpose, value, and connection.\nIt involves striving for a good life in which happiness is achieved through the realization of one\u2019s potential, the cultivation of meaningful relationships, and the contribution to the welfare of the community and the larger world.\n\nIn essence, ethics is a comprehensive framework that encompasses the principles, virtues, and values guiding human conduct.\n\n\ud83d\udc49 Which year are YOU targeting for success in the IAS/IPS/IFS

(Online/Offline)\n\nIt is a reflective practice, a commitment to living according to ideals that dignify human existence and contribute to the flourishing of all.\n\nEthics invites us to consider not only what we do but who we are and what we aspire to become, offering a path toward a more just, compassionate, and fulfilling life.\n\nDeterminants of Ethics: What are the reasons which make someone ethical?\n\nThe fabric of ethics is woven from various threads, each representing a determinant that shapes moral understanding and behaviour.\n\n(1) Cultural Background\nCultural background is a primary determinant of ethics.\nCultures around the world have unique values, traditions, and social norms that influence what is considered ethical behaviour within those societies.\nThese cultural norms shape individuals\u2019 beliefs about fairness, justice, respect, and responsibility from a young age, creating a foundation for ethical reasoning that is deeply influenced by one\u2019s cultural context.\n(2) Personal Values and Morality\nPersonal values and morality serve as internal compasses guiding ethical behaviour.\nThese values are shaped by a combination of factors, including family upbringing, education, religious beliefs, and personal experiences.\nThey reflect what individuals consider important in life, such as honesty, integrity, empathy, and compassion.\nPersonal morality involves the application of these values in decision-making processes, influencing how individuals perceive and respond to ethical dilemmas.\n(3) Education and Intellectual Development\nEducation plays a significant role in shaping ethical perspectives by exposing individuals to diverse ideas, philosophies, and cultures.\nThrough education, people learn to critically analyze ethical issues, consider multiple viewpoints, and develop reasoned arguments.\nIntellectual development fosters an understanding of the complexity of ethical dilemmas and enhances the ability to make well-informed ethical decisions.\n(4) Legal and Professional Standards\nLegal and professional standards provide external frameworks for ethical behaviour.\nLaws and regulations set minimum standards of conduct to ensure fairness, safety, and justice within society.\nSimilarly, professional codes of ethics define the ethical responsibilities of individuals within various professions, promoting integrity, accountability, and excellence.\nAdherence to these standards is often seen as a baseline for ethical conduct, though ethical decision-making can involve considerations beyond legal compliance.\n(5) Social Influences and Peer Pressure\nSocial influences and peer pressure can significantly impact ethical behaviour.\nThe desire for acceptance, approval, and belonging can lead individuals to conform to the ethical norms of their social group, even when those norms conflict with personal values or societal standards.\nSocial media and networking also play a role in shaping ethical perspectives by amplifying certain views and behaviours, which can influence individuals\u2019 perceptions of what is acceptable or desirable.\n(6) Religious Beliefs and Spiritual Traditions\nReligious beliefs and spiritual traditions provide moral guidance and ethical frameworks for many individuals.\nThese beliefs often encompass principles of right and wrong, teachings on virtue and sin, and narratives that illustrate moral lessons.\nWhile the specifics vary across different faiths, religion and spirituality generally aim to guide adherents towards living a life that is aligned with certain ethical ideals and principles.\n(7) Situational Factors\nSituational factors can influence ethical decision-making.\nThe context of a decision, including its potential consequences, risks, and benefits, can affect how individuals evaluate ethical dilemmas.\nFactors such as urgency, pressure, and the perceived impact on others can sway decisions, highlighting the importance of considering the broader context in ethical reasoning.\n\nEthics is shaped by a confluence of determinants, including cultural background, personal values, education, legal standards, social influences, religious beliefs, and situational factors.\n\nUnderstanding these determinants helps individuals navigate ethical dilemmas with greater awareness and sensitivity, fostering ethical conduct that is informed, principled, and responsive to the complexities of human life.\n\nConsequences of Ethics in Human Actions: What happens if someone is ethical?\n\nThe consequences of ethics in human actions extend far beyond the immediate outcomes of individual decisions.\n\nThe consequences of ethical behaviour ripple through every level of society, influencing personal lives, shaping communities, and impacting the global stage.\n\n(1) Personal Integrity and Trust\nEthical behaviour enhances personal integrity and builds trust in relationships.\nWhen individuals act in accordance with ethical principles, such as honesty, fairness, and respect, they establish themselves as reliable and trustworthy.\nThis trust is fundamental to the development of meaningful personal and professional relationships, contributing to a sense of security and cooperation among individuals.\n(2) Social Harmony and Cooperation\nAt the societal level, ethics plays a crucial role in maintaining social harmony and promoting cooperation.\nEthical norms and values guide behaviour in ways that respect the rights and well-being of others, minimizing conflicts and fostering a sense of communal responsibility.\nSocieties that emphasize ethical standards tend to experience higher levels of social trust, cooperation, and stability, which are essential for addressing common challenges and achieving collective goals.\n(3) Economic Prosperity\nEthical conduct in business and economic activities contributes to economic prosperity by establishing a foundation of trust and fairness.\nCompanies that adhere to ethical practices, such as transparency, accountability, and social responsibility, are more likely to attract customers, employees, and investors.\nThis trust enhances the company\u2019s reputation and competitiveness, leading to better business outcomes and contributing to overall economic health.\n(4) Environmental Sustainability\nEthics also has significant implications for environmental sustainability.\nEthical considerations, such as respect for nature and responsibility for future generations, guide actions that protect the environment and promote sustainable use of resources.\nBy prioritizing ethical principles in decision-making, individuals and organizations can contribute to the preservation of ecosystems, the mitigation of climate change, and the promotion of a sustainable future for all.\n(5) Global Justice and Peace\nEthics is pivotal in the pursuit of global justice and peace.\nEthical principles, such as equality, respect for human rights, and non-violence, guide international relations and efforts to address global challenges.\nBy adhering to these principles, nations and global institutions can work together more effectively to resolve conflicts, reduce inequalities, and promote peace and security worldwide.\n\nIn conclusion, the consequences of ethics in human actions are wide-ranging and deeply impactful. Ethical conduct fosters trust, integrity, social harmony, economic prosperity, environmental sustainability, and global justice.\n\nBy emphasizing and practising ethical principles, individuals and societies can create a more just, peaceful, and thriving world for current and future generations."

To be ethical, we must continually work to understand our moral principles and behavior and to make sure that we uphold them in our daily lives.\n\nEthics play a crucial role in both private and public relationships, shaping the behavior, decisions, and interactions of individuals and institutions.\n\nWhile the principles of ethics are applicable across various contexts, the dynamics differ between private relationships, which involve individuals or private entities, and public relationships, which involve interactions within the broader societal and governmental framework.\n\nTable of Contents\n\nEthics in Private Relationships\nPrinciples of Ethics Private Relationships\nSiding with the truth\nBeing Confidential\nBeing Tolerant\nBeing Affectionate\nEthics in Public Relationships\nPrinciples of Ethics in Public Relationships\nSelfness\nIntegrity\nObjectivity\nAccountability\nOpenness\nHonesty\nLeadership\nWhat is the relationship between Ethics in Private and Public relationships?\nConclusion\nEthics in Private Relationships\n\nIt refers to the moral principles that a person adheres to when dealing with others and circumstances in daily life. Relationships with family and friends are a big part of it.\n\nThey are informal since they are built on emotional ties rather than any official mechanism that governs them. Private connections are frequently passed down or inherited.\n\nThey are more forgiving of flaws and relatively permanent.\n\n\ud83d\udc49 Which year are YOU targeting for success in the IAS/IPS/IFS Exam? \ud83d\ude80\n\n(1) \u21d2 UPSC 2025: Prelims cum Mains\n\n(2) \u21d2 UPSC 2026: Prelims cum Mains\n\n(3) \u21d2 UPSC 2027 Prelims cum Mains\n\nTip: Know more about ClearIAS Courses (Online/Offline)\n\nPrivate relationships\u2019 ethics are typically governed by personal qualities, enduring human values, religion, social standards, and the law of the state.\n\nPrivate religious law also regulates ethics in intimate relationships. Since ancient times, individual familial and community commitments have been codified in law and supported by severe penalties, as seen in inheritance, divorce, marriage, and other laws.\n\nReligious institutions, constitutional provisions, and moral norms all control ethical questions in private relationships in India.\n\nPrinciples of Ethics Private Relationships\n\nThe following are the certain principles associated with ethics in private relationships.\n\nSiding with the truth\n\nIn private partnerships, honesty is the first requirement. It enhances the emotional ties in these partnerships and increases the level of mutual trust. For instance, being honest at all times helps one avoid disputes that can result from their purported unusual activity.\n\nBeing Confidential\n\nSecrecy and privacy are of the utmost significance to protect the sacredness of private interactions. For instance, we usually exercise restraint when disclosing secrets about our friends, coworkers, life partners, etc. without getting their consent to avoid upsetting these relationships.\n\nBeing Tolerant\n\nIn private interactions, there will inevitably be a conflict if there are no established rules and regulations because human beings can never attain perfection.\n\nTo make such interactions peaceful and harmonious, one must accept the flaws of others.\n\nBeing Affectionate\n\nAffection and caring shared emotionally transcend all boundaries. This connection is motivated by human emotions rather than by laws or exchanges of favors.\n\nEthics in Public Relationships\n\nIt refers to the moral principles that a person may follow when engaging in conversations and conducting business in their line of work.\n\nRelationships in the public eye exist due to a person\u2019s occupation or position in the workforce.\n\nPrinciples of Ethics in Public Relationships\n\nIn honor of its first Chairman, Lord Nolan, the Committee on Standards in Public Life was occasionally referred to as the Nolan Committee.\n\nThere have been fourteen reports issued so far based on the Nolan Committee\u2019s Seven Principles of Ethical Conduct. The Seven Principles of Public Life were established in the Committee\u2019s First Report. They are\n\nSELFNESS\n\nPeople in positions of power should only operate in the public interest. They shouldn\u2019t do any act to benefit financially or in another way for themselves, their family, or their friends.\n\nINTEGRITY\n\nHolders of public office should avoid putting themselves in any kind of debt to outside parties that might try to use that debt as leverage when it comes to carrying out their official duties.\n\nOBJECTIVITY\n\nHolders of public office should base their decisions on impartial criteria when conducting official business, such as appointing public officials, granting contracts, or suggesting people for prizes and perks.\n\nACCOUNTABILITY\n\nHolders of public office are answerable to the public for their choices and deeds and are required to put up with whatever scrutiny is suitable for their position.\n\nOPENNESS\n\nAll choices and acts that public office holders do should be as transparent as possible. Only when the larger public interest clearly demands should they withhold information and provide justification for their judgments.\n\nHONESTY\n\nHolders of public office are required to disclose any private interests that may conflict with their official responsibilities and to take action to resolve any such conflicts in a way that safeguards the public interest.\n\nLEADERSHIP\n\nPublic officeholders should lead by example and support these values by doing so.\n\nWhat is the relationship between Ethics in Private and Public relationships?\n\nThe distinction between private and public ethics is questionable since we must adhere to the same ethical principles in both our private and public lives. No dichotomous relationship can exist between the two.\n\nEthics applies to both equally because it encourages leading a good life.\n\nIt is quite unlikely that one can expect someone who lacks morals in public to possess them in private and vice versa.\n\nA government servant\u2019s treatment of female coworkers and the existence of gender bias in the rules he implements are directly related to how he treats women in his household.\n\nPublic and professional relations can occasionally develop into personal relationships. As an illustration, consider the teacher-student connection.\n\nSometimes in class, professors utilize personal examples with the students, and the students also discuss their areas of weakness with the teachers so that the latter can assist in the progress. Because of the kind of bond the two have been sharing, the relationship has thus, on some level, become intimate.\n\nConclusion\n\nThere must be no contradiction between ethics in private and public relationships as this may cause some people to feel frustrated, guilty, confused, and disoriented. They each help to strengthen and mold the other.\n\nThey must be compatible with one another to foster personal growth. However, too much congruence can also cause ideas and reforms to stagnate.\n\nFor instance, it will be challenging to bring about socio-cultural changes if no one in public service is reform-minded and congruent with the current society.\n\nClick here to read more on GS-4 notes\n\nArticle Written By: Jis John Sebastian"

(Don\u2019t miss our article on the dimensions of ethics)\n\nValues motivate, while morals and ethics constrain.\n\nThe conflict between Values and Ethics\n\nGenerally, people are predisposed to adopt the values that they are raised with. People also tend to believe that those values are \u201cright\u201d because they are the values of their particular culture.\n\nFor example, if making money is a value cherished by a society (most societies cherish that value!), and if the society is not that bothered about how that money is made, that can lead to unethical practices.\n\nEthical decision-making often involves weighing values against each other and choosing which values to elevate.\n\nA conflict between Values: Value \u2018A\u2019 vs Value \u2018B\u2019\n\nConflicts can also result when people have different values, leading to a clash of preferences and priorities.\n\nCan you think of an example?\n\nWhat if a person values honesty as his core ideal, while the other person values efficiency as the priority? Is there a chance of conflict?\n\nHuman Values vary among Individuals and Cultures, and Time\n\nJust like morals, values also vary among individuals and across cultures and time.\n\nFor example, for some people, their nation\u2019s flag may represent a sacred value. But for others, the flag may just be a piece of cloth.\n\nTypes of Human Values\n\nWe know that honesty, goodness, humility etc are values. They form a group of values called Moral Values.\n\nThere are other types of values as well \u2013 like Intelligence, Beauty, Power etc. Let\u2019s look at the type of human values.\n\n1. Moral Values\nMoral values are concerned with the principles of right and wrong.\nThey serve as the backbone of societal norms and ethics, guiding individuals in making decisions that are not just beneficial to themselves but also considerate of others.\nHonesty, integrity, kindness, and empathy fall under this category.\nMoral values are rated highest among all natural values.\nThese values encourage us to act ethically and responsibly, fostering trust and cooperation within communities.\n2. Social Values\nSocial values emphasize the importance of relationships and social harmony.\nThey include respect, tolerance, and compassion towards others.\nThese values underpin the importance of community and collective well-being over individual success.\nIn a world marked by diversity, social values help bridge differences, promoting peace and mutual understanding among people of various backgrounds.\n3. Cultural Values\nCultural values are shaped by the traditions, customs, and history of a community.\nThey reflect the identity and heritage of a society, including its language, art, and rituals.\nValues such as respect for elders, the significance of family, and the celebration of festivals are examples.\nCultural values are crucial for preserving a community\u2019s uniqueness and fostering a sense of belonging among its members.\n4. Spiritual Values\nSpiritual values explore the meaning and purpose of life beyond the material world.\nThey involve values like faith, inner peace, and enlightenment.\nThese values encourage individuals to connect with their inner selves and the universe, seeking harmony and understanding beyond physical existence.\nSpiritual values can lead to personal growth and fulfilment, often promoting compassion and empathy towards others.\n5. Personal Values\nPersonal values are individual beliefs that dictate how we conduct our lives.\nThey include ambition, courage, independence, and curiosity.\nThese values are subjective and vary greatly among individuals, shaping personal goals, preferences, and behaviours.\nPersonal values are essential for self-identity and autonomy, encouraging us to pursue our passions and live authentically.\n6. Professional Values\nProfessional values guide behaviour in the workplace and contribute to career success.\nThey include dedication, responsibility, innovation, and teamwork.\nThese values are crucial for creating a productive and positive work environment, fostering professional growth, and achieving organizational goals.\nPersonal Values vs Social Values\n\nPersonal Values \u2013 Important for Individual well-being. Examples of personal values \u2013 are self-respect, a comfortable life, freedom etc.\n\nSocial Values \u2013 Important for other people\u2019s well-being. Examples of social values \u2013 equality, social justice, national security, world peace etc.\n\nNote: A coordinated and balanced pursuit of both self-serving and other serving values will lead to a positive and fulfilling life.\n\nLessons from the lives and teachings of great leaders, reformers and administrators\n\nWe are fortunate to have many great leaders, reformers, and administrators who cherished noble values and ethics. They not only lived an ethical life but also taught\u00a0many human values.\n\nLet\u2019s have a quick look at the lessons from the lives of eminent persons. We shall deal with each of them in detail in the next posts.\n\nMahatma Gandhi:\u00a0What he valued \u2013 Simplicity, Minimalism, Satyagraha, Sarvodaya, Secularism, Ahimsa, Non-Violence, Truth, Forgiveness, Self-Sufficiency, Dignity of labour etc.\nJawaharlal Nehru: What he valued \u2013 democracy, institution building, consensus building, socialism, secularism, self-determination, internationalism etc.\nNelson Mandela: What he valued \u2013 service, dignity, self-belief, equality of the human race, freedom, fairness, justice,\u00a0 etc.\nAbraham Lincoln:\u00a0What he valued \u2013 humanism, equality of the human race, integrity, idealism, honesty, freedom etc.\nMartin Luther King Jr:\u00a0What he valued \u2013 self-belief, equality of the human race etc.\nRaja Rammohan Roy:\u00a0What he valued \u2013 social equality, equality of the human race, women empowerment, scientific thinking etc.\nSwami Vivekananda:\u00a0What he valued \u2013 self-belief, equality of the human race, patriotism, compassion etc.\nB R Ambedkar: What he valued \u2013 self-belief, equality of the human race, radical thinking, compassion etc.\nMother Teresa \u2013 What she valued \u2013 compassion, altruism, helpfulness, kindness, cleanliness, determination.\nVerghese Kurien \u2013\u00a0What he valued \u2013 self-belief, cooperative societies, entrepreneurship, innovation, farmer welfare etc.\nM.S.

Sreedharan:\u00a0What he valued \u2013 punctuality, self-belief, integrity, high-quality standards etc.\nExamples of Human Values from the lives and teachings of great leaders, reformers and administrators\n\nThroughout history, great leaders, reformers, and administrators have not only embodied human values but also imparted timeless lessons through their lives and teachings.\n\n1. Mahatma Gandhi: The Epitome of Non-violence and Integrity\n\nMahatma Gandhi\u2019s life is a testament to the power of non-violence and the pursuit of truth.\n\nHis principle of \u2018Ahimsa\u2019 (non-violence) was not just a strategy for political struggle but a universal value for human conduct.\n\nGandhi\u2019s commitment to living a life of simplicity and integrity underscores the importance of personal values in the quest for social and political change.\n\nHis famous adage, \u201cBe the change you wish to see in the world,\u201d urges us to embody the values we advocate for, emphasizing that true change begins with oneself.\n\n2. Nelson Mandela: Resilience and the Spirit of Forgiveness\n\nNelson Mandela\u2019s remarkable journey from a 27-year-long imprisonment to becoming the President of South Africa and a Nobel Peace Prize laureate exemplifies resilience and the spirit of forgiveness.\n\nMandela showed the world that holding onto bitterness and resentment holds us back, while forgiveness, even towards one\u2019s oppressors, can liberate a nation.\n\nHis leadership teaches us the value of reconciliation over vengeance, highlighting the strength required to forgive and the profound impact it can have on healing divided societies.\n\n3. Mother Teresa: Compassion in Action\n\nMother Teresa\u2019s life was a living embodiment of compassion and selfless service.\n\nShe dedicated her life to helping the poorest of the poor, seeing the face of God in everyone she served.\n\nHer work with the sick, the dying, and the destitute in the slums of Kolkata (Calcutta) was driven by profound love and empathy.\n\nMother Teresa believed that small acts of love and kindness could create ripples of change, teaching us that compassion is not merely feeling but action.\n\n4. Martin Luther King Jr.: The Dream of Equality and Justice\n\nDr. Martin Luther King Jr., a pivotal figure in the American civil rights movement, championed equality, justice, and the dignity of all human beings.\n\nHis eloquent speeches and non-violent protests against racial discrimination and segregation marked significant milestones in the fight for civil rights in the United States.\n\nKing\u2019s vision of a society where people are judged by the content of their character rather than the color of their skin remains a powerful call for fairness and unity in diversity.\n\n5. Abraham Lincoln: Leadership and the Pursuit of Freedom\n\nAs the 16th President of the United States, Abraham Lincoln led his country through its Civil War\u2014its bloodiest war and its greatest moral, constitutional, and political crisis.\n\nIn doing so, he preserved the Union, abolished slavery, strengthened the federal government, and modernized the U.S. economy.\n\nLincoln\u2019s leadership during one of the most tumultuous periods in American history exemplifies the values of resilience, justice, and commitment to the principles of democracy and freedom.\n\n6. Malala Yousafzai: The Courage to Advocate for Education\n\nMalala Yousafzai, a Pakistani activist for female education and the youngest Nobel Prize laureate embodies courage and the relentless pursuit of education for all.\n\nSurviving an assassination attempt by the Taliban, Malala didn\u2019t let fear deter her advocacy.\n\nHer steadfast commitment to education rights, especially for girls in regions where access to education is restricted, underscores the power of voice and courage against oppression.\n\nMalala\u2019s story teaches us the value of resilience and the right to education.\n\n7. Rosa Parks: The Strength of Quiet Determination\n\nRosa Parks is known for her pivotal role in the Montgomery Bus Boycott, which became a landmark event in the civil rights movement.\n\nBy refusing to give up her seat to a white passenger on a segregated bus, Parks demonstrated the strength of quiet determination and peaceful protest.\n\nHer actions showed that standing up for one\u2019s rights and dignity often requires courage in the face of injustice and that individual acts of defiance can spark significant social change.\n\n8. Confucius: The Importance of Ethics and Moral Rectitude\n\nThe teachings of Confucius, a Chinese philosopher and educator, have profoundly influenced East Asian thought and life.\n\nConfucius espoused values such as respect for elders, filial piety, benevolence, and the importance of ethics and moral rectitude in personal and public life.\n\nHis concept of \u2018Ren\u2019 (\u4ec1), often translated as humaneness or benevolence, promotes the idea that being virtuous is essential to a harmonious society.\n\nConfucius\u2019 emphasis on moral education and the cultivation of character continues to resonate today.\n\n9. Albert Einstein: Curiosity and the Pursuit of Knowledge\n\nAlbert Einstein, one of the most celebrated physicists in history, exemplified the values of curiosity and the relentless pursuit of knowledge.\n\nEinstein\u2019s contributions to science, including the theory of relativity, have not only advanced our understanding of the universe but also highlighted the importance of questioning and exploring the mysteries of the world.\n\nHis life reminds us that intellectual curiosity and the pursuit of understanding are fundamental to human progress.\n\nRole of Family, Society and Educational institutions in inculcating Values\n\nNow, we are living in an age where people don\u2019t have the right values or ethics. Family, society, and educational institutions can play a great role in inculcating values to the new generation.\n\nRole of Family in inculcating values\n\nThe family is the earliest and without question the most influential agent of socialization.\u00a0Socialization via the family goes from cradle to grave.\u00a0The father, mother, siblings, and grandparents become the immediate agents of socialization.\n\nChildren pick up behavioural traits from all those who are in his/her immediate environment.\u00a0Values are imbibed by children by observing what parents do (and not just what parents say).\n\nThe power of the family is strongest during infancy and toddler years. During the teenage, the influence of peer groups and media usually overshadows the power of the family. However, the family returns as a predominant agent of socialization during the adult years with the roles of marital partner and parents becoming prominent.\n\nThere can be differences in values between family to family based on their socio-economic statuses.\n\nRole of Educational Institutions in inculcating values\n\nSchools and Colleges are important agencies in the process of socialization and thus can help a lot in inculcating values.\n\nSchool is the first place where individual values get compared with the larger value system of society.\nThe curriculum imparts the values of accepted behaviour.\nA school student learns not only from the official curriculum but also from the social curriculum of peer groups. Values are also imbibed from the hidden curriculum (Eg: don\u2019t talk while a teacher is taking the class).\nThis is the place where one learns the values of punctuality and discipline.\nValues education is an explicit attempt to teach about values. There are five basic approaches to values education: inculcation, moral development, analysis, action learning, and values clarification.\nRole of Society in inculcating values\n\nSociety can also inculcate a lot of values in people. The elements of society that have a great influence on people include:\n\nFriends\nNeighbours\nMedia\nFilms\nReligion\nLeaders\nGovernment\nHuman Values: Conclusion\n\nHuman values are integral to the fabric of society, guiding individuals in their daily lives and interactions with others.\n\nValues form the foundation of our decisions, actions, and beliefs, influencing everything from personal development to global relations.\n\nThe lives and teachings of these great figures offer profound lessons on the importance of embodying human values.\n\nThey remind us that integrity, compassion, resilience, forgiveness, and commitment to justice are not just ideals but actionable principles that can guide our actions and influence the world around us.\n\nBy reflecting on these lessons and striving to live by these values, we can aspire to lead lives that not only enrich ourselves but also contribute to the betterment of society."

            "[CONTENT]": "Inculcating values entails educating a child on moral principles or helping him build a moral code that applies to various aspects of his life. Here, a set of internalized values can be used to characterize an ethical framework. Here we look into multiple stakeholders like family, society, and education in inculcating values.\n\nThe inculcation of values is a multifaceted process that involves the active participation of various institutions, including family, society, and educational institutions.\n\nEach of these plays a distinctive yet interconnected role in shaping an individual\u2019s value system, character, and ethical foundation.\n\nTable of Contents\n\nWhat is socialization?\nRole of Family in inculcating values\nChanges in Family Structure\nRole of Educational Institutes in inculcating values\nWhat are the values that are learned by children through educational institutes?\nRole of Society in inculcating values\nConclusion\nWhat is socialization?\n\nIt is the process of transfer of culture from one generation to another, a process by which a person is indoctrinated into his culture. To mold a person into a useful and productive member of society, a lifelong process is required. The tactics of socialization include observation, conditioning, role-acting, inculcating values, and trial and error.\n\nRole of Family in inculcating values\n\nThe family is an important influence on a child\u2019s development and can play a significant role in shaping their values. Parents and caregivers can teach and model values such as honesty, kindness, and responsibility, and can also create a positive and supportive home environment that fosters the growth and development of these values.\n\nAdditionally, families can provide opportunities for children to practice and apply their values in real-life situations, which can help to reinforce and strengthen them.\n\n\ud83d\udc49 Which year are YOU targeting for success in the IAS/IPS/IFS Exam? \ud83d\ude80\n\n(1) \u21d2 UPSC 2025: Prelims cum Mains\n\n(2) \u21d2 UPSC 2026: Prelims cum Mains\n\n(3) \u21d2 UPSC 2027 Prelims cum Mains\n\nTip: Know more about ClearIAS Courses (Online/Offline)\n\nParents and caregivers need to be mindful of the values they are teaching and modeling, as well as to be open to discussing and exploring values with children and helping them understand the importance of different values.\n\nThe family imparts to the child the cultural ideals of peace, collaboration, democracy, harmony, and equity. A person learns the importance of sacrifice, love, feelings, good morals, and other things from their family, which shapes their perspective on other people in society.\n\nThe family, the fundamental pillar of society, serves as the initial institution for teaching moral behavior through elders\u2019 ethical guidance and by setting an example for younger family members. These can be taught through tales, lessons from life, etc.\n\nIn addition to the socialization of children, the family also plays a role in the socialization of adults. Marriage and parenting are major life transitions that can lead to significant changes in an individual\u2019s identity and social role. Through these transitions, individuals learn new skills and responsibilities, and they often adapt their values and behaviors to fit the demands of their new roles.\n\nOverall, the family plays a vital role in the socialization of both children and adults, and it plays a crucial role in the development and maintenance of social cohesion and stability in any society.\n\nChanges in Family Structure\n\nThere have been significant changes in the structure of families over the past few decades. Some of the most notable changes include:\n\nIncrease in single-parent families: There has been an increase in the number of single-parent families, due to a variety of factors such as divorce, separation, and non-marital childbirth.\nIncrease in multi-generational households: There has been an increase in the number of multi-generational households, where two or more generations live together under the same roof. This can be due to a variety of factors such as economic necessity, cultural traditions, and a desire to provide support for aging parents.\nIncrease in cohabitation: There has been an increase in the number of couples who are cohabiting or living together without being married. This is often seen as a step towards marriage, but it can also be a long-term arrangement for couples who do not want to get married.\nIncrease in same-sex partnerships: There has been an increase in the number of same-sex partnerships, both in the form of marriage and non-marital relationships. This is due in part to increased social acceptance and legal recognition of such partnerships.\nDecrease in marriage rates: There has been a decline in the overall marriage rate in many countries, as more people are choosing to remain single or cohabit instead of getting married.\n\nThese changes in family structure have had a variety of social and economic impacts, and have led to debates about the role of the family in society.\n\nRole of Educational Institutes in inculcating values\n\nA child spends the majority of his time in educational institutions, second only to his family. They thus play a significant part in influencing the development of the child\u2019s personality.\n\nEducational institutions can help students develop moral values by providing a safe and supportive learning environment that promotes respect, responsibility, and empathy.\nTeachers can model and encourage positive values in the classroom by demonstrating integrity, fairness, and compassion in their interactions with students.\nEducational institutions can offer opportunities for students to engage in service learning and community service projects, which can help them develop a sense of social responsibility and civic engagement.\nSchools can incorporate character education programs or other initiatives that focus on teaching students about values such as honesty, kindness, and respect for others.\nEducational institutions can encourage students to think critically about ethical issues and to consider the consequences of their actions on others.\nSchools can provide resources and support for students to learn about different cultural and moral perspectives, helping them to develop an appreciation for diversity and inclusivity.\nEducational institutions can create a culture of accountability and responsibility by enforcing rules and consequences for behavior that is inconsistent with the values of the school.\n\nOverall, educational institutions play a vital role in helping students develop the values that are necessary for success in school and in life.\n\nWhat are the values that are learned by children through educational institutes?\n\nThere are many values that children can learn in school. Some common values that are often emphasized in schools include:\n\nRespect: Children can learn to respect themselves, others, and the rules and expectations of the school.\nResponsibility: Children can learn to be responsible for their own actions and to take ownership of their learning.\nHonesty: Children can learn to be honest and truthful in their interactions with others.\nFairness: Children can learn to treat others fairly and to respect diversity and inclusivity.\nEmpathy: Children can learn to understand and care about the feelings and experiences of others.\nPerseverance: Children can learn to work hard and to keep trying even when faced with challenges or setbacks.\nCreativity: Children can learn to think creatively and express themselves through various mediums.\nConfidence: Children can learn to believe in themselves and their abilities.\nSelf-control: Children can learn to regulate their emotions and behaviors.\nCooperation: Children can learn to work well with others and to be part of a team.\n\nThese values can help children develop into responsible and well-rounded individuals, and they can serve as a foundation for success in school and life.\n\nRole of Society in inculcating values\nSocialization: Society plays a significant role in the socialization process, which is the process through which individuals learn the norms, values, and behaviors that are appropriate for their culture. Through socialization, individuals learn what is expected of them and how to behave in various social situations.\nFamily: The family is a primary agent of socialization, and it is within the family that children are first exposed to the values and beliefs of their culture. Children observe and mimic the behaviors of their parents and other family members, which helps to shape their values and beliefs.\nEducation: Schools and other educational institutions also play a role in the inculcation of values. Through the curriculum, students are exposed to the values that are considered important by their culture, such as honesty, integrity, and respect for others.\nPeer groups: Peer groups also influence the values of individuals, particularly during adolescence. Individuals often adopt the values and beliefs of their peer group to fit in and be accepted.\nMass media: The mass media, such as television, movies, and social media, also play a role in the inculcation of values. These sources often present and reinforce certain values and beliefs to large audiences.\nReligion: For many people, religion is a source of values and moral guidance. Religious institutions and practices often teach and reinforce specific values, such as compassion, forgiveness, and charity.\nLaw and government: Law and government also play a role in the inculcation of values. The laws of a society reflect the values that are important to that society, and individuals learn to conform to these laws to be a part of the community.\nConclusion\n\nIn conclusion, the role of the family, educational institutions, and society in inculcating values is crucial. The family serves as the first source of values for children and plays a crucial role in shaping their beliefs and behaviors. Educational institutions also play a significant role in imparting values through the curriculum and extracurricular activities. Society, on the other hand, influences an individual\u2019s values through its cultural and societal norms. Therefore, all three entities play a vital role in the process of inculcating values in individuals.\n\nClick here to read more Ethics notes\n\nArticle Written by: Jis John Sebastian"

(Or even your own attitude?)\n\nYes.\n\nDue to the influence of society, we all develop positive, negative, and neutral attitudes towards many things. (Eg: I hate XYZ religion). If our negative or neutral attitude is undesirable in modern society, it should be changed to a positive attitude.\n\nThere are various techniques for changing a person\u2019s attitude. Yes, that\u2019s the beauty of this subject \ud83d\ude42\n\nWe shall deal with each of them in detail.\n\nAttitude: content, structure, and function\n\nAttitudes are often the result of social influence, experience or upbringing. Attitudes have a powerful influence over behaviour.\u00a0While attitudes are enduring, they can change, resulting in a change in behaviour as well.\n\nFor example \u2013 Only if the citizens of a country have a positive attitude towards cleanliness, campaigns such as Swatch Bharat Mission (Clean India Mission) will succeed. Here, by various campaigns (advertisements), the government is trying to change the attitude of citizens, and hence to stop their behaviour of throwing wastes in public, open-defecation etc.\n\nAttitude \u2013 Content\n\nCarl Jung, one of the founders of psychoanalysis, is of the opinion that the contents of the conscious and unconscious\u00a0part of the mind are usually different. Accordingly, attitudes are classified as explicit and implicit.\n\nExplicit Attitude (Conscious) \u2013 If a person is aware of his attitudes and how they influence his behaviour, then those attitudes are explicit. Explicit attitudes are formed consciously.\n\nImplicit Attitude (Sub-Conscious) \u2013 If a person is unaware of his attitudes (beliefs) and how they influence his behaviour, then those attitudes are implicit. Implicit attitudes are formed subconsciously.\n\nAttitude \u2013 Structure\n\nHow are attitudes formed? Let\u2019s say, for example, you like Honda cars. So you have a positive attitude towards Honda cars. How is this attitude formed?\n\nComponents of Attitude\n\nAs per experts, three components \u2013 learning, emotions, and past behaviour \u2013 come together, and on the basis of it, we form an attitude.\n\nThis multi-component model is known as the ABC Model or CAB Model. Let\u2019s see the components of the CAB model.\n\nCognitive Component \u2013 This involves the person\u2019s learning, knowledge, beliefs, and thoughts about the attitude-object (in our case, Honda cars). For example, if you have learned previously that Honda cars give more than 20 km/litre mileage on petrol \u2013 that can create a positive attitude towards the brand.\nAffective Component \u2013 This involves a person\u2019s feelings, emotions about the attitude object. For example, if owning a Honda car gives you pleasure and prestige, that will create a positive attitude about the brand.\nBehavioural Component\u00a0(Conative Component) \u2013 This involves the past behaviours or experiences regarding the attitude object. For example, if you have previously owned or driven Honda cars and felt comfortable driving the same, that will create a positive attitude towards the brand. People hate cognitive dissonance, and hence try to align the present behaviour with past behaviour as well.\n\nThus, in short, to change an attitude you need to touch all components of that attitude ie. Cognitive, Affective, and Behavioural.\n\nDimensions of Attitude: (1) Strength of Attitude\n\nSome attitudes are strong while some attitudes are weak.\u00a0The strength with which an attitude is held is often a good predictor of behaviour. The stronger the attitude the more likely it should affect behaviour.\n\nFor example, consider that Muthu from Tamil Nadu as well as Rahul from Uttar Pradesh like the Tamil Film Actor Rajnikanth. However, the strength of the positive attitude of Muthu may be very high (10/10 if rated on a scale). Rahul, even though likes Rajnikanth, his positive attitude\u2019s strength may not match the strength of the attitude of Muthu (6/10, if rated on a scale).\n\nThe very strong attitude of Muthu may get directly expressed in his behaviour in the form of hero-worship, intolerance of any negative comments, an extreme expression of emotions etc. However, even though\u00a0Rahul has a positive attitude towards the Film actor, as his attitude is not as strong as Muthu, he may not exhibit strong behaviour as Muthu.\n\nDimensions of Attitude: (2) Accessibility of Attitude\n\nThe accessibility of an attitude refers to the ease with which it comes to mind. In general, highly accessible attitudes tend to be stronger.\n\nDimensions of Attitude: (3) Attitude ambivalence\n\nThe ambivalence of an attitude refers to the ratio of positive and negative evaluations that make up that attitude. The ambivalence of an attitude increases as the positive and negative evaluations get more and more equal.\n\nOne dimensional view of attitude vs Two-dimensional view of the attitude\n\nThe one-dimensional view\u00a0\u2013 It postulates that the positive and negative elements are stored at opposite ends of a single dimension.\u00a0according to this one-dimensional perspective, the positive and negative elements are at opposite ends of a single dimension, and people tend to experience either end of the dimension or a location in between.\n\nThe two-dimensional view\u00a0\u2013 It postulates that positive and negative elements are stored along two separate dimensions.\u00a0If this view is correct, then people can possess any combination of positivity or negativity in their attitudes.\n\nAttitude \u2013 Functions\n\nAttitudes are important because they can guide thought, behaviour, and feelings. If you hold some attitudes, it might be useful to you. Attitudes help to mediate between a person\u2019s internal needs (Eg: self-expression) and the external environment. Thus, attitude helps people to achieve their basic goals.\n\nDaniel Katz classified attitudes into different groups based on their functions\n\nKnowledge function: knowing one\u2019s or other\u2019s attitude imparts knowledge.\nEgo-defensive function: attitudes can help people protect their self-esteem and avoid depression.\nEgo-expressive function: used to express one\u2019s core values or beliefs.\nInstrumental function: helps to choose what is rewarding (and also avoid punishment).\nSocial Acceptance function: adapt to the socially approved attitudes of a larger group.\n\nNow let\u2019s take a look at each of these functions in detail.\n\n1. Knowledge Function\n\nAs we discussed in the beginning, attitude is all about what a person likes or dislikes.\n\nKnowing a person\u2019s attitude helps us predict their behaviour. For example, knowing that a person is religious we can predict they will go to Church.\n\nAttitude thus allows us to\u00a0predict\u00a0what is likely to happen, and so gives us a sense of control. Attitudes can help us organize and structure our experience.\n\nThe knowledge function refers to our need for a world which is consistent and relatively stable.\u00a0In short, attitudes serves the function of providing meaning (knowledge) for life.\n\n2. Ego-defensive Function\n\nNot everyone can do everything. This is the truth.\n\nHowever, attitude (like/dislike), can mask this truth to protect your ego.\n\nFor example, you may not be able to play football like Messi. However, instead of accepting this truth, to protect your self-esteem you can say that you don\u2019t like football, and you are interested only in intellectual activities \ud83d\ude42\n\nPositive attitudes towards ourselves, just like the example above, have a protective function (i.e. an ego-defensive role) in helping us preserve our self-image. Otherwise, we might fall into depression.\n\n3. Ego Expressive Function (Value Expressive/Self Expressive)\n\nThe attitudes we express (what we like or dislike) helps to express who we are, what are our basic values, and what we stand for. This (1) help\u00a0communicate\u00a0who we are and (2) may make us feel good because we have asserted our identity.\u00a0 Self-expression of attitudes can be non-verbal too.\n\nTherefore, our attitudes are part of our identity.\n\n4. Instrumental Function (Utilitarian)\n\nPeople develop positive attitudes towards objects associated with rewards, and negative attitudes towards those associated with punishments.\n\nFor example, as tax-evasion attracts punishments, a person may not favour evading taxes, and start paying taxes properly.\n\nNote: Any attitude that is adopted in a person\u2019s own self-interest is considered to serve a utilitarian function.\n\n5. Social Acceptance Function (Identity/Adaptive)\n\nIf a person holds or expresses socially acceptable attitudes, other people will reward them with approval and\u00a0social acceptance.\n\nFor example, the decoration of the house with Diwali lights.\n\nAdaptive functions help us fit in with a social group. People seek out others who share their attitudes and develop similar attitudes to those they like.\n\nAttitude\u2019s Influence and Relation with Thought and Behaviour\n\nWe tend to assume that people behave according to their attitudes. However, social psychologists have found that attitudes and actual behaviour are not always perfectly aligned.\n\nCase 1 \u2013 Attitude \u2260 Behaviour\n\nFor example, take the case of elections. Plenty of people may support a particular candidate, but they may not take the pain to go out and vote for him, despite their names being there on the electoral roll.\n\nThere is another famous example in relation to this. It is connected with the prejudice (negative attitude) Americans once had against the Chinese.\n\nHere it is:\n\nIn the days when Americans were said to be prejudiced against the Chinese, Richard LaPierre, an American social\u00a0psychologist, conducted the following study.\n\nHe asked a Chinese couple to travel across the United States, and stay in different hotels. They were all given accommodation by the different hotels (there was only one instance during these occasions they were refused service by one of the hotels).\n\nSometime later, LaPierre sent out questionnaires to managers of hotels and tourist homes in the same areas where the Chinese couple had travelled, asking them if they would give accommodation to Chinese guests.\n\nA very large percentage (91%) said that they would not do so.\n\nThis response showed a negative attitude towards the Chinese, which was inconsistent with the positive behaviour that was actually shown towards the travelling Chinese couple.\n\nThus, attitudes may not always predict the actual pattern of one\u2019s behaviour. To be more precise, LaPierre\u2019s study shows that the cognitive and affective components of attitudes (e.g. disliking Chinese people) do not necessarily coincide with behaviour (e.g. serving them).\n\nCase 2 \u2013 Behaviour \u2260 Attitude\n\nBehavioural component (remember the CAB model) is generally the most visible component of our attitude. However, some people can hide the same. We have seen that in the American/Chinese case study example (above). Here a negative attitude was masked by people to show positive behaviour.\n\nThere can also be instances where a negative behaviour to co-exist with a positive attitude. This occurs usually when the positive attitude is not strong enough. For example, consider a person with a positive attitude of not to jump queues. However, when he sees everyone around him does the same, he may think he will lose, if not jump queues. Thus he may behave opposite to his original attitude \u2013 which we can call as weak positive.\n\nCase 3 \u2013\u00a0Attitude = Behaviour\n\nPsychologists have found that there would be consistency between attitudes and behaviour when:\n\nthe attitude is strong, and it occupies a central place in the attitude system.\nthe person is aware of her/his attitude.\nthere is very little or no external pressure on the person to behave in a particular way. For example, when there is no group pressure to follow a particular norm.\nthe person\u2019s behaviour is not being watched or evaluated by others.\nthe person thinks that the behaviour would have a positive consequence, and therefore, intends to engage in that behaviour.\n\nNote: Persons with high integrity usually show a direct relation between attitude and behaviour.\n\nCase 4 \u2013\u00a0Behaviour = Attitude\n\nPeople dislike Cognitive Dissonance. Cognitive dissonance\u00a0is a phenomenon in which a person experiences psychological distress due to conflicting thoughts or beliefs. In order to reduce this tension, people may change their attitudes to reflect their other beliefs or actual behaviours.\n\nThis means they prefer their attitude and behaviour to be aligned in the same direction. By giving incentives to behave contrary to the attitude,\u00a0Leon Festinger and James Carlsmith (study in 1954), proved that the first attitude can be changed to suit their external behaviour.\n\nHow can you change one\u2019s attitude (or your attitude)?\n\nAttitude change occurs anytime an attitude is modified. Thus, change occurs when a person goes from being positive to negative, from slightly positive to very positive, or from having no attitude to having one. The various theories that can be used include:\n\nLearning Theory of Attitude Change:\u00a0Classical conditioning, operant conditioning, and observational learning can be used to bring about attitude change.\n\n(1) Classical conditioning \u2013 create positive emotional reactions to an object, person, or event by associating positive feelings with the target object.\n\n(2) Operant conditioning \u2013 strengthen desirable attitudes and weaken undesirable ones.\n\n(3) Observational learning \u2013 let people observe the behaviour of others so that they change their attitude.\n\nElaboration Likelihood Theory of Attitude Change (The theory of persuasion):\u00a0This theory of\u00a0persuasion\u00a0suggests that people can alter their attitudes in two ways.\n\nFirst, they can be motivated to listen and think about the message, thus leading to an attitude shift.\n\nOr, they might be influenced by the characteristics of the speaker, leading to a temporary or surface shift in attitude. Messages that are thought-provoking and that appeal to logic are more likely to lead to permanent changes in attitudes.\n\nDissonance Theory of Attitude Change:\n\nAs mentioned earlier, people can also change their attitudes when they have conflicting beliefs about a topic (cognitive dissonance). In order to reduce the tension created by these incompatible beliefs, people often shift their attitudes. In the earlier example, the dissonance was created by giving an incentive to change the behaviour, and thus attitude was also changed accordingly.\n\nMoral and Political Attitudes\n\nMoral Attitudes are attitudes of individuals towards moral issues, while political attitudes are attitudes of individuals towards political issues. We shall see them in detail.\n\nMoral Attitude\n\nAttitude is about what you like, and morals are about (what society thinks as) right or wrong. So Moral Attitude is the attitude you hold towards moral issues (where society debates what is right or wrong).\n\nFor example \u2013 what is your attitude towards Euthanasia (mercy killing)? Do you think of it as right?\n\nThere are a lot of moral issues currently \u2013 reproductive cloning, surrogate motherhood, abortion, sex selection, pornography, prostitution, dance bars, euthanasia, capital punishment, homosexuality, live-in relationships, incest, divorce, honour killing, consumerism, owning personal weapons, gambling, prohibition etc being some of them. Your attitude towards these issues comes under the broad category of a moral attitude. (Don\u2019t miss our ethics notes \u2013 go to the dimensions of ethics, in where we deal with Applied ethics).\n\nPolitical Attitude\n\nPolitical attitude is the attitude you hold towards political issues or ideologies. For example, what is your view of the reservation? It is time that India should stop giving reservations? Your attitude towards reservation is a political attitude.\n\nLet\u2019s take another example. What is your view on Communism? Do you like the ideology of Communism? Do you prefer the concept of no-state and market control? Or do you prefer a free market?\n\nCan you think of some other examples of political issues or ideologies?\n\nAttitude towards patriotism, democracy, plebiscite, reservation for women, eunuchs, equality, secularism, socialism, communism, scheduled castes and other minorities in politics, communalism, ideals of transparency and accountability, corruption, voting, political parties etc. comes under the broad umbrella of political attitude.\n\nAlso, your attitude towards the basic politic spectrum \u2013 left or right \u2013 comes under your political attitude.\n\nSocial influence and persuasion\n\nThe study of social influence phenomena lies at the very heart of social psychology. Persuasion is one form of social influence. We shall discuss these topics in detail, as a separate post later. It\u2019s quite interesting to know how society influences us. Now let\u2019s focus on the key concepts.\n\nSocial Influence\n\nSocial influence refers to the ways people influence the attitudes, values, beliefs, feelings, and behaviours of others.\u00a0Each day we are bombarded by countless attempts by others to influence us.\n\nConsider our daily exposure to radio and television commercials, newspaper ads, direct requests, influence attempts by salespersons, politicians, and so forth.\n\nTheorists have broadly classified the social influence into three forms \u2013 conformity, compliance, and obedience. The key difference between them is as below.\n\nConformity \u2013 Behavior change in response to real or imagined social pressure.\nCompliance \u2013\u00a0 Behavior change in response to an explicit request to perform some action.\nObedience \u2013\u00a0Behavior change in response to an Extreme pressure demand to perform some action.\n\nSocial influence varies according to how much pressure is involved. Imitation involves no pressure, conformity involves peer pressure, compliance involves an explicit request to perform some behaviour, and obedience is a response to a direct order to perform some action.\n\nIn other words, Imitation is the behaviour change in the absence of social pressure. The pressure for a behavioural change increases from Conformity \u2192 Obedience. Obedience the most direct form of social influence, Conformity is the most indirect form of social influence; compliance is in-between the two.\n\nSocial Persuasion\n\nPersuasion refers to an active attempt to change another person\u2019s attitudes, beliefs, or feelings, usually via some form of communication.\u00a0Typically, persuasion is treated as a form distinct from that of the other three forms of social influence. As you can rightly guess, it is more related to conformity and compliance.\n\nPersuasion is an active form of influence and is internal in its focus. Change in people\u2019s beliefs or feelings is the goal of such influence.\n\nSystematic persuasion is the process through which attitudes or beliefs are leveraged by appeals to logic and reason. Heuristic persuasion, on the other hand, is the process through which attitudes or beliefs are leveraged by appeals to habit or emotion.\n\nTo sum up:\nAttitude is your view or belief about what you like or dislike.\nYou may note that attitude always comes with positive or negative emotion.\nAttitude has 3 components \u2013 cognitive, affective, and behavioural.\nThe affective (emotional) component may even overcome negative cognitive rationales (if any).\nIt\u2019s good to have positive attitudes \u2013 and it serves many functions.\nAttitude is internal while the behaviour is external.\nAttitudes and actual behaviour are not always perfectly aligned.\nIt is possible to change the attitude and thus behaviour.\nThe theories of learning, persuasion, or dissonance can be used to bring an attitudinal or behavioural change.\nSocial Influence and Persuasion can change the attitude or behaviour of people."

On the other hand, social psychologists have found that opinions and actual behaviour are not always precisely in line.\n\nAlthough they are independent ideas, attitudes, and behaviour are strongly intertwined.

An idea, an item, or an action may be evaluated. Strong attitudes, such as those regarding drinking behaviour, are possible.\n\nMost people have strong opinions on whether or not to drink. In other cases, it might not be strong enough.\n\nA belief system and the development of an attitude may go hand in hand. A generally persistent structure of beliefs, sentiments, and behavioural tendencies toward socially significant things, organizations, events, or symbols is what theorists refer to as an attitude.\n\nAttitudes are \u201cthe most distinctive and fundamental notion in contemporary social psychology,\u201d according to renowned psychologist Gordon Allport. The past and present of a person might influence their attitude.\n\n\ud83d\udc49 Which year are YOU targeting for success in the IAS/IPS/IFS Exam? \ud83d\ude80\n\n(1) \u21d2 UPSC 2025: Prelims cum Mains\n\n(2) \u21d2 UPSC 2026: Prelims cum Mains\n\n(3) \u21d2 UPSC 2027 Prelims cum Mains\n\nTip: Know more about ClearIAS Courses (Online/Offline)\n\nAttitude and behaviour difference\nBehaviour is a social trait, whereas attitude is a personal trait. In other words, while attitude is encapsulated within the individual\u2019s mind and cannot be quickly noticed by others, behaviour can be easily observed by others because it is external.\nBehaviour refers to what you do, whereas attitude pertains to how you feel. While behaviour largely focuses on actions, attitude is more concerned with the mind.\nBehaviour is a physical state, whereas attitude is a mental state. An individual\u2019s attitude might have an impact on their behaviour. A person with the appropriate mindset might also act in the right way. Nevertheless, people occasionally behave in ways that are consistent with their attitudes, and other times they do not.\nA person\u2019s attitude is their viewpoint on a particular subject. Behaviour is the way a person reacts to the pulls and impulses of their environment. This answer may be influenced by the person\u2019s attitude.\nThough one\u2019s attitude cannot be seen from the outside, it can be determined by one\u2019s behaviour. One can be considered to have a sympathetic disposition toward the underprivileged.\nThe person\u2019s behaviour makes it obvious. Because of this, although attitude and behaviour are two separate ideas, they are connected in some ways.\nBehaviour\nA social psychologist may be interested in forecasting a person\u2019s behaviour based on their opinions in a variety of ways, ranging from the very particular (will the person attend church services this week?) to the very general (how many religious rites will the person do over the next month?).\nThe best way to predict a particular behaviour is to ask a question that is equally specific to the action in question, the target of the action, the context in which the action is performed, and the time of the action (for example, \u201cHow do you feel about going to your friend\u2019s wedding this Sunday?\u201d).\nBefore lead-free gasoline becoming required, a study indicated that questions regarding buying lead-free gasoline were more accurate predictors of actual lead-free gasoline purchases than other questions.\nOn the other hand, the best indicator of a general pattern of behaviour is a measure of general attitude.\nIn one study, a general measure of engaging in religious behaviour that was a composite measure of the numerous specific religious behaviours was used to predict the likelihood of engaging in a variety of specific religious behaviours (for example, praying before or after meals, giving money to a religious institution).\n\nSome persons are more likely than others to exhibit consistency in their views and behaviours.\n\nIn general, two categories of people have been taken into account:\nPeople who are conscious of and follow their inner feelings\nPeople who extensively rely on environmental cues to guide their behaviour.\nCompared to persons who rely on environmental cues, those who are conscious of their feelings exhibit more consistent attitudes and behaviours.\nBoth internal emotions and environmental clues can affect how people behave.\nNevertheless, a variety of personality traits have been created and successfully applied to ascertain if a person prefers to rely on one kind of cue over another.\n\nIn connection to behaviour with attitude, two prevalent theoretical stances are explained. These are the theory of deliberate action and the theory of planned behaviour, which is its theoretical offspring.\n\nReasoned Action Theory\n\nA model for the anticipation of behavioural intention, including predictions of attitude and behaviours, is the theory of reasoned action. The ensuing distinction between behavioural intention and behaviour enables an explanation of the constraints on the influence of attitudes.\n\nThe Theory of Reasoned Action, developed by Martin Fishbein and Icek Ajzen, opened the door to the study of attitude and behaviour (1980).\n\nThe idea \u201cwas largely borne out of dissatisfaction with traditional attitude behaviour research, much of which found weak relationships between attitude variables and performance of volitional behaviours\u201d\n\nTheory of Planned Behaviour\n\nTypically, attitudes are not the only factor influencing behaviour. According to this theory of deliberate action, people are more likely to act rationally if they perceive the suggested behaviour as positive (attitude) and believe their significant others want them to do the behaviour (subjective norm).\n\nThis theory of planned behaviour states that behavioural intentions to engage in the behaviour or not have an impact on actual behaviour. These intents are then affected by:\n\nThe individual\u2019s perception of the behaviour\u2019s benefits and drawbacks is referred to as their attitude toward the behaviour.\nThe desire to behave in a way that people who are important to him believe he should behave is an example of subjective norms on behaviour.\nThe degree to which the person thinks he can control whether he engages in the behaviour is known as perceived control over performance.\n\nAccording to this hypothesis, intentions to engage in the target behaviour should be higher when attitudes and subjective norms are favorable toward it and perceived control over its execution is high.\n\nStrong intentions should increase a person\u2019s likelihood of engaging in the behaviour.\n\n\u00a0Ways by which attitudes direct behaviour\n\nThere are two ways that attitudes might affect how people behave.\n\nThe degree to which the behaviour is carefully planned ahead of time rather than being a spontaneous reaction to a person\u2019s assessment of the current situation is the primary distinction between the two systems.\nThe person may think carefully and reflect on a behavioural strategy before deciding how to act in the first mechanism. As a result, the individual may consciously reflect on the effects of his or her attitude.\nBefore making a behavioural choice, a person will carefully consider all of the advantages and disadvantages when choosing a car or which institution to attend, for example.\nAlternatively, in the second mechanism, the person may not consciously think about his or her attitude, yet that attitude may nevertheless have an impact on how that person understands the current experience and, as a result, on behaviour.\nPeople rarely weigh the advantages and disadvantages of each flavour when choosing between chocolate or vanilla ice cream. Which flavour appears to be the best at any one time is instead determined by how that person feels about the other flavours.\n\nThe first kind of procedure is the foundation of the Theory of Reasoned Action. The latter is shown in the attitude-to-behaviour process model.\n\nModel of the process between attitudes and behaviours\n\nThe theory of reasoned action postulates that an individual\u2019s attitude and its consequences for a particular course of action direct behaviour through deliberate thought and conscious contemplation.\n\nThe process model, on the other hand, contends that attitudes can influence behaviour even in the absence of conscious thought and reflection.\n\nFor example, When someone encounters a cockroach, it\u2019s doubtful that they will worry about how unhygienic they are or whether they should smash the bug in front of other people.\n\nIf humans did do such deep thought, the cockroach would disappear before anyone had a chance to decide how to respond.\n\nFactors that affect the strength of an attitude\n\nResearchers have found that under some circumstances, people are more likely to act by their attitudes:\n\nWhen someone\u2019s attitudes are a product of their own experiences.\nWhen they are subject-matter authorities.\nWhen they anticipate a positive result.\nWhen the opinions are frequently spoken.\nWhen they have a chance to gain or lose as a result of the problem.\n\nAs behaviour changes, so can attitudes.\n\nMany times, individuals will change their views to better match their behaviour.\n\nCognitive dissonance is a condition where a person suffers from psychological anguish as a result of opposing thoughts or beliefs. People may alter their attitudes to reflect their other ideas or real behaviours to ease this conflict.\n\nConclusion\n\nIn conclusion, theoretical models have demonstrated that attitudes are comprehensive assessments of stimuli that result from the favorability of a person\u2019s effects, cognitions, and prior behaviours. Normal attitudes are either good or negative, but occasionally they can also be ambiguous.\n\nBehaviours are influenced by attitude. When attitudes are measured with the same level of specificity as the desired behaviour, the relationship between attitudes and behaviour is the strongest.\n\nModern theories of attitude-behaviour relationships explain how attitudes predict behaviour when combined with other factors (such as social norms and perceived control) that have an impact on behaviour.\n\nAdditionally, these models describe how readily available attitudes automatically affect behaviour. According to traditional beliefs, people\u2019s attitudes shift when they are motivated to do so by an influential message.\n\nWhen people are motivated and capable of processing the reasoning, they are more susceptible to the message\u2019s arguments. People may heavily rely on heuristic cues (such as source expertise) to identify their new attitudes when motivation and ability are low.\n\nArticle Written By: Atheena Fathima Riyas\u00a0"

More powerful than moral concepts are moral attitudes.\n\nIt is commonly known that among all categories of natural values, ethical values rank highest. Moral principles such as goodness, purity, truthfulness, and humility of man are valued more highly than qualities such as genius, brilliance, exuberant vitality, and the beauty of nature or of art, as well as stability and power of a state.\n\nStudies have shown that moral ideals are always a person\u2019s particular values. Only man is capable of possessing them and realizing them. A person is morally good or bad depending on his or her acts and attitudes, will and efforts, love and hatred, joy and sadness, and fundamental attitudes.\n\nA man with these qualities\u2014humility, purity, honesty, and affection\u2014will have a personality that exudes moral principles.\n\nMan will lack moral goodness as long as he disregards the moral values of other people, is unable to distinguish between the positive value inherent in truth and the negative value inherent in error, and is unable to understand the positive value inherent in human life and the negative value associated with injustice.\n\n\ud83d\udc49 Which year are YOU targeting for success in the IAS/IPS/IFS Exam? \ud83d\ude80\n\n(1) \u21d2 UPSC 2025: Prelims cum Mains\n\n(2) \u21d2 UPSC 2026: Prelims cum Mains\n\n(3) \u21d2 UPSC 2027 Prelims cum Mains\n\nTip: Know more about ClearIAS Courses (Online/Offline)\n\nFamilies, communities, religion, and education all play significant roles in forming moral convictions.\n\nMoral attitudes have the advantageous implication that they are entangled with powerful emotions. As a result, normal societies avoid abnormal behaviors out of fear of social ostracization, such as child molestation.\n\nMoral attitude characteristics\nReverence\nFaithfulness\nVeracity\nGoodness\nReverence\n\nThe foundation for realizing a man\u2019s moral principles is the capacity to hold moral beliefs, uphold them, and respond to them. Only the individual who possesses reverence bears these signs.\n\nAn emotion or attitude of profound respect for others that is tinged with wonder is known as reverence. It is the mindset that can be referred to as the beginning of all moral life since it is in it that man first adopts a posture toward the world that allows him to make spiritual judgments and understand values.\n\nReverence t is the essential prerequisite for all deep knowledge, especially the ability to understand values. Every response to value, every surrender of anything valuable, is predicated on reverence, which is also a necessary component of that response.\n\nThe foundation of all moral behavior toward our fellow humans and toward ourselves is the fundamental attitude of reverence.\n\nEvery true love begins with the fundamental attitude of reverence. Similar reverence is seen in acts of kindness toward others, respect for another\u2019s rights and freedom to make decisions, restraint of one\u2019s own hunger for power, and awareness of another person\u2019s rights in all contexts.\n\nFaithfulness\n\nAmong the characteristics of a person\u2019s moral attitude that are fundamental to his or her entire moral existence, faithfulness is another crucial aspect.\n\nFaithfulness is the idea of consistently putting one\u2019s allegiance into action and remaining faithful to someone or something, despite adverse circumstances.\n\nA man will be more capable of becoming a vessel of moral ideals, a creature in whom purity, justice, humility, love, and goodness will dwell permanently and radiate from him to the world around him, the more faithful, consistent, and solid he is. This loyalty in the truest meaning of the word is a basic moral principle that applies to all people.\n\nVeracity\n\nReliability is yet another fundamental predicate of a person\u2019s moral life. A person who is dishonest not only displays a serious moral deficiency, but also suffers from crippling effects on every aspect of his personality, moral life, and ability to uphold moral principles.\n\nThe dishonest individual does not hold values in high regard. He takes a lordly posture over the being and handles it any way he pleases. This attitude conveys a sense of haughtiness, disdain, and impertinence.\n\nIntegrity, constancy, and responsibility awareness are the cornerstones of a moral existence in general. It has a great value in and of itself, and like these other qualities, it is also necessary as a fundamental assumption of a personality which is true.\n\nGoodness\n\nThe foundational element of moral principles is goodness. Goodness is the only moral value that more fully embodies the entire reign of moral values than any other.\n\nA man\u2019s goodness is not restricted to having kind thoughts for just one person they adore. When someone is described as being good, it indicates they consistently demonstrate their open goodness and have a loving, giving character toward all men.\n\nBecause goodness is a fundamental attitude and position rather than being restricted to a specific transient attitude like every other virtue.\n\nWhile the other fundamental attitudes, such as respect, loyalty, awareness of one\u2019s responsibilities, and truthfulness, react to the world of values as a whole, better not only reacts to the world of values but also reflect the entire world of values in the person.\n\nNow let us discuss political attitudes.\n\nPolitical attitudes\n\nWhen political beliefs shape political behavior, they are significant.\n\nPolitical attitudes are people\u2019s perspectives on the aspects of public life that political psychology studies, such as opinions on nationalism, political conservatism, political liberalism, and political radicalism.\n\nPolitical views range from being exceedingly liberal to being extremely conservative. According to a large number of academics, a political attitude refers to the beliefs and values that support the functioning of a given political system.\n\nThese attitudes were considered to include both favorable and negative evaluations of the political system, as well as knowledge and abilities on how it functions. Which political parties people support, how they vote, and how they participate are all influenced by these attitudes. Family, gender, religion, race, ethnicity, and area are the factors that influence opinions.\n\nPolitical attitude reveals which political party a person supports, their preferred political ideologies, and their preferred social, economic, cultural, and foreign policies, among other things.\n\nPolitical attitude-shaping factors\n\nPolitical attitude-shaping factors include:\n\nFamily\n\nIn most cases, the first and most enduring effect on young people\u2019s political ideas comes from their families. Despite generational differences and incongruities within the family, children often have political views that are similar to those of their parents.\n\nChildren prefer to vote in the same manner as their parents, which is understandable despite generational differences. Children from politically engaged families are more likely to share their parents\u2019 values and outlooks.\n\nAs kids get older and are exposed to outside influences, their perspectives inevitably veer away from their parents.\n\nReligion\n\nVoting behavior is frequently influenced by religious beliefs. Religion is the belief system that individuals adhere to. Recent events have shown that the religious right has favored Republican Party candidates over Democratic Party candidates by endorsing more conservative candidates for public office.\n\nPeople that identify with the \u201cReligious Right\u201d have different political views than everyone else. The religious right generally leans toward conservatism. This tendency is more obviously connected to social problems like gay rights and cow protection than it is to economic or international concerns.\n\nRace & Ethnicity\n\nIt has been determined that African Americans have been more closely associated with the Democratic Party over the past 50 years than any other recognized group.\n\nSome experts think that this allegiance is dwindling. Numerous studies have shown that Asian Americans tend to vote conservatively, although there is still a dearth of hard data to support this.\n\nEconomic forces\n\nA lot of academics have stated that economic pressures are a major motivator for selecting a specific political position, and this does actually seem to be a significant role. Typically, those who are prospering in society do not want it to alter.\n\nThe impoverished, on the other hand, stand to benefit greatly from gradual change and have little tangible to lose. Possibly, at least.\n\nHowever, economics is not the only determinant of political beliefs.\n\nAge\n\nAge plays a significant role in the formation of political attitudes. Young people are typically more liberal than older people. This may be due to the elder generations\u2019 inherent interest in maintaining the status quo, which the younger generations do not yet have.\n\nIn addition to lacking money, young people also lack a sense of loyalty and community.\n\nPsychological factor\n\nCertain individuals are more suited psychologically to liberalism or conservatism than others. One must have a relatively high tolerance for disarray in order to be liberal.\n\nThe nature of people\n\nIt is a key determinant of political attitude. One is likely to tilt to the right of the spectrum if one think that most humans are fundamentally selfish, bad, and violent.\n\nAnyone who believes that people are inherently wicked will have a tendency to rely on harsh regulations and severe penalties for those who break them in the assumption that such actions are required to curb inappropriate behavior.\n\nPeople who believe their coworkers are generally well-meaning and rational, on the other hand, will tend to lean left. They will make an effort to avoid limiting human liberty with \u201cneedlessly\u201d strict rules and to negotiate with offenders.\n\nGender\n\nIt has been seen in our social structure that women frequently adopt political attitudes that differ from those of their husbands or other family members, notwithstanding this tendency. Since they seek equal rights, equal pay, better chances, etc., women generally lean toward liberal.\n\nBut their political opinions also depend on their family, social position, and religion. Women are more inclined to support their political parties when the chief minister is a woman (such as Jayalalitha or Mamta Banerjee).\n\nWomen have started casting their votes for parties that support \u201cwomen\u2019s issues,\u201d such as women\u2019s protection, reservation, equal pay, and equal legal rights, in the current political climate.\n\nProcess of developing a political stance\n\nEvery society aims for the efficient governance of its citizens to ensure the smooth operation of the system and to sustain harmony and coordination within the community.\n\nThe state, the government, the political parties, and the election or selection of representatives are just a few of the mechanisms or agencies that any society develops. How people develop their political attitudes and how they transmit their ideals from one generation to the next are guided by political attitude formation.\n\nA political system cannot function without the process of forming political views. Political attitude development and political attitude progression go hand in hand.\n\nA person develops orientations, ideas, values, norms, and behavioral patterns relevant to the political system through the process of developing their political attitude.\n\nThe patterns of sociopolitical behavior are determined by political attitude formulations. Political attitude formation is a psychological term since it affects both individuals and society as a whole.\n\nStages in the process of forming a political mindset\n\nThere are four stages in the process of forming a political mindset, according to Easton and Dennis.\n\nA youngster recognizes authority through particular people, such as parents, police officers, and the nation\u2019s president.\nIt is necessary to distinguish between private and governmental authorities.\nIt develops knowledge about impersonal political institutions like the national legislature, the courts, and voting practices.\nThere are differences between political institutions and the people who participate in the activities linked with such organizations, leading to romanticized perceptions of specific people like the president or congress.\nFunctions of the formation of political attitudes\nMaintaining Political Culture: In stable circumstances, maintaining political culture is a crucial component of forming political attitudes. The communication of political cultures from one generation to the next serves this purpose. However, in the current climate, political socialization does not necessarily serve to sustain political culture.\nChanges in Political Culture: A crucial aspect of developing political attitudes is the modification of political culture.\nBuilding Political Culture: The practice of forming political attitudes is used to create political culture. With the implementation of a new political system, every society must construct a new political culture.\nThe foundation of the current political system is the fact that in totalitarian states, there is no room for opposition or disagreement, whereas, in open societies, there are many opportunities for such things.\nContinuity and Change: The process of forming attitudes involves both continuity and change, and this is a crucial component.\nThe process of forming political attitudes is ongoing, and it is accomplished by a number of institutions and agents. People go through a number of stages before becoming fully socialized.\n\nFive groupings can be used to classify the various agents that influence how political attitudes are formed.\n\nPeer groups and families are interpersonal organizations.\norganizations, including workplaces, schools, and places of worship.\nnewspaper, television, and radio are examples of mass media.\nThe legislature, the executive, the judiciary, and the bureaucracy are specialized political input systems.\n\nThis spectrum generally illustrates how people feel about social concerns and the place of government in society. Liberals, who tend to reside in the Northeast and the West Coast, have traditionally held the view that the government should focus more on assisting the economy and less on foreign policy.\n\nConservatives, who predominate in America\u2019s middle and southern areas, tend to believe that the economy requires more assertive foreign policy and less government backing.\n\nLiberals frequently advocate unconventional social reforms, such as allowing same-sex marriage, whereas conservatives favor upholding tradition and are more inclined to credit Christianity with influencing their opinions.\n\nPart of Political ideology and attitude are crucial in determining political ethics because:\n\nIdeology in politics is an edge service. A positive political attitude is required in society for effective politics. Assemblies and Parliament will work longer hours as a result, which is what the constitution and the people ethically expect.\nPolitics ethics largely depend on how accessible a party is to the public and how quickly complaints are resolved. While each is supported by political philosophy, both serve as yardsticks for political attitudes, and having a good one is crucial.\nPositive political attitudes promote political ethics, which is significant because it draws young people into politics and restores faith in democracy during trying times when the country needs it.\nConclusion\n\nIn conclusion, moral views inspire people to engage in altruism, voluntarism, and social service. Because moral attitude is such a powerful emotion, it may be used as a defense against violent behavior and insane behavior and yet be accepted by society.\n\nIt inspires individuals to engage in terrorism, massacres, and riots. People do not get along with individuals who do not share their moral attitude because moral attitude is related to powerful emotions.\n\nPolitical attitude is a belief and behavior system that bases decisions on electoral outcomes.\n\nPositive political attitudes can result in exhibiting zero tolerance for corruption, being pro-poor, providing welfare for weaker groups, and listening to public grievances; however, negative political attitudes can take the form of regionalism and communalizing the populace in order to polarise them during elections.\n\nThe political party it supports is founded on political philosophy.\n\nIt resembles a party\u2019s internal constitution. Every political party has a sound and pro-people political ideology, but they rarely adhere to it because, in order to win elections, individual politicians\u2019 political attitudes are put into action, leading to the use of bribery, lobbying, false protests, walkouts, insensitive defamation of other parties, and perks politics.\n\nArticle Written By: Atheena Fathima Riyas"

They may, however, be used alone as well.\n\nTable of Contents\n\nHow does social influence work?\nSocial Influence Determinants\nReciprocity\nDominance\nScarcity\nThree Social Influence Areas\nConformity\nVisible Badges\nResponsibility Diffusion / Transfer\nPersuasion: What Is It?\nPersuasion occurs in three stages\nPersuasion\u00a0Theory\nPersuasion\u2019s results\nEffects of Persuasion\nPersuasion styles\nMethodical persuasion\nHeuristic influence\nPersuasion\u2019s elements include\nSocial Influence\u2019s Function in Persuasion\nWhat distinguishes persuasion from social influence?\nconclusion\nHow does social influence work?\n\nThe process by which people are exposed to persuasive communication and, as a result, acquire and alter their attitudes, beliefs, intentions, and behaviors are referred to as social influence.\n\nWhen people construct their beliefs based on the opinions of others rather than independent reasoning, social influence is more prevalent.\n\nSocial Influence Determinants\n\nSocial influence is the purposeful or inadvertent change in behavior that one person brings about in another as a result of how the affected person sees themselves in relation to the influencer, other people, and things in their surroundings.\n\nYou can use persuasion to convince someone to modify their behavior or views or to win their acquiescence. Some of the crucial elements affecting social influence include the ones listed below:\n\n\ud83d\udc49 Which year are YOU targeting for success in the IAS/IPS/IFS Exam? \ud83d\ude80\n\n(1) \u21d2 UPSC 2025: Prelims cum Mains\n\n(2) \u21d2 UPSC 2026: Prelims cum Mains\n\n(3) \u21d2 UPSC 2027 Prelims cum Mains\n\nTip: Know more about ClearIAS Courses (Online/Offline)\n\nReciprocity\n\nWhen someone has recently complied with their demands, people are more likely to do the same for them. People also feel compelled to return favors if they believe they owe the other person something.\n\nBecause it causes guilt feelings when someone does not reciprocate when expected, reciprocity is an important consideration in decision-making.\n\nAdditionally, it results in a perpetual circle of reciprocal generosity in which people continue to do favors for one another.\n\nDominance\n\nPeople in positions of power are less likely to be persuaded by reason than by threats and other forms of coercion.\n\nPhysical attractiveness: According to some research, people who are physically appealing are more persuasive than others, even if they don\u2019t appear to be more knowledgeable or competent.\n\nPeople who are attractive are more likely to be accepted, praised, and liked. Other research demonstrates that while women find males wearing red shirts more attractive, men find women wearing red apparel more attractive and sexually desirable.\n\nAccording to research, this may be the result of unintentional links between the color red with romance or love.\n\nScarcity\n\nWhen we think of something as scarce, we typically want it more than when we think of it as plentiful.\n\nThree Social Influence Areas\n\nThe following are the three areas.\n\nConformity\n\nWhen we conform, we follow the rules and standards of a situation or a group. We may act in this manner out of social conformity or because we think it is morally appropriate.\n\nStudy on the #SelfieWithDaughter Case\n\nParents from all over the nation who were celebrating the birth of their kids were featured in the selfie campaign. Most people wanted to fit in, thus an increasing number of parents shared selfies of their daughters online.\n\nThe #SelfieWithDaughter campaign was started by a proud father in a village in Haryana, and it quickly gained international attention.\n\nCompliance is consenting to carry out a request made by another person. When we obey, we carry out their instructions.\n\nUsually, we do this in order to avoid punishment or to get something in return. For instance, we might cooperate with a request to do something because we want a buddy to or we don\u2019t want to get in trouble. Modifying one\u2019s behavior after receiving a clear request from friends, neighbors, family, etc.\n\nIn this, people pretend to agree with one another in public while keeping their disagreements to themselves.\n\nObedience is an action taken in response to a command from someone in a position of authority over us, such as a police officer. Most of the time, the person giving us the command utilizes some kind of force to persuade us that what they are asking us to do is vital.\n\nJustifications for Obeying\n\nVisible Badges\n\nTo remind people who are in charge, the General\u2019s badges are distinct from the Captain\u2019s.\n\nResponsibility Diffusion / Transfer\n\nDiffusion of responsibility when working in a group and transfer of accountability when you are told to complete the task by a superior or another person in authority.\n\nPersuasion: What Is It?\n\nOne type of social impact is persuasion. It is the act of persuading someone to accept a viewpoint or take an action. There are various ways to employ persuasion, but they all have the same goal: persuading someone to agree with you.\n\nThe sender (the person giving the message), the recipient (the one being convinced), and the circumstance all play a role in persuasive messaging (the environment in which messages are delivered).\n\nPersuasion occurs in three stages\n\nPre-suasive conditioning is the term used to describe the initial step of persuasion. This occurs when someone is exposed to a message repeatedly over time until they start to accept it as the norm and grow accustomed to it.\n\nThe central route to persuasion is the name of the second phase. This occurs when a person thoroughly considers the arguments being made to them and makes a decision regarding whether or not to accept them based on logic and reason.\n\nThe peripheral road to persuasion is the name of the third step. This occurs when a person accepts what is being stated without giving it much thought by focusing simply on a few key points of the argument or perhaps just one word in a sentence.\n\nPersuasion\u00a0Theory\n\nBy utilizing written or spoken words to convey knowledge, sentiments, or logic, or a combination of these, one might persuade the Target group to change their attitudes and behaviors toward an event, an idea, an item, or another person (or people).\n\nPersuasion is a Receiver Centric Exercise, it should be noted. It is what the receiver understands, not what the source says, that matters.\n\nThere are four components to persuasion.\n\nWhich party is the information\u2019s or message\u2019s original source?\n\nRecipient / Target Audience: It is given the data provided by the source.\n\nConvincing Message: Appeal made by the source channel or medium that transmits the message or information to the recipient\n\nIt can be summed up as \u2013 Who says, what, to Whom through what means\n\nPersuasion theories: Robert Cialdini\u2018s six principles of persuasion are the most widely used persuasion theory.\n\nThe principle of reciprocity holds that we should return favors in kind. For instance, we feel obliged to repay someone who has given us a present.\n\nOur desire to be consistent with our prior behavior is referred to as commitment and consistency. When we make a commitment to something (like starting a diet), it is challenging for us to change our minds.\n\nThis concept can be used against you if someone urges you to refrain from doing something again after you have already committed not to.\n\nIt might be challenging for you to refuse to do X if they demand that I stop sharing your secret if you don\u2019t do X because of your prior agreement. People will continue to act as long as a reward or penalty is attached to it, thus it can also go the other way. Humans are believed to practice operant conditioning in these situations.\n\nSocial proof is based on the idea that people would look to those around them for indications of how to act in a particular circumstance. An excellent illustration would be the attire worn to a party.\n\nTo know how to dress appropriately for the event, one may think about observing what other people are wearing before determining what to wear.\n\nThis idea is used by authorized persons to persuade an audience by depending on their credibility. Similarly to this, businesses frequently rely on celebrity endorsements to spread their message. The belief is that if a well-known individual like a product, then consumers would as well.\n\nWhen people like another person or business, they are more inclined to comply with their wishes. This is known as like.\n\nCelebrities are frequently thought to only support brands they firmly believe in due to their celebrity and riches, however, it has recently become clear that 50% of the time they do so unpaid!\n\nWhen something becomes widely accessible, people tend to want it less, which is known as the scarcity principle.\n\nLimited-edition products and sales are examples of things that are scarce. Limited offers are a common strategy used by businesses to entice potential buyers to choose their products over those of rivals.\n\nPersuasion\u2019s results\n\nPeople are susceptible to a variety of impacts from persuasion. It has the power to alter how individuals feel, think, and act. It has the power to affect people\u2019s opinions and decision-making processes. Persuasion can also result in more submission and obedience.\n\nPersuasion can also change someone\u2019s perspective. For instance, some people who are persuaded by a public speaker could experience a boost in self-confidence or a sudden need to take action (source).\n\nEffects of Persuasion\n\nAccording to Miller (1980), \u00a0Persuasion can shape, reinforce, or modify reactions. These are three different persuasive effects.\n\nCreating pleasant associations between a thing, a person, or a concept \u201cshapes\u201d attitudes.\n\nContrary to popular belief, many persuasive messages are intended to support rather than change the opinions of the audience.\n\nWhen we think about persuasion, this is perhaps the most significant persuasive impact and the one that comes to mind first. Attitudes can and do change as a result of communication.\n\nPersuasion styles\n\nThere are primarily two styles of persuasion:\n\nMETHODICAL PERSUASION\n\nThe use of logic and reasoning to persuade someone is known as systematic persuasion. Heuristic persuasion relies on emotions, but systematic persuasion is based on logic, reason, and evidence.\n\nHEURISTIC INFLUENCE\n\nWhen you utilize emotional appeals to persuade someone, you are using heuristic persuasion. An advertisement for a horror film is an illustration of heuristic persuasion in action. Giving a rational justification for why people should support your political party would be a persuasive message with systematic persuasion.\n\nPersuasion\u2019s elements include\n\nPersuasion is primarily composed of three elements: source, message, and recipient. The one or thing persuading is called the head. The source\u2019s attempt to convince the recipient by what they say or do is known as the message.\n\nThe target of persuasion is the recipient. Credibility, knowledge, and reliability are examples of source factors. A coherent and well-reasoned argument supported by evidence is one of the message factors.\n\nStrong feelings can also be persuasive since they draw attention to themselves and prevent listeners from considering excuses for not complying. The degree to which people\u2019s needs are addressed in response to requests and how open they are to receiving messages are both considered reception elements.\n\nSocial Influence\u2019s Function in Persuasion\n\nSocial influence is the process by which other people\u2019s attitudes, ideas, and behaviors have an impact on a person. When someone tries to persuade another person to alter their attitude or conduct, persuasion is a type of social influence that takes place.\n\nTo persuade someone, the persuader may employ a variety of strategies, such as posing a threat or offering a reward.\n\nWhat distinguishes persuasion from social influence?\n\nOne person tries to persuade another to change their attitude or conduct through the one-way process of persuasion. Social influence, on the other hand, is a two-way process in which both parties attempt to influence one another.\n\nTwo friends trying to convince each other to quit their relationship with their current partner is an example of social influence. In this instance, they make an effort to socially sway one another by utilizing logic and feelings to decide.\n\nIt is conceivable for the two persons to differ over whether one friend should remain with their partner or break up with them. In the absence of conflicts, it would be considered persuasion as opposed to social influence because there was no difference in the participants\u2019 opinions.\n\nconclusion\n\nThe ability to employ social influence for good or harm makes it a potent instrument. It has the power to influence individuals to take actions they might not otherwise take or to comply with demands. Understanding how social influences operate may help you make wiser decisions in your life because there are many different methods to affect other people.\n\nClick here to read more such notes.\n\nArticle written by: Atheena Fathima Riyaz"

It is something that a person is naturally good at or has the potential to be good at, often without needing to be taught or trained.\n\nAptitude is generally considered something that a person is born with, although it can also be developed through practice and experience.\nIn the context of the civil service, aptitude refers to the inherent abilities and skills that a person has that make them well-suited for a career in public service.\nHow is it different from skills, intelligence, or interest?\n\nAptitude, skills, intelligence, and interest are all related, but they are not the same thing. Here is a brief overview of the differences between these terms:\n\nAptitude: Aptitude refers to a natural talent or ability that someone has for a particular activity or skill. It is something that a person is naturally good at or has the potential to be good at, often without needing to be taught or trained.\nSkills: Skills are the abilities that a person has developed through learning and practice. They can be either technical skills, such as the ability to use certain software or equipment, or more general skills, such as communication or problem-solving.\nIntelligence: Intelligence is a general term that refers to a person\u2019s ability to learn and understand new things, and to think and reason effectively. It is often measured using intelligence tests or other standardized assessments.\nInterest: Interest is a desire or inclination to learn more about or pursue a particular activity or subject. It is often what motivates a person to develop their skills and knowledge in a particular area.\n\nWhile aptitude, skills, intelligence, and interest can all contribute to a person\u2019s success in the civil service, aptitude is generally considered to be the most innate and inherent of these qualities.\n\n\ud83d\udc49 Which year are YOU targeting for success in the IAS/IPS/IFS Exam? \ud83d\ude80\n\n(1) \u21d2 UPSC 2025: Prelims cum Mains\n\n(2) \u21d2 UPSC 2026: Prelims cum Mains\n\n(3) \u21d2 UPSC 2027 Prelims cum Mains\n\nTip: Know more about ClearIAS Courses (Online/Offline)\n\nWhat is the difference between aptitude and attitude?\nWhile attitude refers to how you feel about a particular person, thing, event, or idea, aptitude refers to your ability to perform a particular kind of task. It is possible to develop both aptitude and attitude.\nWhile aptitude is linked to competence, attitude is linked to character or virtues.\nWhile character, virtues, and moral ideals are supported by attitude, aptitude decides whether a person will acquire the necessary skills to complete a task.\nAptitude is both mental and physical, whereas attitude is solely mental.\nWhat are the required aptitudes for a civil servant?\n\nSeveral aptitudes are important for success in the civil service. Some of the key aptitudes that are required for a career in the civil service include:\n\nProblem-solving: Civil servants are often faced with complex problems that require creative and innovative solutions. As such, they need to have strong problem-solving skills to identify and address challenges as they arise.\nCritical thinking: Civil servants must be able to analyze and evaluate information to make informed decisions. This requires the ability to think critically and to consider multiple perspectives.\nCommunication: Civil servants need to be able to communicate effectively with a wide range of people, including other government employees, elected officials, and the general public. This requires strong writing and speaking skills, as well as the ability to listen actively and empathize with others.\nOrganization: Civil servants often work on multiple projects simultaneously and must be able to manage their time and resources effectively. Good organizational skills are essential to keep track of tasks and meet deadlines.\nAdaptability: The civil service is a dynamic environment, and civil servants must be able to adapt to changing circumstances and priorities. This requires flexibility and the ability to learn new things quickly.\nLeadership: Civil servants may be called upon to lead teams or projects, and strong leadership skills are essential to inspire and motivate others.\nCollaboration: Civil servants often work in teams and must be able to collaborate effectively with others to achieve common goals. This requires the ability to work well with others and to build positive relationships.\nEthical judgment: Civil servants are entrusted with significant responsibilities and must be able to make ethical decisions that serve the best interests of the public. Strong ethical judgment is essential to uphold the integrity of the civil service.\nWhat is the importance of aptitude in civil services?\n\nAptitude is important in the civil service because it reflects a person\u2019s natural abilities and skills, and can help to predict their potential success in a particular role.\n\nAptitude tests are often used as part of the selection process for civil service positions because they can provide insight into a candidate\u2019s inherent abilities and potential for success.\nHaving the right aptitudes can also help to make the job of a civil servant more enjoyable and rewarding. For example, someone with strong problem-solving skills may find it more fulfilling to work on complex challenges, while someone with good communication skills may enjoy interacting with the public.\nFoundational Values Of Civil Service\n\nFoundational values are the core principles and beliefs that guide the behavior and actions of an individual or organization.\n\nIn the context of the civil service, foundational values are the guiding principles that inform the work of civil servants and help to ensure that they act in the best interests of the public.\nWhen we talk about the people who run our government and make sure everything works smoothly for us, there are some really important qualities they need to have.\n\nLet\u2019s dive into what these qualities are and why they\u2019re super important for people in civil service.\n\nIntegrity: Being Honest and Fair\nThink of integrity as being the superhero of honesty. It means always doing the right thing, even when no one is watching.\nFor people in government, it\u2019s like a promise to always be honest, follow the rules, and make decisions that are good for everyone, not just for themselves.\nThis builds trust between the government and us, the people.\n\nRead more: Integrity\n\nImpartiality and Non-Partisanship: Fairness for All\nImpartiality is a fancy word for being fair to everyone, no matter what.\nNon-partisanship means not letting political party loyalty influence decisions.\nSo, government servants should treat everyone the same, no matter who they support politically or what they believe in.\nThis makes sure that government services are delivered fairly to all of us.\n\nRead more:\u00a0Impartiality and Non-Partisanship\n\nObjectivity: Just the Facts\nObjectivity means making decisions based on solid facts and real information, not on personal feelings or opinions.\nIt\u2019s like being a judge in a talent show and picking the winner based on their performance, not because they\u2019re friends. This helps government workers make fair and effective decisions.\n\nRead more:\u00a0Objectivity\n\nDedication to Public Service: Going the Extra Mile\nDedication to public service is all about caring for and committing to helping people through jobs in the government.\nIt\u2019s like being part of a team where the main goal of a civil servant is to make life better for everyone in the community, especially when times are tough.\n\nRead more:\u00a0Dedication to Public Service\n\nEmpathy, Tolerance, and Compassion: Understanding and Caring\nEmpathy is putting oneself in someone else\u2019s shoes to understand how they feel.\nTolerance is about accepting and respecting people who are different from us.\nCompassion means wanting to help those who are suffering or having a hard time.\nFor people in government, these qualities are crucial because they help make sure that everyone, especially those who need extra support, is looked after and treated kindly.\n\nRead more:\u00a0Sympathy, Empathy and Compassion: Know the Difference\n\nAdditional foundational values of civil services\nThe values\u2014integrity, impartiality, objectivity, dedication, empathy, tolerance, and compassion\u2014are super important for anyone working in the government.\nThey help make sure that our government is trustworthy, fair, and caring\nIt\u2019s like having a rulebook for being awesome at serving the public and making sure everyone is treated right.\n\nIn addition to this, also understand some additional values.\n\nProfessionalism: Professionalism is the quality of being competent, reliable, and respectful. Civil servants are expected to conduct themselves with a high level of professionalism to maintain the trust of the public.\nResponsibility: Responsibility is the obligation to act in a particular way or to achieve a particular goal. Civil servants have a responsibility to serve the public and to act in the best interests of the community.\nService: Service is the act of helping or assisting others. Civil servants are in the business of serving the public, and a commitment to service is an essential value for anyone working in the civil service.\nTransparency: Transparency is the quality of being open and honest. Civil servants must be transparent in their actions and decisions to ensure accountability and maintain the trust of the public.\nNolan Committee recommendations\n\nThe Nolan Committee was a committee of experts that was established in the United Kingdom in 1994 to review the ethical standards of public life.\n\nThe committee was chaired by Lord Nolan, a senior judge, and its mandate was to identify the principles that should govern the conduct of public servants and to make recommendations for improving standards of integrity in public life.\n\nIt identified seven principles that should govern the conduct of public servants in the United Kingdom.\n\nThese principles, known as the \u201cSeven Nolan Principles,\u201d are:\n\nSelflessness: Public servants should act solely in terms of the public interest. They should not act in their interests or the interests of any particular group.\nIntegrity: Public servants should not place themselves under any financial or other obligation to outside individuals or organizations that might influence them in the performance of their duties.\nObjectivity: Public servants should make decisions on merit, and should not be influenced by personal interests or the interests of any particular group.\nAccountability: Public servants should be accountable for their actions and decisions, and should be prepared to justify them.\nOpenness: Public servants should be transparent in their actions and decisions, and should be willing to disclose information to the public as appropriate.\nHonesty: Public servants should be truthful and candid in their dealings with others.\nLeadership: Public servants should exhibit leadership and demonstrate integrity, objectivity, and openness in their own behavior to set an example for others to follow.\nHow are they important?\n\nThe significance of foundational values in the civil service cannot be overstated.

He lived a long life and passed away in 1962 at the ripe old age of 101. After retiring in 1918, he continued to be involved in public life for forty-four years.\n\nOne day after finishing his work for the day and realizing that it was now dark, Sir M.V. stopped for the night at a government guest house.

It reflects adherence to ethical code with incorruptible virtues of uprightness and honesty. Ashok Khemka and Abdul kalam can also be cited as good examples of people with a high level of integrity.\n\nThe recent scams like PMC Bank, and PNB Bank scam etc are the result of a lack of integrity among individuals showing the low level of integrity prevailing in society.\n\nTable of Contents\n\nTypes of Integrity\nSources of Integrity\nImportance of values in Administration\nSuggestions for Improvement of Integrity in Civil Services\nTypes of Integrity\n\nThere are different types of Integrity, which are as follows:\n\nIntellectual integrity: It requires being willing to stand up for your best judgment of truth by willing to act following the judgment when the need arises. When we fail to stand up for our best judgment of truth, we are said to lack intellectual integrity.\n\nIt requires truth for its sake and it needs one to overcome self-deception and temptation offered by commercialism. It is characterized by openness and fairness\u00a0\n\nFor example, Socrates was an outstanding example of a person of intellectual integrity who was committed to the pursuit of truth and knowledge and demonstrated it even in the time of attacks on his integrity\n\nPersonal Integrity: It is about organizing one\u2019s desires, commitments, volitions, values, and actions in such a way that there is no conflict between any one of them. When a person possesses personal integrity then various aspects of his self are fully integrated\n\nIt requires that the person should commit to some consistent set of principles and commitments in times of temptations and challenges and uphold these principles or commitments.\n\nFor example, the holders of public office should not place themselves under any financial or other obligation to outside individuals or organizations that might seek to influence them in the performance of their official duties.\n\nMoral Integrity: Moral integrity refers to consistency and honesty in the application of standards of morality or right and wrong which is used for judging others as well as ourselves.\n\nIt requires an unconditional and unwavering commitment to some of the other moral principles. We can\u2019t have moral integrity without having personal integrity\n\nFor Example, Buddha emphasized the purity of thoughts, words, and deeds.\n\nSources of Integrity\nDPSP-\u201cUphold and safeguard the sovereignty, unity, and integrity of India,\u201d as stated in Part IV-A and Article 51A, is one of the fundamental obligations.\nInner conscience-The best way to uphold our ideals is always determined by one\u2019s inner conscience.\nUnited Nations code of conduct-The UN adopted India\u2019s Central Civil Services (Conduct) Rules as the \u201cInternational Code of Conduct for Public Officials.\u201d\nRole Models-Recognizing the integrity of those who uphold the organization\u2019s values For instance, the PM will recognize and present honors to the best administrators at the annual Vigilance Awards, Civil Services Day, and Good Governance Day.\nPeer Group and parents-We can learn from our peers and parents.\nPublic servants-Numerous case studies of retired government officials can be used to motivate others because people tend to mimic the actions of the people they see as their role models.\n\nThe younger generation is frequently taught how to respect integrity through the provision of foundational training and mid-career coaching.\n\nImportance of values in Administration\n\nThe nation\u2019s overall development did not interest the British government. Indians were offered all lower posts. The pay for these positions was meager. They engaged in corrupt behavior. It developed and become a habit over time.\n\nWe need to adopt values and aspirations because of \u201crapid urbanization and industrialization,\u201d where status in society is determined by one\u2019s place in society, economic power, and material belongings. Poor civil servants are easy prey to corrupt activities because of low pay and ongoing inflation, which makes it difficult for them to retain their social standing.\n\nOne of the primary causes of corruption is certainly the inadequate pay provided by salary scales and the rising expense of living. The fast-rising cost of living in recent years has reduced actual income, notably for the paid classes.\n\nPeople don\u2019t report corrupt authorities to the government. Instead, they make bribe offers to get their false statements accepted.\n\nPolitics being criminalized and excessive administrative meddling contributed to the decline of integrity in public life. The public trust in the government machinery is thereby deteriorating.\n\nThe procedures are difficult and time-consuming. It is said that the operations of some government agencies, such as Customs and Central Excise, Imports and Exports, Railways, Supplies and Disposals, Police, Income Tax, etc., are difficult and time-consuming. As a result, dishonest methods like the \u201cspeedy money\u201d scheme are emerging.\n\nThere are inadequate laws to address the menace of corruption. The IPC and other laws that address cases of corruption are outdated and offer insufficient punishments. The legal process for punishing a corrupt official is far too drawn out.\n\nArticle 311 of the Indian Constitution, which grants civil workers protection, has been interpreted by our courts in a way that makes it challenging to deal with dishonest public officials.\n\nThe problem has been made worse by higher officials\u2019 reluctance to punish corrupt employees because they cooperated with them.\n\nPressure groups, including trade associations and the Indian Chamber of Commerce, and State Chambers of Commerce are alleged to contribute to the spread of corruption through their efforts to secure favors for their local areas.\n\nThe Prevention of Corruption Act, the Civil Servants Conduct Rules, the Central Vigilance Commission (CVC) AND State Vigilance Commission, the Central Bureau of Investigation, and the Institutions of Lok Pal and Lok Ayukta are the current institutional mechanisms, regulations, and legal framework for addressing lack of integrity.\n\nSuggestions for Improvement of Integrity in Civil Services\n\nCreate the terms of service Attractive, public services are provided in exchange for additional funds, these services are often subpar and sluggish without payment of a bribe. Therefore, is a fundamental way to eradicate pervasive bribery in the civil service.\n\nReengineering government processes to make them simpler as the convoluted processes used by government entities appear to be the primary contributor to the spread of corruption. These processes require evaluation and simplification. Officials must be responsive to the needs of all citizens and delays must be avoided.\n\nWe can try to form a positive public opinion as corruption will continue to thrive until the majority of people resolutely and forcefully oppose it. It takes widespread, unwavering resistance to corruption, as well as the guts to take action to end it.\n\nEnsuring high standards of behavior among key employees High Officials who exercise a great deal of discretion must maintain strict discipline to turn down gifts, invitations, and other favors.\n\nReducing points of contact will reduce the likelihood of corruption and requests for bribes. As an illustration, using IT for service delivery will move processes online, eliminating interaction points and potential points of bribery.\n\nTherefore, integrity is essential in the public sector to ensure good governance, enabling employees to carry out their jobs honestly and promoting improved administration.\n\nArticle written by Jewel."

It means treating all individuals and groups equally and without prejudice. In order to be impartial, a person should not allow their personal beliefs or feelings to influence their decisions or actions.\n\nThis is important in many contexts, such as in the judicial system, where judges and jurors are expected to be impartial, or in journalism, where reporters are expected to present factual information without bias.

An unbiased SDM/DSP, for example, will command the respect of the people and hence acquire their assistance in various conflict management scenarios.\n\nIt contributes to the development of an equitable attitude toward everything and everyone. For example, impartiality will assist a DM/DC in providing the benefits of a government scheme without bias based on caste or religion.\n\nNon Partisanship\n\nNonpartisanship refers to the state of not being affiliated with or biased toward any particular political party or ideology. It is the idea of being neutral and unbiased in political matters, and not taking sides with one party or another. Nonpartisanship is often associated with fairness and objectivity.\n\nIt is important in many contexts where political neutrality is important, such as in journalism or in some government agencies. Nonpartisanship can be difficult to maintain, as individuals may have personal beliefs and opinions that influence their actions, but it is an important principle to strive for in order to promote fairness and impartiality.\n\nHow does non partisanship ensure ethical governance?\n\nIt will assist a government worker in making decisions free of fear or favoritism toward any political party and in accordance with constitutional norms. Non-partisanship, for example, will assist a DM/DC in carrying out the duties of a RO efficiently during elections.\n\nIt guarantees that the elected representative and government servants have an effective/professional relationship. Non-partisanship, for example, will increase/maintain a chief secretary\u2018s credibility regardless of the party in power.\n\nDifference between impartiality and non-partisanship\n\nImpartiality and nonpartisanship are closely related concepts, but there is a subtle difference between the two. Impartiality refers to the state of being fair and unbiased, and not allowing personal beliefs or feelings to influence one\u2019s decisions or actions. It is about treating all individuals and groups equally and without prejudice.\n\nFor example, a judge should be impartial and not allow their personal beliefs or feelings to influence their decision in a case.\n\nNonpartisanship, on the other hand, refers to the state of not being affiliated with or biased toward any particular political party or ideology. It is about being neutral and unbiased in political matters, and not taking sides with one party or another.\n\nFor example, a journalist should be nonpartisan and present factual information about a political issue without promoting a particular party or candidate.\n\nHere is an example to illustrate the difference between the two concepts:\n\nImagine a person named Sarah who is running for public office. Sarah has strong personal beliefs about certain issues, such as gun control and abortion. As a candidate, Sarah should strive to be impartial and treat all voters fairly, regardless of their views on these issues. However, Sarah may also choose to run as a nonpartisan candidate, meaning that she is not affiliated with any particular political party and is not seeking the support of any particular party. In this case, Sarah would be expected to present her views and policy positions in a neutral manner, without promoting the interests of any particular party.\n\nWhile both concepts involve being unbiased and fair, impartiality is more general and applies to all situations, while nonpartisanship specifically relates to political matters. However, both are important for ensuring fairness and objectivity in various contexts, such as in the judicial system, journalism, and government agencies.\n\nChallenges in maintaining impartiality and non partisanship in governance\n\nThere are several challenges in maintaining impartiality and nonpartisanship in governance, including:\n\nPersonal beliefs and biases: It can be difficult for individuals to set aside their personal beliefs and biases when making decisions or taking actions. This can be especially challenging when the issues at hand are emotionally charged or relate to deeply held personal beliefs.\nPolitical pressure: Government officials may face pressure from politicians or other powerful interests to act in a particular way or to support a particular party or ideology. This can make it difficult for them to maintain impartiality and nonpartisanship and to act in the best interests of the public as a whole.\nConflicts of interest: Government officials may have personal or financial interests that conflict with their duties as a public servant. This can make it difficult for them to maintain impartiality and to act in the best interests of the public.\nLimited information: In some cases, government officials may not have access to all of the information they need to make informed decisions. This can make it difficult for them to be impartial and nonpartisan, as they may have to make decisions based on incomplete or biased information.\nPublic perception: Even if government officials are acting in an impartial and nonpartisan manner, they may be perceived as being biased by the public or media. This can damage the credibility and trust of the government.\nMeasures to ensure impartiality and non-partisanship in governance\n\nThere are several measures that can be taken to ensure impartiality and nonpartisanship in governance, including:\n\nEstablishing clear rules and guidelines: By establishing clear rules and guidelines for decision-making and behavior, organizations can help to ensure that individuals act in an impartial and nonpartisan manner.\nProviding training and education: Training and education programs can help individuals to understand the importance of impartiality and nonpartisanship and how to avoid personal biases when making decisions.\nImplementing conflict of interest policies: By implementing conflict of interest policies, organizations can help to ensure that individuals with personal or financial interests that may conflict with their duties as a public servant are not involved in decision-making processes.\nEnsuring transparency: By making information and decision-making processes transparent, organizations can help to ensure that individuals and groups are held accountable for their actions and that the public can see that decisions are being made in an impartial and nonpartisan manner.\nEstablishing independent review mechanisms: By establishing independent review mechanisms, organizations can provide an additional level of oversight to ensure that decisions and actions are fair and unbiased.\nConclusion\n\nWhen there is a crisis of conscience and an ethical quandary to choose between right and wrong, impartiality and nonpartisanship eventually provide neutrality and develop principles of integrity and objectivity. This eventually develops to genuine dedication to public duty.\n\nMr. T.N. Sheshan was able to thrive in difficult conditions while maintaining dignity and respect because he always adhered to the principles of neutrality, non-partisanship, and impartiality. This mindset has helped to overhaul the Election Commission.\n\nIn a nutshell, non-partisanship and impartiality maintain neutrality through promoting good governance, apolitical functioning, and decision-making transparency. These values are required to construct protections against conflict of interest in order to reestablish adherence to the diverse ideals established in the Constitution\u2019s preamble.\n\nArticle written by: Caroline"

It appears that a person\u2019s intrinsic worth largely depends on the existence of both an objective existence and a subjective conscious life.\n\nPlato\n\nPlato is renowned for having a unique perspective on objective reality.\n\nHe essentially argued that the greatest reality was in what he refers to as Forms, or Ideas, rather than the common physical objects we perceive around us.\n\nAristotle\n\n\u00a0Aristotle\u2019s notion of objective knowledge is significantly different from Plato\u2019s, but his metaphysics seems to fit our understanding of objective reality more closely than Plato\u2019s did.\u00a0\n\nAccording to him, understanding the essences or forms of things is objective knowledge.\n\nEven while we can\u2019t always know something objectively, we can. Individuals may only be known through regular perceptual contact, whereas shapes can be perfectly or eternally known.\n\nObjectivism and Subjectivism\n\nObjectives may or may not be subjective, but never the other way around.\n\nFor instance, the phrase \u201cclimbing mountains is a difficult undertaking\u201d is both subjective and maybe objective.\n\nHowever, the phrase \u201cMount Everest is the tallest peak\u201d is objective.\n\nAn objective assertion is one that is totally factual, real, unbiased, and balanced. Subjective refers to something that lacks objectivity or is merely an individual\u2019s perspective or expression of opinion.\nFacts and observations provide the basis of an objective assertion. A subjective assertion, on the other hand, is predicated on presumptions, beliefs, and views, as well as being impacted by feelings and emotions.\nProvable, quantifiable, and observable information is considered objective. Contrarily, subjective information is specific to the maker, or the subject.\nThe objective statement is verifiable and can be confirmed. A subjective statement or a collection of balanced perspectives. They cannot be checked or validated.\nInformation is objective, it remains the same regardless of who reported it. A subjective statement, on the other hand, varies from person to person.\nMaking decisions based on an objective statement is appropriate, however, doing so with a subjective statement is not.\nA subjective statement is used in blogs, biographies, and comments on social media, but an objective statement can be found in textbooks, encyclopedias, and rigorous science.\n\nInformation that is objective produces the whole truth; that is, it tells a story from all sides in a methodical manner.\n\nIt is a verifiable fact that it exists.\n\nContrarily, subjective data is influenced by the personality of the individual who provides it.\n\nIt is a fantastic interpretation or analysis of the facts based on individual viewpoints, opinions, and other factors.\n\nHow to Inculcate Objectivity\nWritten regulations should be implemented with less discretion in order to ensure objectivity in administration.\nIncreasing emotional intelligence and empathy for the underprivileged in society.\n\u00a0Allowing freedom to execute creative ideas at the field level rather than following every instruction from superiors, but only with their written consent.\nTransparency and openness allow for the assurance of objectivity.\nThe innovative information management system improves objectivity.\nCriticism against Objectivity\nAdministration becomes lethargic when there are too many objectives.\nIn some instances, objectivity kills field-level innovation and creativity. Good ideas are discouraged by excessive meddling from the secretariat or headquarters.\nA decision cannot always be made fairly based just on facts and statistics. It makes a man a wholly emotionless individual.\nInefficiency in the delivery of public services. For instance, a teenage girl recently died of starvation in Jharkhand as a result of the mandated linkage of the Aadhaar card with the ration card. She had gone several weeks without obtaining any food ration from the public distribution.\nReduce administrative capacity to handle unusual circumstances. Due to the complexity of Indian law, it is occasionally impossible to achieve 100% adherence to a rule without breaking a few other laws.\n\u00a0Adhering to absolute objectivity in governance may result in delays, inaction, and the inability of the government or the different departments and agencies that make up the executive branch to make policy decisions that control the nation and the economy.\nConclusion\n\nAlthough objectivity is important, one must approach with caution and keep both the text and the context in mind in order to come up with the best decision. Because of this, it is argued that pragmatism and objectivism should be combined rather than using a pure form of objectivity.\u00a0\u00a0\n\nArticle Written By: Aryadevi E S"

Dedication can also be said to be committed with passion. The dedication highlights the aspects of emotional intelligence along with commitment.\n\nThe dedication is relevant to civil services follow can be seen through the following examples:\n\n\ud83d\udc49 Which year are YOU targeting for success in the IAS/IPS/IFS Exam? \ud83d\ude80\n\n(1) \u21d2 UPSC 2025: Prelims cum Mains\n\n(2) \u21d2 UPSC 2026: Prelims cum Mains\n\n(3) \u21d2 UPSC 2027 Prelims cum Mains\n\nTip: Know more about ClearIAS Courses (Online/Offline)\n\nMG Rajamanikyam carried rice sacks on his shoulder without hesitation during the Kerala flood.\nAshok Khemka \u2014 45 transfers in 23 years.\nSmita Sabharwal \u2013 \u201cfund your city\u201d project for infrastructure development.\nDifference Between Dedication And Motivation\n\nThough motivation is a strong driving force, psychological studies have shown the effect of motivating actions being temporary, it is often found to be fleeting. It is the will and courage to initiate a work but in the long run, the impact of, motivation fades away.\n\nThe lack of dedication puts down the motivation level.\n\nThere is a saying \u201c Dedication will get you up the mountain, while motivation will get you to base camp.\u201d\n\nThe example of Glenn Cunningham is a perfect example to show the importance of dedication, despite being a victim of a tragic incident in early childhood, he had burnt half of his low body. His mother motivated him to dream big and walk again.\n\nBut through his dedication, he went on to win the fastest mile in the USA.\n\nPerseverance and Commitment\n\nThe quality of perseverance is the ability to stay calm and focused when all things around you are not as per the plan. It is the ability to have faith in oneself and vision to see the good despite all the hardships.\n\nExample: How does a sportsman react to failures in practice, real matches, and events? Great athletes like Usain Bolt, Michel Phelps, etc have all believed in the process and stayed true to their practice and process in order to achieve great heights.\n\nAt the same time commitment is an agreement to carry out a specific activity at a specific time in the future under specific conditions. The act of committing to a course of action is known as commitment. It has an element of discipline.\n\nWhy Dedication is Important For Civil Servants?\n\nAs per the Nolan committee for Public Services one of the 7 values for public life is \u2018probity\u2019. Probity is the display of integrity, honesty, and other values. It is evidence of ethical behavior in life.\n\nSuch high standards demand dedication to the public on conduct and ethical perspective. The nature of the job for civil servants demands an exceptional level of dedication:\n\nA civil servant may encounter several obstructions like social opposition against any program, lack of support from the political executive, and complex situations that need utmost care and precautions\nPublic service frequently involves unexpected or sudden situations that need readiness and prompt assessment.\nA true civil servant ensures that no policy or action is taken at the cost of the welfare of the public at large.\nNew innovative ideas and solutions to problems are required.\nIn India, where a large population is poverty-ridden, many are victims of social disadvantage and vulnerability, and treating civil services as just another job may not give the civil servant the required encouragement and urge to eliminate this from society.\nExamples of Dedication In Public Services\nIAS officer MG Rajamanikyam carried rice sacks on his shoulder without hesitation during the Kerala flood.\nIAS officer Ashok Khemka was transferred 45 times in 23 years.\nSonam Wangchuk started operation New Hope- revolutionizing education in Ladakh.\nCompassionate Kozhikode,a program to alleviate hunger was started by then district collector, Kozhikode N.Prashant Nair\nArmstrong Pame a young bureaucrat, built the People\u2019s road in Manipur only using voluntary contributions\nAruna Sundara Rajan- Headed Kudumbashree project\nFactors that Determine Dedication\n\nSeveral factors can make it easy to understand the factors that determine dedication.\n\nInstitutionalization\n\nThis is particularly true in the case of police and military forces. Through training and drills, the new recruit is so thoroughly institutionalized in the execution of their responsibilities that they are prepared for the \u201cCall of Duty.\u201d\n\nAdditionally, when they initially join, recruits are just like any other individual, seeking employment and financial security; yet, after receiving training and institutionalization, they start to put the interests of the country first.\n\nAltruism and Self-Actualization\n\nExamples of this include statesmen, noble physicians, and trusted civil servants. In this case, a lot of people identify as altruistic and believe that helping the country fulfills their potential and caliber.\n\nThey invest their time, energy, and even work-life balance into enhancing public space outcomes by utilizing their management capabilities, joint efforts, and experience. They prioritize their duties and feel accomplished when they carry them out to the best of their abilities.\n\nEarly Socialization and Value Development in an Individual\n\nPeople who are raised with values like patriotism, service, and sacrifice reflect these values later in life by giving back to society. These ideals were ingrained in them by their parents, their school, and their community.\n\nBenevolence\n\nThe ethical spirit of public administration is benevolence toward all. Unlike business administration, which is concerned with the private good, it is about the public good.\n\n\u201cGovernment work is merely governmental work without benevolence.\u201d Our field takes on a new meaning and purpose with benevolence, going beyond just doing a good job; the work we do becomes noble\u2014a kind of civic virtue.\u201d\n\nArticle Written By: Priti Raj"

For instance, you might start blushing or feel queasy when you witness someone else blushing.\n\nCognitive Empathy\n\nUnderstanding another person\u2019s mental state and potential thoughts in reaction to the scenario.\n\nThis is associated with the theory of mind, sometimes known as thinking about what other people are thinking.\n\nHow Empathy Makes Life More Beautiful\n\nEmpathy is a skill with many useful applications in daily life.\n\nYou can establish social ties with other people by empathizing with them.\n\nYou can react effectively in social situations if you are aware of what other people are thinking and feeling. Social relationships are critical for both physical and psychological well-being, according to research.\n\nLearning to control your own emotions through empathy with others. Emotional control is crucial because it enables you to control your emotions even under extreme stress without being overwhelmed.\n\nEmpathy promotes a service mentality with people. When you have empathy for other people, not only are you more inclined to act in a helpful manner, but other people are also more likely to assist you.\n\nElements of Empathy\n\nThe following are the elements of empathy.\n\nEmpathy as a Virtue\n\nMoral sentimentalism, a school of ethics, holds that morality derives from our desires and emotions.\n\nMoral sentimentalism offers logical justifications for prevalent moral characteristics.\n\nEmpathy, a word that is frequently used to describe a form of concern for another, is seen as a crucial quality.\n\nRational Element\n\nAccording to some other philosophers, empathy also has a rational component. Since it involves fairness, justice, and interconnectedness, it may be regarded as rational in nature and its application as an activity based on sound judgment.\n\nBiological evolution-related\n\nEmpathy is said to be a fundamental component of human nature. It may have developed during the course of human biological evolution, similar to other components of our mental composition.\n\nAs a result, it has aided in human adaptation to the environment, survival, and procreation.\n\nRisks Associated with Empathy\n\nWhen you have a lot of empathy, you care about other people\u2019s pleasure and health. It also implies, though, that thinking about other people\u2019s emotions constantly can occasionally leave you feeling overburdened, exhausted, or even overstimulated.\n\nThe exhaustion you could experience after frequently being exposed to painful or upsetting experiences is referred to as compassion fatigue.

The amount and level of emotional intelligence in a person are known as the emotional quotient.\n\nThere is a difference between Classic Intelligence and Emotional Intelligence. Classic intelligence can be defined as what is measured by IQ tests. These tests are about the skills which are required to analyze and solve problems. However, implementing the solution requires emotional intelligence. Classical intelligence alone is not enough to produce consistent results. Intelligent actions are now a result of both emotions as well as reasoning. Emotional intelligence is about being intelligent about your emotions. IQ gets you hired whereas EQ gets you promoted.\n\n\ud83d\udc49 Which year are YOU targeting for success in the IAS/IPS/IFS Exam? \ud83d\ude80\n\n(1) \u21d2 UPSC 2025: Prelims cum Mains\n\n(2) \u21d2 UPSC 2026: Prelims cum Mains\n\n(3) \u21d2 UPSC 2027 Prelims cum Mains\n\nTip: Know more about ClearIAS Courses (Online/Offline)\n\nFor example, Suppose you are an SP handling a mob lynching situation in your district. Some of your men get injured while doing their duty. As you do not have orders from above you and your team are not left with many options. Here you would need emotional intelligence to handle the situation.\n\nEmotional Intelligence can be identified in people based on positive and negative characteristics of their behaviour, whether good or bad or high or low EI.\n\nAbility model by Mayer and Salovey\n\nEmotional perception: It is the ability to recognize emotional cues and help a person to gauge and understand problems through the application of emotions better. For example, if a person is sad he will show signs of discontent and underperformance at work.\n\nEmotional Reasoning: It is the ability to use emotions for application in thinking and organizing activities. For example, the policies of the government are enacted after proper reasoning and belief and taking the needs of every section of society into consideration.\n\nUnderstanding the emotions: It is important to understand the emotions of others and consider them as the causal factor. For example, understand that if your senior is angry at you, it may be because his mood is not good today or he might not is satisfied with his performance.\n\nManagement of emotions: It is important to manage emotions and show flexibility and optimism in the approach while dealing with situations.\n\nGoleman\u2019s Model\n\nEmotional Intelligence at an individual level\n\nIn today\u2019s world when everything is so fast and it is very easy to be excited and overwhelmed by professional duties which can affect mental health, thus emotional intelligence becomes important to prevent such situations and have a positive outlook. For example, it can help in dealing with anxiety and depression and keeping a negative outlook away.\n\nIt helps in creating a suitable work-life balance which is the need of the hour in this busy world with regard to professional and personal responsibilities. For example, time management will help in giving ample time to hobbies and family apart from the busy office schedule.\n\nThis helps in inculcating stronger relationships as it allows us to communicate more effectively and forge stronger relationships both at work and in our personal life. For example, taking emotional cues can help in better understanding colleagues and dealing with them with sensitivity.\n\nThere is a positive effect of emotional intelligence on the success of individuals at work and will help in better job performance. For example, a more motivated person will work efficiently without excuses, fatigue, and disinterest.\n\nEmotional intelligence for a civil servant\n\nAn administrator is expected to resolve conflicts more efficiently. For example, if there is a riot in his district, he will be able to understand the people\u2019s emotions and use law and order, he will also try to pacify people by using emotional intelligence.\n\nAn emotionally intelligent civil servant doesn\u2019t take anything personally while discharging his duties. For example, an administrator while doing his duties sometimes gets hurt with insults too and an emotionally intelligent administrator will associate it with professional obligation and will depersonalize with it.\n\nThe administrator needs to be empathetic while discharging their duties. For example, when a disabled person was unable to sit on a chair, IAS Kaustubh himself sat on the floor with him.\n\nIt helps in managing difficult situations while discharging duties during hard times. For example, during floods, an administrator has to take care of various things from managing the flood-affected areas to the people involved in it along with the proper care provided, such as temporary homes.\n\nIt helps an administrator to be true to the fundamental values and abide by the core values\u00a0even in difficult situations. For example, IAS Ashok Khemka exposed irregularities in the DLF group even after immense political pressure and bureaucratic harassment.\n\nRead: Utilities and application of Emotional Intelligence in administration and governance\n\nNeed for Emotional Intelligence\n\nAristotle has said that anyone can be angry which is easy but to be angry with the right person at the right time and for the right purpose is not within everyone\u2019s power and is not easy.\n\nWhen our emotional health is in a bad state so is our level of self-confidence and self-esteem. We have to slow down and deal with what is troubling us so that we can enjoy the simple joy of being happy and at peace with ourselves.\n\n\u2013 Jess C.

Socrates is known for\u00a0proclaiming his total ignorance; he used to say that the only thing he was aware of was his ignorance, seeking to imply that the realization of our ignorance is the first step in philosophizing.\n\nHe was sentenced to death after being accused of impiety and corrupting the youth.\n\nSocrates initiates his discourse with an expert on a subject by seeking a definition by asking, for example, what virtue, goodness, justice, or courage is; as his discussions prioritize definitions.\n\nPlato\u2019s Socrates often claims that he is aware of his lack of knowledge, especially when discussing ethical concepts such as goodness, and courage since he does not know the nature of such concepts. Socrates accepts that acknowledging one\u2019s lack of knowledge is the first step to wisdom.\n\nSocrates exerted a strong influence on philosophers in a later period and also in the modern era. Socrates was studied by medieval scholars and played an important role in the thought of the Italian Renaissance, particularly within the humanist movement. Interest in Socrates continues till now, as reflected in the works of S\u00f8ren Kierkegaard and Friedrich Nietzsche. Depictions of Socrates in art, literature, and popular culture have made him a widely known figure in the Western philosophical tradition.\n\nPlato\n\nPlato upholds the principle of the virtue-based eudemonistic conception of ethics that is human well-being (eudaimonia) is the highest aim of moral thought and conduct, and the virtues are the requisite skills and dispositions needed to attain it.\n\nPlato\u2019s writings Apology, Crito, and Phaedo demonstrate dramatic accounts of the events leading to his mentor Socrates\u2019 death; depict matters of concern, ethical living, and simplicity of thought and expression.\n\nPlato conversed about philosophy as a way of life similar to how the soul is part of life. In Phaedo, Plato contended that the soul is something, rather than a sense of harmony. Phaedo also illustrates important arguments for personal immortality. It goes on to discuss in detail the soul and its rational, appetitive, and spirited features. He also talked about virtuous characteristics in individuals and related actions.\n\nPlato wrote accounts in Republic in which he treated happiness as a state of perfection that is hard to comprehend. On the other hand, Aristotle talked about happiness as a self-sufficient state of the active individual.\n\nPlato\u2019s ethical thought process was subjected to modifications throughout his life hence each stage presented a different indication. In his early works, there are no indications that the search for virtue and the human good goes beyond the human realm. This changes with a growing interest in the metaphysical basis of knowledge during the middle phase, a development that leads to the positing of the \u2018forms\u2019, as the true nature of all things, leading to the Form of the Good as the inspiring principle of all goodness.\n\nPlato\u2019s later works do not lower the standards of knowledge as such, he acknowledges that his design of a rational cosmic order is based on conjecture and speculation, an acknowledgment that finds its continuation in his later work, the laws, which has a more pragmatic treatment of ethical standards and political institutions.\n\nPlato\u2019s dialogues about the philosophy of Socrates demonstrate the Socratic approach to areas of philosophy including\u00a0rationalism\u00a0and\u00a0ethics. The Platonic Socrates lends his name to the concept of the\u00a0Socratic Method, and also to\u00a0Socratic irony. The Socratic method of questioning takes shape in dialogue using short questions and answers, epitomized by those Platonic texts in which Socrates and his interlocutors examine various aspects of an issue or an abstract meaning, usually relating to one of the virtues, and find themselves at an\u00a0impasse, completely unable to define what they thought they understood.\n\nAristotle\n\nAristotle was a Greek philosopher who was well versed in ethics, philosophy, rhetoric, and political sciences. He was one of the influential philosophers who stressed a virtuous character. He was also the pupil of Plato and was born after the death of Socrates. Aristotle was the first to note that the extent to which the dialogues portray Socrates authentically is a matter of some debate.\n\nVirtues relate to the feelings and actions of each individual. Aristotle talked about different virtues and postulated that people get angry at certain things and adamantly hold on to their views. Conversely, Aristotle affirmed that the deficiency of this character is punitive and intolerable. Regardless of any situation, it is unsuitable to become angry when it is not worth it. If doing so, again indicates a deficient non-virtuous moral character. Aristotle also referred to any non-virtuous person by inner doubt and predicaments. Even though the person may be single-minded or inconsiderate, he or she must be able to look out for companions to pardon their actions. Aristotle argued that spiteful people are not able to believe in themselves. On the other hand, virtuous individuals, gain pleasure in their actions.\n\nAristotle created the naturalistic tradition through his ethical writings (like Eudemian Ethics, Nicomachean Ethics, and Politics) which constitute the first systematic investigation into the foundations of ethics. Aristotle\u2019s account of the virtues could be seen as one of the first inquiries in normative ethics.\n\nAristotle was a towering philosopher of his time in the arena of ancient Greek philosophy along with Metaphysics, mathematics, logic, physics, biology, botany, ethics, politics, agriculture, medicine, dance, and theatre. He was more empirical-minded than Plato or Socrates and was famous for disapproving of Plato\u2019s moral theory.\n\nHis ethical thoughts are still relevant and influence virtue ethics. He expanded the notion of happiness through the analysis of the soul which structures and animates the living human organisms.\n\nAlso read: Theory of Evolution by Darwin\n\nConfucius\n\nConfucius was a Chinese philosopher, poet, and politician who is traditionally considered the paragon of Chinese sages. Confucius\u2019s teachings and philosophy underpin East Asian culture and society, remaining influential across China and East Asia to this day.\n\nHis philosophical teachings, called Confucianism, emphasized personal and governmental morality, the correctness of social relationships, justice, kindness, and sincerity. His followers competed with many other schools during the Hundred Schools of Thought era.\n\nAlthough Confucianism is followed religiously by the Chinese, it is argued that its values are secular and therefore, it is less of a religion and more of secular morality.\n\nOne of the innermost teachings of Confucius is the superiority of personal exemplification over explicit rules of behaviour. His moral teachings emphasized self-cultivation, the ambition of moral exemplars, and the attainment of skilled judgment rather than knowledge of rules.\n\nConfucian ethics are the virtues of the self: sincerity and the cultivation of knowledge. Virtuous action towards others begins with virtuous and sincere thought, which begins with knowledge.\n\nConfucius\u2019s political thought is based upon his ethical thought. He argued that the best government is one that rules through rites and people\u2019s\u00a0natural morality, and\u00a0not\u00a0by using bribery and coercion.\n\nConfucius\u2019s teachings were later turned into an elaborate set of rules and practices by his numerous disciples and followers, who organized his teachings into the Analects.\n\nModern Moral Philosophers\n\nImportant modern philosophers in the ethical domain are Hobbes, Rousseau, Kant etc.\n\nThomas Hobbes\n\nThomas Hobbes was an\u00a0English\u00a0philosopher, considered to be one of the founders of modern\u00a0political philosophy. His masterwork\u00a0Leviathan\u00a0rivals in significance the political writings of Plato, Aristotle, Locke, Rousseau, Kant, and Rawls. In addition to political philosophy, Hobbes contributed to other fields, including\u00a0history,\u00a0jurisprudence,\u00a0geometry, the\u00a0physics\u00a0of\u00a0gases,\u00a0theology, and\u00a0ethics, as well as\u00a0philosophy\u00a0in general.\n\nIn philosophy, he defended a range of materialist, nominalist, and empiricist views against Cartesian and Aristotelian alternatives. His works The Elements of Law, the\u00a0Elements of Philosophy, and\u00a0Leviathan\u00a0all share a structure as Hobbes begins with questions about mind and language, and works towards questions in political philosophy.\n\nHobbes is famous for his early and elaborate development of \u201csocial contract theory\u201d, the method of justifying political principles or arrangements by appealing to the agreement that would be made among suitably situated rational, free, and equal persons. He used the social contract method to conclude that we ought to submit to the authority of an absolute, undivided, and unlimited sovereign power.\n\nJean-Jacques Rousseau\n\nJean-Jacques Rousseau was a\u00a0Genevan\u00a0philosopher, writer, and composer. His\u00a0political philosophy\u00a0influenced the\u00a0Enlightenment\u00a0throughout Europe, as well as aspects of the\u00a0French Revolution\u00a0and the development of modern political, economic, and educational thought.\n\nHis literary works have had a significant influence on various fields they related to. His Discourse on Inequality\u00a0and\u00a0The Social Contract\u00a0are fundamental in modern political and social thought. His\u00a0sentimental novel\u00a0Julie, or the New Heloise\u00a0(1761) was important to the development of pre-romanticism and\u00a0romanticism\u00a0in fiction. His\u00a0Emile, or On Education\u00a0(1762) is an educational piece on the place of the individual in society.\n\nRousseau\u2019s autobiographical writings especially the posthumously published Confessions\u00a0initiated the genre of modern autobiography. The unfinished\u00a0Reveries of the Solitary Walker exemplified the late 18th-century and featured an increased focus on\u00a0subjectivity\u00a0and introspection that later characterized modern writing.\n\nImmanuel Kant\n\nImmanuel Kant was a German philosopher and one of the important enlightenment thinkers. Kant\u2019s comprehensive works on epistemology, metaphysics, ethics, and aesthetics have made him a central figure in modern Western philosophy.\n\nKant believed that reason is also the source of morality, and those aesthetics arise from a faculty of disinterested judgment. Kant\u2019s views continue to have a major influence on contemporary philosophy, especially in the fields of epistemology, ethics, political theory, and post-modern aesthetics.\n\nKant propagated that\u00a0perpetual peace\u00a0could be secured through universal\u00a0democracy\u00a0and\u00a0international cooperation, and this could be the culminating stage of\u00a0world history.\n\nHis conception of the unity of consciousness has been popular among modern thinkers like John Rawls. Kant was of the view that universality is essential to any viable moral philosophy.\n\nKant\u2019s works have influenced various fields of social, behavioural, and physical sciences along with mathematics and linguistics. Kant\u2019s work on mathematics and synthetic a priori knowledge are also cited by theoretical physicist\u00a0Albert Einstein\u00a0as an early influence on his intellectual development. And in recent years, there has been renewed interest in Kant\u2019s theory of mind from the point of view of\u00a0formal logic\u00a0and\u00a0computer science.\n\nMoral Thinkers and Philosophers from India\n\nIndian history has an abundance of great thinkers, philosophers,s, and teachers with immense knowledge. They all contributed to shaping the rich culture and philosophy of the land.\n\nChanakya\n\nChanakya (375\u2013283 BCE) was an ancient Indian polymath who was a teacher, author, strategist, philosopher, economist, jurist, and royal advisor. He is also known as Kau\u1e6dilya or Vishnugupta, who authored the ancient Indian political treatise, the Arthashastra.\n\nChanakya assisted the first Mauryan emperor\u00a0Chandragupta\u00a0in his rise to power and played an important role in the establishment of the\u00a0Mauryan Empire. Chanakya served as the chief advisor to both emperors Chandragupta and his son\u00a0Bindusara.\n\nChanakya is regarded as a great thinker and diplomat. He envisioned a united subcontinent based on law and order. His Arthashastra is a precise and timeless description of power and strategic aspects of statecraft.\n\nChanakya\u00a0wanted to create a society where people are not too engrossed in the material aspects of life. He laid equal emphasis on spirituality too.\n\nRead: Chanakya neeti\n\nBuddha\n\nGautama\u00a0Buddha was an ascetic, a religious leader, and a teacher who lived in ancient India during the 6-5th century BCE. His teachings laid the basis of Buddhist philosophy and traditions as well as Buddhism as a religion.\n\nHe is one of the most important Asian thinkers and spiritual masters of all time, and he contributed to many areas of philosophy, including epistemology, metaphysics, and ethics.\n\nIn epistemology, Buddha seeks a middle way between the extremes of obstinacy and scepticism, emphasizing personal experience, a practical attitude, and the use of critical thinking toward all types of knowledge.\n\nIn ethics, Buddha proposes a threefold understanding of action: mental, verbal, and bodily. In metaphysics, he argues that there are no self-caused entities and that everything dependently arises from or upon something else. This allows Buddha\u2019s teachings to provide a criticism of souls and personal identity. Such criticism forms the foundation for his views about the reality of rebirth and an ultimate liberated state called \u201cNirvana.\u201d\n\nNirvana is a special state of mind in which all the causes and conditions responsible for rebirth and suffering have been eliminated. In philosophical anthropology, Buddha explains human identity without a permanent and substantial self.\n\nThe doctrine of non-self, however, does not imply the absolute inexistence of any type of self but is compatible with a conventional self, which is unsubstantial and impermanent.\n\nThe fundamental ethical and spiritual point behind the Buddha\u2019s philosophy is that impermanent, conditioned, and conditional things such as wealth, social position, power, sensual pleasures, and even meditative states, cannot generate a state of ultimate happiness. To overcome the existential dissatisfaction generated by all ephemeral and contingent things, one needs to follow a comprehensive path of ethical and mental training conducive to the state of ultimate happiness called nirvana.\n\nAdi Shankaracharya\n\nAdi Shankara was an Indian philosopher and theologian who set forth the doctrine of Advaita Vedanta. Shankaracharya combined the ideologies of ancient \u2018Advaita Vedanta\u2019 and also explained the basic ideas of Upanishads.\u00a0He advocated the oldest concept of Hinduism which explains the unification of the soul (atman) with the Supreme Soul (Nirguna Brahman).\n\nShankaracharya\u2019s most important work is his efforts to blend the six sub-sects, known as Shanmata, which translates to \u2018six religions,\u2019 which is the worship of six supreme deities.\n\nShankaracharya explained the existence of one Supreme Being (Brahman) and that the six supreme deities are part of one divine power. He also founded \u2018Dashanami Sampradaya,\u2019 which talks about leading a monastic life.\n\nWhile Shankaracharya was a firm believer in ancient Hinduism, he condemned the \u2018Mimamsa school of Hinduism\u2019 which was purely based on ritual practices.\n\nThroughout his journey, Shankaracharya discussed his ideas with various other philosophers and fine-tuned his teachings from time to time. Shankaracharya founded four monasteries (mathas) that continue to spread his teachings:\n\nSringeri Sharada Peetham advocates Aham Brahmasmi (I am Brahman) and was based on Yajur Veda.\nDwaraka Pitha advocates Tattvamasi (That is you) and was based on Sama Veda.\nJyotirmatha Pitha advocates Ayamatama Brahma (This ataman is Brahman) and was based on Atharva Veda.\nGovardhana matha advocates Prajananam Brahma (Consciousness is Brahman) and was based on Rig Veda.\n\nHis philosophy was simple. He advocated the existence of the soul and the Supreme Soul and believed the Supreme Soul alone is real and unchanging while the soul is a changing entity and that it does not have absolute existence.\n\nThiruvalluvar\n\nThiruvalluvar\u00a0was a celebrated\u00a0Tamil\u00a0poet\u00a0and\u00a0philosopher best known as the author of the\u00a0Tirukkural\u00a0which is a collection of couplets on ethics, political thought, economical matter, and life. The text is considered an exceptional and cherished work of Tamil literature.\n\nThiruvalluvar showed that a person could lead a divine life or a life of purity and sanctity even if they are a Grihastha or householder. He showed that there was no necessity to leave the family and become a Sannyasin to lead a divine life of purity and sanctity.\n\nThirukkural is divided into three sections: section one deals with Aram, good ethical behaviour with conscience and honour (right conduct); section two discusses Porul, the right manner of conducting worldly affairs; and section three dwells on Kaamam, love between men and women.\n\nThirukkural has been translated into several languages, including a translation into Latin by Constanzo Beschi in 1730, which helped make the work known to European intellectuals.\n\nSwami Vivekananda\n\nSwami Vivekananda was one of the most celebrated spiritual leaders of India. He was a prolific thinker, great orator, and passionate patriot. He carried on the free-thinking philosophy of his guru, Ramakrishna Paramhansa forward into a new paradigm. He followed the Advaita Vedanta school of philosophy.\n\nHe worked tirelessly towards betterment of the society, in servitude to the poor and needy, dedicating his all to his country. He was responsible for the revival of Hindu spiritualism and established Hinduism as a revered religion on the world stage.\n\nHis message of universal brotherhood and self-awakening remains relevant, especially in the current backdrop of widespread political turmoil around the world. His teachings have been an inspiration to many, and his words have become goals of self-improvement, especially for the youth of the country.\n\nHis is four classics: Jnana-Yoga, Bhakti-Yoga, Karma-Yoga, and Raja-Yoga, are outstanding treatises on Hindu philosophy.\n\nHe was a truly modern thinker who understood the importance of moving forward with the world yet to be rooted in his traditions. He was influenced by western philosophy for individual development and progress. He realized three things are necessary to make every man great, every nation great, namely conviction of the powers of goodness; absence of jealousy and suspicion; and helping all who are trying to be and do good.\n\nHe believed in having faith in self along with faith in the divine: \u201cThe tidal wave of Western Civilisation is now rushing over the length and breadth of the country. It won\u2019t do now simply to sit in meditation on mountain tops without realizing in the least its usefulness. Now is wanted intense\u00a0Karma yoga, with unbounded courage and indomitable strength in the heart. Then only will the people of the country be roused.\u201d\n\nRabindranath Tagore\n\nRabindranath Tagore was a great poet, author, educationist, and Nobel laureate. He was a true believer in Vedanta philosophy and believed in Brahman, the manifestation of the entire universe. Such a philosophy led him to have implicit faith in the Brotherhood of Man and Fatherhood of God and the need for universal religion.\n\nTagore was an individualist and believed in giving the right type of freedom to the individual. Every individual is unique and differs in potential. Every individual, according to Tagore, has a right to give direction to his life in his way. He believed in the fundamental unity of man and nature.\n\nTagore believed that man should live for the Ultimate Truth which liberates us from the cycle of birth and death and makes us one with the Creator. Tagore said, \u201cLet us find our God, let us live for the Ultimate Truth which emancipates us from the bondage of the dust and gives us the wealth, not of things but inner light, not of power but love\u201d.\n\nTagore believed that every individual should try to attain spiritual perfection. This will lead to better social order, human brotherhood, and finally an international brotherhood. \u201cExperience of the spiritual world, religion as the right-centre of life\u2019s activities, and the unity of thought and truth\u201d was the essence of Tagore\u2019s great philosophy.\n\nTagore was a humanist and naturalist and was close to humanity and nature. He was an ardent believer in peace and unity.\n\nMahatma Gandhi\n\nGandhian philosophy is the religious and social ideas adopted and developed by Gandhi, during his period in South Africa from 1893 to 1914, and later of course in India. These ideas have been further developed by later \u201cGandhians\u201d, like Vinoba Bhave and Jayaprakash Narayan. In the west, some of the works of Martin Luther King Jr. also propagate the philosophy.\n\nThe philosophy exists on several planes for understanding the universe as an organic whole \u2013 the spiritual or religious, moral, political, economic, social, individual, and collective. The spiritual or religious element, and God, is at its core. Human nature is regarded as fundamentally virtuous and all individuals are believed to be capable of high moral development and reform.\n\nThe twin principles of Gandhi\u2019s thought are truth and nonviolence or Satya and ahimsa. Gandhi believed that truth is the relative of truthfulness in word and deed and the Ultimate Reality. This ultimate truth is God and morality. The moral laws and codes are the basis of truth and morality.\n\nAhimsa is not mere peacefulness or the absence of overt violence but denotes active love for everything in this world according to Gandhi. It is the polar opposite of violence, or \u201cHimsa\u201d, in every sense.\n\nHe has said \u201cAs soon as we lose the moral basis, we cease to be religious. There is no such thing as religion overriding morality. Man, for instance, cannot be untruthful, cruel or incontinent and claim to have God on his side\u201d\n\nHence Gandhian philosophy stems from the truth and non-violence and teaches that one should acknowledge and accept the truth that people are different at all levels (\u201ctruth\u201d). Also, one should never resort to violence to settle inherent differences between human beings at any level: from between two people to two nations to two races or two religions (\u201cnon-violence\u201d).\n\nThere are seven social sins according to Gandhi:\n\nPolitics without Principles\nWealth Without Work\nPleasure Without Conscience\nKnowledge Without Character\nCommerce Without Morality\nScience Without Humanity\nWorship Without Sacrifice\nSummary\n\nHumans are social animals and seek a cause-effect relationship that motivates them to question the society where they live which can be achieved through philosophy. Philosophy can be applied to the physical world existing around us and also applied to intangible objects and imaginary like a god, cosmology.\n\nAncient Greece and India were the cradles of ethical thinkers and philosophers whose thoughts and teachings laid the base for a great many discoveries and changes in the world.\n\nEthics is multi-dimensional and applicable in all fields in today\u2019s modern world. Since ancient times, teachings about the human interface have ethics, values, and attitude\u00a0intertwined with each other.\n\nFor civil services, ethical thinking, aptitude, values and the right attitude are very necessary. Hence it is important to have a good theoretical understanding of the concepts for practical application.\n\nThere are many more contributions of thinkers and philosophers from India and the world that have influenced the shaping of the world we see today, like:\n\nJohn Rawls in his theory of social justice attempts to solve the problem of distributive justice. Rawls derives two principles of Justice: the liberty principle and the difference principle. In his concept of the liberty principle, Rawls explains that each person is to have an equal right to the most extensive basic liberty compatible with a similar liberty for others. In his concept of the difference principle, social and economic inequalities are to be arranged.\n\nSimilarly, there have been great rulers who have built and ended empires based on their ideologies. Napoleon Bonaparte had said, \u201cGreat ambition is the passion of a great character. Those endowed with it may perform very good or very bad acts. All depends on the principles which direct them.\u201d Hitler had great ambition but was blinded by vengeance and power leading to the doom of their country. On the other hand, the great Mauryan ruler Ashoka built an empire based on welfare, compassion, and truthfulness.\u201d\n\nTeachers and parents also play an important role in building the character of a nation through their younger generation. One of modern India\u2019s great scientist, teacher, and ex-president of the country Dr. A.P.J Abdul Kalam had said, \u201cIf a country is to be corruption free and become a nation of beautiful minds, I strongly feel there are three key societal members who can make a difference. They are the father, the mother, and the teacher.\u201d"

For instance, the creation of an Office for Public Service Values and Ethics in Canada distinguished between the two. Here in India, a comparable difference is required.\n\nValues by themselves lack agency, or the capacity to take action. Instead, the way ethical standards are applied to values will determine a person\u2019s behavior. For instance, while government officials may hold the concept of honesty, it is their behaviour and actions that put this value into practise.\n\n\ud83d\udc49 Which year are YOU targeting for success in the IAS/IPS/IFS Exam? \ud83d\ude80\n\n(1) \u21d2 UPSC 2025: Prelims cum Mains\n\n(2) \u21d2 UPSC 2026: Prelims cum Mains\n\n(3) \u21d2 UPSC 2027 Prelims cum Mains\n\nTip: Know more about ClearIAS Courses (Online/Offline)\n\nTherefore, ethics are the laws that apply values to daily life. All facets of ethical decision-making, ethical judgment, ethical choice, and ethical behavior are influenced by values.\n\nAdditionally, it is incorrect to distinguish between \u201cpositive\u201d and \u201cnegative\u201d values because values cannot be either positive or negative. Value application is something that may be viewed from both negative and positive angles.\n\nFor instance, the value of confidentiality may be perceived positively (essential for national security) or negatively (Inhibits transparency). The people who depend on the public service may stop having faith in it if its actions are not guided by the right set of values.\n\nHigh-level public service values can greatly increase public confidence and trust. On the other hand, poor application of values or the promotion of unsuitable values can result in a decrease in these fundamental components of democratic administration.\n\nTo know more about values click here\n\nPublic service values\n\nSeveral core values are important in public service and public administration, including:\n\nService to the public: Public servants are committed to serving the needs and interests of the public. This involves providing high-quality services that meet the needs of the people and working to improve the lives of citizens.\nIntegrity: Public servants must be honest, transparent, and accountable in their actions and decision-making. This means acting with integrity, honesty, and fairness in all aspects of their work.\nImpartiality: Public servants must be impartial and objective in their decision-making, free from personal or political bias. This means treating all citizens equally and impartially, regardless of their characteristics or beliefs.\nProfessionalism: Public servants must be competent, skilled, and dedicated to their work. This involves upholding professional standards and being committed to continuous learning and development.\nRespect for diversity: Public servants must respect and value the diversity of the communities they serve. This includes valuing diversity in terms of race, ethnicity, gender, sexual orientation, religion, and other personal characteristics.\nResponsibility: Public servants must be responsible and accountable for their actions and decisions. This means taking ownership of their work and being accountable to the public for their actions.\nTransparency: Public servants must be open and transparent in their actions and decision-making processes. This involves making information about government policies, programs, and decisions available to the public.\nPublic service ethics/ Administrative ethics\n\nThe civil service\u2019s professional code of ethics is referred to as administrative ethics. They define the moral character of government employees and set rules for how various civil servant types should act and behave.\n\nAs a profession in the modern state, the civil service has created a moral code for its members. Civil officials are required to uphold the customs, precedents, and standards that make up the code of ethics.\n\nIn particular, in light of the expanding significance of administration and its effects on society, public workers are required to uphold high moral standards not only for themselves but also for the community at large.\n\nSeveral ethical principles are important in public service and public administration. These include:\n\nFairness: Public servants must be fair and impartial in their decision-making, treating all individuals and groups equally and without bias.\nConfidentiality: Public servants must protect the confidentiality of sensitive information and ensure that it is not disclosed without proper authorization.\nLoyalty: Public servants must be loyal to their organization and the public, and must not act in a way that undermines the trust and confidence of the public.\nObjectivity: Public servants must be objective and unbiased in their decision-making, and must not be influenced by personal interests or biases.\nConflict of interest: Public servants must avoid conflicts of interest and disclose any potential conflicts to their supervisor or the appropriate authorities.\n\nTo learn more about public service ethics click here\n\nImportance of public service values and ethics\n\nEthics and values are significant for a civil servant for the following reasons:\n\nUtilizing public resources ethically guarantees that society develops effectively and efficiently without corruption. It holds the one in a position of public trust, responsible for his/her deeds.\nThe moral requirements of impartiality and objectivity give organizations merit. Increasing predictability has the effect of enhancing economic efficiency.\nWhen public officeholders make judgments fairly, based on merit, and unaffected by personal or private interests, the results for society are better. Work commitment and dedication enhance administration.\nEvery segment of the public, regardless of color, religion, or caste, must be treated fairly, and ethics ensure just and fair governance.\nSocial capital: a just and moral government will be seen favorably and will guarantee citizen involvement in government. The resulting trust makes administration simpler and more efficient.\nReduce corruption by increasing effectiveness and severing the unholy connection between the government and the anti-social groups.\nCompassion is an important element to include in daily tasks since it significantly improves the lives of vulnerable groups.\nThe government starts to respond to the needs and ambitions of the populace. For instance, in West Bengal, roadside merchants were evacuated before a separate public market was established for them.\nBuilding trust in the economy and international relations is another benefit of ethical administration.\nTo establish standards and regulations that can improve the connection between political executives and public personnel. fostering the impartiality and nonpartisanship of government employees.\nTo instill in public employees strong moral standards and ensure their implementation in deeds.\nPrinciples of managing ethics\n\nA strong ethics infrastructure is required to manage ethics in public services; merely creating a code of conduct is not sufficient. The OECD lists the following essential components of a strong ethics infrastructure:\n\nPolitical commitment: Politicians should stress the value of ethics, lead by example, and provide resources to encourage moral behavior.\nAn effective legal framework contains rules and regulations that establish and uphold moral norms.\nEffective tools for accountability \u2013 These include administrative processes, audits, agency performance reviews, consultations, and oversight measures.\nWorkable conduct codes should include a values statement, roles, responsibilities, obligations, and constraints.\nMechanisms for professional socialization like education and training\nFavorable conditions for public employment, such as fair and equitable treatment, adequate compensation, and security\nA coordinating organization for ethics\nA vibrant civil society with investigative media to function as a watchdog over governmental actions.\nIndian initiatives to strengthen the ethical framework\n\nAccountability to Parliament \u2013 In India, political executives, who in turn answer to the Parliament, are responsible for holding administrators accountable. Financial accountability exists in addition to administrative accountability. For instance, before the government can spend any money from the Consolidated Fund of India or the state, the legislative must provide its consent.\n\nCommittee on Ethics of the Rajya Sabha and Lok Sabha \u2013 The Rajya Sabha\u2019s Rules of Procedure and Conduct of Business provide for the creation of a Committee on Ethics to monitor Members\u2019 moral and ethical behavior. This committee also oversees the Lok Sabha. A similar committee exists in the Lok Sabha to oversee the moral and ethical behavior of its members.\n\nCode of Conduct for Public Officials \u2013 A code of conduct has been established for civil servants to boost citizen confidence in government by guaranteeing them that personal interests and power do not influence policy.\n\nStatus and problems in public service ethics and values\n\nThe field of public service ethics and values is susceptible to a variety of issues. Some of these issues consist of:\n\nCorruption: Abusing authority or a position for one\u2019s gain is considered one of the biggest issues with public service ethics. Bribery, theft, and nepotism are just a few of the various ways that corruption manifests. It may erode public confidence in the government, result in inappropriate resource allocation, and result in unequal distribution of benefits.\nConflicts of interest arise when a public servant\u2019s interests or relationships collide with their obligations and responsibilities as such. For instance, if a public employee participates in decision-making regarding a corporation that transacts business with the government and has financial ties to that company, there may be a conflict of interest.\nEthical dilemmas: When confronted with opposing moral principles or allegiances, public employees may experience ethical conundrums. For instance, a public servant might struggle with balancing their devotion to their political party or personal convictions with their obligation to serve the public.\nLack of transparency: To avoid responsibility or to further their interests, public employees may feel compelled to act secretively or withhold information from the general public. The public\u2019s faith and confidence in the government may be weakened by this lack of transparency.\nLack of accountability: If there aren\u2019t enough checks and balances in place to make sure that public employees are held accountable for their activities, they may be held less responsible for them. Power abuses could result from this, compromising the public service\u2019s integrity.\nEthical lapses: Lack of awareness or comprehension of ethical principles and values can lead to blunders or unethical behavior on the part of public employees. Public harm and bad decision-making may result from this.\nConclusion\n\nIt is crucial that public employees receive training on ethical principles and values and that there are processes in place to make sure they are held accountable for their actions to solve these issues. To keep public officials accountable, the public must have access to information regarding their deeds and decision-making procedures.\n\nArticle written by: Caroline"

Read on to know more.\n\nSince ethical norms are not organized, there is always a potential that a conflict may arise and that there will be disagreements over proper behavior.\n\nThis will give rise to various ethical dilemmas and concerns in public and private institutions.\n\nIn this article, we shall try to analyze them briefly.\n\nTable of Contents\n\nEthical concerns and dilemmas in government institutions\nReasons for the unethical behavior of government officials\nEthical Concerns in Private Sector Institutions\nEthical concerns with respect to employees\nEthical concerns with respect to employers\nTaking Credit for Others\u2019 Work\nHarassing Behavior\nTransparency and disclosure\nQuality of products and services\nEthical dilemmas in government and private institutions\nPrinciples to be used in resolving ethical dilemmas\nActs of double effect\nEthical concerns and dilemmas in government institutions\n\nEthical concerns can arise in public institutions when the actions or decisions of those institutions or the individuals working within them do not align with the values, principles, and standards of behavior that are expected in the public sector.\n\nSome common ethical concerns in public institutions include:\n\nAdministrative Discretion: The public official has ample opportunity to use discretion within the confines of the laws\u2019 established norms and regulations and the established procedures. The problem is that choosing one course of action from a range of options is frequently done based on personal preference, political or other affiliations, or even self-aggrandizement.\nCorruption: Corruption in public office refers to the misuse of public power for personal or financial gain. This can take many forms, including bribery, embezzlement, fraud, and nepotism. Corruption in public office can have serious consequences for individuals, organizations, and societies. It can undermine trust in government, hinder economic development, and lead to social and political instability. It can also disproportionately impact marginalized or disadvantaged groups, as they may be less able to access the resources or opportunities that are being corruptly distributed.\nAdministrative secrecy: Administrative secrecy, also known as official secrecy or state secrecy, refers to the practice of keeping certain information or activities secret within government institutions. However, administrative secrecy can also be a concern in government institutions, as it can be used to conceal wrongdoing or abuse of power or to limit transparency and accountability. It can also restrict access to information that is in the public interest, such as information about environmental impacts, public health, or government decision-making.\nNepotism: Nepotism in government institutions refers to the practice of favoritism or preferential treatment based on personal relationships, rather than merit. This can occur when a public official hires, promotes or favors someone based on their personal relationship with that individual, rather than considering the qualifications or suitability of other candidates.\nInformation leaks: In public institutions, information leaks can be a concern because they can compromise the confidentiality and security of sensitive information, such as national security secrets, confidential government documents, or personal data. Information leaks can also undermine trust in the government and can lead to political or social instability.\n\nTo learn more about the challenges of corruption in public office click here\n\n\ud83d\udc49 Which year are YOU targeting for success in the IAS/IPS/IFS Exam? \ud83d\ude80\n\n(1) \u21d2 UPSC 2025: Prelims cum Mains\n\n(2) \u21d2 UPSC 2026: Prelims cum Mains\n\n(3) \u21d2 UPSC 2027 Prelims cum Mains\n\nTip: Know more about ClearIAS Courses (Online/Offline)\n\nAlso read: Ethical Dilemma: 10 Heartbreaking Case Studies\n\nReasons for the unethical behavior of government officials\n\nThere are a variety of reasons why public officials may engage in unethical behavior. Some common reasons include:\n\nPersonal gain: Public officials may be motivated by a desire for personal financial gain or to advance their careers.\nPower or influence: Public officials may abuse their power or influence for personal or inappropriate purposes.\nLack of accountability: If there are insufficient mechanisms in place to hold public officials accountable for their actions, they may be more likely to engage in unethical behavior.\nCulture of corruption: If corruption is prevalent within an organization or society, public officials may be more likely to engage in unethical behavior.\nPersonal values or beliefs: Public officials may act unethically if their values or beliefs conflict with the values or standards of behavior expected in the public sector.\nPressure or temptation: Public officials may be tempted to engage in unethical behavior if they are under pressure to meet certain goals or if they are offered incentives or rewards for unethical behavior.\nExcessive security: Excessive security which has been provided in Acts like PoCA and Article 311 of the Constitution etc. is misused by corrupt and unethical civil servants.\nEthical Concerns in Private Sector Institutions\n\nIn private institutions, ethics refers to the moral standards that ought to guide business decisions. Some common ethical concerns in private institutions include:\n\nEthical concerns with respect to employees\nworking at several companies: An employee is not permitted to work in more than one location at once.\nFailure to uphold the company\u2019s privacy policy: Don\u2019t divulge company information to rival businesses.\nInflammatory communications: In the workplace, offensive language is not permitted.\nIncorrect use of equipment for personal purposes.\nMaking use of the travel incentive.\nTaking more than the permitted amount of leaves.\nEthical concerns with respect to employers\nFavoritism: An employer shouldn\u2019t give a specific employee preferential treatment when it comes to promotions and bonuses.\nSexual assault\nletting a worker go without giving them any notice.\nPayment of the employee\u2019s gratuity and provident fund is delayed needlessly.\nTaking Credit for Others\u2019 Work\nEmployees frequently collaborate in teams to produce new goods, improve services, and come up with marketing initiatives, but this rarely results in equal contributions from all members of the group. It is improper for all employees to receive equal recognition when only a small number completed the necessary work. To aid in the completion of a project, team members should ensure that all employees execute certain tasks.\nHarassing Behavior\nEmployees frequently are unsure about what to do if they witness another employee being sexually, emotionally, or physically harassed by a coworker. If an employee attempts to report a superior for harassment, they can be concerned for their jobs.\nThe staff members who write the employee handbook for the business are most suited to find a solution to this moral conundrum. It is their responsibility to include precise wording that makes it clear that an employee won\u2019t be disciplined for reporting coworkers\u2019 inappropriate behavior or harassing behavior.\nTransparency and disclosure\nTransparency and disclosure are important ethical concerns in private institutions because they help to build trust and confidence in the organization and its actions. They also help to ensure that stakeholders have the information they need to make informed decisions about their relationship with the organization.\nQuality of products and services\nProviding quality that falls short of what the organization promises is always viewed by society as immoral.\nEthical dilemmas in government and private institutions\n\nEthical dilemmas refer to situations in which individuals or organizations face conflicting moral obligations or values, and must choose which course of action to take. Ethical dilemmas can arise in both public and private institutions. Some common ethical dilemmas include:\n\nConflicts of interest: This occurs when an individual\u2019s interests or relationships conflict with their duties or responsibilities within the organization. For example, a public official may face an ethical dilemma if they are asked to make a decision that could benefit a family member or close friend.\nTransparency vs. confidentiality: Public and private institutions may be faced with ethical dilemmas when deciding whether to disclose sensitive information or to keep it confidential. For example, a private company may face an ethical dilemma when deciding whether to disclose information about a product defect that could potentially harm consumers.\nIndividual vs. collective interests: Ethical dilemmas may arise when an individual or organization must choose between acting in their interests or the interests of a larger group. For example, a private company may face an ethical dilemma when deciding whether to pursue a business opportunity that could benefit the company but could potentially harm the environment or the community.\nRights and responsibilities: Ethical dilemmas may arise when an individual or organization must choose between conflicting rights or responsibilities. For example, a public official may face an ethical dilemma when deciding whether to prioritize the right to privacy of an individual, or the responsibility to protect public safety.\nPrinciples to be used in resolving ethical dilemmas\n\nSeveral principles can be useful in resolving ethical dilemmas:\n\nRespect for autonomy: This principle involves respecting the autonomy and decision-making capacity of individuals and giving them the freedom to make choices about their own lives.\nNon-maleficence: This principle involves avoiding actions that could cause harm or suffering to others.\nBeneficence: This principle involves taking positive actions that promote the well-being of others.\nJustice: This principle involves treating all individuals fairly and equitably.\nRespect for persons: This principle involves respecting the dignity and worth of all individuals.\nFidelity: This principle involves being faithful or loyal to one\u2019s commitments, values, and principles.\nVeracity: This principle involves being honest and truthful.\n\nBy considering these principles when resolving ethical dilemmas, individuals and organizations can make decisions that are aligned with their values and that respect the rights and interests of all stakeholders.\n\nIt is important to note that ethical dilemmas may involve conflicting principles, and it may be necessary to weigh the relative importance of different principles to make a decision.\n\nActs of double effect\n\nThe doctrine of double effect, also known as the principle of double effect, is a moral principle that is often used to distinguish between actions that are morally permissible and morally wrong.\n\nThe principle holds that it is sometimes morally acceptable to perform an action that has both good and bad consequences, as long as the action intends to produce the good consequences and the bad consequences are not intended or are only a side effect of the action.\n\nThe principle of double effect has four main components:\n\nThe action must be morally good or neutral in itself.\nThe bad consequence must not be how the good consequence is achieved.\nThe bad consequence must not be intended.\nThe good consequences must outweigh the bad consequences.\n\nExamples of actions that may be subject to the principle of double effect include administering pain medication to a terminally ill patient, which may have the side effect of hastening the patient\u2019s death or bombing a military target during wartime, which may also cause civilian casualties.\n\nThe principle of double effect is often used to justify certain actions that might otherwise be considered morally wrong, such as euthanasia or abortion. However, the principle is also subject to debate and criticism, and its application can be complex and nuanced.\n\nArticle written by: Caroline"

These elements work together to establish a framework for ethical behavior, providing a foundation for individuals, organizations, and communities to navigate complex moral situations.\n\nTable of Contents\n\nWhat are laws?\nLaws as a source of ethical guidance\nWhat are the Rules?\nDifference between Laws and Rules\nRegulations as a source of ethical guidance\nWhat is conscience?\nPolitical Level\nCitizen Level\nConclusion\nWhat are laws?\n\nLaws are only rules in a legal form. For lack of a better term, the definition of law is a rule that has been legally made to apply to every member of society.\n\nA law is a sentence that has been enacted by a legislature in a democratic system. A law can be considered to be much more formal than a regulation. A higher level of government, typically the police and prosecutor\u2019s office, sets the laws.\n\nLaws are codified in a certain manner so that they can be applied as necessary. Voting is one of the stages that laws must go through before becoming enacted.\n\nGovernments make and enforce laws based on society\u2019s values to regulate our interactions with one another. Governments enact laws to safeguard the people who live within their borders. The three primary governmental entities tasked with making laws are the legislature, the judiciary, and public authorities.\n\n\ud83d\udc49 Which year are YOU targeting for success in the IAS/IPS/IFS Exam? \ud83d\ude80\n\n(1) \u21d2 UPSC 2025: Prelims cum Mains\n\n(2) \u21d2 UPSC 2026: Prelims cum Mains\n\n(3) \u21d2 UPSC 2027 Prelims cum Mains\n\nTip: Know more about ClearIAS Courses (Online/Offline)\n\nLaws as a source of ethical guidance\nBefore being put into effect and enforced by the police and the military, laws must first be accepted and formulated by the branches of government with assistance from the legal system, which is made up of lawyers and other government employees.\nHowever, the way laws are passed differs depending on the government.\nIn a dictatorship, the ruler has the authority to enact any law.\nThe many branches of the government must vote on the legislation before it can become law in an egalitarian society.\nEveryone must abide by the law, including private individuals, groups, and businesses as well as well-known individuals, organizations, and institutions.\nLaws set out standards, procedures, and principles that must be followed.\nA law is enforceable by the judicial system, i.e. those responsible for breaking them can be prosecuted in court.\nThere are various types of laws framed like criminal laws, civil laws, and international laws.\nBreaking a law is a punishable crime and has drastic consequences such as hefty fines, jail time, and community service time.\nWhat are the Rules?\n\nSimilar to conventions, rules are norms of conduct that are created for certain situations. They are essential since there is typically a consequence associated with them. Both businesses and individuals create rules. Rules are more lenient and have fewer repercussions.\n\nRules are strategies that are offered to maintain an organization\u2019s efficient operation as well as peace and harmony among its members.\n\nRules are individualized, and they are frequently adjusted as the circumstances in the home change. People can learn how to get ready for society by following the rules.\n\nFundamentally, rules are judicial legal conclusions, much like the decisions a judge makes in a case. It is the rule of law or rules of law established in a legal dispute.\n\nRules are a less formal set of guidelines that, depending on who is enforcing them, may have few or no repercussions. The person who makes the rules also applies them.\n\nDifference between Laws and Rules\n\nRules and laws differ significantly from one another.\n\nThe key distinction is the penalties for breaching them. The law is more potent than a rule, even though both are intended to promote a sense of order, fair play, and safety.\n\nLaws resemble the formalized version of rules. Laws are codified in certain ways to allow for flexible interpretation. Rules can be bent.\n\nTo be effective, laws must be passed after following the correct procedures. Rules are only established and changed as necessary.\n\nSociety must establish specific rules and laws that aid in regulating its efficient operation.\n\nEveryone will be treated equally thanks to the laws and regulations that have been put in place. No matter their social standing or position, all people are required to abide by a set of regulations, and if they do breach any of those norms, they must face the repercussions.\n\nThe laws and regulations kept society working smoothly and effectively.\n\nRegulations as a source of ethical guidance\n\nA regulation is a set of legal requirements intended to reshape behavior that results from flaws. A regulation can be used to encourage or forbid behavior, to create uniform incentives, or to alter preferences.\n\nA written document with rules with laws on it and a procedure for monitoring and enforcing laws are the two components that make up regulations. The goal of regulation is to solve a situation by establishing it or changing it according to a set of laws or ideas.\n\nThe executive branch normally makes regulations through several departments, including the departments of state, agriculture, treasury, etc.\n\nRules and regulations are comparable in that regulations add more detail to a specific law that has been established by a legislative body. The regulation\u00a0establishes or restricts a right, establishes or restricts an obligation, or assigns a responsibility.\n\nThere are many different kinds of regulation, including governmental authority-issued legal limits and multiparty contracts.\nThe executive typically establishes regulations to ensure that laws are followed to the letter.\n\nTypically, laws offer a framework for tackling a topic. The purpose of regulations is to provide a complex and thorough framework for implementing the laws.\n\nWhat is conscience?\n\nConscience is a quality, instinct, or choice that aids in separating right from wrong.\n\nWhen a person acts in a way that violates their moral principles, the conscience causes feelings of regret. Conversely, when our actions, thoughts, and words are in line with other people\u2019s value systems, the conscience causes feelings of pleasure and well-being.\n\nThe \u201cvoice inside\u201d and the \u201cinner light\u201d are two frequent metaphors for conscience. It denotes both awareness of one\u2019s conduct and a person\u2019s moral sense of right and evil.\n\nConscience is frequently used in connection with phrases like \u201cgut feeling\u201d and \u201cguilt.\u201d\n\nIn this view, conscience is something that can be impacted by the indoctrination of one\u2019s family, socioeconomic status, religion, or culture rather than something that is fundamentally the result of a reasonable inference.\n\nThroughout much of the history of philosophy, there has been debate about the extent to which conscience influences moral judgment before an action and whether such moral judgments should or should not be rooted in reason.\n\nConscience can act as a source of ethical guidance for bureaucrats, politicians, and citizens in a democratic system\n\nThe innate intuitive ability to distinguish between right and wrong is known as conscience. The \u201cInner Voice\u201d is crucial, especially in democracies when there are many participants, including citizens, NGOs, and corporations, who are all managed by politicians who are chosen by them alone.\n\nHowever, everyone has a conscience that helps them make crucial decisions on a personal basis. As a result, it can be a powerful tool for preventing individual self-centered thinking.\n\nPolitical Level\n\nCorruption, nepotism, and self-serving behavior can be reduced with the aid of conscience.\n\nThis will encourage them to uphold the Constitution\u2019s ideas and act in society\u2019s best interests. They should bear in mind that they were elected to serve the people, not their interests and greed, at every decision-making stage.\n\nAdministrative Level: The moral dilemma of whether to just obey commands from superiors or to follow the correct course of justice is crucial. Since they serve as a conduit between the general public and political leaders, the intrinsic voice of serving the nation while upholding the greatest standards of honesty and integrity is crucial.\n\nCitizen Level\n\nResidents\u2019 collective and individual consciences are crucial because they characterize the social conditions that exist today, such as maintaining a clean environment, participating in elections, and objecting to anti-democratic ideas.\n\nThus, upholding it will help prevent widespread prejudice like rioting and the lynching of offenders.\n\nAdditionally, it\u2019s critical to continuously flourish and advance both personally and institutionally. Therefore, moral decay may be stopped and faith in political institutions can be restored if everyone acts and upholds their core ideals.\n\nConclusion\n\nEthical guidance is a multi-dimensional construct, drawing from laws, rules, regulations, and individual consciousness. The integration of these sources provides a comprehensive framework for ethical behavior in various contexts, fostering a sense of responsibility, accountability, and shared values within society.\n\nTo read more articles on ethics, click here\n\nArticle written by Aseem Muhammed"

This is a classic case of lack of accountability which is prevailing among civil servants and has dire consequences on the nation.\n\nWhat is the concept of accountability? Why there is a lack of accountability in civil servants? How to uphold the civil servants accountable? What are the methods? What are the existing underlying problems and weaknesses? Are there any changes made by the government after the discrepancies found in the traditional method? What can be done to make it more transparent and accountable?

Then the decision will be scrutinized as per the legal process and procedures.\n\nMostly the issue of accountability is linked with corruption\u00a0and that\u2019s why Lord Acton also said that \u201d power corrupts and absolute power corrupts absolutely \u201d\n\nWhy there is a lack of accountability among civil servants?\n\nSince Civil servants have power, so there will always be a threat of misuse of powers. That\u2019s why accountability is considered as one of the important values for both administration and government.\n\nAn accountable government is responsible and ethical.\n\nIt will ensure liberty, equality, freedom, respect for people, and Human Rights, and will facilitate efficiency, satisfaction, and quality of service.\n\nHence, accountability is an essential component and is one of the important grievances of citizens of the country.\n\nHow to uphold accountability?\n\nTraditionally it was upheld by a formal mechanism like checks and balances along with control over the machinery through rules and procedures.\n\nThere are also other institutions ensuring accountability like CAG, CBI, CVC, National Human Rights Commission, enforcement directorate, and so on.\n\nInformal mechanisms like social media and civil society also uphold and ensure accountability.\n\nWhat are the existing problems and weaknesses?\n\nThese formal mechanisms are not that strong, as they largely ensure the legal aspects of accountability. The ethical standards are missing, leading to a lack of substantial aspects of accountability in the administration.\n\nFor instance, police arresting people based on suspicion is legally justified. However, police personnel forced them to accept the commission of offense leaves the question of substantial accountability.\n\nAnother example can be the invoking of article 356 and the associated role of the governor in it. As it was seen that they were largely lacking substantial accountability.\n\nTax officers carrying out raids are completely legal, however, if they are targeting some sections of people question the ethical standards and the substantial aspect of accountability.\n\nTherefore in the traditional concept of accountability ethics is missing from the enforcement of accountability.\n\nChanges made to overcome these issues\n\nThe traditional concept was showing signs of gap between the concept of accountability and its enforcement in letter and spirit.\n\nHence 1980s onwards there were changes made in enforcing accountability. They introduced the participation of people in the process of upholding accountability through the citizens\u2019 charter, right to information, social auditing, and so on.\n\nDue to the increased participation of people transparency increased which created strong deterrence against wrongdoings.\n\nBecause of this changed approach now the civil servants and the discretion of the administration are minimized and the room for misuse of power is narrowed down, resulting in improved responsiveness and responsibility of the civil servants towards the citizens of the country.\n\nWay forward\n\nAny misuse of power if exposed should be punished and the accountability institutions like CAG, CVC, and CBI should be made independent in the true sense.\n\nRather than RTI being a tool for transparency, the government should try to promote transparency.\n\nA local ombudsman should be created by combining a few districts as suggested by the second ARC.\n\nArticle written by Chetna Yadav."

Governance\nTransparency: Openness in operations and decision-making processes, ensuring that stakeholders understand how decisions are made.\nAccountability: Taking responsibility for actions and their impacts on society, the economy, and the environment.\nFairness: Ensuring equitable treatment of all stakeholders, including employees, customers, and communities.\nSustainability: Making decisions that not only benefit the present but also consider future generations.\nExamples and Case Studies\n\nHave a look at some of the examples and case studies to understand the concept of ethical governance.\n\nPatagonia: A Model of Environmental Stewardship\nPatagonia, the outdoor apparel company, exemplifies ethical governance through its commitment to environmental sustainability.\nIt donates a portion of its sales to environmental causes, uses sustainable materials, and encourages consumers to buy less by offering durable products.\nPatagonia\u2019s approach not only respects the environment but also builds long-term loyalty among customers, proving that ethical governance can drive success.\nThe Volkswagen Emissions Scandal: A Lesson in Accountability\nContrastingly, the Volkswagen emissions scandal serves as a cautionary tale of what happens when ethical governance is sidesteined.\nIn 2015, it was discovered that Volkswagen had been using software in its diesel vehicles to cheat on emissions tests, falsely portraying their cars as more environmentally friendly than they were.\nThis breach of trust resulted in billions of dollars in fines and a damaged reputation, highlighting the importance of accountability and transparency.\nNew Zealand\u2019s Approach to COVID-19: Fairness and Transparency\nThe New Zealand government\u2019s handling of the COVID-19 pandemic is a testament to ethical governance in action.\nThrough clear communication, transparent decision-making, and equitable health measures, the government not only managed to control the spread of the virus effectively but also maintained high levels of public trust and cooperation.\nThis case demonstrates how ethical governance can lead to positive outcomes even in the face of global challenges.\nGood Governance vs Ethical Governance\n\nGood governance and ethical governance, while often intertwined, emphasize different dimensions of how organizations and governments operate and interact with their stakeholders.\n\nHere\u2019s a table comparing the two to highlight their unique characteristics and areas of overlap:\n\nAspect\n\t\nGood Governance\n\t\nEthical Governance\n\n\nDefinition\n\t\nRefers to the processes, policies, and laws that ensure an organization is effectively and efficiently managed in a transparent, accountable, and equitable way.\n\t\nFocuses on the moral principles that guide the decision-making and behavior of an organization, ensuring actions are fair, transparent, and beneficial to all stakeholders.\n\n\nKey Principles\n\t\nAccountability, transparency, responsiveness, rule of law, inclusiveness, equity, effectiveness and efficiency, consensus-oriented.\n\t\nIntegrity, honesty, fairness, responsibility, respect, transparency.\n\n\nPrimary Focus\n\t\nThe mechanisms, processes, and structures that ensure the organization\u2019s objectives are achieved in a manner that reflects the interests of all stakeholders.\n\t\nThe ethical values and standards that underpin decisions and actions within the organization, ensure they are in line with moral principles.\n\n\nOutcomes\n\t\nSustainable development, efficient use of resources, protection of stakeholders\u2019 rights, improved decision-making.\n\t\nTrust and credibility among stakeholders, reduced corruption, enhanced reputation, and long-term success.\n\n\nExamples\n\t\nImplementing clear policies for financial management, ensuring public participation in decision-making, and establishing systems for accountability and monitoring.\n\t\nDeveloping a code of ethics, training employees on ethical behavior, and making decisions that go beyond legal compliance to reflect moral considerations.\n\n\nChallenges\n\t\nBalancing diverse stakeholder interests, adapting governance structures to changing external conditions, and ensuring accountability without excessive bureaucracy.\n\t\nNavigating complex ethical dilemmas, maintaining ethical standards in the face of competitive pressures, and aligning individual behavior with organizational values.\n\nWhile good governance provides the framework for managing an organization in a way that is accountable, efficient, and responsive, ethical governance ensures that every action taken within this framework adheres to a set of moral principles.\n\nBoth are essential for achieving not only the strategic objectives of the organization but also for ensuring its actions contribute positively to society and maintain the trust and respect of its stakeholders.\n\nProbity in Governance and Ethical Governance\n\nBelow is a table that differentiates between probity in governance and ethical governance, highlighting key aspects of each:\n\nAspect\n\t\nProbity in Governance\n\t\nEthical Governance\n\n\nDefinition\n\t\nProbity in governance refers to the adherence to the highest standards of ethical behavior and integrity.\n\t\nEthical governance encompasses the broader framework of practices, processes, and values that guide ethical decision-making and behavior in an organization.\n\n\nFocus\n\t\nFocuses on honesty, integrity, and uprightness in the conduct of individuals, especially public officials.\n\t\nFocuses on the ethical principles that govern the organization\u2019s decisions, actions, and treatment of all stakeholders.\n\n\nScope\n\t\nOften associated with anti-corruption measures, transparency, and accountability in public sector management.\n\t\nEncompasses a wider range of ethical considerations, including social responsibility, environmental sustainability, and the ethical treatment of employees and communities.\n\n\nApplication\n\t\nPrimarily applied in the context of public administration and governance.\n\t\nApplies to both public and private sectors, including corporations, non-profits, and governmental bodies.\n\n\nKey Elements\n\t\nTransparency in dealings\nIntegrity in decision-making\nAccountability for actions\n\t\nEthical decision-making\nSocial and environmental responsibility\nStakeholder engagement and fairness\n\n\nOutcome\n\t\nAims to prevent corruption, ensure transparency, and build trust in public institutions.\n\t\nAims to foster an ethical culture, build long-term trust with stakeholders, and ensure sustainable success.\n\n\nImplementation\n\t\nOften involves strict regulations, audits, and compliance mechanisms to enforce integrity.\n\t\nInvolves ethical guidelines, training, leadership by example, and an organizational culture that promotes ethical practices.\nWhy Ethical Governance Matters\n\nEthical governance is not just a moral obligation; it\u2019s a strategic imperative.\n\nOrganizations that prioritize ethical principles are more likely to build trust with their stakeholders, attract and retain talent, and ensure long-term sustainability.\nIn an era where consumers are increasingly conscious of corporate behavior, ethical governance can be a significant differentiator.\nMoreover, in the public sector, ethical governance is crucial for maintaining social cohesion, ensuring the fair distribution of resources, and fostering trust in institutions.\nIt is the backbone of democratic societies, ensuring that power is exercised responsibly and for the benefit of all.\nConclusion\n\nEthical governance is about making the right choices for the right reasons.\n\nIt requires a commitment to values that transcend profit and power, aiming instead for a positive impact on society, the environment, and future generations.\n\nAs we\u2019ve seen through various examples, ethical governance can lead to success and resilience, while its absence can result in failure and mistrust.\n\nIn our interconnected world, the importance of ethical governance has never been more pronounced. It\u2019s the compass that guides us toward a more just, sustainable, and prosperous future for all."

There are several approaches to improving moral principles in government.\n\nPrinciple of Selflessness\n\nOfficers of public offices should only consider the general welfare when making decisions. They should refrain from taking any action that will benefit themselves, their family, or their friends materially or financially.\n\nHigh Integrity\n\nHolders of public office should avoid putting themselves in any kind of debt to outside parties or organizations that could influence how they carry out their official duties.\n\nObjectivity\n\nHolders of public office should base all decisions on merit when conducting public business, including public appointments, contract awards, and recommending people for rewards and benefits.\n\nAccountability\n\nPublic officeholders ought to be as transparent as possible about all their choices and activities. They should document the rationale behind their choices and only impose information restrictions where the larger public interest requires it.\n\nHonesty\n\nHolders of public offices must disclose any private interests that may clash with their official responsibilities and take action to resolve any disputes in a way that safeguards the public\u2019s interests.\n\nLeadership\nHolders of public offices should promote and support these principles by way of leadership and examples.\nSense of belongingness with the Public: Elected representatives such as village Panchayat members, Block Samiti members, Zilla Parish members,\nElected members of the local bodies, MLAs, and MPs should establish a sense of belongingness with voters of their constituencies; and listen to and address their grievances by visiting them regularly to implement ethics in governance.\nBetween the two, there shouldn\u2019t be any communication gaps.\nResponsible and Responsive Civil Servants\n\nA senior-level bureaucrat who serves as a conduit between the people and the government oversees each ministry. These senior officers ought to provide the responsible Minister with accurate feedback regarding the issues experienced by the public and recommendations for workable steps that can be made to address the issue within the bounds of the law. If at all possible, they might also advise changing the law to adequately handle the issue.\n\nFriendly relations with people\n\nGovernance will change into good governance if there are friendly relationships between the government and the people at various levels. If one of their critical demands is not met for any technical reason, the public will feel like they are a part of the administration and will better understand the government\u2019s position.\n\nWhistleblower Protection\n\nSecure Reporting Channels: Establish confidential reporting mechanisms for whistleblowers to report unethical practices without fear of retaliation.\n\nLegal Protections: Enact and enforce legislation that provides legal protections for whistleblowers, encouraging a culture of openness and accountability.\n\nThe steps taken by the government to improve ethical values in governance\neGovernance and digitization to reduce red tape, streamline paperwork, and promote accountability and transparency. Example: PRAGATI, MyGov portal\nRTI enables citizens\u2019 right to know, improving the integrity of government.\nTo ensure there is no corruption, there are strict rules including the Prevention of Corruption Act and the CVC.\nCivil service codes and various Service Rules to ensure honesty and integrity. Example: Civil Service Conduct Rules.\nCitizen charters and citizen-oriented governance to better address feedback, and grievances. Example: CPGRAMS, Jan Sunwai.\nIn 2006, the Department of Personnel drafted a Public Service Bill which enumerated fundamental values of Public Services, a Code of Ethics, a Management Code, etc. to develop public services. The bill didn\u2019t make much headway and is in cold storage etc\nWitness protection scheme to safeguard the witness from victimization.\nMore steps to strengthen ethical and moral values\nImplementation of citizen charters successfully.\nEliminating political meddling and the politicization of governance.\nCode of Ethics and Public Service Bill introduction.\nThe following strategies have been recommended by the Second Administrative Reforms Commission:\nCodifying ethics will guarantee that public employees adhere to the very minimum requirements.\nEffective vigilance mechanisms guarantee that corruption is eradicated from the source. CVC, the Whistleblowers Act, Lokpal, etc. are a few examples.\nMechanisms for social audits must be improved and standardized.\nThe future of governance must be centered on the people, and that means digitization and e-governance. One place where clients can pay all of their bills is UMANG, for instance.\nIf instilled early on through education, values like selflessness, honesty, integrity, and objectivity would eventually result in ethical leadership.\nPublic officials should receive sensitivity training and value-oriented training.\nAuditing should be done ethically.\nEvery organization should ensure that work and responsibility are delegated, and citizen charters should be used to codify the accepted practices.\n\nTo ensure the best service delivery and citizen-centric governance, it is essential to strengthen ethical and moral values in governance.\n\nConclusion\n\nStrengthening ethical and moral values in governance is an ongoing process that requires commitment, continuous effort, and collaboration. By prioritizing transparency, accountability, and citizen engagement, governments can foster a culture of ethical governance that enhances public trust and promotes the well-being of society. Integrating ethical principles into governance practices contributes to the establishment of a just, fair, and responsible government.\n\nArticle written by Aseem Muhammed"

It guides the realm of international relations as well.\n\nThere are a few ethical issues that arise when discussing international relations and funding. The first is the question of whether or not it is appropriate to fund projects in other countries.\n\nEthical issues can be personal or professional. Many ethical issues are social, such that one must decide whether to obey the law or act by conscience. Other ethical issues are not black and white and require careful consideration.\u00a0\n\nWhat is International Ethics?\nThe capacity to actively contribute to the development of a moral worldwide community might be characterized as having international ethics. The aim of creating a solid foundation of moral values that may guide international relations is to create a fair and just global community.\nThe extent and nature of ethical obligations between states in the age of globalization are addressed in the field of international relations theory known as international ethics.\nIt gives insight into how countries and other entities interact with other countries and their citizens.\nIt advises the international community on how to address major problems. For instance, the UNCLOS has aided in distributing maritime resources fairly among all nations.\nThe scope and depth of ethical obligations between states in the age of globalization are the focus of the area of international relations theory known as international ethics. How governments and other entities treat other nations and international ethics explains how inhabitants are explained by international ethics. People who are well-verate the good and evil, the rights and wrongs, that can take place in the global arena.\nSome sources of International Ethics are:\nUN Declaration of Human Rights\nGeneva Convention for Humanitarian Treatment in War\nCommon but differentiated responsibility under the Paris Climate Deal of UNFCCC\nThree perspectives of ethics in International Relations\n\nWhen it comes to ethics in international relations, there are three dominant perspectives: realism, liberalism, and constructivism.\n\nRealistic Perspective:\nThe first is the realistic perspective which suggests that a country\u2019s national interest should be at the center of its decision-making process.\u00a0\nThere is anarchy in International Relations with\u00a0no world government. Hence, the state is the most important actor.\nPeace is created by Deterrence. For instance, Proponents of the Realistic Perspective are of the view that the Third World War didn\u2019t happen because of Nuclear Weapons).\nLiberal Perspective:\nThe second is a liberal perspective that promotes freedom, democracy, the rule of law, civil rights, and human rights.\u00a0\nThe state is an important actor but cooperation between states is possible. For instance, Mutual Cooperation in the form of WTO, UN, IMF, World Bank, UNSC, etc.\nPeace and stability are established via Cooperation.\nConstructive Perspective:\nLastly, the third is a constructivist perspective which argues that the norms and practices of social interactions influence state behavior.\nImportance of International Ethics\nLegitimacy: Ethics grants and withdraws legitimacy. Practices have sprung up or abolished based on society\u2019s core values.\nRights and Responsibilities: The Universal Declaration of Human Rights, along with the United Nations Charter, the Geneva Conventions, and other international agreements like the Refugee Convention, is among the most well-known attempts to create a broad consensus on the elements of human rights.\nPeace and Harmony: Ethics aims at a \u201cPeaceful World\u201d, \u201cRespect for All\u201d & \u201cEquality\u201d while forming international organizations, declarations & forums. Eg: The demand for equality in IMF & UNO shows the demand for adhering to ethics in a way.\nSolidarity: Natural disasters and refugee crises require a more compassionate view of the global community. These are not isolated events and rather, the duty of every global citizen to help in times of crisis. Eg: Aid during natural disasters (Nepal earthquake)\nFairness: Fairness addresses normative standards for appropriate contribution, equal regard, and just desert. Eg: Amartya Sen\u2019s \u201ccapabilities approach\u201d.\nResponsibility Sharing: International environmental initiatives to combat issues like ozone depletion, global warming, etc., which require measures from many states that are important contributors to forces causing such problems, are guided by international ethics. Eg: the Common But Differentiated Responsibility (CBDR) principle in the Paris Climate Deal towards fighting climate change is the result of ethics in international affairs.\nInternational Ethics and foreign funding\nIt is widely argued that international funding helps in building the capacity and empowering local development actors (like NGOs) in developing countries. This is an inclusive and democratic approach to development.\nWhen there are places in the world with no opportunities, economic insecurity, war, instability, hunger, and overwhelming hopelessness, it\u2019s a natural breeding ground for terrorism. So one of the best ways to tackle global terrorism is to lift people out of poverty. International funding is a way to achieve this.\nIt is anticipated that the complexities of responding to climate change require partnerships between international and local NGOs and CSOs.\nDespite several such needs, many countries including India are wary of international funding due to the following reasons.\nEthical Issues with International Funding\n\nThe following are the issues with international funding.\n\nSuppresses the Sovereignty of the Nation\n\nIt involves the following.\n\nConditional Funding:\n\nThe policy framework and strategies are shaped by the donors through impositions, substantially weakening the people\u2019s rights, choices, and decisions to choose the demands and activities necessary for their development.\nConditionality ignores local societal diversity and local ownership.\nEg: The IMF loans to India after the 1991 economic crisis came with severe conditions on macroeconomic policy.\n\nDebt-Trap Funding:\n\nForeign funding to governments in the form of loans to infringe on national sovereignty has also come to light due to China\u2019s debt-trap diplomacy.\nChina provides loans to Pakistan for \u2018One Belt One Road\u2019, and as Pakistan is not able to pay back, it is entangled in China\u2019s debt trap.\nFunding to NGOs\nThere is a growing concern that foreign government contributors are trying to sway local NGOs\u2019 policies and advance their interests by sponsoring them, giving their views unwarranted prominence, and supporting their initiatives.\nIt has been claimed that foreign operatives utilize NGOs to further their goals, such as causing civil unrest and delaying development projects, among others.\nBy delaying coal power projects, Greenpeace advances Western interests.\nMany claim that foreign sponsorship is anti-democratic since it goes against the idea of \u201cgovernment by, for, and of the people.\u201d\nAccording to this viewpoint, civil society, whether progressive or not, is legitimate when it can generate money domestically, while NGOs that rely on foreign funding, on the other hand, distort the will of the people.\nFunding terrorist organizations.\nEg. Pakistan\u2019s ISI has been actively supporting radical organizations to create social disharmony, radicalize local youths, and hire them for terror activities.\nIn the age of Information technology, foreign funding to technology (software and hardware) companies creates a cyber-security risk.\nExample: Last year, India banned several Chinese apps and made FDI through government routes mandatory for investments from neighboring countries.\nDecrease the legitimacy of Elections\nElectoral Bonds are allowed to receive foreign funds. This opens a new and more direct way of foreign influence on local politics.\nThere have been allegations by some Western countries against covert Russian meddling in their elections. Such incidents can happen in India as well.\nFunding for Clinical trials\nMany Western countries have been accused of funding voluntary clinical trials in poor countries in Africa and Asia.\nThis is a clear violation of human rights.\n\nWhen it comes to international relations and funding, there are several ethical problems to take into account. How money is dispersed effectively and efficiently is one problem. The method used to choose which projects to support is another.\n\nThere is also the issue of how to guarantee that the money is used effectively and efficiently. The problem of making sure that projects are sustainable is another.\n\nFinally, it is important to think about how initiatives may affect nearby communities. These moral considerations are crucial because they guarantee that money is being used properly and morally.\n\nConclusion\n\nTo avoid creating issues later on, it is crucial to have openness and accountability in place as well as sound governance procedures from the start. Working with partner organizations can help maintain transparency and accountability.\n\nPartnerships with those who have experienced poverty will be advantageous since they may give feedback on whether programs are effective or detrimental. The finest projects will offer chances for education, skill development, employment, and income generation.\n\nEven though it comes with several ethical concerns, international funding is nonetheless necessary for every country\u2019s development. If properly utilized, this funding can lead the country to progress and prosperity. The creation of an international framework by governments and international organizations is urgently required to ensure that international cash transfers are conducted ethically. India may encourage the international community to work toward this aim by using its influence as a UNSC member.\n\nArticle written by: Aseem Muhammed"

Read further to know.\n\nBefore going deep into the topic, let\u2019s first understand the structure of a company or corporation. There are a few entities that revolve around most companies and those include owners (shareholders), the board of directors, management and the stakeholders such as employees, suppliers, customers as well as the public at large.\n\nA good company should not only make a profit for the founders or owners but should benefit all stakeholders. The interests\u00a0of ordinary shareholders should never be compromised.\u00a0Shareholders are the true owners of the corporation and all governance policies of a corporation should uphold this fact.\n\nCorporate governance is the ethical practice of corporate administration where the interests of shareholders and other stakeholders are always given high priority.\n\nTable of Contents\n\nWhat is corporate governance?\nDefinition\nGuidelines at the International Level\nInitiatives in India\nUnderstanding the Governance of corporations\nSignificance\nWhat is corporate governance?\n\nCorporate governance is a concept that revolves around the appropriate management and control of a company.\n\nIt includes the rules relating to the power relations between owners, the board of directors, management and the stakeholders such as employees, suppliers, customers as well as the public at large.\nSustained growth of any organization requires the cooperation of all stakeholders, which requires adherence to the best corporate governance practices.\nIn this regard, the management needs to act as trustees of the shareholders at large and prevent asymmetry of benefits between various sections of shareholders, especially between the owner-managers and the rest of the shareholders.\nIn general, corporate governance corresponds to the fair, transparent and ethical administration of a corporation giving maximum benefits to the shareholders.\nEthics is at the core of corporate governance, and management must reflect accountability for their actions on the global community scale.\nGovernance of corporations is a relatively new term used to describe a process, which has been practised for as long as there have been corporate entities.\nThis process seeks to ensure that the business and management of corporate entities are carried on by the highest prevailing standards of ethics and efficacy upon the assumption that it is the best way to safeguard and promote the interests of all corporate stakeholders.\nDefinition\n\nA basic definition of corporate governance, which has been widely recognized, was given in a report by the committee under the chairmanship of Sir Adrian Cadbury (the Cadbury Report)\n\n\ud83d\udc49 Which year are YOU targeting for success in the IAS/IPS/IFS Exam? \ud83d\ude80\n\n(1) \u21d2 UPSC 2025: Prelims cum Mains\n\n(2) \u21d2 UPSC 2026: Prelims cum Mains\n\n(3) \u21d2 UPSC 2027 Prelims cum Mains\n\nTip: Know more about ClearIAS Courses (Online/Offline)\n\nThis definition has been endorsed in various other discourses on the subject, including the 1998 final report of the Committee on The Financial Aspects of Corporate Governance.\n\nIt is the system by which companies are directed and controlled. Boards of directors are responsible for the governance of their companies.\n\nThe shareholders\u2019 role in governance is to appoint the directors and the auditors and to satisfy themselves that an appropriate governance structure is in place.\nThe responsibilities of the directors include setting the company\u2019s strategic aims, providing the leadership to put them into effect, supervising the management of the business and reporting to shareholders on their stewardship.\nThe Board\u2019s actions are subject to laws, regulations and the shareholders in general meetings.\nGuidelines at the International Level\nCadbury Committee Report-The Financial Aspects of Corporate Governance (1992).\nGreenbury Committee Report on Directors\u2019 Remuneration (1995).\nHampel Committee Report on Corporate Governance (1998).\nThe Combined Code, Principles of Good Governance and Code of Best Practice, London Stock Exchange (1998).\nCalPERS\u2019 Global Principles of Accountable Corporate Governance (1999).\nBlue Ribbon Report (1999).\nKing Committee On Corporate Governance (2002).\nSarbanes Oxley Act (2002).\nHiggs Report: Review of the role and effectiveness of non-executive directors (2003).\nThe Combined Code on Corporate Governance (2003).\nASX Corporate Governance Council Report (2003).\nOECD Principles of Corporate Governance (2004).\nThe Combined Code on Corporate Governance (2006).\nUNCTAD Guidance on Good Practices in Corporate Governance Disclosure (2006).\nThe Combined Code on Corporate Governance (2008).\nInitiatives in India\nIn India, corporate governance initiatives have been undertaken by the Ministry of Corporate Affairs (MCA) and the Securities and Exchange Board of India (SEBI).\nThe first formal regulatory framework for listed companies specifically for governance\u00a0of corporations was established by the SEBI in February 2000, following the recommendations of the Kumarmangalam Birla Committee Report. It was enshrined as Clause 49 of the Listing Agreement.\nFurther, SEBI is maintaining the standards of corporate governance through other laws like the Securities Contracts (Regulation) Act, 1956; Securities and Exchange Board of India Act, 1992; and the Depositories Act, 1996.\nThe Ministry of Corporate Affairs appointed a Naresh Chandra Committee on Corporate Audit and Governance in 2002 to examine various corporate governance issues.\nIt made recommendations in two key aspects of corporate governance: financial and non-financial disclosures: independent auditing and board oversight of management. It is making all efforts to bring transparency to the structure of corporate governance through the enactment of the Companies Act and its amendments.\nIndia\u2019s SEBI Committee on Corporate Governance defines it as the \u201cacceptance by management of the inalienable rights of shareholders as the true owners of the corporation and their role as trustees on behalf of the shareholders. It is about commitment to values, about ethical business conduct and about making a distinction between personal & corporate funds in the management of a company.\u201d\nIt has been suggested that the Indian approach is drawn from the Gandhian principle of trusteeship and the Directive Principles of the Indian Constitution, but this conceptualization of corporate objectives is also prevalent in Anglo-American and most other jurisdictions.\nTo promote better practices in India, the Ministry of Corporate Affairs, Government of India, has set up the National Foundation for Corporate Governance (NFCG) in partnership with the Confederation of Indian Industry (CII), Institute of Company Secretaries of India (ICSI) and Institute of Chartered Accountants of India (ICAI).\nUnderstanding the Governance of corporations\n\nJust like the governance of a country, the governance of a corporation is also not an easy matter.\n\nAlmost all modern corporations work transparently; there will be elections to the top posts. Shareholders elect the Board of Directors. The Board of Directors appoint the officers (management) for day-to-day administration. They will run the company on behalf of shareholders.\nCommitment to the highest standards of ethics and integrity should be an uncompromising principle of every corporation. The objective of establishing a good governance structure is to foster entrepreneurial drive within a system of accountability to ensure maximum returns to all stakeholders.\nWhile it is debatable whether consensus can be reached on what is \u2018Best Practice\u2019 in terms of the Governance of corporations, considering the structure, complexity and diversity of organizations.\nHowever, as a responsible corporate citizen, we make sure that we adhere to corporate best practices at all times.\nIt is based on principles such as conducting the business with integrity and fairness, being transparent about all transactions, making all the necessary disclosures and decisions, complying with all the laws of the land, accountability and responsibility towards the stakeholders and commitment to ethically conducting business.\nAnother point that is highlighted in the SEBI report is the need for those in control to be able to distinguish between what are personal and corporate funds while managing a company.\nSignificance\n\nThe term is highlighted whenever there are corporate frauds. Corporate Governance and Code of Corporate Governance calls for ethical and accountable corporate administration.\n\nThe best practices are important not only for the public or shareholders but also for the very existence of the company itself. Adopting the system will increase the value, sustainability and long-term profits.\nThese days, it is not enough for a company to merely be profitable; it also needs to demonstrate good corporate citizenship through environmental awareness, ethical behaviour and sound corporate governance practices.\nIt has become a pressing issue following the 2002 introduction of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act in the U.S., which was ushered in to restore public confidence in companies and markets after accounting fraud bankrupted high-profile companies such as Enron and WorldCom.\nThe importance of corporate governance was highlighted at the time of Satyam Fraud and also when Kingfisher Airlines was making a loss.\n\nEffective corporate governance systems can vary widely around the globe, influenced by different legal, regulatory, and cultural environments.\n\nHowever, the underlying goal remains the same: to enhance corporate performance and accountability in the interest of shareholders and other stakeholders, thereby contributing to the stability and efficiency of financial and economic systems."

Some clients take out loans totaling thousands of crores of rupees but do not repay the debt. Then some borrow very little money\u2014perhaps a few thousand rupees\u2014and repay it all at once.\n\nLal Bahadur Shastri, the first prime minister of India, borrowed Rs 5,000 from the Punjab National Bank in 1965 to purchase a Fiat automobile.\n\nBefore he could pay back the money, he passed away in Tashkent in 1966.

It is strict adherence to a code of ethics based on undeviating honesty. Never resorting to illicit practices or cheating during an exam can be good examples of probity.\n\nProbity reflects the maximalist method of living, in which one upholds the greatest goals and beliefs, as opposed to merely refraining from engaging in unethical or corrupt actions in one\u2019s personal and professional life.\n\nWhat is Probity in governance?\n\nProbity in governance is defined as the adherence to ethical and moral values like honesty and integrity.\n\nIt refers to procedural integrity with a high level of ethical standards which is very important in the governance system and for the socio-economic development and the welfare of the people of the country.\n\nStrong actions by the IAS officer Durga Shakti Nagpal against the land scam and sand mafia racket in Uttar Pradesh is a real-life example of probity in governance.\n\nThe passing of the Social Audit by the Meghalaya government will further help in increasing the level of probity.\n\nWhy do we need Probity in the governance system?\n\nIt helps in preserving the confidence of the public in the government and enhances the public trust in the governance system of the country.\n\nProbity helps maintain the integrity upright in the public service of the nation, which is the bedrock of the governance system.\n\nIt helps in avoiding the potential if any for misconduct and corruption and also helps in ensuring compliance with the processes and accountability in the governance system.\n\nHow to ensure probity in governance?\n\nTo make someone high on probity it becomes important to provide them with proper training on moral ethics so that they are inspired, and reflected in the governance. Moral education can help in ensuring it. For example, training can be given to avoid bribes.\n\nAccountability can play a positive role, when an individual is expected to give answers and is answerable to the higher authorities then they avoid performing acts that are not correct which ultimately transforms into good governance. For example, social audits help in ensuring accountability and thus result in probity.\n\nTransparency is an integral part of any organization, it compels the state and the civil society to look into rules and have clear objectives, monitor and report on the performance.\n\nCompulsory display of the citizen\u2019s charter in the government offices under the Right to Information Act can help in ensuring probity.\n\nProbity is maintained by formulating and implementing the code of conduct and adhering to the model code of conduct for the ministers, bureaucracy, civil society groups, etc. For example, the Indian army maintained the code of conduct in the treatment of the Pakistani prisoners of war concerning their living quarters and food.\n\nWe can allow the different stakeholders the participate in various decision-making processes via public hearings, capacity building of citizens, and so on.\n\nMerely making rules and regulations will not help, we need effective laws, rules, and regulations governing every feature and its effective implementation. For example, following COVID distancing norms during the lockdown period.\n\nStrong anti-corruption machinery with real and effective power is the need of the hour to probe government officials and high-level politicians. Ashish Tiwari, an IPS officer along with smart policing 2018 introduced smart governance through low-cost initiatives to weed out corruption.\n\nAll the people and the organizations interacting with an organization are expected to be impartial at every stage of the process. For example, recruitment procedures conducted by the Union Public Service Commission ensure impartiality at every stage of the process.\n\nTransformational leadership mighty help, for example, the salt satyagraha led by Mahatma Gandhi where he motivated thousands of people toward a common goal the best example.\n\nEmotional intelligence can be a useful tool as it helps in understanding and managing emotions. People with high emotional intelligence know what they are feeling and these emotions can affect others.\n\nLastly, participative democracy can be the best way forward as it is concerned with ensuring that citizens are provided the opportunity to directly participate and be involved in the decisions that affect their lives.\n\nMeasures taken by the government\nPrevention of Corruption Act 1988 defines a public servant combining the purview of corruption and bribes.\nThe Right to Information Act\u00a0helps probity in governance through citizen activism. Even the second ARC considers the RTI act as the master key to good governance.\nThe Central Vigilance Commission\u00a0advises the government in matters related to the maintenance of integrity in the governance system.\nLokpal and Lokayukta Act 2013 provides an institution of ombudsman which helps in enquiring the allegations of corruption against certain public functionaries and the matters related to them.\n\nProbity in governance is an essential tool for an efficient and effective system of governance and the socio-eco-development and welfare of society.\n\nArticle written by Chetna Yadav"

within government agencies, aimed at delivering services, formulating policies, and implementing programs that cater to the public interest.\nPublic servants, therefore, are the custodians of societal welfare, tasked with the noble duty of ensuring that the needs of the community are met with efficiency, equity, and compassion.\nThe ethos of public service transcends personal gain, emphasizing a commitment to the collective well-being of society.\nIt demands from its practitioners an unwavering dedication to the principles of justice, equality, and respect for all individuals, regardless of their status or background.\nPublic servants are, thus, expected to act with a sense of purpose that goes beyond their personal ambitions, focusing on the greater good and the long-term benefits for the community they serve.\nExamples of Public Service\n\nThe concept of public service manifests in various forms across the globe, embodying the commitment to serve the public interest with integrity, impartiality, and efficiency.\n\n\ud83d\udc49 Which year are YOU targeting for success in the IAS/IPS/IFS Exam? \ud83d\ude80\n\n(1) \u21d2 UPSC 2025: Prelims cum Mains\n\n(2) \u21d2 UPSC

service:\n\nHealthcare Services\nIn many countries, public healthcare systems are a prime example of public service, providing essential medical care to citizens regardless of their financial status.\nFor instance, the National Health Service (NHS) in the United Kingdom offers comprehensive healthcare services ranging from general practitioner visits to emergency treatment and long-term care, funded primarily through taxation.\nHealthcare professionals working in such systems embody the public service ethos by prioritizing patient care and equitable access to medical services.\nEducation\nPublic education systems serve as another cornerstone of public service, aiming to deliver quality education to all children and young adults.\nCountries like Finland have garnered international acclaim for their public education systems, which emphasize equal opportunities, teacher autonomy, and student well-being.\nEducators and administrative staff within these systems dedicate themselves to nurturing the intellectual and social development of students, ensuring that future generations are equipped with the knowledge and skills to contribute positively to society.\nEmergency Services\nEmergency services, including fire departments, police forces, and emergency medical services (EMS), are vital components of public service.\nThese services are built on the principles of rapid response, expertise, and a commitment to saving lives and maintaining public safety.\nFor example, firefighters not only battle blazes but also engage in rescue operations, fire prevention education, and community safety planning.\nPolice officers ensure law and order, focusing on community policing and crime prevention strategies that build trust between law enforcement and the communities they serve.\nEnvironmental Protection\nPublic service also extends to the protection and preservation of the environment through various government agencies and initiatives.\nFor example, the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) in the United States enforces regulations that protect air and water quality, oversees hazardous waste disposal, and works to mitigate the impacts of climate change.\nEmployees of such agencies are dedicated to safeguarding natural resources for present and future generations, reflecting a deep commitment to public service and the public good.\nSocial Welfare Programs\nSocial welfare programs provide critical support to vulnerable populations, including the elderly, disabled, unemployed, and low-income families.\nThrough services such as unemployment benefits, disability assistance, housing support, and food aid programs, these initiatives exemplify public service by striving to reduce poverty, promote social justice, and enhance the quality of life for those in need.\nPublic servants in this sector work tirelessly to administer these programs fairly and compassionately, ensuring that aid reaches those who need it most.\nPublic Infrastructure Projects\nThe development and maintenance of public infrastructure\u2014roads, bridges, public transportation systems, and utilities\u2014are crucial public services that facilitate economic development and improve quality of life.\nProjects like the construction of high-speed rail networks in countries like Japan and France demonstrate a commitment to sustainable development, connectivity, and public convenience.\nEngineers, planners, and construction workers involved in these projects contribute to the public service ethos by focusing on safety, efficiency, and long-term benefits for the community.\nEach of these examples showcases the multifaceted nature of public service, highlighting the dedication of public servants to enhancing the welfare of society through their respective roles.\nThe underlying principle across all these examples is the commitment to serve the public interest with integrity, accountability, and a deep sense of responsibility.\nProbity in Governance: The Ethical Compass\n\nProbity in governance is the ethical bedrock upon which the credibility and legitimacy of public institutions are built.\n\nIt encompasses the principles of honesty, integrity, and moral uprightness, ensuring that public officials conduct their duties with the highest ethical standards.\nProbity is what instils confidence in the public, affirming that their representatives and civil servants are working in the best interest of society, free from corruption, nepotism, and undue influence.\nAn integral aspect of probity is the commitment to transparency and accountability in all government dealings.\nThese principles ensure that decision-making processes are open to scrutiny and that public officials are answerable to the citizens for their actions.\nBy fostering an environment where decisions are made in the light of day, governments can build trust with their constituents, reinforcing the belief that public service is carried out with fairness and integrity.\nThe Concept of Public Service: A Pillar of Probity in Governance\n\nPublic service is any assistance given by the government to those under its purview, either directly or by assisting independent private organizations.\n\nAll public servants working for the government are included in the term\u2019s second definition.\nThe idea that some services should be accessible to everyone, regardless of wealth, is implied by the term \u201cpublic service.\u201d\nOver millennia, the idea of public service has changed.\nAlthough plenty of resources were available during the beginning of human existence, there weren\u2019t many requirements.\nEveryone might meet their requirements in that condition of nature without exerting any significant conscious effort.\nThere was a tiny population, basic living, minimal needs, and an abundance of resources.\nThere was little evidence of rivalry or strife.\nDespite the absence of institutional controls, society was generally peaceful and orderly.\nAs the complexity of life expanded and the population grew, a struggle for survival started.\nThe idea of the state was purposefully formed to preserve correct order in society when this struggle for survival could no longer be sustained.\nThe fulfilment of everyone\u2019s necessities was another goal of establishing a state.\nInfrastructure for public services was developed to accomplish this.\nProbity in Governance vs Corruption in Public Life\n\nProbity in administration is the antithesis of corruption in public life.\n\nThe UN Convention against Corruption emphasizes probity.\nProbability is the demonstration of moral behaviour in a specific process.\nA strict devotion to the highest values and principles (integrity, honesty, and decency) is referred to as probity. It strikes a balance between a person\u2019s self-interest and their duty to the community.\nHigh moral and ethical standards like integrity, honesty, impartiality, devotion to constitutional values, and devoted and selfless public service are requirements for probity in public life on the part of all public workers.\nAs a risk management strategy that ensures procedural integrity, probity has been described. Instead of focusing on results, it is more interested in protocols, systems, and processes.\nThe cornerstone of effective governance is the idea of probity in public life. It is essential to both democracy and long-term progress.\nGood policy-making, effective service delivery, accountability, and responsibility in the use of public resources are all attributes of good governance that are fostered by a well-functioning civil service.\nIn addition to the traditional civil service values of effectiveness, integrity, accountability, and patriotism, the Second Administrative Reforms Commission asserts that civil servants must instil and adopt moral and ethical principles such as probity in public life, observance of human rights, empathy for the oppressed, and devotion to their welfare.\nMaintaining probity for government employees and agencies entails more than just abstaining from corrupt or dishonest behaviour.\nIt entails putting public sector values like objectivity, accountability, and transparency into practice.\nPublic Service with an emphasis on probity\nThe public servant should act as the ideal citizen for others to follow.\nInstead, public service in India is marred with corruption, favouritism, criminalization, high-handedness, and indifference.\nGiven the high rate of poverty, illiteracy, and poor health standards in India, there is an urgent need to improve the quality of governance.\nThus, to overcome these challenges, probity in public life is required.\nChallenges to Probity in Governance\nCorruption in public life\nIncreasing political interference in the administration.\nAbsence of transparency and accountability.\nArchaic code of conduct and absence of code of ethics.\nComplex laws giving immunity (e.g., Article 311) and lethargic judiciary.\nUnholy politician-bureaucrat-businessman nexus.\nGeneral disintegration of ethics in society.\nLack of focus on quality-of-service delivery.\nChallenges and Solutions\n\nDespite the ideals of public service and probity, challenges such as corruption, inefficiency, and lack of accountability can erode public trust in governance.\n\nTo combat these issues, institutions must implement robust mechanisms for transparency, establish clear codes of conduct, and encourage a culture of ethical leadership.\nEducation and awareness programs can also play a vital role in reinforcing the values of public service and probity among current and future generations of public servants.\nConclusion: A Call to Action\n\nThe concepts of public service and probity in governance are not merely theoretical ideals; they are actionable principles that require the commitment and vigilance of every individual involved in the machinery of governance.\n\nAs societies evolve, so too must our understanding and implementation of these concepts, adapting to new challenges and opportunities with the ultimate goal of serving the public interest with honour and integrity.\n\nIn essence, the commitment to public service and probity is a call to action for all public officials and citizens alike to foster a governance culture that values transparency, accountability, and ethical conduct.\n\nBy embracing these principles, we can ensure that governance not only meets the needs of the present but also lays the foundation for a just and prosperous future for all.\n\nIndia\u2019s entire educational system needs to be changed so that lessons on morality, ethics, nonviolence, truth, brotherhood, honesty, integrity, and uprightness are included in the curriculum.\n\nThe goal should be to steer the next generation properly to create a society with rules.\n\nProbity enters public life as a result of an orderly society, where it then becomes the norm.\n\nRead more: Ethics study materials."

Read further to know more.\n\nProbity originates from the Latin word \u2018probitas\u2019, meaning good. Probity is confirmed integrity. It is usually regarded as being incorruptible. It is the quality of having strong moral principles and strictly following them, such as honesty, uprightness, transparency, and incorruptibility.\n\nThe philosophical basis of probity in governance can be traced back to ancient Greek and Roman philosophy, which emphasized the importance of justice, honesty, and integrity in public life.\n\nThe philosopher Aristotle, for example, argued that good governance depended on the virtue and moral character of the rulers and that rulers had a moral obligation to act in the best interests of the community.\n\nIn the modern world, probity in governance has become an increasingly important issue, as the temptation for those in positions of power to abuse their authority for personal gain can be significant.\n\nThis has led to the development of various mechanisms and practices to promote probities in public life, such as codes of conduct, transparency laws, and independent oversight bodies.\n\nTable of Contents\n\nHistorical Perspective\nPhilosophical basis of probity in governance\nPrinciples of Probity\nWhy probity in governance is a desired attribute?\nConclusion\nHistorical Perspective\n\nThe concept of probity in governance has a long and varied history, with roots in ancient Greek and Roman philosophy.

Theoretical dogmas on ethical administration were also offered by Chinese thinkers such Lao Tse, Confucius, and Mencius.\n\nAs civilizations developed and became more complex, the need for mechanisms to ensure probity in governance became more pressing.\n\nIn the medieval period, for example, the Catholic Church played an important role in promoting ethical standards in public life, through the establishment of moral codes and the use of ex-communication as a means of punishing corrupt officials.\n\nIn the modern era, the issue of probity in governance has become increasingly important, as the temptation for those in positions of power to abuse their authority for personal gain can be significant.\n\nThis has led to the development of various mechanisms and practices to promote probities in public life, such as codes of conduct, transparency laws, and independent oversight bodies.\n\nOne of the most significant developments in the history of probity in governance has been the emergence of democratic systems of government, in which the actions of those in positions of authority are subject to the scrutiny and oversight of the public and the media.\n\nThis has helped to ensure that public officials are accountable for their actions and are held to high ethical standards.\n\nOverall, the history of probity in governance reflects a longstanding recognition of the importance of ethical standards in public life, and the need for mechanisms to ensure that those in positions of power act in the best interests of the community.\n\nWhile the specific practices and mechanisms used to promote probity have evolved over time, the underlying principles have remained largely constant, with a focus on accountability, transparency, and the rule of law.\n\nPhilosophical basis of probity in governance\n\nThe philosophical foundations of governance and probity refer to the underlying principles and ideas that inform the way a society is governed, with a focus on ethical standards and the avoidance of corruption and abuse of power. These principles can vary widely, but some of the key philosophical foundations of governance and probity include:\n\nSocial contract theory: The idea that individuals agree to give up some of their rights and freedoms in exchange for the protection and order provided by the state.\nRule of law: The principle that the law applies equally to all individuals, regardless of their social status or position of power.\nAccountability: The requirement that those in positions of authority are answerable to the public for their actions, and can be held to account if they fail to act in a responsible and ethical manner.\nTransparency: The requirement that the actions of those in positions of authority are open and transparent, and that the public has access to information about how decisions are made and how resources are allocated.\nIndividual rights and freedoms: The belief that individuals should have certain inalienable rights and freedoms, and that the state has a responsibility to protect these rights.\nCollective ownership: The idea that the means of production should be owned collectively, rather than by private individuals or corporations.\nRedistribution of wealth: The principle that the state should redistribute wealth in order to promote social and economic equality.\nCommunitarian values: The belief that the needs and interests of the community should take precedence over the rights and freedoms of the individual.\nVirtue ethics: The idea that good governance depends on the virtue and moral character of the rulers, and that rulers have a moral obligation to act in the best interests of the community.\nUtilitarianism: The belief that actions and policies should be judged based on their ability to promote the greatest happiness for the greatest number of people.\n\nThese are just a few examples of the many philosophical foundations that have influenced the way societies are governed throughout history. The philosophical basis of governance and probity is a complex and multifaceted topic, with a wide range of ideas and perspectives that have shaped the way societies are governed and governed themselves.\n\nOverall, the philosophical basis of probity in governance is rooted in the belief that those in positions of authority have a moral obligation to act in the best interests of the community, and that they should be held to high ethical standards.\n\nThis requires the promotion of principles such as accountability, transparency, and the rule of law, as well as the implementation of specific practices and mechanisms to ensure that these principles are upheld.\n\nPrinciples of Probity\n\nThe Nolan Committee was established in the United Kingdom in 1994 to review standards of conduct in public life, with a focus on probity and integrity in governance.\n\nThe committee\u2019s recommendations, which were published in a series of reports between 1995 and 1997, included the identification of seven principles of public life that are designed to promote integrity and trust in the UK\u2019s public institutions. These principles are known as the \u201cNolan Principles.\u201d\u00a0This can be read at par with the evolution of the Philosophical Basis of Governance and Probity.\n\nSelflessness: Public officials should act in the public interest and not for personal gain.\nIntegrity: Public officials should not place themselves in situations where their honesty and impartiality could be called into question.\nObjectivity: Public officials should base their decisions on evidence and should not allow their personal views to influence their judgment.\nAccountability: Public officials should be accountable for their actions and should be prepared to justify their decisions.\nOpenness: Public officials should be open and transparent in their actions and should be willing to provide information to the public.\nHonesty: Public officials should be truthful and honest in their dealings with the public and with their colleagues.\nLeadership: Public officials should exhibit strong leadership qualities and should strive to set a good example for others to follow.\n\nThese principles are intended to provide guidance for the behavior of public officials in the UK and are designed to ensure that those in positions of authority are held to high ethical standards.\n\nThe Nolan Principles are widely recognized as an important benchmark for probity in public life and are used as a reference point for assessing the conduct of public officials in the UK.\n\nWhy probity in governance is a desired attribute?\n\nHere are five key points that highlight the need for probity in governance:\n\nTrust and confidence: Probity in governance is essential for maintaining trust and confidence in the public institutions and those who lead them. When the public perceives that those in positions of authority are acting with integrity and honesty, it helps to foster a sense of trust and confidence in the system as a whole.\nFairness: Probity in governance helps to ensure that decisions are made fairly and impartially, rather than being influenced by personal interests or agendas. This is important for promoting a sense of justice and fairness within society.\nGood governance: Probity in governance is closely linked to the concept of good governance, which refers to the effective and responsible management of a country or organization. When those in positions of authority are held to high ethical standards, it helps to ensure that the governance of a society is effective and efficient.\nEconomic development: Probity in governance can also have a positive impact on economic development. When the public perceives that those in positions of authority are acting with integrity, it can help to create a more favorable business environment and encourage investment.\nPolitical stability: Probity in governance is also important for maintaining political stability, as it helps to ensure that those in positions of power are accountable for their actions and are not able to abuse their authority. This can help to prevent social unrest and conflicts within society.\n\nIn total, the need for probity in governance is clear. By promoting ethical standards and the avoidance of corruption, we can help to ensure that those in positions of authority are acting in the best interests of the community and that our public institutions are trustworthy and effective.\n\nConclusion\n\nThe lack of corruption is a necessary condition for ensuring probity in government, according to the National Commission to Review the Working of the Constitution\u2019s (NCRWC, 2002) report on the topic.\n\nThe other prerequisites include effective laws, rules, and regulations that cover every facet of public life as well as their effective and fair application.\n\nThe NCRWC presented recommendations on how to uphold probity in governance, with a focus on the legal and procedural components of containing the corruption threat. Therefore, a prerequisite for an efficient and effective system of governance as well as for socio-economic growth is probity in governance.\n\nClick here to Read more notes on GS-IV -ETHICS\n\nArticle Written By: Jis John Sebastian"

Open data initiatives facilitate innovation, research, and the development of applications that benefit society.\nFreedom of Information Acts: Many countries have enacted Freedom of Information (FOI) laws, which grant citizens the right to access information held by the government. These laws promote transparency and empower citizens to hold the government accountable.\nGovernment Portals and Websites: Governments often maintain official portals and websites that provide information about policies, programs, services, and contact details. These platforms serve as centralized sources of information for citizens.\nSocial Media and Online Platforms: Governments use social media and other online platforms to share information in real-time, connect with citizens, and address concerns. These channels also serve as tools for disseminating emergency information.\nData Privacy and Security: While sharing information, governments must prioritize data privacy and security to protect citizens\u2019 sensitive information. Implementing robust cybersecurity measures and respecting privacy rights contribute to responsible information sharing.\nWhat is transparency in governance?\n\nTransparency in governance refers to the practice of making government processes, information, and decision-making more open and accessible to the public.\n\nIt involves the release of government data and documents, the use of open meetings and public forums, and the implementation of freedom of information laws, among other measures.\n\nThe goal of increasing transparency in governance is to promote accountability, trust, and public participation in the democratic process. It allows citizens to better understand how their government operates and to hold it accountable for its actions.\n\nIn addition, transparency can help to prevent corruption and abuse of power, as it allows for greater scrutiny of government activities.\n\nBenefits of transparency in governance\n\nThere are several benefits to transparency in governance, including:\n\nImproved accountability: Transparency allows citizens to hold their government accountable for its actions and decisions.\nEnhanced trust: Transparency can help to build trust between the government and the public, as it allows citizens to see how their government operates.\nIncreased participation: Transparency can encourage greater public participation in the democratic process, as citizens can access information and have a say in decision-making.\nReduced corruption: Transparency can help to prevent corruption and abuse of power, as it allows for greater scrutiny of government activities.\nHow to maintain transparency in information sharing?\n\nThere are several measures that governments can take to maintain transparency in information sharing:\n\nParticipatory governance: Participatory governance refers to a process in which citizens are actively involved in the decision-making processes of their government. The goal of participatory governance is to increase the accountability, responsiveness, and transparency of government by allowing citizens to have a greater say in the decisions that affect their lives. Panchayati Raj institutions and urban local bodies, social audits, etc. are some of the means to achieve the same.\nImplement freedom of information laws: These laws give citizens the right to access government information, subject to certain exemptions to protect sensitive information. The Right to Information Act 2005 is one such enabling provision.\nEstablish open data initiatives: Governments can make data sets available to the public through open data portals, allowing citizens to access and use data on a wide range of topics. E.g., Open Government Data (OGD) Platform.\nUse open meetings and public forums: Governments can hold public meetings and forums to discuss and make decisions on important issues, allowing citizens to have a say in the process.\nProvide regular updates and progress reports: Governments can keep the public informed about their activities and decision-making by providing regular updates and progress reports.\nUse social media and other online platforms: Governments can use social media and other online platforms to share information and engage with the public. e-governance initiatives of the government aim at achieving this.\nProtect whistleblowers: Whistleblower protection laws protect individuals who report misconduct or wrongdoing within their organization, encouraging transparency and accountability.\nEstablish clear policies and procedures: Governments can establish clear policies and procedures for information sharing, including guidelines for handling sensitive information.\nBudget Transparency: Governments can enhance transparency by providing detailed information about public expenditures, budgets, and financial transactions. This helps citizens understand how public funds are allocated and spent.\nPublic Consultation: Engaging citizens in decision-making processes through public consultations fosters transparency and inclusivity. Governments can seek public input on policies, projects, and legislative initiatives.\nTransparency in Procurement:\u00a0Disclosing information about government procurement processes, contracts, and vendor details enhances transparency and helps prevent corruption. Online platforms may be used to publish procurement-related information.\nPublic Reporting and Audits:\u00a0Regularly publishing audit reports, financial statements, and performance evaluations enhances transparency. Independent oversight bodies contribute to accountability by reviewing government activities.\nTransparency in Legislative Processes:\u00a0Making legislative processes more transparent, including live streaming of sessions, providing access to bills, and recording votes, ensures that citizens are informed about the decision-making processes of their representatives.\nAccessible Information for Persons with Disabilities: Ensuring that information is accessible to all, including persons with disabilities, promotes inclusivity and transparency. This involves providing information in accessible formats, such as Braille or electronic text.\nHow does India promote Information sharing and transparency?\n\nIn India, several initiatives and mechanisms have been introduced to enhance transparency and provide citizens with access to information.\n\nRight to Information Act (RTI), 2005:\u00a0The RTI Act is a landmark legislation that empowers citizens to seek information from public authorities. It promotes transparency by requiring government agencies to disclose information proactively and respond to citizens\u2019 requests for information within specified timelines.\nOpen Government Data (OGD) Platform:\u00a0The Open Government Data Platform India (data.gov.in) is an initiative that provides single-point access to datasets published by various government departments. It aims to promote transparency, innovation, and the use of government data for research and development.\ne-Governance Initiatives:\u00a0Various e-Governance initiatives, such as Digital India, have been launched to leverage technology for delivering government services, enhancing transparency, and reducing corruption. Online portals and platforms facilitate the electronic exchange of information between the government and citizens.\nPublicly Accessible Websites:\u00a0Government departments and agencies maintain official websites that provide information about their functions, policies, programs, and services. These websites often include documents, reports, and updates for public access.\nBudget Transparency:\u00a0The Union Budget and state budgets are presented transparently, outlining allocations and expenditures. Budget documents are made available to the public, and efforts are made to simplify the budgetary process for better understanding by citizens.\nSocial Media Engagement:\u00a0Government agencies, including ministries and departments, actively use social media platforms to disseminate information, engage with citizens, and address queries. This contributes to a more direct and interactive communication channel.\nTransparency in Recruitment and Examinations:\u00a0Recruitment processes for government jobs and competitive examinations are often conducted transparently. Notifications, results, and related information are made available on official websites to ensure accessibility and fairness.\nCitizen Charters:\u00a0Many government departments and agencies publish Citizen Charters that outline the services they offer, service standards, and the grievance redressal mechanisms. These charters aim to set expectations and ensure accountability.\nAccountability Mechanisms:\u00a0Vigilance commissions and ombudsman mechanisms play a role in holding public officials accountable for their actions. These entities investigate complaints of corruption and maladministration.\nParticipatory Governance:\u00a0Initiatives such as MyGov encourage citizen participation in governance. Citizens can provide suggestions, participate in discussions, and contribute to policy formulation and decision-making processes.\nConclusion\n\nTransparency allows the public to see how their government is operating and to hold it accountable for its actions. This can help to prevent corruption and abuse of power, as it allows for greater scrutiny of government activities. Thus, it can facilitate collaboration and teamwork between different levels of government and between the government and the public.\n\nArticle written by: Caroline"

            "[CONTENT]": "What is the Code of Ethics? What are its components and characteristics? What are its issues? To answer these questions, read further.\n\nA code of ethics is primarily intended to provide direction for all decision-making and to establish a shared ethical foundation for all decisions. Additionally, it aids experts in understanding the steps that need to be taken by them.\n\nIt is a set of rules intended to promote proper conduct among members of a certain group, association, or profession.\n\nThe code is developed based on actions that the organizations want to prevent from occurring and happening rather than just based on the actions of past organizational and individual experiences.\n\nRobert Bowen has given two fundamental and significant functions of the code of ethics.\n\nThe first purpose is the moral and professional standards of conduct. These will hold people accountable for performance and their dedication to honesty and obligation.\n\nThe second purpose is to define professional behavior to promote a sense of tolerance, pride, and responsibility among professionals.\n\n\ud83d\udc49 Which year are YOU targeting for success in the IAS/IPS/IFS Exam? \ud83d\ude80\n\n(1) \u21d2 UPSC 2025: Prelims cum Mains\n\n(2) \u21d2 UPSC 2026: Prelims cum Mains\n\n(3) \u21d2 UPSC 2027 Prelims cum Mains\n\nTip: Know more about ClearIAS Courses (Online/Offline)\n\nWhile writing a code of ethics, we should keep in mind that it should be written to a general audience. It is written in a clear yet specific language and should follow a logical order.\n\nA code of ethics is crucial for any sort of business as violations of ethics can lead to major problems with users, partners, or the government. It can lessen ambiguity and take individual opinions into account when establishing ethical norms.\n\nA code of ethics is primarily intended to serve as a general framework for all administrative decisions, providing direction for all decisions.\n\nTable of Contents\n\nCharacteristics of Code of Ethics\nComponents\nIssues with the Code of Ethics\nConclusion\nCharacteristics of Code of Ethics\n\nThe code should be such that it should be feasible. It must not be so difficult as to prohibit the ability to adhere to it. It should be enforceable.\n\nA code of ethics that is enforceable but serves no useful function is equivalent to laws without punishments.\n\nAn individual will lose respect for the law if the law is not implemented in letter and spirit. This is even true for ethical codes as well.\n\nThe failure to enforce the codes leads to a lack of respect for the codes and diminishes the integrity of the process and support for ethos.\n\nComponents\n\nAlways show respect to everyone you interact with, and do so to the degree that you would like to be shown respect in return. For example, since Atal Bihari Vajpayee accepted other people\u2019s opinions, even those of opposition leaders, he was respected by all leaders, including those in the opposition.\n\nThe code of ethics must also promote fairness and ensure that no one else\u2019s rights are violated while making decisions. It may be unfair to hire hiring managers from one part of the state over applicants from another.\n\nIt refers to making decisions consistently with high moral standards and honesty. For example, Rajni Sekhri Sibal, an IAS officer from Haryana. When the political establishment offered her a bribe to alter the outcomes of 3200 Junior Basic Training (JBT) instructors in 1999\u20132000, she firmly refused.\n\nThe code of conduct serves as a decision-making guide and waiver of liability. It reduces the cognitive dissonance and stress associated with some of the decision-making processes.\n\nAn official must select associates based only on merit, without regard to any factors that might serve his interests.\n\nA group\u2019s decisions must be made in the interests of the greatest number of people possible, not just one particular group of people. For example, the Odd-Even program for Delhi Pollution inconvenienced vehicle owners but benefited Delhi\u2019s population as a whole.\n\nThe code of ethics includes taking accountability for organizational actions as well as accountability for the broader good.\n\nIssues with the Code of Ethics\n\nIt is possible that not all people from the same socioeconomic origins can adhere to the same ethical standards. For preventive reasons, a police officer might not wish to detain people with his past or comparable backgrounds.\n\nOrganizations and government agencies today must find creative answers to several problems. Some of which may not be morally correct. A police officer may not be considered morally righteous for using his spies to provide him with information about prospective terrorist suspects.\n\nIt is limited to the imagination of the individuals as the behaviors cannot be guided by any set of rules. It should come from within the organizations and the individuals.\n\nPublic service is a profession that should be governed by a set of rules which do not come from reading a specific code.\n\nIn rare situations, they might occasionally impair rational decision-making. It might not be wise to uphold moral principles amid a riot or inter-communal conflict.\n\nAccording to utilitarian principles, a specific person may be impacted for the sake of the greater good. A person may be detained as a preventive measure if there is reason to believe they may cause trouble later.\n\nConclusion\n\nThe civil service values that all civil servants and government servants should aspire should be defined and made applicable to all the tiers of the government and the organizations.\n\nAny transgression of the mentioned values should be treated as misconduct that will invite punishment.\n\nThe 2nd ARC has also recommended measures to protect civil servants against malicious complaints.\n\nArticle written by Chetna Yadav."

Read to know more.\n\nThe codes of conduct for civil services, such as the Indian Administrative Service (IAS), Indian Police Service (IPS), and other similar branches, are detailed sets of guidelines designed to ensure that officers maintain the highest standards of integrity, impartiality, and dedication to public service.\n\nWhile the specific rules can vary by country and service, the core principles tend to align globally.\n\nHere, we outline some common and relevant aspects of codes of conduct that are typically emphasized across various civil services.\n\nTable of Contents\n\nCodes of Conduct: The Background\nWhat is meant by Codes of Conduct?\nAll India Services Conduct Rules\nGeneral Conduct\nMaintenance of Public Order\nFinancial Integrity\nOfficial Duties and Confidentiality\nAccountability and Disciplinary Measures\nApplications of Code of Conduct: Examples and Case Studies\nIssues with Codes of Conduct\nVagueness and Ambiguity\nLack of Awareness and Understanding\nInadequate Enforcement Mechanisms\nConflict of Interest\nCultural and Contextual Relevance\nOveremphasis on Punishment\nCodes of Conduct: Solutions and Best Practices\nCodes of Conduct: The Background\n\nThe Indian bureaucracy was once known as \u201cbabudom\u201d due to its elitism and sense of entitlement.\n\nThe phrase \u201cbabu\u201d was commonly used in jest to refer to civil servants and other government employees.\n\u201cConduct Rules,\u201d a compilation of guidelines with \u201cdo\u2019s and don\u2019ts,\u201d was produced in the 1930s.\nThe Compilation was divided into separate rules by the All India Services Rules, 1955.\nThe 1964 version was the outcome of the Santhanam Committee\u2019s recommendation to dramatically broaden such regulations.\nThese guidelines were later updated to include new behavioural standards.\nWhat is meant by Codes of Conduct?\nA code of conduct is a set of rules, standards of behaviour, or practices for an individual or organization that guide the decisions, procedures, and systems of an organization in a way that contributes to the welfare of its stakeholders.\nThe code of conduct derives from the code of ethics and transforms the general principles into specific standards that all members of the organization are required to abide by.\nFor instance, the Model Code of Conduct of the Election Commission of India is a set of rules for how political parties and candidates should behave during elections, particularly about speeches, election day, polling booths, portfolios, election manifestos, processions, and general conduct.\nFor civil servants, a set of regulations is established regarding how they should behave while carrying out their tasks.\nCodes of conduct, for instance, specify rules for how government employees should accept gifts and regulate certain types of behaviour.\nAll India Services Conduct Rules\n\nThe All India Services (AIS) encompasses several of India\u2019s premier civil services, including the Indian Administrative Service (IAS), Indian Police Service (IPS), and Indian Forest Service (IFoS).\n\nOfficers in these services play critical roles in the governance and administration at both the central and state levels.\nThe \u201cAll India Services Conduct Rules\u201d are a set of regulations designed to ensure that officers maintain the highest standards of integrity, impartiality, and professionalism in their duties.\n\nHere, we will outline the key elements of the AIS Conduct Rules, reflecting the principles expected of these prestigious services.\n\n\ud83d\udc49 Which year are YOU targeting for success in the IAS/IPS/IFS Exam? \ud83d\ude80\n\n(1) \u21d2 UPSC 2025: Prelims cum Mains\n\n(2) \u21d2 UPSC 2026: Prelims cum Mains\n\n(3) \u21d2 UPSC 2027 Prelims cum Mains\n\nTip: Know more about ClearIAS Courses (Online/Offline)\n\nGeneral Conduct\nIntegrity and Devotion to Duty: AIS officers are expected to maintain absolute integrity, impartiality, and devotion to duty at all times. They must act in a manner that is both by the law and in the best interest of the public.\nProhibition of Sexual Harassment: The conduct rules explicitly prohibit sexual harassment in the workplace, aligning with the commitment to provide a safe and respectful working environment for all employees.\nMaintenance of Public Order\nBehaviour and Decorum: Officers are required to conduct themselves, both in public and in private life, in a manner that does not bring discredit to the service or the nation. This includes the avoidance of any behaviour deemed unbecoming of a civil servant.\nPolitical Neutrality: AIS officers must remain politically neutral. They are prohibited from engaging in any political activities or affiliations that could compromise their position or the impartial execution of their duties.\nFinancial Integrity\nInvestments, Loans, and Bankruptcy: The rules regulate the financial activities of officers, including investments and borrowings, ensuring they do not conflict with their official duties or responsibilities. Officers are also required to manage their personal finances judiciously to avoid insolvency or bankruptcy, which could reflect poorly on the service.\nMovable, Immovable, and Valuable Property: Officers must declare their assets and liabilities, as well as those of their family members. Any acquisitions or disposals of property must be reported, and permissions may be required for certain transactions to prevent conflicts of interest.\nOfficial Duties and Confidentiality\nGifts: The acceptance of gifts, hospitality, or services under certain conditions could be construed as a breach of ethical standards. Officers are required to report the receipt of any gifts received from domestic or foreign dignitaries beyond a specified minimal value.\nConfidentiality of Information: Officers are entrusted with sensitive information and are expected to maintain the confidentiality of such information during and after their service tenure.\nGovernment Resources: The use of government resources must be strictly for official purposes and not for the personal gain of the officer or anyone else.\nAccountability and Disciplinary Measures\nCompliance and Enforcement: Adherence to the AIS Conduct Rules is strictly enforced. Violations can result in disciplinary actions, including censure, suspension, or even dismissal from service, depending on the severity of the breach.\nRedress and Appeals: There are mechanisms in place for officers to appeal against disciplinary actions, ensuring fairness and accountability in the enforcement of the rules.\n\nThe AIS Conduct Rules are essential for maintaining the integrity, effectiveness, and reputation of All India Services.\n\nThey are designed not only to guide officers in their professional conduct but also to uphold the principles of good governance and public service.\n\nBy adhering to these rules, AIS officers set a standard of excellence and ethical behaviour that strengthens the democratic fabric of the nation.\n\nApplications of Code of Conduct: Examples and Case Studies\n\nCodes of Conduct will assist in avoiding conflicts of interest and serve as a guide when it comes to avoiding instances where the officer might appear to be in a profitable position while doing his official obligations.\n\nA conflict of interest may arise for a public employee responsible for awarding contracts for a particular project if one of the applicants is a friend or relative.\nAn essential quality for government workers in carrying out their tasks is honesty.\nA person following a code of conduct should not withhold any facts, figures, or information about a possible violation of the laws of the country.\nAshok Khemka, for instance, is well-recognized for revealing the flaws in a corporate group.\nOne such standard of behaviour that civil servants are supposed to uphold is confidentiality.\nWhen the Pakistani Army urged Vardhaman Abhinandan to reveal top-secret information, he complied with the Indian Air Force\u2019s code of conduct.\nIAS Armstrong Pame built a road despite the lack of government funds and donated a significant amount of his own money.\nThe kindness of a person is a sign of their moral code. Always conduct oneself in interpersonal interactions with consideration for others and kindness.\nIt is obvious when one is upholding the rule of law wherever it is appropriate, as well as the laws and regulations established by the law.\nA person who follows a code of conduct respects other people\u2019s time by being and doing at the appropriate times.\nFor instance, N R Narayana Murthy, who is renowned for his timeliness, shortened his speech from 20 minutes to 5 minutes to assist the organizers in getting a handle on the timetable.\nA person with a high standard of behaviour must be inclusive and remove any bias that might exist for personal or cultural reasons.\nFor instance: The Tatas launched a group-wide project on diversity and inclusion in 2014, including 600,000 individuals from more than 100 different countries.\nA person can be sure to be fair in both his professional and personal responsibilities by having good ethics.\nB. Chandrakala IAS is renowned for being fair and has called out other politicians and government officials for abusing their positions of power and using them for personal gain.\nIssues with Codes of Conduct\n\nWhile the establishment of Codes of Conduct for civil services and other professional organizations is a critical step towards ensuring ethical behaviour and integrity, there are several issues and challenges associated with these codes that can affect their effectiveness.\n\nThese challenges range from the formulation of the codes themselves to issues related to enforcement and compliance. Let\u2019s explore some of these key issues:\n\nVagueness and Ambiguity\nProblem: Codes of Conduct can sometimes be written in a manner that is too broad or vague, leaving too much room for interpretation. This can lead to inconsistencies in enforcement and may allow unethical behaviour to go unchecked.\nImpact: Ambiguity undermines the purpose of the code, making it difficult for members to understand what is expected of them and for enforcers to hold them accountable.\nLack of Awareness and Understanding\nProblem: There is often a gap in awareness or understanding of the Codes of Conduct among the members it is supposed to govern. Without thorough training and education on the code, its principles, and its practical applications, members may inadvertently violate the code.\nImpact: The effectiveness of the code is diminished if it is not internalized by its members as part of their professional conduct.\nInadequate Enforcement Mechanisms\nProblem: Even when Codes of Conduct are clear and well-understood, the lack of a robust mechanism for enforcement can render them ineffective. This includes insufficient monitoring, reporting, and accountability processes.\nImpact: The absence of strong enforcement mechanisms can lead to a culture of impunity, where violations are neither reported nor acted upon, eroding trust in the organization.\nConflict of Interest\nProblem: Conflicts of interest, both real and perceived, can arise when individuals involved in enforcing or adhering to the Code of Conduct have competing priorities or loyalties.\nImpact: This can compromise the impartiality of the enforcement process and may lead to decisions that favour personal or group interests over the principles outlined in the code.\nCultural and Contextual Relevance\nProblem: Codes of Conduct may not always take into account the diverse cultural, social, and organizational contexts in which they are applied. This lack of contextual sensitivity can result in standards that are either too rigid or too lenient for the environment they are meant to regulate.\nImpact: The effectiveness of the code can be compromised if it is not perceived as relevant or applicable to the specific setting in which it operates.\nOveremphasis on Punishment\nProblem: Some Codes of Conduct may focus too heavily on punitive measures for non-compliance rather than on education, awareness, and the promotion of ethical behaviour.\nImpact: An overemphasis on punishment can create a climate of fear and suspicion, which may discourage open discussion about ethical dilemmas and reporting of violations.\nCodes of Conduct: Solutions and Best Practices\n\nTo address these challenges, organizations can adopt several best practices:\n\nClarity and Specificity: Ensure the code is clear, concise, and specific, with examples to guide interpretation and application.\nTraining and Education: Implement comprehensive training programs to promote understanding and internalization of the code\u2019s principles.\nRobust Enforcement: Develop transparent, fair, and effective mechanisms for monitoring compliance and addressing violations.\nEncourage Reporting: Create a safe and supportive environment for reporting ethical concerns and violations without fear of retaliation.\nRegular Review and Update: Periodically review and update the code to reflect changing ethical standards, legal requirements, and organizational values.\n\nBy addressing these issues, organizations can strengthen the effectiveness of their Codes of Conduct, fostering a culture of integrity, accountability, and ethical excellence.\n\nArticle written by Chetna Yadav."

It can include things like the company\u2019s mission and values, the way that employees interact with each other and with management, the level of collaboration and teamwork, and the overall atmosphere and environment of the workplace.\n\nA positive work culture can contribute to employee satisfaction and productivity, while a negative work culture can lead to high turnover and low morale. Some common elements of a positive work culture include:\n\nClear communication and transparency\nA focus on continuous learning and personal development\nA sense of community and teamwork\nRespect for diversity and inclusion\nFair and equitable treatment of all employees\nA balance between work and personal life\n\nCreating a positive work culture requires effort from both management and employees.

Some specific differences include:\n\nCommunication styles: In India, there is often a hierarchy in the workplace and a focus on respect for authority. This can lead to more formal, indirect communication, with employees being more hesitant to speak up or disagree with their superiors. In the West, there is often a greater emphasis on open and direct communication, with employees feeling more comfortable expressing their opinions and ideas.\nBusiness practices: In India, the concept of \u201cface-saving\u201d is important, and there is often a greater focus on maintaining relationships and avoiding conflict. This can lead to a more collaborative and consensus-based decision-making process. In the West, there is often a greater focus on individual achievement and competition, and decisions are more likely to be made on the basis of objective criteria.\nWork-life balance: In India, work often takes precedence over personal life, and it is common for employees to work long hours and put in extra time on weekends. In the West, there is often a greater emphasis on the importance of a healthy work-life balance, with more strict boundaries between work and personal time.\n\nIt\u2019s important to note that these are generalizations and that there is a great deal of diversity within both Indian and Western work cultures. Many companies in both regions have adopted more progressive approaches to work cultures, such as flexible work arrangements and a focus on work-life balance.\n\nMeasures to Ensure Positive Work Culture\n\nThere are several steps that companies and organizations can take to create and maintain a positive work culture:\n\n\ud83d\udc49 Which year are YOU targeting for success in the IAS/IPS/IFS Exam? \ud83d\ude80\n\n(1) \u21d2 UPSC 2025: Prelims cum Mains\n\n(2) \u21d2 UPSC 2026: Prelims cum Mains\n\n(3) \u21d2 UPSC 2027 Prelims cum Mains\n\nTip: Know more about ClearIAS Courses (Online/Offline)\n\nClearly communicate the company\u2019s mission and values: Employees need to understand the purpose and goals of the company in order to feel invested in their work.

Some potential implications of a negative work culture include:\n\nHigh turnover: A negative work culture can lead to low employee morale and high turnover, as employees may choose to leave the company rather than continue to work in an unhealthy or toxic environment. This can be costly for the company, as it can take time and resources to train new employees.\nPoor performance: A negative work culture can lead to low motivation and productivity, as employees may feel discouraged or demotivated in their work. This can impact the overall performance of the company.\nDecreased innovation: A negative work culture can stifle creativity and innovation, as employees may be afraid to speak up or share their ideas. This can limit the company\u2019s ability to adapt and stay competitive in a changing business environment.\nDamage to the company\u2019s reputation: A negative work culture can damage the company\u2019s reputation, both internally and externally.

Some of the main challenges include:\n\nLimited resources: Governments often have to balance the demands of providing a wide range of services with limited financial and human resources. This can make it difficult to deliver services at the level of quality that citizens expect.\nBureaucracy and red tape: Complex policies, procedures, and regulations can create delays and inefficiencies in the service delivery process.\nLack of coordination between agencies: Different government agencies and departments may have conflicting priorities or a lack of communication, which can hinder the delivery of services.\nBalancing the demands of different interest groups: Governments must often balance the demands and needs of different groups, such as different age groups, income levels, or geographic areas. This can make it difficult to meet the needs and expectations of all citizens.\nTechnological challenges: The use of technology can improve the efficiency and effectiveness of service delivery, but implementing and maintaining new technologies can also present challenges.\nPolitical considerations: Political pressures and considerations can sometimes influence the priorities and decision-making of governments, which can impact the delivery of services.\n\nOvercoming these challenges is essential for governments to deliver high-quality services to their citizens and maintain trust and satisfaction.\n\nMeasures to Improve Quality of Service Delivery\n\nThere are a number of measures that governments can take to improve the quality of service delivery. Some strategies include:\n\nEstablish clear goals and performance standards: Defining clear goals and performance standards can help ensure that services are delivered consistently and effectively.\nInvolve citizens in the service delivery process: Engaging citizens in the service delivery process can help ensure that services meet the needs and expectations of those they are intended to serve.\nUse performance data to drive continuous improvement: Regularly collecting and analyzing performance data can help identify areas for improvement and inform efforts to continuously improve service delivery.\nInvest in training and professional development: Providing ongoing training and professional development can help ensure that government employees have the necessary skills and expertise to deliver high-quality services.\nSimplify policies and procedures: Streamlining policies and procedures can help reduce bureaucracy and improve the efficiency of service delivery.\nUse technology to improve efficiency: The use of technology can improve the efficiency and effectiveness of service delivery, but it is important to ensure that the technology used is reliable and user-friendly.\nFoster collaboration and coordination between agencies: Encouraging collaboration and coordination between different government agencies and departments can help improve the delivery of services.\nFoster a culture of customer service: Creating a culture of customer service within government agencies can help ensure that employees are focused on meeting the needs and expectations of citizens.\nExamples\n\nThe following are the measures to improve the quality of service delivery\n\nJandhan Aadhar mobile (JAM trinity)\n\nJandhan-Aadhar-Mobile (JAM) is an initiative in India that aims to bring financial inclusion to the country\u2019s citizens.\n\nIt involves the use of the Jandhan (meaning \u201cbank in hand\u201d) account, the Aadhar (a unique identification number issued by the government of India) and mobile technology.\n\nThe Jandhan account is a basic bank account that can be opened with minimal documentation and is linked to the individual\u2019s Aadhar number.\n\nThe use of mobile technology allows for easy access to these accounts, including the ability to transfer funds, pay bills, and access government benefits.\n\nThe goal of JAM is to increase financial inclusion by making it easier for individuals, particularly those in rural areas or who are otherwise disadvantaged, to access financial services and participate in the formal economy.\n\nCitizens Charter\n\nA citizen\u2019s charter is a document that outlines the rights and responsibilities of citizens in relation to a particular service or organization.\n\nIt is intended to provide transparency and accountability in the service delivery process and to make it clear to citizens what they can expect from the service or organization in terms of quality, timeliness, and responsiveness.\n\nE-Governance\n\nE-governance is the use of electronic communication and information technologies to provide government services, exchange information, and communicate with citizens. It aims to make government processes more efficient, transparent, and accessible to citizens.\n\nE-governance initiatives can include online portals and platforms for accessing government services and information, mobile apps, and the use of social media and other digital communication channels to interact with citizens.\n\nE-governance can also involve the digitization of government records and processes, such as the use of electronic voting systems or the implementation of electronic tax filing systems.\n\nThe use of e-governance can help improve the efficiency and effectiveness of government operations, as well as make it easier for citizens to access government services and information. It can also help increase transparency and accountability in government processes.\n\nHowever, it is important for governments to ensure that e-governance initiatives are designed and implemented in a way that is inclusive and takes into account the needs and capabilities of all citizens, including those who may not have access to technology or digital literacy skills.\n\nBiometric-enabled Ration Card Security System\n\nA biometric-enabled ration card security system is a system that uses biometric data, such as fingerprints or iris scans, to verify the identity of individuals when they access government-subsidized food rations.\n\nThe goal of such a system is to improve the security and accuracy of the ration distribution process, as well as to reduce fraud and corruption.\n\nIn a biometric-enabled ration card security system, individuals would have their biometric data registered when they apply for a ration card. When they go to a distribution center to receive their rations, they would have their biometric data scanned to verify their identity.\n\nThis would ensure that only the intended recipient is able to access the rations and that there is a record of who received the rations.\n\nBiometric-enabled ration card security systems can help improve the efficiency and effectiveness of the ration distribution process, as well as increase transparency and accountability.\n\nHowever, it is important to ensure that the system is implemented in a way that is respectful of individuals\u2019 privacy and that takes into account any potential barriers to access, such as technical issues or the need for specialized training.\n\nConclusion\n\nIn conclusion, the delivery of high-quality services is essential for the success of any government. Ensuring that services are delivered efficiently and effectively, and that they meet the needs and expectations of citizens, is crucial for building and maintaining trust, satisfaction, and loyalty among the public.\n\nWhile there are a number of challenges that governments face in delivering quality services, there are also a number of strategies and best practices that can help improve service delivery.\n\nThese include establishing clear goals and performance standards, involving citizens in the service delivery process, using performance data to drive continuous improvement, investing in training and professional development, simplifying policies and procedures, using technology to improve efficiency, fostering collaboration and coordination between agencies, and fostering a culture of customer service.\n\nBy adopting these strategies and continually seeking ways to improve and innovate their service delivery, governments can ensure that they are meeting the needs of their citizens and building a stronger, more responsive, and effective public sector.\n\nArticle written by : Vivek Rajasekharan"

Misuse of public funds can also include making extravagantly pointless purchases that don\u2019t meet the organization\u2019s commercial or operational needs.\n\nThe term \u201cmisuse of public assets\u201d refers to the improper or unlawful use of government property as well as the failure to protect those assets.\n\nAlso read: Budget 2023\n\nGovernment Accounts\n\nThe government\u2019s accounts are categorized into three parts:\n\nConsolidated Fund of India\nContingency Fund of India\nPublic Account\nConsolidated Fund of India\n\nOf all the government accounts, the Consolidated Fund of India is the most important account. The Consolidated Fund includes all of the government\u2019s receipts and expenditures, excluding exceptional items.\n\nAs per Article 266 (1) of the Indian Constitution, this fund was established. The Consolidated Fund of India holds all of the government\u2019s direct and indirect tax earnings, borrowing costs, and receipts from loans given by the government.\n\nAll government expenses are borne out of this fund, except for extraordinary items, which are paid for from the Contingency Fund or the Public Account. Notably, no funds may be withdrawn from this fund without the consent of the Parliament.\n\nContingency Fund of India\n\nThe contingency Fund of India is constituted under Article 267(1) of the Indian Constitution.\n\nThe Contingency Fund of India shall be held by a Secretary to the Government of India in the Ministry of Finance on behalf of the President.\n\nThe advances out of the Contingency Fund of India shall be made to meet the unforeseen expenditure.\n\nThe Central Government makes rules regulating all matters connected with or ancillary to the custody of, the payment of money into, and the withdrawal of money from, the Contingency Fund of India.\n\nPublic Account\n\nThe Public Account of India fund was constituted under Article 266 (2) of the Constitution.\n\nIt accounts for flows for those transactions where the government is only serving as a banker.\n\nThese include small savings, provident funds, deposits and advances, remittances, and so on. The government does not own these funds.\n\nThey eventually need to be returned to their rightful owners. As a result of the fund\u2019s distinctive feature, Parliamentary approval is not necessary for expenditures made from it.\n\nReasons for Ineffective Utilization of Public Funds\n\nVarious social, political, and administrative factors lead to the misutilization or underutilization of public funds.\n\nFreebies for political benefits: For power and position in politics, voters were lured by various irrational freebie\u2019s promises. This ineffective misutilization of public funds put pressure on the government\u2019s account. It also discourages the party in power to spend wisely for the benefit of all.\n\nLimited Power of CAG: Comptroller and Auditor General of India are considered the guardian\u00a0of the public purse that controls the entire financial system of the country at both the levels\u2013the Centre and the state but the CAG can audit the account after the expenditure is done. So, CAG cannot make sure that the fund is used wisely or not.\n\nNepotism in Politics: The heirs of political parties get prominent places in governance without experience, leading to ineffectiveness in government.\n\nRivalry in Politics: Differences between the ruling party and the opposition party erode the cooperation and collective efforts required, making running the welfare programs even more difficult.\n\nIlliteracy and Lesser Public Participation: People are not well aware of their rights because of illiteracy. Their ignorance about the policies and schemes of the government holds them back from asking about the financial liabilities of the government.\n\nFault in Bureaucracy: Sometimes misuse of power vested upon them acts as a hindrance in carrying out developmental activities.\n\nMisuse of Power: For their personal gain, the person in power usually misused their position like MPs investing granted MPLAD funds in private trusts or using it for their own goods. In 2012, the Comptroller and Auditor General (CAG) revealed that between 1993 to 2006, the then-governing body had allocated 216 coal blocks illegally to public and private enterprises, which stated the misuse of a massive amount of public funds.\n\nConclusion\n\nThough the government is working for the welfare of the people but there are several factors and loopholes responsible for the ineffective drain of funds. To effectively use public funds requires several measures for good governance, including decentralization of power, addressing legal loopholes, strengthening public institutions like CVC and RTI, improving administrative accountability, and fostering a more democratic society.\n\nThe shift towards good governance and digitalization has helped in curbing the menace of corruption and the use of loopholes but still, it\u2019s a long way to go that can better be achieved with the help of people\u2019s participation, increasing moral responsibilities in agencies and bureaucracy, focussing on implementing procedure and output of schemes and bringing transparency in procedures.\n\nArticle Written By: Priti Raj"

            "[CONTENT]": "What do you mean by corruption? What are its associated challenges? Read further to know more.\n\nCorruption is defined as the abuse of entrusted power for private gain. There are several challenges and impacts associated with corruption.\n\nIndia ranked 85th out of 180 countries (score 40) in Corruption Perceptions Index (CPI) 2021, released by Transparency International, which measures the corruption level of a country\u2019s public sector.\n\nTable of Contents\n\nWhy Corruption is Unhealthy?\nCauses of Corruption\nImpacts of Corruption\nHampering Sustainable Development Goals\nInefficiency and Economic Loss\nRigged Political System\nPoverty\nViolation of Human Rights\nDysfunctioning of Public and Private Sector\nPartial Justice\nOrganized Crime and Terrorism\nFailure in Infrastructure\nDamage to Climate and Biodiversity\nMeasures to Combat Corruption\nWhy Corruption is Unhealthy?\n\nCorruption destroys morale, undermines democracy, represses economic growth, and makes inequality, poverty, social division, and the environmental problem worse.\n\nCauses of Corruption\n\nBefore learning about the challenges and impacts of corruption, let\u2019s understand what are the causes of corruption. According to a survey conducted in 2017, the following factors have been attributed as causes of corruption:\n\nHigher levels of bureaucracy and inefficiency in administrative structures\nWeak property rights\nLow levels of education\nLack of commitment to society\nExtravagant family\nLow press freedom\nLow economic freedom\nLarge ethnic divisions and high levels of\u00a0in-group favoritism\nThe greed of money, and desires.\nHigher levels of market and political monopolization\nLow levels of democracy\nWeak civil participation\nLow political transparency\nGender inequality\nContagion from corrupt neighboring countries\nPoverty\nPolitical instability\nUnemployment\nLack of proper policies against corruption\nImpacts of Corruption\n\nCorruption has a wide-ranging impact on organizations, individuals, and communities as well.\n\nHampering Sustainable Development Goals\n\nThe achievement of the Sustainable Development Goals of the United Nations is hampered by corruption. The SDGs are comprehensive, therefore it is not surprising that corruption might undermine them.\n\n\ud83d\udc49 Which year are YOU targeting for success in the IAS/IPS/IFS Exam? \ud83d\ude80\n\n(1) \u21d2 UPSC 2025: Prelims cum Mains\n\n(2) \u21d2 UPSC 2026: Prelims cum Mains\n\n(3) \u21d2 UPSC 2027 Prelims cum Mains\n\nTip: Know more about ClearIAS Courses (Online/Offline)\n\nCountries that lack the capacity to govern effectively are unable to end poverty, eradicate hunger, provide their population with high-quality healthcare and education, ensure gender equality and other human rights, lower inequality, and other goals.\n\nTo be more precise,\u00a0 Goal 16 of the SDGs which is \u201cPromote peaceful and inclusive societies for sustainable development, provide access to justice for all, and build effective, accountable, and inclusive institutions at all levels,\u201d, which is highly relevant, is difficult to achieve if corruption in public services persists.\n\nIn addition, resolutions passed by the Conference of the States Parties to UNCAC have consistently stressed the connection between corruption and sustainable development. Therefore, if the global community is serious about achieving the SDGs, it must recognize corruption as a barrier to their achievement and strengthen its anti-corruption measures.\n\nInefficiency and Economic Loss\n\nAlthough it is challenging to find precise figures for the economic consequences of corruption, International Monetary Fund (IMF) research from 2016 indicated that the cost of bribery alone varies from $1.5 to $2 trillion annually.\n\nThis amounts to an overall economic loss of about 2% of the world\u2019s GDP.\n\nHowever, it does not account for the financial costs associated with all other types of corruption. In developing nations, corruption may contribute to underdevelopment.\n\nAccording to a report published by Transparency International, \u201cThe Impact of Corruption on Growth and Inequality\u201d, At the macro level, research generally shows that corruption has a detrimental, direct effect on economic development and growth.\n\nAdditionally, corruption has an indirect impact on a country\u2019s economic performance by influencing a number of variables that spur economic growth, including investment, taxation, public spending level, composition, and effectiveness.\n\nRigged Political System\n\nCitizens who uphold high moral standards lose representation, influence, and power.\n\nPoverty\n\nThe World Bank\u00a0 (2019) estimates that more than 50% of people in the oil-rich country live in extreme poverty. This illustration demonstrates how wealth redistribution occurs when corrupt players use the political and economic systems to their advantage.\n\nCorruption makes it possible for party officials, bureaucrats, and contractors to use funds allocated for elections, health care, education, and poverty assistance as a means of personal gain. As a result, social programs, and political systems\u2019 potential for redistribution degrade.\n\nViolation of Human Rights\n\nThe Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights (OHCHR) of the United Nations has recently attracted attention to important connections between corruption and human rights violations.\n\nCorruption itself reduces the capacity of the State to address violations of civil and political rights and to enact the necessary safeguards, including socioeconomic rights, which frequently call for complex government initiatives.\n\nDysfunctioning of Public and Private Sector\n\nDysfunction is the result of several corrupt actions added together. The quality of products and services declines, whether they are provided by the public or private sectors, and accessing them becomes more expensive, time-consuming, and unfair.\n\nInstead of promoting innovation and efficiency, state-owned organizations and sectors are designed to benefit government officials. In organizations, this may result in the loss of intrinsic motivation. \u00a0People start to question the worth of effort and innovation.\n\nPartial Justice\n\nPeople can no longer trust judges and prosecutors to do their jobs when corruption penetrates the legal system.\n\nCitizens may be falsely accused of crimes, denied due process, and wrongfully imprisoned, especially those who lack finances or strong allies.\n\nOrganized Crime and Terrorism\n\nBecause money can be laundered, funding can be hidden, and judges and politicians can be bribed, nefarious parts of society can flourish. As levels of intimidation rise, so do levels of violence, illicit drug use, prostitution, and sexual slavery.\n\nIn addition to being the result of corruption, organized crime can also be brought about by corrupt opportunities created by a weak, ignorant, or inefficient government.\n\nFailure in Infrastructure\n\nIt is a well-known fact that the Mafia uses the construction sector as a means of money laundering and a major source of earnings.\n\nBuildings that are fundamentally hazardous are present everywhere throughout the country as a result of obvious violations of land-use and permission restrictions, purportedly accomplished by bribery, favoritism, and influence-peddling.\n\nDamage to Climate and Biodiversity\n\nFunding and measures to combat climate change are hampered by corruption, which is a challenge that undermines programs to conserve forests and manage them sustainably. It also encourages wildlife-related crimes.\n\nMeasures to Combat Corruption\n\nThe government of India is committed to \u201cZero Tolerance Against Corruption\u201d and has taken several measures to combat the challenges associated with corruption which include:\n\nSystemic reforms to provide transparency in citizen-friendly services to reduce corruption. That includes:\n\nThe direct and transparent distribution of welfare benefits to citizens under various government programs through the Direct Benefit Transfer project.\nE-tendering is in public procurement.\nIntroduction of e-Government and simplification of processes and systems\nIntroduction of the Government e-Marketplace (GeM) for government procurement.\nDiscontinuation of interviews in the recruitment of Group \u2018B\u2019 (Non-Gazetted) and Group \u2018C\u2019 posts in the Government Departments.\nThe Central Civil Services (Classification, Control, and Appeal) Rules and the All India Services (Disciplinary and Appeal) Rules have both been revised to provide precise timelines for disciplinary processes.\nThe Prevention of Corruption Act, 1988 has been amended to clearly criminalizes the act of giving bribe.\nThrough a number of decrees and circulars, the Central Vigilance Commission (CVC) encouraged all organizations involved in significant procurement activities to establish an Integrity Pact in order to ensure an effective and prompt inquiry whenever any irregularity or misconduct is identified.\nUnder the 1988 Prevention of Corruption Act, Lokpal is legally required to receive and handle complaints about alleged offenses against public employees.\nTo ensure that people have access to relevant info, the Ministry of Personnel, Public Grievances and Pensions has implemented a number of steps. These, among others, comprise:\nThe Right to Information (RTI) Act was passed in 2005 to establish a practical framework for the right to information, allowing citizens to secure access to data that is under the control of public authorities.\n\nRead:\u00a0Corruption in Civil Services\n\nArticle Written By: Priti Raj"

He raises the following points:-\n\n(i) In the present times, when an unethical environment is quite prevalent, individual attempts to stick to ethical principles may cause a lot of problems in one\u2019s career. It may cause hardship to the family members as well as risk to one\u2019s life. Why should we not be pragmatic follow the path of least resistance, and be happy with doing whatever good we can?\n\n(ii) When so many people are adopting wrong means and are grossly harming the system, what difference would it make if only a small minority tries to be ethical? They are going to be rather ineffective and are bound to get frustrated.\n\n(iii) If we become fussy about ethical considerations, will it not hamper the economic progress of our country? After all, in the present age of high competition, we cannot afford to be left behind in the race for development\n\n(iv) Understandably, we should not get involved in grossly unethical practices, but giving and accepting small gratifications and doing small favours increases everybody\u2019s motivation.\n\nIt also makes the system more efficient.

The magnitude of the disaster is always unanticipated. During one of the seasons, a cloudburst caused devastating floods and landslides leading to high casualties. There was major damage to infrastructure like roads, bridges and power-generating units. This led to more than 100000 pilgrims, tourists and other locals trapped across different routes and locations. The people trapped in your area of responsibility include senior citizens, patients in hospitals, women and children, hikers, tourists, ruling parties, regional presidents along with their families, additional chief secretaries of the neighbouring state and prisoners in jail.\n\nAs a civil services officer of the state, what would be the order in which you would rescue these people and why?

(UPSC CSE 2015)\n\nCase Study: Problem Solving (Policy Making)\n\nLand needed for mining, dams and other large-scale projects is acquired mostly from Adivasis, hill dwellers and rural communities. The displaced persons are paid monetary compensation as per the legal provisions. However, the payment is often tardy. In any case, it cannot sustain the displaced families for long. These people do not possess marketable skills to engage in some other accusation. They end up as low-paid migrant labourers. Moreover, their development goes to industries, industrialists and urban communities whereas the costs are passed on to these poor helpless people. This unjust distribution of costs and benefits is unethical. Suppose you have been entrusted with the task of drafting a better compensation-cum-rehabilitation policy for such displaced persons, how would you approach the problem and what would be the main elements of your suggested policy?

Together with some other like-minded friends, she formed an NGO to build a school for a poor rural community. The objective of the school was to provide the best quality modern education at a nominal cost. She soon discovered that she had to seek permission from several Government agencies. The rules and procedures were quite confusing and cumbersome. What frustrated her most was delays, the callous attitude of officials and the constant demand for bribes. Her experience and the experience of many others like her have deterred people from taking up social service projects. A measure of Government control over voluntary social work is necessary.
