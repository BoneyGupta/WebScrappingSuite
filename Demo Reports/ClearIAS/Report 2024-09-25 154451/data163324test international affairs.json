With US President Donald Trump imposing a lot of taxes on imports, and China hitting back with similar measures, there is every possibility that world will witness a new war \u2013 a trade war \u2013 in the coming months.\n\nTable of Contents\n\nWhat is a trade war?\nWhat are trade barriers?\nWhat is a Tariff?\nTrump Tariffs\nTrade War Escalation \u2013 between US and China\nWhat can World Trade Organisation (WTO) do?\nTrade War \u2013 Who will be the winner?\nWhat happened in previous trade wars?\nWho wins in trade wars?\nSummary\nReference:\nWhat is a trade war?\n\nA trade war is an economic conflict in which countries impose import restrictions on each other in order to harm each other\u2019s trade.\n\nIn a trade war, two or more counties create trade barriers on each other in retaliation for other trade barriers.\n\nWhat are trade barriers?\n\nTrade barriers are what governments use to hinder or control free trade (mainly imports from another country).\n\nThere are two types of trade barriers.\n\nTariff barriers \u2013 Eg: Import tariff, Export tariff, Specific duty, Ad valorem duty,\u00a0Countervailing duty,\u00a0 Anti-dumping duty, Protective tariff etc.\nNon-Tariff barriers \u2013 Eg:\u00a0quotas, embargoes, sanctions, levies and other restrictions.\nWhat is a Tariff?\n\nIn simplest terms, a tariff is a tax.\n\nA\u00a0tariff\u00a0is a tax on imports or exports.\n\n\ud83d\udc49 Which year are YOU targeting for success in the IAS/IPS/IFS Exam? \ud83d\ude80\n\n(1) \u21d2 UPSC 2025: Prelims cum Mains\n\n(2) \u21d2 UPSC 2026: Prelims cum Mains\n\n(3) \u21d2 UPSC 2027 Prelims cum Mains\n\nTip: Know more about ClearIAS Courses (Online/Offline)\n\nMoney collected under a tariff is called a\u00a0duty\u00a0or customs duty. Tariffs are used by governments to protect domestic industries from competition.\n\nIt adds to the cost of imported goods.\n\nTrump Tariffs\n\nThe Trump tariffs are a series of tariffs imposed during the presidency of Donald Trump. In January 2018, Trump imposed tariffs on solar panels and washing machines, and in March 2018, he imposed tariffs on steel and aluminium.\n\nThe case the White House is making is that the tariffs necessary to protect vulnerable American industries.\n\nPresident Donald Trump had said that the US which has nearly USD 800 billion deficit with other countries is ready for a trade war with them if they retaliated against his decision to impose 25 per cent import tariff on steel and 10 percent on aluminium.\n\nTrade War Escalation \u2013 between US and China\n\nOn March 7, US President Donald Trump announced 25% tariffs on imports of steel and aluminium from China.\n\nChina responded by saying it would impose duties on $3bn worth of US products, announcing tariffs of up to 25% on imports of food including frozen pork, wine and some fruits on April 1.\n\nWhat can World Trade Organisation (WTO) do?\n\nThe arbiter of international trade disputes \u2013 WTO \u2013 was born in 1995 out of a set of agreements struck by countries trying to reduce trade barriers.\n\nIf a government\u2019s complaint about another nation\u2019s trade barriers is seen as grounded, the WTO recommends acceptable retaliation.\n\nIn the case of steel, Trump is invoking a seldom-used clause of a 1962 U.S. law that gives him the authority to curb imports if they undermine national security.\n\nUnder WTO rules,\u00a0countries can take trade actions to protect \u201cessential security interests.\u201d\n\nOther nations could challenge the validity of the U.S. use of that clause. They also could copy the U.S. move by citing national security to block imports themselves.\n\nTrade War \u2013 Who will be the winner?\n\nStockmarkets across the world have\u00a0fallen anticipating a full-blown trade war between the United States and\u00a0China.\n\nThe tariffs measures were poorly received by the vast majority of economists; almost 80% of 104 economists surveyed by Reuters believed that imports on tariffs on steel and aluminum imports would be a net harm to the U.S. economy, with the rest believing that the tariffs would have little or no effect; none of the economists surveyed believed that the tariffs would benefit the U.S. economy.\n\nOn the other hand, the trade war can badly affect China too.\u00a0If China\u2019s exports suffer from President Trump\u2019s upcoming trade actions, and any copycat barriers elsewhere, domestic consumption hardly looks robust enough to carry growth.\n\nShould a trade war escalate between the US and China, consultancy Wood Mackenzie estimates that global economic growth could slow from 2.9% to 2.2% over the next four years.\n\nThe small, open economies in the eastern part of the European Union will suffer disproportionately if the global trade war currently brewing extends to Europe, analysts have warned.\n\n\u201cJonathan Butcher, Wood Mackenzie principal economist, in a March 28 note, says, \u201cThat risk of retaliation and escalation is itself a threat to the global economy. We are currently enjoying a period of robust global growth, but sentiment plays a big part in maintaining economic momentum. The threat of a trade war could dampen sentiment, slowing consumer spending and business investment. If a trade war does develop\u2026 There are no winners in such a situation.\u201d\n\nWhat happened in previous trade wars?\n\nOne of the most notorious examples is the\u00a0Smoot-Hawley Act\u00a0passed by Congress in 1930 and\u00a0often blamed for deepening the Great Depression. The act raised import tariffs on some 20,000 goods provoking retaliatory tariffs by major US trading partners, leading to a severe trade war, the contraction of world trade, and exacerbation of the Great Depression.\n\nWho wins in trade wars?\n\nNo one, if history is any guide.\u00a0When President George W. Bush raised steel tariffs in 2002, U.S. gross domestic product declined by $30.4 million,\u00a0according to\u00a0the U.S. International Trade Commission. The U.S. lost about\u00a0200,000 jobs, about 13,000 of which were in raw steel-making, by one estimate.\n\nSummary\n\nTrump\u2019s trade war will hurt everyone \u2014 the only question is how much.\u00a0Everybody, all economies, will be adversely affected.\n\nA trade war between the world\u2019s major economies would lead to a significant contraction of world trade. In turn, this could result in a deep recession in the world economy, which would, no doubt, exacerbate the \u00adalready tense geopolitical strains.\n\nReference:\nWikipedia\nInvestopedia\nBloomberg\nBusiness Insider\nEPW"

Read further to learn more.\n\nIn today\u2019s world, there are mainly three ongoing conflicts that possess the capacity to escalate into a nuclear conflict. These are Israel-Palestine, India-Pakistan, and the Korean conflict.\n\nOf these three, the most unpredictable and volatile is the Korean conflict; attributed to the megalomaniacal character of the North Korean ruler.\n\nIn this article, we will cover all the aspects of the Korean Conflict that you must know.\n\nTable of Contents\n\nModern Korea \u2013 History from Genesis to the conflict\nThe Korean Conflict\nSeeds of the Conflict: By USSR and USA\nEscalation of the conflict \u2013 The Korean Wars\nThe Weapon Race by North Korea\nKorean Conflict: Recent Troubles\n\u2018North Korea vs South Korea\u2019 now \u2018North Korea vs USA\u2019: What Makes Things Worse?\nPossible Solution to the Korean Conflict\nConclusion: Don\u2019t neglect the China factor\nModern Korea \u2013 History from Genesis to the conflict\nThe present-day political conflicts in Korea have strong roots in its history \u2013 the earlier Chinese and Japanese influence and the later USSR and USA influence.\nThe Joseon Dynasty ruled most of the Korean peninsula from 1392-1897 (for more than 5 centuries).\nJoseon was the last dynasty of Korea and its longest-ruling\u00a0neo-Confucian\u00a0dynasty.\nThe philosophy of neo-Confucian professed by the Joseons is the strongest linking factor of the Korean peninsula.\nChina had considerable influence on the Joseon Dynasty. It was a vassal of the Qing dynasty of China. It even led to a period where Korea was open to trade only with China. This explains the historical link between China and Korea.\nIn 1895, the Treaty of Shimonoseki was signed between Japan and China after the former defeated China in the\u00a0Sino-Japanese War (1894-95).\nAs a result of the treaty, Joseon was removed from China\u2019s vassalage.\nIn 1897, the Joseon was renamed as KOREAN EMPIRE.\nFrom 1897-1905 Korea witnessed a strong autocratic rule under Emperor Gojong. He embarked on a journey to strengthen the military and market structure of Korea. He was helped by Russia, which had much influence on Korea during the period.\nThe Russo-Japanese War (1905) ended Russia\u2019s influence and with the 1905 Protectorate Treaty, Korea became a Japanese protectorate.\n1905-1910 was a period of political turbulence in Korea. It ended with the 1910 annexation of Korea by Japan.\n1910- 1945, Korea was effectively under the rule of the Japanese. It was after the fall of Japan in World War II that the seeds of the Korean conflict were sown.\nThe Korean Conflict\n\nThe present-day Korean conflict is born primarily from the seeds sown during the Cold War \u2013 between the USSR and the USA. You may note here that after the defeat of Japan \u2013 which was the earlier controlling force of Korea \u2013 the superpowers were the USSR and the USA.\n\nThe Korean conflict can be divided into three main phases:\n\n\ud83d\udc49 Which year are YOU targeting for success in the IAS/IPS/IFS Exam? \ud83d\ude80\n\n(1) \u21d2 UPSC 2025: Prelims cum Mains\n\n(2) \u21d2 UPSC 2026: Prelims cum Mains\n\n(3) \u21d2 UPSC 2027 Prelims cum Mains\n\nTip: Know more about ClearIAS Courses (Online/Offline)\n\n1. Korean War (1950-1953):\n\nThe Korean War was a major armed conflict that began on June 25, 1950, when North Korean forces, supported by the Soviet Union and China, invaded South Korea. The conflict quickly escalated into a full-scale war.\nThe United Nations, with the United States taking a leading role, intervened to support South Korea. This marked one of the early instances of UN involvement in a military conflict.\nThe war resulted in significant loss of life and destruction, and it ended in an armistice agreement on July 27, 1953, but not a formal peace treaty. The Korean Peninsula remained divided along the 38th parallel, and the Korean Demilitarized Zone (DMZ) was established.\nThe Korean War had lasting consequences, as it solidified the division of Korea into North and South, each with its government and ideology. It also contributed to the Cold War tensions between the United States and the Soviet Union.\n\n2. Post-Korean War Tensions (1953-1980s):\n\nAfter the armistice, North and South Korea continued to exist as separate and ideologically opposed states.\nThe two Koreas remained in a state of hostilities, with sporadic border incidents and clashes.\nNorth Korea developed a socialist system under the leadership of the Kim dynasty, while South Korea transitioned to democracy and experienced significant economic growth.\n\n3. Contemporary Tensions (1990s-Present):\n\nTensions have persisted between North and South Korea, with occasional flare-ups and crises. Notable incidents include naval clashes, the bombing of South Korean facilities, and missile tests by North Korea.\nEfforts have been made to ease tensions and promote dialogue between the two Koreas and the international community. Inter-Korean summits have taken place in recent years, including meetings between North Korean leader Kim Jong-un and South Korean President Moon Jae-in.\nThe international community, including the United States, China, and Russia, has been involved in diplomatic efforts aimed at denuclearization and peace on the Korean Peninsula.\nSeeds of the Conflict: By USSR and USA\n\nThe Allied forces of the Second World War at the Yalta Conference (1945), agreed to establish a \u201cfour-power trusteeship over Korea\u201d.\nBefore a concrete plan could be formulated, the USSR invaded Korea and within a week Japan surrendered. This led to a condition where the north of Korea was under the USSR and the south under the rest of the allies, mainly the USA (the two regions are divided by the 38th parallel).\nIn December 1945 at the Moscow Conference, a joint Soviet-American commission was established to work on the Trusteeship issue of Korea.\nThe fear of the spread of communism and the mutual distrust between the USSR and the USA led to the failure of the trusteeship plan.\nThe advent of the cold-war the end to the hope of a united Korea.\nIn 1948 the United Nations proposed free elections across all of Korea. USSR rejected this plan. However, an election took place in the American protectorate resulting in the establishment of the Republic of Korea (South Korea).\nThe next month the northern part was declared as the Democratic People\u2019s Republic of Korea (North Korea).\nBoth halves tried to enhance their reach, territorially and ideologically, which gave birth to the Korean Conflict.\nEscalation of the conflict \u2013 The Korean Wars\nIn 1950, North Korea, supplied by the USSR, launched an attack on South Korea occupying most of the country.\nAs a response to the attack, in September (1950) the United Nations forces led by the US retaliated with brutal force and changed the dynamics of the war.\nThe 1950-51 period was the most turbulent one.\nThe US forces led by Douglas MacArthur wished to use the opportunity to capture the north and hence crossed the 38th parallel. However, their aggression led to the entry of China to support North Korea.\nSensing the escalation of the crisis, the US president removed Douglas MacArthur in 1951, and peace talks began in 1951.\nMid 1951 to 1953 saw a period of relative calm despite acts of hostilities from both sides.\n\nAfter the death of Stalin, in 1953, USSR brokered an armistice agreement. It led to:\n\nAn official ceasefire without a Peace treaty. So, in a sense, the war never ended.\nExchange of Prisoners of War (PoWs).\nEstablishment of Korean Demilitarized Zone (DMZ)\u00a0\u2013 2.5 miles wide and approximately 150-mile long areas with no military presence. Its surrounding makes the most fortified border in the world.\nThe Weapon Race by North Korea\nUnder Kim Jong Il (the second leader of North Korea and father of present leader Kim Jong-un) North Korea accelerated its nuclear program and supposedly developed nuclear capabilities (probably with the help of China).\nIt withdrew from the Non-Proliferation Treaty (NPT) in 2003. (North Korea is not a member of the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty (CTBT) either)\nThereafter it tested nuclear explosives in 2006, 2009, 2013, and 2016. Also, it has demonstrated Uranium enrichment capability and possesses weapon-grade Plutonium.\nFor denuclearizing the Korean Peninsula, the Six-Party Talks between North Korea, South Korea, Japan, China, Russia, and the United States began in 2003. However, these have in suspended since 2009.\nThere are suspicions that it possesses a large chemical weapon arsenal. (North Korea is not a member of the Chemical Weapon Convention (CWC))\nIn December 2015, Kim Jong Un also claimed to have thermonuclear capabilities (the veracity of the claim is, however, a matter of debate).\nKorean Conflict: Recent Troubles\n\nIn 2016 North Korea conducted two nuclear tests (its fourth and fifth tests). In addition, it successfully launched medium and long-range missiles.\nDespite global condemnation and warnings, it continued its ventures and in March 2017, launched four Ballistic Missiles.\nPortraying an offensive stance, the US started deploying THAAD (Terminal High Altitude Area Defence) in South Korea in March 2017. (Note: For information on India\u2019s Ballistic missile defense system click here)\nUnfazed by the threats, on 4th July 2017 (Independence Day of USA) North Korea claimed to have successfully launched an Inter-Continental Ballistic Missile (ICBM), capable of reaching even Alaska, USA.\n\u2018North Korea vs South Korea\u2019 now \u2018North Korea vs USA\u2019: What Makes Things Worse?\n\nMegalomaniac attitude of Kim Jong Un, who in the past has demonstrated acts of utter cruelty to satisfy his ego.\nThe USA under Donald Trump is fickle in foreign policy where there seems to be knee-jerk-based diplomacy rather than realpolitik.\u00a0 His action in Afghanistan (dropping of GBU-43) shows his willingness to go to great extents to satisfy his motives.\nChina which serves as a lifeline to North Korea hasn\u2019t shown concerted efforts to solve the issue. This resulted in a blame game started by the US president, which has further made getting China\u2019s support a tough task.\nDespite President of South Korea Moon Jae-in\u2019s call for talks, the North Korean leader hasn\u2019t shown much interest. The possibility of talks between the original parties is nearly over.\nThe conflict which involved territorial issues between North and South Korea has transformed into a tussle between the USA and North Korea. The launch of an ICBM by North Korea on 4th July 2017 proves the point. It reduces the possibility of a local solution and if not resolved in time, it could lead to a full-blown nuclear war.\nPossible Solution to the Korean Conflict\n\nWar is not a solution, it\u2019s a progenitor of conflicts. Only destruction of a party involved can bring peace after war, that too depends on the whims of the victorious. Therefore, we won\u2019t consider war as a possible solution. Thus the available options are:\n\nBreaking the Economic lifeline of North Korea with the support of China:\nIt is hard to achieve, especially when China considers North Korea as a strategic asset to engage the USA without confronting the US directly.\nAlso, if cornered, there is a possibility that Kim Jong Un may take the nuclear path as a desperate measure.\nA cyber-attack to paralyze the missile and nuclear weapon system of North Korea. Like Stuxnet did to Iran:\nCyber-attacks are best to measure to delay or disrupt but fail on a long-term basis.\nNorth Korea has maintained a closed network and it\u2019s very hard to judge how much damage cyber-attack can do. A mediocre success by cyber-attack would only make North Korea\u2019s preparedness more robust.\nConciliation based on the initiative of South Korea:\nThis seems the best option available. To start, we can resume the Six-party Meet that has remained in suspension since 2009. Also, the US needs to take a bigger step and remove THAAD so that such talks can begin again.\nConclusion: Don\u2019t neglect the China factor\n\n\u00a0\n\nIn his book \u201cArt of War\u201d, Sun Tzu calls for war where there should be a diversion of the enemy\u2019s strength without directly indulging with the opponent. North Korea is the point of diversion of strength, the US the opponent, and China the strategist. The continued support of North Korea by China, directly as well as clandestinely vindicates this policy.\n\nAny solution to the Korean Conflict would be either short-lived or highly destructive if China doesn\u2019t support it. The Korean crisis is the litmus test of realpolitik and the use of force only shows a lack of wits. In an ideal world, we could call for a concerted effort by all to bring peace. But pragmatism calls for the wait and watch, as for now, peace is not beneficial for the one capable of bringing peace.\n\nArticle by: Alok Singh"

In fact, at the end of World War II, no claimant occupied a single island in the entire South China Sea.\nChina laid claim to the South China Sea in 1947. It demarcated its claims with a U-shaped line made up of eleven dashes on a map, covering most of the area.\nBut two \u201cdashes\u201d were removed in the early 1950s to bypass the Gulf of Tonkin as a gesture to communist comrades in North Vietnam.\nThe remaining \u2018nine-dash line\u2019 stretches hundreds of kilometers south and east of its southerly Hainan Island, covering almost 90% of the South China Sea.\nAfter the 1960s when a huge reserve of oil and natural gas was discovered in the region, the territorial claims started growing in an unprecedented manner.\nThe United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea (UNCLOS), which came into force in 1994, established a legal framework intended to balance the economic and security interests of coastal states with those of seafaring nations.\nWhile UNCLOS has been signed and ratified by nearly all the coastal countries in the South China Sea, based on their own interpretation of the UNCLOS, claimant countries started to legitimize their claims.\nIn 2002, ASEAN and China came together to sign the Declaration on the Code of Conduct of Parties in the South China Sea to keep disputes away. However, it didn\u2019t achieve the desired outcomes.\nIn 2009, Malaysia and Vietnam sent a joint submission to the Commission on the Limits of the Continental Shelf (CLCS) to set out some of their claims. In response to this China submitted a map containing the infamous \u201cnine-dash\u201d line and due to this, there was no headway in the dispute resolution.\nPCA-Ruling and implications\nBoth the Philippines and China laid their claims the Scarborough Shoal which is a little more than 100 miles from the Philippines and 500 miles from China. The Philippines and China are both dependent upon fishing in the South China Sea, specifically in the Scarborough Shoal, for the economic development and livelihood of their people. A tense but bloodless stand-off between China and the Philippines over Scarborough Shoal in 2012, led to China gaining de facto control over the region.\nBut in 2013, the Philippines raised the dispute with China to the PCA(Permanent Court Of Arbitration), saying China\u2019s claims violated Philippines\u2019 sovereignty under the 1982 U.N. Convention on the Law of the Sea(UNCLOS).\nThe Permanent Court of Arbitration ruled that\u00a0Chinese claims over 90 percent of the South China Sea area are illegitimate and under UNCLOS, China is intruding into the Philippines\u2019 sovereign waters as the 9-dash line which includes the Scarborough shoal and crosses into the Philippines EEZ.\nChina out rightly rejected the ruling. China prefers bilateral negotiations with the other parties. But many of its neighbors argue that China\u2019s relative size and clout give it an unfair advantage.\nASEAN and South China Sea\n\nOne of the fundamental principles of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) has been to resolve regional disputes by peaceful means. But over the years, the position of ASEAN on the South China Sea disputes has weakened its image internationally and failing to resolve this issue would lead to questions being raised about its credibility as an effective regional organization.\n\nThe US and the South China Sea\nThe U.S. has no claim in the South China Sea, but has been highly critical of China\u2019s assertiveness and insisted on free navigation of commercial vessels in the South China Sea is vital for regional and international trade.\nIt conducted joint military patrols with the Philippines and Japan, Australia, and Indonesia.\nUS also increased the financial support for enhancing the military capabilities of ASEAN and East Asian countries as well strengthened bilateral defense collaboration with these countries.\nIndia and the South China Sea\n\nIndia remained acutely conscious of its official position of neither being party to the disputes nor taking sides for many years. But with increasing ties with East Asian countries (Act East Policy), India indirectly started raising concerns about Chinese illegitimate claims in the South China Sea. India believes that the disputes in the Southeast Asian littorals are a litmus test for the international maritime law.\nIn the aftermath of the Hague Tribunal\u2019s verdict on the South China Sea, India obligated to take a principled stand on the issue of freedom of navigation and commercial access enshrined in the UNCLOS.\nDespite China\u2019s protests, India continues its oil exploration in Vietnam\u2019s exclusive economic zone(EEZ) in the South China Sea from where ONGC Videsh Limited supplies oil to Vietnam.\nIndia also supports a negotiated settlement of Brunei\u2019s maritime dispute with China and has inked defense cooperation agreement that would provide an institutional foundation for more collaborative work on maritime security and secure India\u2019s energy lanes to Brunei.\nSummary\n\nThe South China Sea have been witnessing a lot of unfortunate conflicts in terms of economic interests, civilian security, and the environment in the recent past. \u00a0The illegal construction of artificial islands\u00a0and nuclear power plants\u00a0on these fragile islands in the region raises severe environmental threats to the South China Sea.\n\nThe South China Sea situation will only be settled when the bordering countries change their mindsets from one of sovereignty and sole ownership of resources to one of functional cooperation and cooperative management. India\u2019s rising clout in the region due to enhanced economic cooperation would go a long way in resolving the disputes.\n\nArticle contributed by: Sree Resmi S"

Instead, they are chosen by \u201celectors\u201d through a process called the \u201cElectoral College\u201d.\n\nThe election process of US President can be consolidated into five steps \u2013\u00a0Step 1: Primaries and Caucuses,\u00a0Step 2: National Conventions,\u00a0Step 3: Election Campaigning, Step 4: General Election, and\u00a0Step 5: Electoral College.\n\nStep 1: Primaries and Caucuses (Party level elections in States)\n\nThere may be many people who want to be the president of the United States of America. Each of these people may have their own ideas about how the US government should work. People with similar ideas usually align behind the same political party. But they need to win the favour of their party members first.\n\nCandidates from each political party campaign throughout the country to win the favour of their party members.\n\nPrimaries and caucuses are methods that political parties use to select candidates for a general election.\nPrimary: A primary is a state-level election where party members vote for the best candidate that will represent them in the general election. Party candidates selected in a primary then run against each other in a general election. 34\u00a0U.S. states conduct primary elections.\nThere are several types of primaries in the U.S. system like\u00a0Closed primary, Semi-closed primary, Open primary and Semi-open primary.\nCaucus: A caucus is a local meeting where registered members of a political party in a city, town or county gather to vote for their preferred party candidate and conduct other party business.\u00a0A caucus is a substitute for a primary election to select delegates to the national party convention. 16\u00a0states hold caucuses to determine political party candidates.\nStep 2: National Conventions of Each Party\n\nOnce the primaries and caucuses are completed in each state, a national convention is held in which a party\u2019s nomination for president is formally announced to the public. During the convention, the elected delegates cast their vote for a party candidate and the candidate with the most delegates gets the party\u2019s nomination. The end of the convention marks the beginning of the general election process.\n\nEach party holds a national convention to finalize the selection of one presidential nominee. At each convention, the presidential candidate chooses a running-mate (vice-presidential candidate).\n\nStep 3: General Election Campaigning\n\nGeneral election campaigning begins after a single nominee is chosen from each political party, via primaries, caucuses, and national conventions.\n\nThese candidates travel the country, explaining their views and plans to the general population and trying to win the support of potential voters. Rallies, debates, and advertising are a big part of general election campaigning.\n\nStep 4: General Election (Popular Vote)\n\nUsually in November.\nMany modern voters might be surprised to learn that when they step into a ballot box to select their candidate for president, they actually are casting a vote for fellow Americans called electors.\nPeople in every state across the country vote for one president and one vice president. When people cast their vote, they are actually voting for a group of people known as electors.\nThe voters of each state, and the District of Columbia, vote for electors to be the authorized constitutional members in a presidential election. These voters form the electoral college.\nAn elector is a member of the electoral college.\u00a0These electors, appointed by the states, are pledged to support the presidential candidate the voters have supported.\nEven though the majority of people of the USA vote for a candidate, that does not mean that he/she will win the Presidential election. There are instances where a candidate who won the popular vote lost the election.\nTo win the election, a candidate needs to secure more than 270 electoral votes.\nStep 5: Electoral College (Electors vote for the US President)\n\nUsually in December.\nThe US the president is elected by the institution called the Electoral College.\nThe Constitution only states that the candidate who receives a majority of votes in the Electoral College becomes president. It says nothing about the popular vote.\nThe intent of the framers was to filter public opinion through a body composed of wiser, more experienced people; the framers did not want the president to be chosen directly by the people.\nEach state gets a certain number of electors. This is based on each state\u2019s total representation in Congress.\nEach of the 50 US states and the capital Washington DC (a district which does not belong to any state) have a set number of electors which reflects their size. California is the most populated (over 38 million people) and has 55 electoral votes \u2013 more than any other. On the other hand, a state such as Montana, which is geographically large but has a relatively small population (just over one million people) \u2013 only has three electors.\nAside from Maine and Nebraska, if a candidate gets the most votes within a state they receive that state\u2019s full quota of electoral college votes.\nEach elector casts one electoral vote following the general election.\nThere are a total of 538 electoral votes.\nThe candidate that gets more than half (270) wins the election.\nWhat happened in the 2016 elections?\n\nIn 2016, Donald J. Trump won the Electoral College with 304 votes compared to 227 votes for Hillary Clinton. However, seven electors voted for someone other than their party\u2019s candidate.\n\nEven though it doesn\u2019t matter, it was Hillary Clinton who won the popular vote in 2016.\n\nHow did Trump become the US president despite losing the popular vote in 2016?\n\nThough uncommon, it is possible to win the Electoral College, but lose the popular vote. That means that a candidate can win a combination of states and reach the 270 electors mark without winning the majority of votes across the country.\n\nThis has happened five times in American elections \u2013 most recently in 2000 and 2016.\n\nPopular Vote vs Electoral Vote: Understand the difference\n\nUS President and US Vice President\n\nWhy does the U.S. have an Electoral College?\n\nThe short answer is the framers of the Constitution didn\u2019t trust direct democracy and provided an extra layer to ensure, as James Madison put it, that \u201cfactions\u201d of citizens with a common interest don\u2019t harm the nation as a whole. However, the Electoral College has become a mere formality.\n\nThe Constitution doesn\u2019t require electors to vote according to the popular vote of the people they represent. But it\u2019s rare for an elector not to follow the people\u2019s and their party\u2019s choice.\u00a0Although the actual vote of the Electoral College takes place in each state between mid-November and mid-December, in most cases, a projected winner can be announced on election night.\n\nWhat Happens if No Candidate Gets 270 Electoral Votes?\n\nIn the rare event that no candidate gets the needed 270 electoral votes, the decision would go to the House of Representatives, who would vote to elect the new President from among the top three candidates. A similar process would take place in the Senate to elect the Vice President from among the top two candidates. The only time this has happened was during the 1824 election when John Quincy Adams received the most votes in the House of Representatives after no candidate won a majority of the Electoral College.\n\nAlso read:\u00a0United States Federal Government shut down.\n\nUS Presidential Election Disputes and Supreme Court\n\nIn 2000, for the first time in 112 years, the eventual winner of the election, Republican George W. Bush (47.87% of voters), failed to win the popular vote lagging behind the Democratic nominee Al Gore who won over 48.38 % of voters (edging out Bush nationwide by about 550,000 votes).\n\nThe outcome of that election came down to Florida, which at the time had 25 electoral college votes and gave Bush a narrow electoral college win with 271 electors over Gore\u2019s 266.\n\nHowever, the contest was so close in the sunshine state that a mandatory recount was triggered. And with legal challenges being launched in several Florida counties the case was eventually decided by the Supreme court who handed the state, and therefore the Presidency, to Bush with a ruling 5-4 in favour of the Republican on December 12 of that year.\n\nOk. Elections are over. What\u2019s next?\n\nThe president-elect and vice president-elect take the oath of office and are inaugurated in January.\n\nThe Election Process of US President: Infographic\n\nGo through the below infographic to know the steps in the election process of US President.\n\nConclusion\n\nUS President and Vice President are not directly elected by voters.\n\nIt is the \u2018electors\u2019 from each state who elect the US President and Vice President.\n\nThe Electoral College consists of 538 electoral votes (from 50 states and District of Columbia).\n\nThe elections results are largely influenced by the voter behaviour in large swing states.\n\nTo win the election the candidate needs to secure 270 electoral votes."

The aims of Paris Agreement is as below:\n\nKeep the global temperature rise this century well below 2 degrees Celsius above the pre-industrial level.\nPursue efforts to limit the temperature increase even further to 1.5 degrees Celsius.\nStrengthen the ability of countries to deal with the impacts of climate change.\n\nIt may seem a small change in temperature but this can mean a big difference for the Earth!\n\nParis Agreement: Things to note\nIn French, the Paris\u00a0Agreement\u00a0is known as L\u2019accord de Paris.\nThe key vision\u00a0of Paris Agreement is to keep global temperatures \u201cwell below\u201d 2.0C (3.6F) above pre-industrial times and \u201cendeavour to limit\u201d them even more, to 1.5C.\nParis Accord talks about limiting\u00a0the amount of greenhouse gases emitted by human activity to the same levels that trees, soil and oceans can absorb naturally, beginning at some point between 2050 and 2100.\nIt also mentions the need to\u00a0review each country\u2019s contribution to cutting emissions every five years so they scale up to the challenge.\nRich countries should help poorer nations by providing \u201cclimate finance\u201d to adapt to climate change and switch to renewable energy.\nThe Paris Agreement has a \u2018bottom up\u2019 structure in contrast to most international environmental law treaties which are \u2018top down.\nThe agreement is\u00a0binding in some elements like reporting requirements, while leaving other aspects of the deal such as the setting of emissions targets for any individual country as non-binding.\nNote: You can download the Paris Agreement from this link.\nIs this the first international agreement to combat climate change due to global warming?\n\nNo. In fact, Paris Agreement comes under the broad umbrella of United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC). UNFCCC is a convention held in 1992 to combat climate change. Kyoto Protocol (1997) was another major international commitment under UNFCCC.\n\n\ud83d\udc49 Which year are YOU targeting for success in the IAS/IPS/IFS Exam? \ud83d\ude80\n\n(1) \u21d2 UPSC 2025: Prelims cum Mains\n\n(2) \u21d2 UPSC 2026: Prelims cum Mains\n\n(3) \u21d2 UPSC 2027 Prelims cum Mains\n\nTip: Know more about ClearIAS Courses (Online/Offline)\n\nParis Agreement (2015) vs\u00a0Kyoto Protocol (1997)\nParis Agreement is\u00a0the world\u2019s first comprehensive climate agreement. Although developed and developing countries were parties to Kyoto Protocol,\u00a0developing countries were not mandated to reduce their emissions.\nThis means that while Paris Agreement is legally binding to all parties, Kyoto Protocol was not.\nParis Agreement was reached on\u00a0the twenty-first session of the Conference of the Parties (COP) and the eleventh session of the Conference of the Parties serving as the meeting of the Parties to the Kyoto Protocol (CMP).\n\nNationally Determined Contributions (NDC)\nThe national pledges by countries to cut emissions are voluntary.\nThe Paris Agreement requires all Parties to put forward their best efforts through \u201cnationally determined contributions\u201d (NDCs) and to strengthen these efforts in the years ahead.\nThis includes requirements that all Parties report regularly on their emissions and on their implementation efforts.\nIn 2018, Parties will take stock of the collective efforts in relation to progress towards the goal set in the Paris Agreement.\nThere will also be a global stock take every 5 years to assess the collective progress towards achieving the purpose of the Agreement and to inform further individual actions by Parties.\nIndia\u2019s Intended Nationally Determined Contribution (INDC)\n\nIndia\u2019s INDC include a reduction in the emissions intensity of its GDP by 33 to 35 per cent by 2030 from 2005 level.\nIndia has also pledged to create an additional carbon sink of 2.5 to 3 billion tonnes of CO2 equivalent through additional forest and tree cover by 2030.\nIndia will\u00a0anchor a global solar alliance, INSPA (International Agency for Solar Policy & Application), of all countries located in between Tropic of Cancer and Tropic of Capricorn.\nFrameworks\u00a0under Paris Agreement\nTechnology Framework\nCapacity Building Framework\nTransparency Framework\nWhy is Paris Agreement important?\nCurrent commitments on greenhouse gas emissions (Kyoto Protocol) will expire in 2020. Paris Agreement deals with what should be done in the decade after 2020 and beyond this time frame.\nThe text of the agreement includes a provision requiring developed countries to send $100 billion annually to their developing counterparts beginning in 2020. That figure will be a \u201cfloor\u201d that is expected to increase with time.\nThe Paris Agreement has a \u2018bottom up\u2019 structure in contrast to most international environmental law treaties which are \u2018top down.\nFor the first time, the accord lays out a longer-term plan for reaching a peak in greenhouse emissions \u201cas soon as possible\u201d and achieving a balance between the output of man-made greenhouse gasses and absorption \u2013 by forests or the oceans \u2013 \u201cby the second half of this century\u201d.\nWhen will Paris Agreement come into force?\nThirty days after the date on which at least 55 Parties to the Convention accounting in total for at least an estimated 55 % of the total global greenhouse gas emissions have deposited their instruments of ratification, acceptance, approval or accession with the Depositary.\nOn 5 October 2016, the threshold for entry into force of the Paris Agreement was achieved.\nThe Paris Agreement will enter into force on 4 November 2016.\nCriticisms about Paris Agreement\nAccording to a study published in Nature on June 2016, current country pledges are too low to lead to a temperature rise below the Paris Agreement temperature limit of \u201cwell below 2 \u00b0C\u201d.\nEven a UNFCCC report had observed that even if all the pledges made by 197 countries that are signatory to the Paris pact were fulfilled, it would be insufficient to meet the conservative goal of keeping global temperature rise within the 2 degree Celsius threshold.\nMost of the agreement consists of \u201cpromises\u201d or aims and not firm commitments.\nThe starting point of $100bn per year remains under 8% of worldwide declared military spending each year.\nSince the only mechanism remains voluntary national caps on emissions, without even any guidance on how stringent those caps would need to be, it is hard to be optimistic that these goals are likely to be achieved.\nThere is only a \u201cname and shame\u201d system or\u00a0a \u201cname and encourage\u201d plan and\u00a0the \u2018contributions\u2019 themselves are not binding as a matter of international law.\nSummary\nThe Paris Agreement is an agreement within the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC).\nCountries will aim to keep global temperatures from rising more than 2\u00b0C (3.6\u00b0F) by 2100 with an ideal target of keeping temperature rise below 1.5\u00b0C (2.7\u00b0F).\nParis is only the beginning of a shift towards a low-carbon world, and there is much more to do.\nREFERENCE:\nUNFCCC.\nIndia\u2019s INDC \u2013 PIB.\nBBC\nTime.\nWikipedia."

India attaining full membership in the Shanghai Co-operation Organisation (SCO), PM Modi\u2019s historic visit to the five Central Asian countries, etc. stand testimony to this.\nINSTC, or International North-South Transport Corridor, receives special mention in India-Central Asia relations.\nWhat is INSTC?\n\nThe International North\u2013South Transport Corridor (INSTC) is a multi-modal connectivity project that establishes transport networks (ship, rail, and road route) for moving freight between India, Russia, Iran, Europe, and Central Asia.\n\nThe INSTC is designed to provide an alternative and shorter trade route between South Asia and Northern Europe. It connects the Indian Ocean and the Persian Gulf to the Caspian Sea and further extends to Northern and Western Europe.\nIt is not a new concept. This ancient route was used by European, Indian, and many other foreign traders to reach out to the Central Asian markets.\nDuring the time of the Safavid dynasty, it is estimated that around 10,000 Indian traders were spread across the empire. (Safavids were one of the most significant ruling dynasties of Persia (modern Iran) from 1501 to 1736.)\nThe current INSTC project was initiated by Russia, India, and Iran in September 2000 in St. Petersburg.\nThe modern-day INSTC is a multi-modal transportation route linking the Indian Ocean and Persian Gulf to the Caspian Sea via Iran, and then onwards to northern Europe via St. Petersburg in Russia.\nThe route primarily involves moving freight from India, Iran, Azerbaijan, and Russia via ship, rail, and road. The objective of the corridor is to increase trade connectivity between major cities such as Mumbai, Moscow, Tehran, Baku, Bandar Abbas, Astrakhan, Bandar Anzali etc.\nMembers of the project:\n\nAs noted earlier, the founding members are Russia, India and Iran. But since the signing of the agreement in 2002, the progress on the route has been slow.\n\nBut on January 18, 2012, a meeting in New Delhi discussed the various modalities to take the project forward. As a follow-up, support from other Central Asian nations was sought, and now the group has been expanded.\n\nThe current members are India, Iran, Russia, Azerbaijan, Kazakhstan, Armenia, Belarus, Tajikistan, Kyrgyzstan, Oman, Syria, Turkey, Ukraine, and Bulgaria (observer).\n\nTurkmenistan currently is not a formal member but is likely to have road connectivity to the corridor, after being formally invited by PM Modi.\n\nAzerbaijan and Armenia are heavily involved in the project with both countries currently building new train lines and roads to complete the missing links in the NSTC.\n\nThe INSTC Route\n\n\u00a0\n\nMumbai is at the southern hub of the route.\nThe route extends to Bandar Abbas in Iran via sea. Bandar Abbas is a sprawling port city on the southern coast of Iran, on the Persian Gulf. It occupies a strategic position on the narrow Strait of Hormuz.\nFrom Bandar Abbas to Bandar-e-Anzali by road on the Iranian mainland. Bandar-e-Anzali is another Iranian port but on the Caspian Sea side.\nFrom Bandar-e-Anzali to Astrakhan by ship across the Caspian Sea. Astrakhan is a Caspian port in the Russian Federation. The city lies on the two banks of the Volga River.\nFrom Astrakhan to other regions of the Russian Federation, and further into Europe by Russian Railways.\nAdditional Routes\n\nAzerbaijan route: The NSTC route through Azerbaijan allows India-Iran-Azerbaijan-Russia-Kazakhstan transport connectivity. Iran started construction work to complete the missing link of the Qazvin-Rasht-Astara railway\nChabahar NSTC Integration: India and Iran have a long-standing agreement, signed in 2002, to develop Chabahar port into a full deep sea port. Bandar Abbas port handles 85% of Iran\u2019s seaborne trade and is highly congested. Whereas, Chabahar has high capacity with plans to expand it from its current capacity of 2.5 million to 12.5 million tons annually. Unlike Bandar Abbas, Chabahar can handle cargo ships bigger than 100,000 tons. Industry Analysts have highlighted there are long-term plans to integrate Chabahar with the NSTC.\nThe Kazakhstan \u2013 Turkmenistan \u2013 Iran railway link: also known as North\u2013South Transnational Corridor, is a 677 km long railway line connecting Kazakhstan and Turkmenistan with Iran and the Persian Gulf.\nSouthern Armenia-Iran Railway Corridor: As the key missing link in the International North\u2013South Transport Corridor, the Southern Armenia Railway would create the shortest transportation route from the ports of the Black Sea to the ports of the Persian Gulf.\nTrans-Iranian canal: The idea of linking the Persian Gulf and the Caspian Sea by canal was developed in the late 19th century. In 2016 Russia Today reported that the Russian and Iranian governments were discussing the project.\nObjectives of the North-South Transport Corridor\n\nAs per the agreement of 2002, the main objectives of this route are:\n\nincreasing effectiveness of transport ties to organize goods and passenger transport along the International \u2018North\u2013South\u2019 transport corridor;\nthe promotion of access to the international market through rail, road, sea, river, and air transport of the State Parties to this agreement; and\nproviding security of travel and safety of goods\nharmonization of transport policies as well as law and legislative basis in the field of transport to implement this Agreement.\nAdvantages of the route\n\nAnalysts predict by having improved transport connectivity between Russia, Central Asia, Iran, and India, their respective bilateral trade volumes will increase. The Foreign Trade Policy of India, 2015-20, has highlighted the importance of the International North-South Transport Corridor (INSTC) in expanding India\u2019s trade and investment links with Central Asia.\nThe successful activation of the corridor will help connect India to Russia within 16-21 days at competitive freight rates leading to the development of trade on the INSTC. At present, we have to either use the Rotterdam port or land route via China to reach Russia and Central Asia. These are long, expensive, and time-consuming.\nIt is also expected to eliminate the usage of reefer containers for agro commodities and further support the supplies to Russia.\nA study conducted by the Federation of Freight Forwarders\u2019 Associations in India found the route is, \u201c30% cheaper and 40% shorter than the current traditional route\u201d.\nFor India, we can have access to the lucrative markets of Central Asia, by-passing the transit through Pakistan. Indian exports could potentially get a competitive advantage due to lower costs and less delivery time.\nThe INSTC has particular economic and strategic relevance to India given the increasing regional ambitions of China through its One Belt, One Road Initiative. The proposed INSTC trade corridor could help India secure its interests in Central Asia and beyond.\nThe potential of this route is manifold if India can bring on board its South East Asian neighbors too. The Suez Canal route takes 45-60 days, whereas the INSTC would take 25-30 days. Turkey has offered to provide the necessary information for linking the Black Sea Economic Cooperation (BSEC) with INSTC.\nConstraints\n\nThe successful implementation of the INSTC faces challenges such as geopolitical issues, infrastructure development, customs procedures, and political cooperation among participating countries.\n\nINSTC still doesn\u2019t have a strong institutional mechanism to deal with the operational issues on the ground.\nProblems related to customs procedures and documentation remain.\nIssues relating to the funding of the infrastructure needed.\nLow level of existing containerization on the route.\nLack of common border crossing rules among the participating nations.\nHigher tariff by rail vis-\u00e0-vis road transport relating to movement from Bandar Abbas.\nWagon shortages.\nSecurity problems emanating from Islamic insurgents east, and west of the route, and the associated hurdle of high insurance costs.\nCurrent Status\n\nTo understand the problem areas and to realize the full potential of the corridor, the dry run was conducted on the Nhava Sheva\u2013Bandar Abbas (Iran)\u2013Baku (Azerbaijan) and the Nhava Sheva\u2013Bandar Abbas\u2013Amirabad (Iran)\u2013Astrakhan (Russia) route via the Caspian Sea in August 2014 by the Federation of Freight Forwarders Associations in India (FAI).\n\nThe dry run report points out that \u201cthe proposed INSTC route via Bandar Abbas in Iran to Russia and CIS Destination in transit through Iran, could be the best route with optimal transit/cost for the Indian exporters/importers\u201d.\n\nThe Ukraine war has prompted Russia to refocus attention on the INSTC. The Iranian government has also renewed its commitment to it.\n\nThe 2021 blockage of the Suez Canal has further served to highlight the INSTC as a necessary if not better alternative to the Canal.\n\nConclusion\n\nINSTC is an ideal start to project India as a big global player. Even though the investment is well worth it with its economic, political, and geo-strategic benefits, it is testing India\u2019s financial backbone. India can do well to rope in other interested parties for partnering in the project, like Japan which also sees Central Asia as a lucrative market for its products.\n\nRead:\u00a0Global south\n\nArticle by: Jishnu J Raju"

It possesses the world\u2019s largest foreign exchange reserves and has more than 30 companies in the FT 500 list of the world\u2019s largest companies.\n\n\u2018The Chinese Rise\u2019 and \u2018The Chinese Century\u2019 are phrases commonly used by media these days. Is China buying the world? In this post, we bring a brief review of the current global banking scenario.\n\nTable of Contents\n\nChina\u2019s increasing clout in Global financial institutions\nAsian Infrastructure Investment\u00a0Bank, AIIB:\nEuropean Bank for Reconstruction and Development, EBRD:\nNew Development Bank, NDB:\nAfrican Development Bank:\nInter-American Development Bank:\nInternational Finance Corporation (under World Bank):\nSilk Road fund:\nSCO Development Bank:\nReasons for the current investment spree in China:\nDomestic Banking in China\nConclusion:\nChina\u2019s increasing clout in Global financial institutions\n\nThe post world war-II global financial scene has been dominated by the World Bank and International Monetary Fund, together known as the Bretton Wood twins. But of late, the world as a whole and Eurasia, in particular, has played host to the overtures of China, especially in the financial scene. Let\u2019s us look into some of the institutions created or revamped under the watchful eyes of The Dragon.\n\nAsian Infrastructure Investment\u00a0Bank, AIIB:\nNow 97 approved members.\nHeadquartered in Beijing.\nAimed to fund the infrastructure needs of the countries in Asia. ADB notes an $800 billion infrastructure funding gap in the region.\nThe capital of the bank is $100 billion.\nChina has veto power in decision making.\nIndia, Russia also members.\nDespite objections from the US, European countries like Britain, France, Germany and US\u2019 allies like Australia and South Korea have decided to participate in it.\nEuropean Bank for Reconstruction and Development, EBRD:\nEBRD was created to reinforce the unipolar global world order post-1991 USSR collapse.\nThe main area of its focus is Eastern Europe, which integrated and continues to get integrated (as recent Ukraine coup points) to the western institutional hub.\nThe focus area now ranges from Central Europe to Central Asia.\nThe biggest shareholder is the United States.\nHeadquarters: London.\nFounded in 1991. Owned by 65 countries and two EU institutions.\nEBRD recently approved China\u2019s application to join it.\nSuma Chakrabarti is the present president of the bank.\nNew Development Bank, NDB:\nNDB is the outcome of the Fortaleza declaration of the BRICS countries.\nTreaty in force in July 2015.\nHeadquartered in Shanghai, China.\nThe authorized capital of $100 billion, with an initial subscribed capital of $50 billion, equally contributed by the 5 members (Brazil, Russia, India, China, South Africa). New members can join but the share of BRICS nations can never be less than 55%.\nAll 5 countries have the same voting rights.\nKV Kamath is the president of the bank.\n\nAlso read: Global Financial Innovation Network (GFIN)\n\nAfrican Development Bank:\nFormed in 1964.\nHeadquartered at Abidjan, Ivory Coast.\nIt was formed in the post-colonial period, along with the African Union.\nChina recently agreed to fund the African Development Bank with $2 billion as part of Africa Growing Together Fund.\nInter-American Development Bank:\nEstablished in 1959.\nHeadquartered at New York.\nIt is the largest source of development financing in Latin America and the Caribbean for economic and social development and regional integration.\nThe US has 30% shares in the $70 billion capital of the bank. Combined with European members, it can veto the decisions of the bank.\nChina became the 48th member of this bank, contributing $350 million to finance development projects in the region.\nInternational Finance Corporation (under World Bank):\nIt is a member of the World Bank group.\nIt was established in 1956.\nHeadquartered at Washington DC.\nIt mainly offers investment, advisory and asset management services to encourage private sector development in the developing countries.\nChina is increasingly using the IFC route to channel its foreign exchange reserves.\nSilk Road fund:\nIt is a state-owned investment fund of the Chinese govt. to foster increased investment in countries along with the One Road-One Belt initiative.\nIt was founded in 2014, headquartered in Beijing.\nChina has pledged $40 billion for the creation of this investment fund.\nSCO Development Bank:\nA new bank was proposed under the auspices of the Shanghai Corporation Organisation, SCO.\n\nAlso read: International Financial Services Centres Authority (IFSCA)\n\nReasons for the current investment spree in China:\nThe slow pace of reforms of the Bretton Woods institutions: The United States of America literally holds a veto in the decision-making of these bodies and also in appointments of the institution heads. As such, the IMF and World Bank choose to remain as the vestiges of the old unipolar world order, and not adapt to the changing tunes of the time. Developing countries like China and India are largely disappointed with this status-quo mentality and choose to tread a new path.\nChina runs a current account surplus economy and has beefed up foreign exchange reserves to the tune of around $3 trillion (though it is coming down at a brisk pace, of late). President Xi is looking for possible greenfield areas to make the foreign exchange more productive. The One Road-One Belt initiative and the setting up of the new development banks are part of this larger aim.\nChina is shifting from an export-led investment model to a domestic consumption-led investment model. To aid its erstwhile export-led model, it needed to keep the Chinese currency, Renminbi, always depreciated and thus boost its exports by competitive pricing of its products. This was achieved by investing in American treasury bonds (and thus appreciating dollars & keeping Renminbi value high). Now, when the development priority is shifting to a domestic consumption-led model, it no longer needs to continue investing in American bonds, which is low-interest yielding and can be put to better use by funding investment elsewhere.\nChina\u2019s Peaceful-Growth Theory: India has always accused China of a policy of encircling, the String of Pearls Theory. Funding peaceful development projects using these investment banks can help China to nullify this posturing of India and increase its soft power credentials in the immediate neighbourhood, thus attacking the US\u2019 Pivot to Asia strategy as well.\nAs noted earlier, China is shifting to the domestic consumption-led economic growth pattern. As such, China is planning to deploy elsewhere the productive capacity garnered over the past decades, which had fuelled the export-led growth model. This is evident from Chinese companies aggressively bidding for projects in Sri Lanka (Colombo port), Pakistan (Gwadar port), Maldives (GMR airport), Africa (Djibouti port) etc. Bids are won by providing soft loans directly from sovereign funds of China set up under different names.\nThe global financial crisis of 2008 significantly shook up the credibility of the established financial ecosystem centred on the IMF and World Bank. The intervention of these two had minimal implications on the global economic scenario and the world has still not escaped from the aftermath of the recession. The crisis also undermined the credibility of G7, and developing countries started looking for fresh leadership, which China was ready to provide.\nAbove all, there is a massive gap in the demand and supply of infrastructure investment funds. Existing institutions including World Bank and Asian Development Banks are not able to meet this increasing gap, which China aims to fill.\nDomestic Banking in China\n\nIf banks in the world are arranged on the basis of their assets (loans-given), Chinese banks will grab 4 out of the first 5 positions.\u00a0\u00a0The largest bank in the world continues to be Beijing-based Industrial & Commercial Bank of China Ltd., with more than $3.5 trillion in assets portfolio.\u00a0All four banks in the top five \u2013 ICBC, China Construction Bank, Agricultural Bank of China, and Bank of China \u2013 are state-owned. These banks are the engine of credit driving the Chinese economy, generating more than three-quarters of its total financing.\u00a0Don\u2019t buy the argument that this is yet more proof of China\u2019s gathering economic clout. It\u2019s not.\n\n\ud83d\udc49 Which year are YOU targeting for success in the IAS/IPS/IFS Exam? \ud83d\ude80\n\n(1) \u21d2 UPSC 2025: Prelims cum Mains\n\n(2) \u21d2 UPSC 2026: Prelims cum Mains\n\n(3) \u21d2 UPSC 2027 Prelims cum Mains\n\nTip: Know more about ClearIAS Courses (Online/Offline)\n\nChinese banks are looking down the barrel of a staggering RMB 8 trillion \u2013 or $1.7 trillion \u2013 worth of losses according to the French investment bank Societe Generale. Put another way, 60 per cent of capital in China\u2019s banks is at risk as authorities start the dangerous process of reining in the debt-bloated and unprofitable state-owned enterprise (SOE) sector. There are many who believe China need a massive bailout package.\n\nAlso read: International Monetary Fund (IMF)\n\nConclusion:\n\nAs Peter Nolan had once argued, the view that China is buying the world is damaging to international relations. Chinese firms still have only a negligible presence in high-income countries. Only time can tell whether Chinese is buying the world or it is on the verge of collapse.\n\nAnd from India\u2019s perspective, the opening of the coffers of the Chinese foreign exchange is a blessing. As we are looking for more funds and investments in our flagship programs ranging from \u2018Make in India\u2019 to \u2018Start-up India\u2019, India should be open to her big brother in Asia. But as always, we need to tread with caution.\n\nArticle by: Jishnu J Raju"

It evolved over decades and reached its present model in 1992.\n\nThere are 51 countries in Europe, out of which 28 countries have signed a treaty to become a part of the European Union. So, clearly, there are countries in Europe which are not part of the European Union.\n\nThe EU treaty provided for a European Parliament and European Council which consisted of representatives of the member states.\n\nEU members account for 16 per cent of world imports and exports.\n\nIt is the largest trading bloc in the world surpassing the US.\n\nIn 2012, the EU was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize for advancing the causes of peace, reconciliation, democracy and human rights in Europe.\n\nWhat is the Euro Area?\nThe Euro Area (EA) is a subset of the EU, which is a monetary union of 19 of the 28 countries which use the common currency, Euro.\nNot all EU members use the Euro. Britain is an EU member, it is not part of the EA. It does not use the Euro and has retained its own currency, the Pound Sterling.\nWhy the \u2018Leave EU\u2019 campaign?\nThe Leave Campaign argues that Britain is losing out a big deal by staying in the EU.\nIt has to pay millions of pounds each week as a contribution to the European budget.\nThe extremely bureaucratic nature of the European parliament is hurting British exporters\nMigration from the European Union into Britain (mainly PIGS economies) is creating an imbalance in the welfare schemes of the UK government.\nBut, those who oppose the campaign say that Britain is a net gainer if She stays in the EU.\nAbout the referendum and the result\nA referendum denotes voting in which everyone (or nearly everyone) of voting age can take part, normally giving a \u2018Yes\u2019 or \u2018No\u2019 answer to a question. The side which gets more than half of all votes cast is declared a winner.\nPrime Minister David Cameron (Conservative Party) had promised to hold a referendum for Brexit if he won the 2015 general election. But, he led\u00a0the campaign for \u2018stay\u2019 vote.\nThere were\u00a0growing calls from many MPs of the Conservative Party\u00a0and the UK Independence Party (UKIP), for a new referendum. (In 1975, Britain had\u00a0voted to stay in the EU in a referendum).\nA referendum was held on\u00a0June 23, 2016, to decide whether Britain should exit or remain in the European Union.\nEligible voters: All British, Irish and Commonwealth citizens over 18 who are resident in the UK, along with UK nationals living abroad who have been on the electoral register in the UK in the past 15 years.\n51.9% of voters favoured exit of Britain from the EU.\u00a0It is the first time since the EU was founded in 1957 that a member country is leaving.\nIndia, the UK, and the European Union\n\nIndia is one of the top investors in the UK.\nThere are about 800 Indian-owned companies in the country employing roughly 110,000 people. (Eg:\u00a0Jaguar Land Rover is owned by the Tata group)\nMany of these firms made investments with the wider European market in mind.\nTogether, the UK and Europe account for over-a-quarter of the country\u2019s IT exports, worth around $30bn.\nThe UK is the third-largest source of foreign direct investment in India and India\u2019s largest G20 investor.\nIndia is the third-largest source of FDI to the UK in terms of numbers of projects. India invests more in the UK than in the rest of Europe combined, emerging as the UK\u2019s third-largest FDI investor.\nThe key sectors attracting Indian investment include healthcare, agritech,\u00a0food, and drink.\nIn November 2015, Prime Minister Modi has said, \u201dAs far as India is concerned, if there is an entry point for us to the EU, that is the UK.\u201d\nBut, the UK is only India\u2019s 12th largest trade partner, well behind other European countries such as Germany and Switzerland.\nInterestingly, the UK is also among just seven in 25 top countries with which India enjoys a trade surplus.\nNegative Impacts of the Brexit referendum on India\nIndia will have to adjust to changing world order.\nThere may be foreign fund outflow and dollar rise.\nRupee may depreciate because of the double effect of foreign fund outflow and dollar rise.\nThis may\u00a0increase petrol and diesel prices to an extent.\nThe government then may want to reduce additional excise duty imposed on fuel when it was on a downward\u00a0trajectory. This may\u00a0increase fiscal deficit unless revenue increased.\nPrices of gold, electronic goods, among others may also increase.\nSensex and Nifty may tumble in the short-run.\nThe falling value of the pound could render several existing contracts loss-making.\nThe vote is also bad news for Indian outsourcers.\nForeign funds are likely to move out if the world outside thinks that investment in India is risky.\nIndia\u2019s Forex (currently a record 363 billion dollars) may diminish, particular if the currency is stored in Euros or Pound (this comes around\u00a020% of total forex).\nBrexit will have a negative impact on the $108 billion Indian IT sector in the short term.\nMany Indian companies are listed on the London Stock Exchange and many have European headquarters in London. Brexit will take away this advantage.\nDue to fall in the value of Pound sterling, Indian\u00a0exports to the UK will suffer. Cheaper rupee will make Indian exports, including IT and ITeS, competitive. Indian import companies operating in the UK may also report a loss. Also, note that India is exporting more than what it is importing from Britain.\nPositive\u00a0Impacts of the Brexit referendum on India\nThere are many\u00a0who think a weakening British currency might be good news.\nIndia being more of an importing country than an exporting nation, the overall effect may turn out positive for India (if the dollar doesn\u2019t appreciate much against rupee).\nWith lower pound value, Indian companies may be able to acquire many hi-tech assets.\nAs investors look around the world for safe havens in these turbulent times, India stands out both in terms of stability and of growth.\nBrexit might give a boost to trade ties between India and the UK.\nBritain will now be free to discuss a bilateral trade pact with India.\nDue to the fall in the value of Pound sterling, those who import from the UK will gain. Indian export companies operating in the UK may also gain.\nMore Indian\u00a0tourists can afford to visit Britain in the coming days as the currency value has fallen.\nMore Indian\u00a0students can afford to study in Britain (for higher education) as the fees may seem cheaper.\nBritain will need a steady inflow of talented labour, and India fits the bill perfectly due to its English-speaking population.\nThe fall in the prices of commodities like crude, which will help India save a lot on its import bill (every $1 drop in crude prices leads to roughly $1 billion savings in India\u2019s oil import bill), reducing its trade and current account deficits (CAD).\nBrexit would weaken global growth and lead to a meaningful decline in commodity prices. This is only going to enhance both the relative and absolute appeal of India.\nLower commodity prices will help the macro fundamentals: be it fiscal deficit, current account deficit or inflation, which will give the government more levers to pump up the investment cycle.\nBrexit: What does it mean to Britain?\nAs per International Monetary Fund (IMF), a vote to exit the European Union in the referendum could leave Britain\u2019s economy more than 5 per cent smaller by 2019 than if it stays in the 28-nation club.\nBrexit could cause the country\u2019s economy to be between 3.8 and 7.5 per cent smaller by 2030.\nThe pound expected to fall by around 20 per cent. This would mean that exports to the UK will suffer and imports from the UK will gain. Export companies operating in the UK will gain, while import companies will lose.\nMore foreign tourists will visit Britain in the coming days as the currency value has fallen.\nMore foreign students may prefer Britain for higher education as the fees may seem cheaper.\nEU citizens in Britain and Brits living in other EU nations would have to update their immigration statuses.\nCompanies operating in both the UK and the EU would have to verify that they\u2019re compliant with two sets of laws.\nUS President Obama has warned that it could take 10 years for Britain to negotiate a new trade deal with the US.\nThe referendum results (52:48) is very close. This means a\u00a0major division of opinion in Britain which has social implications too. While the less educated and the old seems to favour the \u2018leave EU\u2019 campaign, the young and the employed are more in favour of Britain staying in the EU.\nBrexit could encourage England, Wales, Scotland, or Northern Ireland to appeal for quitting the United Kingdom.\nBrexit: What does it mean to the World?\nRemittance from the UK to countries outside in terms of Pound will fetch lesser returns compared to the past.\nExport dominated countries may be affected, whether exporting to the UK or not. If the UK is the major trading partner, the effect will be more.\nThe United States will bear the major brunt of a Brexit being the UK\u2019s biggest trading partner.\nA\u00a0direct impact on Asian economies from Brexit is unlikely in the long term because as a percentage of GDP, exports to the UK is less than 2% for most economies.\nBut businesses in some major Asian economies \u2013 like India and Japan- will be hit.\nCompanies which have set up operations in the UK to gain access to EU markets will be affected.\nBREXIT would likely allow any US Dollar strength to play out. This may cause other currencies to decline in value.\nIs India ready to handle the Brexit?\nThe finance ministry said that\u00a0the country has sufficient foreign exchange reserves to handle any impact.\nRBI Governor then, Raghuram Rajan, said the central bank will infuse whatever liquidity is needed into the Indian market to keep it \u201cwell behaved\u201d.\nSEBI and stock exchanges have beefed up their surveillance mechanism to deal with any excessive volatility.\nIf exports to the UK are costly and imports are cheaper, India can think of utilizing the import-advantage by reversing the present trade scenario.\nOnce the dust settles, India may\u00a0be seen to be a net gainer and inflows would continue to gravitate towards the Indian shores.\nLatest Updates on Brexit\n\nNegotiations with the EU officially started in June 2017, aiming to complete the withdrawal agreement by October 2018. However, that didn\u2019t happen. Having failed to get her agreement approved, May resigned as prime minister in July 2019 and was succeeded by Boris Johnson.\n\nBoris Johnson sought to replace parts of the agreement and vowed to leave the EU by the new deadline. An early general election was then held on 12 December. The Conservatives won a large majority in that election, with Johnson declaring that the UK would leave the EU in early 2020.\n\nThe Withdrawal Agreement was ratified by the UK Parliament on 23 January 2020, and by the European Parliament on 29 January, ensuring the UK leaves the EU on 31 January.\n\nUK left the EU at 11 p.m. GMT on 31 January 2020.\n\nHowever, the UK is still negotiating the future trade relationship with the EU. Britain is now going through a transition period where negotiations are open. The transition period will end on 31 December 2020.\n\nDuring the transition, the UK still remains subject to EU law and remains part of the EU customs union and single market, but is no longer part of the EU\u2019s political institutions."

It is alleged that many of these documents show how wealthy individuals \u2013 including public officials \u2013 hide their money from public scrutiny.\n\nTable of Contents\n\nPanama Papers:\u00a0What is it?\nWhat does Mossack Fonseca do?\nHow the leak was possible?\nWhat is ICIJ?\nWho are involved in the Leaked Papers?\nWhat is LRS?\nAre all people who use offshore structures crooks?\nAre some people who use offshore structures crooks?\nWhat are Tax Havens?\nWhat are Shell Companies?\nWhat is money-laundering (in a nutshell\u2026)?\nWhat is\u00a0Mossack Fonseca\u2019s take on Panama Papers?\nConclusion:\nPanama Papers:\u00a0What is it?\nIt is a set of 11.5 million documents that were leaked from a Panama-based corporate service provider Mossack Fonseca. (Note: Panama is a Central American country).\nIt is considered as the biggest leak in the history, even bigger than the WikiLeaks and the Snowden leaks.\nThe documents contain detailed information (including those of shareholders and directors, and even passport information!) about more than 2.14 lakh offshore companies listed by the agency.\nIt is alleged that the agency facilitated the rich and influential people to hide their wealth from public scrutiny, and thus evade taxation in their domestic domains.\nThe alleged perpetrators vary from current government leaders to public officials to close associates of various heads of the governments etc. The leak consists of data created between 1970s and late 2015.\nThe data primarily comprises e-mails, PDF files, photos, and excerpts of an internal Mossack Fonseca database, covering a period from the 1970s to 2016.\nThe Panama Papers leak provides data on some 214,000 companies with a folder for each shell firm that contains e-mails, contracts, transcripts, and scanned documents. The leak comprised over 4.8 million emails, 3 million database format files, 2.2 million PDFs, 1.2 million images, 320 thousand text files, and 2242 files in other formats.\n\nWhat does Mossack Fonseca do?\nMossack Fonseca is the world\u2019s fourth largest offshore law firm. It was founded by German lawyer Jurgen Mossack in 1977, and later joined by Panamanian novelist/lawyer Ramon Fonseca.\nIts Services:\nIt specializes in commercial law, trust services, investor advisory, and international business structures.\nIt also offers intellectual property protection, wealth management and maritime law services.\nMore importantly its services include incorporating companies in offshore jurisdictions such as British Virginia Islands and helping in administering such firms, for a yearly fee.\nThough it is based in Panama, it has operations and franchises worldwide, particularly in the tax havens like Switzerland, Cyprus, and British Virginia Islands (BVI) etc. It has so far acted for more than 3, 00,000 companies, including a lakh such companies in BVI alone.\nIt was also in news for Argentine money laundering controversy (K-Money); money laundering by German Commerzbank; its role in the Petrobras corruption scandal and more recently following the Panama Papers Leak.\nHow the leak was possible?\nThe documents were made available to a Munich based newspaper Suddeutsche Zeitung, from early 2015 through encrypted channels, from an anonymous source who was using the pseudonym John Doe.\nIt is said that the whistle blower didn\u2019t seek nothing but undisclosed security cover as compensation, as (s)he believed the company was involved in unethical business.\nThe cache of information sized around 2.6 terabytes, and Suddeutsche Zeitung sought the help of the US based International Consortium of Investigative Journalists (ICIJ). The consortium helped in distributing the documents for parallel investigation and analysis to around 107 media centres in 80-odd countries.\nWhat is ICIJ?\nIn 1997 International Consortium of Investigative Journalists, was launched by Center for Public Integrity, CPI (an American not-for-profit investigative journalism organisation. It won the Pulitzer Prize in 2014).\nIt is based in Washington and includes around 165 investigative journalists from over 65 countries.\nTheir main area of investigations include cross-border crime, corruption, accountability of the power etc.\nCPI\u2019s previous reports include those on\n\u201cWho\u2019s behind the financial Meltdown\u201d 2009,\nThe Climate Change Lobby Explosion, 2009;\nTobacco Underground, 2010;\nSecrecy for Sale: offshore accounts, 2013 to present.\nWho are involved in the Leaked Papers?\nAs per the disclosed papers, there are at least 12 national leaders among the 143 politicians or their family members or close associates, managing offshore firms, besides other famous personalities around the globe.\nSome of the more famous names are:\nRussian President Vladimir Putin\u2019s Best Friend, one Sergei Roldugin, is at the centre of a scheme in which money from Russian state banks is hidden offshore.\nNawaz Sharif, the Pakistan Prime Minister\u2019s family (3 of his 4 children).\nAyad Allawi, ex-interim Prime Minister of Iraq.\nPetro Poroshenko, the in-famous President of Ukraine. He had set up a secret off-shore company in British Virginia Islands. He didn\u2019t disclose any information about the firm, while serving as the President, and hence violates the country\u2019s constitution, says anti-corruption group Transparency International.\nTwo cousins of the Syrian President Bashar al-Assad.\nSaudi King Salman Bin Abdulaziz Bin Abdulrahman al Saud held an \u2018unspecific role\u2019, in a Luxembourg based company.\nAla Mubarak, son of Egypt\u2019s former President Hosni Mubarak.\nSigmundur David Gunnlaugsson, Prime Minster of Iceland. He was elected after the 2008 banking collapse in Iceland and had pledged to clean up corruption in the banking system. Following the leak, he announced his resignation on April 5, even while vehemently opposing any wrong-doing.\nBrother-in-law of Chinese President Xi Jinping.\nAn offshore investment fund was run by British Prime Minister David Cameroon\u2019s father.\nLionel Andres Messi, the football club Barcelona (FCB)\u2019s forward and 5-time Ballon d\u2019Or winner. His family has been accused of tax evasion.\nScandal also touches a key member of FIFA\u2019s Ethics Committee, Juan Pedro Damiani, banks like HSBC etc.\nIndians involved: the Indian newspaper represented in ICIJ consortium is The Indian Express. The Indian names (so far) revealed by the newspaper include:\nAiswarya Rai: was director/share-holder of a now dissolved company based in British Virginia Islands.\nAmitabh Bachchan: was director of one shipping firm in BVI and three in Bahamas.\nSameer Gehlaut, India bulls owner.\nKP Singh, DLF Promoter.\nVinod Adani.\nTwo politicians Shishir Bajoria from West Bengal and Anurag Kejriwal of Delhi.\n\nNote: The newspaper states that while RBI let individuals buy shares under LRS (Liberalised Remittance Scheme), it never allowed them to set up companies abroad, having clarified it through an FAQ mid-way in September 2010.\n\nWhat is LRS?\nThe legal framework for administration of foreign exchange transactions in India is provided by the Foreign Exchange Management Act, 1999.\nUnder the Liberalised Remittance Scheme, all resident individuals, including minors, are allowed to freely remit up to USD 2,50,000 per financial year (April \u2013 March) for any permissible current or capital account transaction or a combination of both.\nThere are no restrictions on the frequency of remittances under LRS. However, the total amount of foreign exchange purchased from or remitted through, all sources in India during a financial year should be within the cumulative limit of USD 2,50,000. Once a remittance is made for an amount up to USD 2,50,000 during the financial year, a resident individual would not be eligible to make any further remittances under this scheme, even if the proceeds of the investments have been brought back into the country.\n\nWhile one is travelling abroad, on a private visit, (other than to Nepal and Bhutan), he can obtain foreign exchange up to an aggregate of USD 2,50,000 (only 3,000 as cash, rest as travellers cheque or banker\u2019s draft) in any financial year. This limit is also subsumed under LRS.\n\nAre all people who use offshore structures crooks?\nNot quite.\nIn fact, using such offshore structures and firms is entirely legal (and even promoted by many host countries).\nThere could be legitimate reasons for such investments.\nSome use it to defend \u201craids\u201d from criminals, or sometimes to get around hard currency restrictions or currency exchange restrictions.\nSometimes firms are set up to make use of favourable tax or a bilateral treaty or a free trade agreement with another country.\nOthers use offshore for reasons of inheritance or estate planning etc.\nAre some people who use offshore structures crooks?\nYes, more often than not, such offshore structures smacks wrong doing.\nMany a time such off shore business firms are set up in what is called as \u201cTax Havens\u201d. The motive behind the same is multifarious.\nWhat are Tax Havens?\nThey are defined as those jurisdictions in which their banks provide services primarily to non-residents and they do not require the account holders to disclose information about them or their business, more than the bare minimum.\nSuch jurisdictions offer the comfort of high privacy and opaque transactions, an impenetrable wall of secrecy.\nTax havens are invariably low-tax regimes.\nExamples: Many of such jurisdictions are small island nations (and hence the name). Examples include British Virginia Islands, Panama, Bahamas, and Macao etc.\nMany of the firms registered in such jurisdictions are \u2018Shell Companies\u201d.\nWhat are Shell Companies?\nA shell company has an outward appearance of being a legitimate firm, but it is nothing but an empty shell.\nIt helps in managing the money involved within the company, while hiding who really owns the company.\nIt is also called \u201cletter-box company\u201d, as consist of little more than an address to post to.\nSo most obvious motive behind such off-shore firms in the tax havens is to avoid taxes, in the mother country.\nThus such jurisdictions thus play an important role in large-scale money-laundering activities, corruption activities, terrorism funding, storing revenue from organised crimes etc.\nWhat is money-laundering (in a nutshell\u2026)?\n\nIt literally means laundering (cleaning) the dirty money, so that one can use it without evoking any suspicion. There are many ways to launder the money like using Bearer Bonds or paying for non-existent imports, or even buying toilet papers for a million Rupees (inflating the price).\n\nWhat is\u00a0Mossack Fonseca\u2019s take on Panama Papers?\n\nTheir press release is as below:\n\nRecent media reports have portrayed an inaccurate view of the services that we provide and, despite our efforts to correct the record, misrepresented the nature of our work and its role in global financial markets.\n\nThese reports rely on supposition and stereotypes, and play on the public\u2019s lack of familiarity with the work of firms like ours.\n\nConclusion:\n\nThe Panama Papers have evoked great interest from governments and civil society around the world. While some have used the opportunity to tar capitalism as a concept promoting crooks, the debate over bringing back the illicit money has gained more traction. The data is a shot in the arm for government of India as well, which was reeling without adequate information about black money abroad. The Government has done the right thing by constituting an inter-department investigation team to look into the veracity of the leaked papers. It would also be interesting to note whether the current dispensation has the spine to take action against the Who\u2019s Who of India.\n\n\ud83d\udc49 Which year are YOU targeting for success in the IAS/IPS/IFS Exam? \ud83d\ude80\n\n(1) \u21d2 UPSC 2025: Prelims cum Mains\n\n(2) \u21d2 UPSC 2026: Prelims cum Mains\n\n(3) \u21d2 UPSC 2027 Prelims cum Mains\n\nTip: Know more about ClearIAS Courses (Online/Offline)\n\nReference and Courtesy:\n\nThe Guardian, BBC.\nThe Indian Express.\nhttps://panamapapers.icij.org\n\nArticle by: Jishnu J Raju"

            "[CONTENT]": "Huge number of refugees and migrants have been shifting to Europe, from many countries like Syria, particularly since 2011. They see Europian Union (EU)\u00a0as their asylum. With more number of\u00a0refugees coming in at a time when\u00a0the\u00a0natives don\u2019t want any more,\u00a0the whole situation has developed into a crisis. This crisis is\u00a0called European Refugee Crisis.\n\nTable of Contents\n\nThe refugees are not only from Syria!\nMigrants and Refugees \u2013 Statistics\nThe European Response to Migrant Crisis\nWhy Europe?\nMacro level causes for Refugee Crisis\nAdding fuel to fire\nSyrian Conflict have been going on for 4 years but why suddenly this crisis?\nConclusions with Possible Solutions\nQuestions to ponder:\nThe refugees are not only from Syria!\n\nMore than 5 Lakh people have crossed to Europe by sea and land. Most of them are from Syria \u2013 troubled not only by civil war, but also by the most violent and inhumane atrocities by ISIS. But Syria is not the single source. They come from areas such as the Middle East (Syria, Iraq), Africa (Eritrea, Nigeria, Somalia, Sudan, Gambia), South Asia and Central Asia.\u00a0According to International Organisation for Migration (IOM) statistics, a substantial number of refugees are also from Afghanistan and Pakistan too due to unending civil conflicts in these countries.\n\nThe phrase \u201cEuropean migrant crisis\u201d became widely used in April 2015, when five boats carrying almost two thousand migrants to Europe sank in the Mediterranean Sea, with a combined death toll estimated at more than 1,200 people.\n\nMigrants and Refugees \u2013 Statistics\n\nAccording to UNHCR, the UN\u2019s refugee agency, 59.5 million people were forcibly displaced in 2014 which again rose considerably in 2015.\nA record number of 1,07,500 migrants reached the borders of European Union in recent months.\nBetween 2000 and 2015, around 30, 000 have perished along these borders.\n\nThis figures stand as a witness that this crisis didn\u2019t started only after ISIS emerged. The increasing number of unaccompanied minors seeking asylum in Europe is seen as a dangerous growing trend among refugees. In 2014 alone around 24,000 unaccompanied minors applied for asylum. Many of the children who arrive are at the age group of 15 to 17 with no formal schooling adding more headaches to host countries.\n\nThe European Response to Migrant Crisis\n\nGermany and the EU have been pushing for other EU members to work out a plan for asylum seekers. Britain leads among countries which strictly rejects it. The Right-Wing PM of Hungary has appealed to refugees not to try and cross into Hungary which has fenced its borders with razor wire. Bulgaria, Czech, Slovakia and Poland all are reluctant in taking of refugees making the situation grave. Germany is expected to give green signal to almost 1 million applicants for asylum. After extensive criticisms by Media on Refugee crisis, EU has started to take few favourable steps. \u00a0Initially Europe greeted immigrants with barbed wires, tear gas and police brutality. Only after huge outcry across International media and from human rights and progressive organisations within Europe, eased the curbs on refugees.\n\n\ud83d\udc49 Which year are YOU targeting for success in the IAS/IPS/IFS Exam? \ud83d\ude80\n\n(1) \u21d2 UPSC 2025: Prelims cum Mains\n\n(2) \u21d2 UPSC 2026: Prelims cum Mains\n\n(3) \u21d2 UPSC 2027 Prelims cum Mains\n\nTip: Know more about ClearIAS Courses (Online/Offline)\n\nAylan: Another incident which helped to garner pro- refugee sentiments was photo of dead child Aylan on a beach. A mishap happened from his father who accidently dropped him from an overcrowded boat while trying to escape. These photos send jitters across world and thanks to social media which made sure that this photo was seen by everyone who has an account. Also Pope Francis statement that every Church in Europe should take a refugee family has given hope to many that it may change the mood in European Right Wing\u2019s mind. Countries have started to take more refugees peacefully now. European people have been welcoming refugees with water, food, shoes and blankets. Though Italy, Greece and Hungary are the frontline countries of reception, most sort after destinations are Germany, Sweden, Austria and Switzerland.\n\nWhy Europe?\n\nEurope is the most preferred destination for the people from this war conflicted regions as its economically prosperous, socially secure and has friendly immigration laws. Mostly it\u2019s not because refugees are opportunists that they walk to EU but it\u2019s due to dangerous situation they and their families has to live. Endless wars, conflicts have ruined their countries political, economic and social equilibrium. Also it\u2019s surprising why GCC countries never have been helpful or receptive to refugee crisis especially when it\u2019s happening in their backyard. Rich countries like Saudi Arabia and Qatar has to play more pro- active roles in this situation. So obviously Europe as nearest land seems to be their immediate hope to go as they can trek or use boats or ships to reach.\n\nMacro level causes for Refugee Crisis\nWest: A short and quick look into history will show you that countries who are responsible for this situation are the ones who have to bear pain of this crisis i.e Europe or to put in a clich\u00e9 \u2018West\u2019 inclusive of US. Middle East can be said as the holy grail of West since oil was accidentally found by two American gentlemen in Saudi Arabia. No doubt it was a boon to natives and even to millions of Asian and African immigrants to Middle East but also it paved the way to unending geo-political crisis across the region. Before finding oil just like Asia and Africa European colonialism had sucked all its wealth and when time came to leave the place like everywhere, Imperial powers left without solving issues created by them mainly land disputes within neighbours. Example is Israel and Palestine issue.\nDictatorship regimes and Islamic fundamentalism:\u00a0Continuous dictatorship type regimes and Islamic fundamentalism made Middle East most volatile n disturbed place on the planet. Western powers in order to make their oil supply smooth and to be part of Gulf Boom started in early 80\u2019s always took a partial stand on these issues.\nShia-Sunni divide: Another villain to already worsened situation was Shia-Sunni divide among people, society and regimes which led to many conflicts.\u00a0 This reason has led many natives to flee as refugees in the past from Palestine, during Iraq-Iran war, Iraq-Kuwait war etc.\nWars: This refuge crisis has given Europe a reality check on its wars on many regions of MENA (Middle East and North African region). Wars on these lands didn\u2019t ease the situation even though they were able to kill or defeat dictator leaders. By war, infrastructure and liveable conditions of already abysmal level got more deteriorated.\u00a0 These resulted natives of these lands to search green pastures which happened to be Europe and hence started Refugee crisis.\nDemocracy movements and civil war: Present refugees crisis didn\u2019t started yesterday but it has been seen a huge surge from Libya conflict. If we go again back refugee problem as a crisis started from US, UK joint war to liberate Iraq.\nISIS:\u00a0Emergence of ISIS just sky rocketed the whole thing. Western powers in a way failed to bring stable regimes to these lands. \u00a0People in a way got sandwiched between atrocities of ISIS or ineffective regimes backed by West on one side and on the other side hunger, poverty and tyranny. Only way to survive for them was to initiate long walk towards Europe! Thus started one of the biggest Exoduses ever seen in history.\nAdding fuel to fire\nSaudi Arabia has been\u00a0attacking and bombing Yemen.\nAsylum denied refugees may join ISIS.\nTurkey\u2019s intolerance with Kurds\nSyrian Conflict have been going on for 4 years but why suddenly this crisis?\nWar in Syria against ISIS is not getting any better. It made Syrians to leave their country to Turkey which is closest and they thought once war is over, they can return.\nEven though Turkey has taken 2 million refugees, it\u2019s not a country for people to stay in the long run as Right to work for refugees are not legal yet. Also new regime of Turkey is also not quite favourable to refuges as previous government. It has made refugees reluctant to go to Turkey.\nUN organisations working with millions of refuges in Jordan, Turkey and Lebanon are running short of funds to keep up the relief work and expenses of camp making people to think of going to Europe. Similar is the situation among UN camps catering to the needs of refugees in Eastern Europe.\nMany people have saved required money to use legally or illegally to get into Germany.\nPeople have familiarised with the route via Balkan to trek to EU.\nEU countries have been sitting as a lame duck all this year\u2019s talking, discussing on refugee crisis without sensing urgent need of a solution or to deal with such a situation.\nStill EU should understand that what they are facing now is just a tip of iceberg compared to neighbouring countries of Syria when it comes to dealing with refugees.\nConclusions with Possible Solutions\n\nWest in a way with its narrow minded Foreign Policy have destabilized West Asia and Middle East and now cannot show their back on refugee crisis.\n\nEurope should include US which has been largely elusive on whole issue till now.\nGCC countries should involve more in accepting refugees. It\u2019s a blunder what Saudi Arabia is doing right now by attacking and bombing Yemen currently which will only add more refugees.\nIf Europe is going to push back the refugees, the situation will be more vicious. Such a stupidity will increase the chances of refugees joining with ISIS as they won\u2019t have any other options to survive.\nTurkey should end its anonymity with Kurds and involve them more into finding a solution and to defeat ISIS.\nAssad regime should be made more accountable.\nInclude Russia and organise an all-out war against ISIS.\n\nFinding a formula based solution which will end all tyranny is not practical but it\u2019s time that Europe and US sit together and re-check their neo imperialistic and double faced foreign policies in West Asia and Middle East. Also Western powers should stop Saudi Arabia from funding Wahhabis ideology being spread in Middle East society which is resulting in more Islamic fundamentalism helping organisations like ISIS and Boko\u2014Haram.\n\nTo all those who oppose to support refuges,\u201cRecognize yourself in he and she who are not like you and me.\u201d\u00a0 \u00a0\u2013 Carlos Fuentes.\n\nQuestions to ponder:\n\u201cA spectre is haunting Europe \u2013 the spectre of Refugee crisis\u201d. Analyse the reasons of the refugee crisis faced by Europe. Do you think the response of the western world as adequate to tackle the situation?\nWest in a way with its narrow minded foreign policy have destabilized West Asia and Middle East and now cannot show their back on refugee crisis. Critically analyse.\nThe European migrant crisis is not entirely Syrian in origin.

This was the immediate cause of the Euromaidan protests. There were other reasons too.\n\nCauses of Euromaidan\nSuspension of the Ukraine\u2013European Union Association Agreement by the government.\nRussian foreign policy.\nThe threat of Russian trade sanctions.\nGovernment corruption.\nPolice brutality.\nGoals of Euromaidan\nThe signing of the EU Association Agreement and Free Trade Agreement.\nImpeachment of President Viktor Yanukovych.\nRe-adoption of the 2004 Constitution of Ukraine amendments.\nInternational sanctions against Yanukovych and Azarov government members.\nRejection of Customs Union membership.\nImpact of Euromaidan\n\nThe Euromaidan protests eventually led to the ousting of President Yanukovych in February 2014.

Yanukovych fled to Russia and is wanted in Ukraine for the killing of protesters.\n\nIn brief, the 2014 Ukrainian revolution was anti-Yanukovych who is pro-Russia. Those who protested wanted close Ukraine-EU relations and not a Ukraine-Russia partnership.\n\nThe 2014 Crimean Crisis\n\nThe Crimean Crisis happened when pro-Russian forces seized control of the Crimea region. The Causes of the Crimean Crisis can be summed up below :\n\nOpposition to the\u00a0Euromaidan\u00a0movement.\nOpposition to the\u00a0Yatsenyuk Government.\nThe Verkhovna Rada\u2019s vote on 23 February to repeal the language law that protected minority languages.\n\n\nAmid the political upheaval in Ukraine, Russia intervened by deploying troops to Crimea, which had a significant Russian-speaking population.\n\nIn March 2014, a controversial referendum was held in Crimea, in which a majority of participants voted in favor of joining Russia.\n\nThe international community, including Ukraine and Western countries, condemned the referendum as illegal and not reflective of the will of the people.\n\nWho is in charge of Ukraine? Different perspectives!\nRussia\u2019s take: Viktor Yanukovych\u00a0remains Ukraine\u2019s elected leader, and Ukraine\u2019s new government is illegitimate. Russian United Nations envoy Vitaly Churkin called it an \u201carmed takeover by radical extremists.\u201d\nUkraine\u2019s take: Ukraine has a legitimate government and is set to have new presidential elections on May 25. \u201cLet\u2019s allow that to work,\u201d Ukrainian Ambassador to the U.N. Yuriy Sergeyev said.\nUnited States take: Yanukovych abandoned his post last month, fled the country, and was then voted out of office by Ukraine\u2019s democratically elected parliament.\nDo Russian troops have a right to be in Crimea?\n\nRussia\u2019s take: Yes. A treaty between the neighboring nations allows Russia to have up to 25,000 troops in Crimea. Yanukovych requested Russia to send military forces.\n\nUkraine\u2019s take: No. Russian troops amassing in Crimea and near the border with Ukraine are an \u201cact of aggression.\u201d\n\nUnited States take: No, and Russian President Vladimir Putin is playing a dangerous game. The consequences of military action \u201ccould be devastating,\u201d.\n\nWhat is the Russian interest in the Crimean Peninsula?\n\nRussia\u2019s take: Russia has said its parliament approved Putin\u2019s use of military force to protect Russian citizens in the Crimean peninsula.\n\nUkraine\u2019s take: There\u2019s no evidence of any threat to Russians inside Ukraine. Russia wants to annex Crimea.\n\nUnited States take: Russia is responding to its historic sensitivities about Ukraine, Crimea, and their place in Moscow\u2019s sphere of influence. Russia fears that Ukraine is falling under European or Western influence.\n\nUS-Russia-Ukraine Diplomatic Talks\nU.S. Secretary of State John Kerry held the first direct talks with his Russian counterpart as Washington warned Moscow it risked losing its coveted G8 place over the worst East-West crisis since the end of the Cold War.\nCrimea\u2019s parliament voted for the region to become part of Russia, and to hold a referendum in 10 days on endorsing the move.\nUkraine\u2019s interim economy minister dismisses the move as \u201cunconstitutional\u201d.\nEU leaders are holding an emergency summit to decide their response to Russia\u2019s troop deployment in Crimea.\nThe US imposes visa restrictions on people who are \u201cthreatening the sovereignty and territorial integrity of Ukraine\u201d\nConclusion\n\nThe former President of Ukraine who was pro-Russia was ousted as part of the Euromaidan protests (2014 Ukraine Revolution to be precise).\n\nThe protesters generally were of pro-west (read EU and US) attitude and demanded closer EU relations. As the President of Ukraine sought Russia\u2019s help, Russian troops entered the Crimean peninsula in Ukraine. Crimea\u2019s parliament voted for the region to become part of Russia, and to hold a referendum in 10 days on endorsing the move.\n\nThe annexation of Crimea was met with strong condemnation from many countries and led to diplomatic tensions between Russia and Western nations. The United States and the European Union imposed economic sanctions on Russia in response.\n\nThe crisis further exacerbated tensions between Ukraine and Russia. The eastern regions of Donetsk and Luhansk, with large Russian-speaking populations, also witnessed separatist movements and conflict between pro-Russian rebels and the Ukrainian government.\n\nThe annexation of Crimea violated Ukraine\u2019s territorial integrity and international law. The United Nations General Assembly passed a resolution that affirmed Ukraine\u2019s sovereignty over Crimea and condemned Russia\u2019s actions.\n\nThe 2014 Crimean crisis marked a significant turning point in the relationship between Russia and the West, and it had far-reaching implications for regional stability and international norms.\n\nThe issue of Crimea\u2019s sovereignty remains unresolved, and tensions between Russia and Ukraine persist to this day.\n\nUkrainian- Crimean Crisis and UPSC!\n\nAn understanding of key events in Ukraine\u2019s political crisis would help to answer the 2014 UPSC interview questions. Adding below, are some important keywords related to the Ukraine crisis. Check them out. Interested aspirants may explain some of them in the comments.\n\nKeywords related to the Ukrainian Revolution and Crimean Crisis\n\nKeywords: Ukraine crisis,\u00a0Crimea coup,\u00a0Russia Ukraine dispute,\u00a0Simferopol,\u00a0Crimean airports,\u00a0Sevastopol,\u00a0Kerch ferry terminal,\u00a0Vladimir Putin,\u00a0Arseniy Yatsenyuk,\u00a0Viktor Yanukovych,\u00a0Oleksandr Turchinov, Euromaidan, Orange Revolution.\n\nEg: Euromaidan: Protest which attracted around 300,000 people on Kyiv\u2019s Independence Square, known as the Maidan, the largest since the 2004 Orange Revolution.

Read further to know.\n\nThis article on Sub-Prime Crisis, Fiscal Cliff, and Fiscal Drag is part of the article series by ClearIAS.com on some current but confusing concepts related to the US economy.\n\nWe plan to discuss in detail, terms like the United States Sub-Prime Crisis, Fiscal Cliff, Fiscal Drag, US debt ceiling, US shutdown, Quantitative Easing, and Federal tapering in layman\u2019s terms. So here starts our Background Digging Operation on the most highlighted economy terms in recent times.\n\nTopics that will be covered in the article series:\n\nSub-prime crisis.\nFiscal Cliff and Fiscal Drag.\nUS debt ceiling crisis and US Federal Government Shutdown.\nQuantitative Easing and Federal Tapering.\n\nTable of Contents\n\nBackground: Sub-Prime Crisis of 2008\nSub-prime mortgage crisis: What was that?\nFiscal Cliff Explained\nReasons for Fiscal Cliff and the Possible Impact\nHow did the US avoid the fiscal cliff?\nFiscal Drag: What does it mean?\nBackground: Sub-Prime Crisis of 2008\n\nThe United States, being the biggest economy in the world always enjoyed a strong position to influence the world economic affairs in a globalized world. Be it positive or negative, whatever happens in the US has an impact on almost all countries including India. But the strength of US economy was tested thoroughly in 2008 by a crisis called a sub-prime crisis, and the results portrayed the problems of the economic structure of the US.\n\nNews about economics crisis in the US banks started to spread like forest fire. New terms like the recession, meltdown etc. made headlines in newspapers across the world. What was the reason? Let\u2019s analyze crisis situation in 2008, popularly known as Subprime Mortgage Crisis.\n\n\ud83d\udc49 Which year are YOU targeting for success in the IAS/IPS/IFS Exam? \ud83d\ude80\n\n(1) \u21d2 UPSC 2025: Prelims cum Mains\n\n(2) \u21d2 UPSC 2026: Prelims cum Mains\n\n(3) \u21d2 UPSC 2027 Prelims cum Mains\n\nTip: Know more about ClearIAS Courses (Online/Offline)\n\nSub-prime mortgage crisis: What was that?\n\nThe term is associated with sub-prime lending. Many US banks had lent money to sub-prime borrowers (those borrowers who were rated below the prime borrowers), and these sub-prime borrowers failed to pay back the loans they had taken. Loans were given during real estate boom time, but when the bubble burst, banks lost most of their money. Badly affected banks include names like Lehman Brothers, Merril Lynch, and Bear Stearns.\n\nAs many of these banks closed their operations, US went into a period of recession (period of low growth) and the whole world was affected by it. US Federal bank (the supreme bank in US, just like the RBI of India) intervened and it tried everything it could do to prevent further collapse. The Fed pumped money, they bought many mortgages and gave liberal credit to other banks [Monetary Policy]. US government also made significant steps as part of their fiscal policy to control sub-prime crisis and recession. The government announced many tax cuts and started huge public expenditure programs [Fiscal Policy].\n\nFiscal Cliff Explained\n\nThe story of Fiscal Cliff starts with the subprime crisis. Hence we covered that first. US Congress ( the legislative body, similar to Indian Parliament) had passed many laws during the recession period calling for tax cuts, in-order to boost economic activity. But there was a time period specified for these exemptions. Many of these exemptions expired at midnight on December 31, 2012. So period from Jan 1, 2013, was supposed to be a period of high taxes. A sudden condition of high taxes and reduced public expenditure after a long period of tax cuts and liberal public expenditure is known as Fiscal Cliff. In the case of US, it was more a technical or policy issue, but to avoid this policy issue, the two houses of the US congress had to reach a consensus, which they didn\u2019t reach initially.\n\nTo sum up, Fiscal Cliff is the burden due to sudden increase in tax and less expenditure as mandated by some US bills (mainly a technical issue, but has practical reasons for each bill). It was the Congress to take action, but if they had not taken, US would have faced a fiscal contraction worth $600bn in 2013, which could tip the economy into a new recession.\n\n[Source My own quote : For your understanding!]\n\nReasons for Fiscal Cliff and the Possible Impact\nThe primary reason: expiry of Bush-era tax cuts.\nFiscal Cliff became a highlighted issue because of the provisions mentioned in the following bills:\u00a02010 Tax Relief Act,\u00a0Budget Control Act of 2011.\nThe\u00a0Budget Control Act of 2011\u00a0codified in law a grudging political compromise forcing the government to slash spending by $1.2 trillion over 10 years from January 1, 2013.\u00a02013 cuts, called \u201csequestration,\u201d was about $109 billion. ( Budget Control Act of US is analogous to\u00a0FRBM act of India!)\nA package of tax reductions and an extension of unemployment benefits will expire, meaning taxes will rise much for most Americans.\nTogether, higher taxes and lowered spending could slice the $1.1 trillion deficit racked up in fiscal 2012 by almost $600 billion in 2013, according to the Congressional Budget Office, vastly improving the government\u2019s financial picture. Though it might seem positive from the budget angle of government, it is a sudden and heavy burden on the people.\nThe CBO estimated the shock treatment would send the country back to recession and push the unemployment rate to 9.1 percent.\nFiscal cliff expected from Jan 1, 2013, would have resulted in Fiscal Drag.\nHow did the US avoid the fiscal cliff?\n\nThe\u00a0American Taxpayer Relief Act of 2012\u00a0(ATRA) addressed the revenue side of the fiscal cliff by implementing smaller tax increases compared to the expiration of the Bush tax cuts. Also, a\u00a0compromise was reached between Democrats and Republicans on January 1, 2013, regarding tax cuts. Higher income tax rates were agreed for the wealthy. Tougher decisions on spending cuts have been discussed in the Congress.\n\nFiscal Drag: What does it mean?\n\nThe first point to remember about fiscal drag is that government will get more tax revenue (mainly income tax) at the time of fiscal drag. Fiscal drag is the tendency of revenue from\u00a0taxation\u00a0to rise as a share of GDP in a growing economy.\u00a0Fiscal drag may happen due to inflation or fiscal policies of the government.\n\nFiscal drag is normally associated with progressive tax rates. Because of progressive taxes, the government will get more taxes when the economy is booming. This also\u00a0helps slow the rate of increase in\u00a0demand, reducing the pace of\u00a0growth, making it less likely to result in higher\u00a0inflation. Thus fiscal drag is an automatic stabilizer, as it acts naturally to keep demand stable.\n\nAlso note that fiscal drag means greater tax burden for people. And the greater tax burden can lead to less consumer spending.\n\nRead the second part of this article series in the link:\u00a0US debt ceiling crisis and US Federal Government Shutdown."

What are the solutions to the US debt ceiling crisis and US shutdown?\n\nThe last article from ClearIAS.com discussed about\u00a0Sub-prime crisis and Fiscal Cliff. Things didn\u2019t end there for the US economy. There were other problems to handle.\u00a0\n\nThe next two major categories of economic issues were (1) the US debt ceiling crisis and the US Federal Government Shutdown and (2) Quantitative Easing and Federal Tapering.\u00a0\n\nLet\u2019s discuss the US Debt Ceiling Crisis and the US Federal government shutdown in this post and discuss Quantitative Easing in another article. So, straight to the topic.\n\nTable of Contents\n\nUS Debt Ceiling Crisis\nBack to Fiscal Cliff Crisis\n$1 trillion-plus annual budget gap of US!\nWhat is Debt ceiling? Who sets this figure?\nUnited States Federal Government shut down\nSolutions to US Debt Ceiling Crisis and US Shut down\nUS Debt Ceiling Crisis\n\nDo you remember that the Fiscal Cliff was rather a technical and policy issue rather than an economic issue? Do you remember the date December 31, 2012? On the same date, another related but different problem was creating trouble for the US government. This crisis too was related to bills. And the name of the crisis: US Debt Ceiling Crisis.\n\nBack to Fiscal Cliff Crisis\n\nFiscal Cliff became a highlighted issue because of the provisions mentioned in the following bills.\n\n\ud83d\udc49 Which year are YOU targeting for success in the IAS/IPS/IFS Exam? \ud83d\ude80\n\n(1) \u21d2 UPSC 2025: Prelims cum Mains\n\n(2) \u21d2 UPSC 2026: Prelims cum Mains\n\n(3) \u21d2 UPSC 2027 Prelims cum Mains\n\nTip: Know more about ClearIAS Courses (Online/Offline)\n\n2010 Tax Relief Act.\nBudget Control Act of 2011.\n\nThe fiscal cliff crisis was partially solved with the passage of\u00a0the American Taxpayer Relief Act of 2012\u00a0on Jan 1, 2013. This meant that there was a compromise that taxes should not be increased beyond a limit and there should not be excessive cuts on public expenditure. But this compromise had another problem \u2013 the debt ceiling \u2013 associated with it. That too, is a self-imposed, technical, and policy issue.\n\n$1 trillion-plus annual budget gap of US!\n\nHope you are now clear about the fact that the economic condition of the US is not very good. $1 trillion-plus is the US annual budget gap (A figure which is around India\u2019s GDP). Too much budget deficit is not good for any economy. The risk of reduction of credit rating always exists. Also, there are more chances of populism. So\u00a0Budget Control Act of 2011\u00a0imposed restrictions on the debt limit of the US government. And that value was 16.399 trillion dollars.\n\nCan you think of any way of reducing the $1 trillion-plus US annual budget deficit? The usual way out is either to increase taxes or reduce spending. But this contradicts the compromise on the Fiscal Cliff crisis. Besides, the two houses of the US Congress, are on two different pages, creating a deadlock. So what to do then?\n\nWhat was needed to solve the Fiscal Cliff crisis was directly antagonistic to the solution of the US debt ceiling crisis. So it turned out that the solution to resolve the US debt ceiling crisis was not to reduce the debt, but rather increase or suspend the debt ceiling limit itself!\n\n[Source: My own quote: For your understanding!]\n\nAlso read: Debt Sustainability\n\nWhat is Debt ceiling? Who sets this figure?\nThe limit is set by Congress. The United States will not be able to borrow any more money if it crosses the debt ceiling and would, in theory, be forced to slash spending to make ends meet.\nThe debt limit does not control or limit the ability of the federal government to run deficits or incur obligations. Rather, it is a limit on the ability to pay obligations already incurred. It does not prohibit Congress from creating further obligations upon the United States. The ceiling was last set at $16.4 trillion in 2011.\nPossible, but desperate, remedies would include halting pay to the military, retirement health benefits, social security, and failing to pay government debts.\nThe US will not default on its own debt immediately. The Treasury has various extraordinary measures in its armory, including halting the issuance of securities to state and local governments, which could buy about two months of leeway.\nAfter the passing in early January 2013 of the American Taxpayer Relief Act of 2012 to avert the projected fiscal cliff, political attention shifted to the debt ceiling.\nThe debt ceiling had technically been reached on December 31, 2012, when the Treasury Department commenced \u201cextraordinary measures\u201d to enable the continued financing of the government.\n\nAlso read: Public Debt: Overview\n\nUnited States Federal Government shut down\n\nFrom October 1 through 16, 2013, the\u00a0United States federal government entered a shutdown\u00a0and curtailed most routine operations after Congress failed to enact legislation appropriating funds for fiscal year 2014, or a continuing resolution for the interim authorization of appropriations for fiscal year 2014. Regular government operations resumed on October 17 after an interim appropriations bill was signed into law. There was a conflict of interest on the\u00a0Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act\u00a0(commonly known as \u201cObamacare\u201d) between Democrats and Republicans.\n\nThe 16-day-long shutdown of October 2013 was the third-longest government shutdown in U.S. history, after the 18-day shutdown in 1978 and the 21-day 1995\u201396 shutdown.\n\nThe US Government shutdown was rather a budget issue appropriation issue for the new fiscal year. It was connected with the US debt ceiling, but the shutdown issue was a short-term one (connected only with the spending for the next fiscal), but the debt ceiling was a long-term problem (connected with the long-term borrowing limit.)\n\n[ Relate the Shutdown issue with a case like the Indian Budget got passed in Lok Sabha but not in Rajya Sabha; the Debt ceiling can be related to the provisions of the FRBM act which places restrictions on the Fiscal Deficit].\n\nAlso read: Budget Documents Made Simple\n\nSolutions to US Debt Ceiling Crisis and US Shut down\n\nSolution tried = Suspend the debt ceiling!\n\nThe 2013 crisis began in January 2013 and ended on October 17, 2013, with the passing of the\u00a0Continuing Appropriations Act, of 2014, though the debate continues.\nOn October 16, the Senate passed the Continuing Appropriations Act, 2014, a continuing resolution, to fund the government until January 15, 2014, and\u00a0suspend the debt ceiling\u00a0until February 7, 2014, thus ending both the United States federal government shutdown of 2013 and the United States debt-ceiling crisis of 2013.\nOn January 14, 2014, the House and the Senate Appropriations Committees agreed on a spending plan that would fund the federal government for two years.\nOn January 16, 2014, Congress passed a $1.1 trillion appropriations bill that will keep the federal government funded until October 2014. (Short-term solution).\nCongress still needs to address the debt ceiling issue.\n\nRead the third part of this article series in the link:\u00a0Quantitative Easing and Federal Tapering Explained."

Some international organizations are very large, such as corporations. Others are small and dedicated to a specific purpose, such as the conservation of a species. Many international organizations are intergovernmental.\n\nInternational organizations can function for the aggregation and articulation of the national interests of its members into the international system.

These include international non-profit organizations and worldwide companies such as the World Organisation of the Scout Movement, and the International Committee of the Red Cross.\nInternational organizations, also known as International Governmental Organizations (IGOs)\nThe type of organization most closely associated with the term international organization. These are organizations that are made up primarily of sovereign states. Notable examples include the United Nations (UN), Organisation for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE), Council of Europe (COE), International Labour Organisation (ILO), and International Police Organisation (INTERPOL).\nThe UN has used the term \u201cIntergovernmental organization\u201d instead of \u201cinternational organization\u201d for clarity.\nImportant International Economic Organizations\n\nThe following are the important economic organizations.\n\nBretton Woods Institutions\n\nThe following are the Bretton Woods institutions.\n\nWORLD BANK GROUP\u00a0(WBG)\nThe World Bank Group (WBG) is a family of five international organizations that make leveraged loans to developing countries. It is the largest and most famous development bank in the world and is an observer at the United Nations Development Group.\nIts five organizations are the International Bank for Reconstruction and Development (IBRD), the International Development Association (IDA), the International Finance Corporation (IFC), the Multilateral Investment Guarantee Agency (MIGA) and the International Centre for Settlement of Investment Disputes (ICSID).\nINTERNATIONAL BANK FOR RECONSTRUCTION AND DEVELOPMENT OR THE WORLD BANK\nThe International Bank for Reconstruction and Development (IBRD), better known as the World Bank, was established at the same time as the International Monetary Fund to tackle the problem of international investment.\nSince the IMF was designed to provide temporary assistance in correcting the balance of payments difficulties, an institution was also needed to assist with long-term investment purposes. Thus, IBRD was established to promote long-term investment loans on reasonable terms.\nThe World Bank (IBRD) is an inter-governmental institution, corporate in form, whose capital stock is entirely owned by its member governments. Initially, only nations that were members of the IMF could be members of the World Bank; this restriction on membership was subsequently relaxed.\nTHE INTERNATIONAL DEVELOPMENT ASSOCIATION (IDA)\nThe International Development Association (IDA) is part of the World Bank Group that helps the world\u2019s poorest countries. Overseen by 173 shareholder nations, IDA aims to reduce poverty by providing loans (called \u201ccredits\u201d) and grants for programs that boost economic growth, reduce inequalities, and improve people\u2019s living conditions.\nIDA complements the World Bank\u2019s original lending arm\u2014the International Bank for Reconstruction and Development (IBRD). IBRD was established to function as a self-sustaining business and provides loans and advice to middle-income and credit-worthy poor countries. IBRD and IDA share the same staff and headquarters and evaluate projects with the same rigorous standards.\n\u00a0INTERNATIONAL FINANCE CORPORATION (IFC)\nThe IFC was established in 1956 to support the growth of the private sector in the developing world. The IFC\u2019s stated mission is \u201cto promote sustainable private sector investment in developing countries, helping to reduce poverty and improve people\u2019s lives.\u201d\nWhile the World Bank (IBRD and IDA) provides credit and non-lending assistance to governments, the IFC provides loans and equity financing, advice, and technical services to the private sector. The IFC also plays a catalytic role, by mobilizing additional capital through loan syndication and by lessening the political risk for investors, enabling their participation in a given project. The IFC has worked with\u00a0more than\u00a03319 companies in 140 countries since its inception in 1956.\nTHE\u00a0MULTILATERAL INVESTMENT GUARANTEE AGENCY\u00a0(MIGA)\nIt is an international financial institution that offers political risk insurance and credit enhancement guarantees. Such guarantees help investors protect foreign direct investments against political and non-commercial risks in developing countries. MIGA is a member of the World Bank Group and is headquartered in Washington, D.C., United States.\nIt was established in 1988 as an investment insurance facility to encourage confident investment in developing countries.\u00a0MIGA\u2019s stated mission is \u201cto promote foreign direct investment into developing countries to support economic growth, reduce poverty, and improve people\u2019s lives\u201d.\u00a0It targets projects that endeavor to create new jobs, develop infrastructure, generate new tax revenues, and take advantage of natural resources through\u00a0sustainable\u00a0policies and programs.\nInternational Monetary Fund (IMF)\nThe World Bank and the IMF perform different functions, but they are often confused with each other either concerning their functions or with their operation.\nThe International Monetary Fund functions The IMF is a lending institution that gives advances to members in need, It is the mentor of its members\u2019 monetary and exchange rate policies and maintains the stability in the Exchange rate system around the World.\nAsian Development Bank (ADB)\nAsian Development Bank (ADB) was set up to fight poverty in Asia and the Pacific. ADB is a multilateral development finance institution dedicated to reducing poverty in Asia and the Pacific. Established in 1966, ADB is now owned by 63 members, mostly from the region.\u00a0 The headquarters is in Manila with 24 other offices around the world.\nThe\u00a0New Development Bank (NDB)\nThe\u00a0New Development Bank (NDB) was established by The BRICS states (Brazil, Russia, India, China, and South Africa). According to the Agreement on the NDB, \u201cthe Bank shall support public or private projects through loans, guarantees, equity participation, and other financial instruments.\u201d Moreover, the NDB \u201cshall cooperate with international organizations and other financial entities, and provide technical assistance for projects to be supported by the Bank.\nThe initial\u00a0authorized capital\u00a0of the bank is $100 billion divided into 1 million\u00a0shares\u00a0having a par value of $100,000 each. The initial subscribed capital of the NDB is $50 billion divided into paid-in shares ($10 bln) and callable shares ($40 bln). The initial subscribed capital of the bank was equally distributed among the founding members. The Agreement on the NDB specifies that the voting power of each member will be equal to the number of its subscribed shares in the capital stock of the bank.\nThe bank is headquartered in Shanghai, China. The first regional office of the NDB will be opened in\u00a0Johannesburg, South Africa.\nAsian Infrastructure Investment Bank\u00a0(AIIB)\nIndia is preparing to start a large number of infrastructure projects, but they\u2019re short of money, so they need help from China. Of course, they can get money from ADB or WB, but they also need to find a balance between China and the USA.\nIt\u2019s a great chance to develop economic links between India and China. These two countries both have a huge market, and they also keep a rapid growth of the economy.\nThough AIIB is a Chinese-led financial institution, India is welcome to play an important role in it. It\u2019s the reason why the UK, Germany, and France all want to be a member of AIIB.\nWorld Trade Organization (WTO)\nWorld Trade Organization, as an institution was established in 1995. It replaced the General Agreement on Trade and Tariffs (GATT) which had been in place since 1946. In pursuance of World War II, western countries came out with their version of development, which is moored in the promotion of free trade and homogenization of the world economy on Western lines. This version claims that development will take place only if there is seamless trade among all the countries and there are minimal tariff and non-tariff barriers.\nThat time along with two Bretton Wood institutions \u2013 IMF and World Bank, an International Trade Organization (ITO) was conceived. ITO was successfully negotiated and agreed upon by almost all countries. It was supposed to work as a specialized arm of the United Nations, toward the promotion of free trade. However, the United States along with many other major countries failed to get this treaty ratified in their respective legislatures and hence it became a dead letter.\n\nRead to know more about International Affairs,\u00a0 UN agencies, and other Important international institutions.\n\nArticle written by Aseem Muhammed"

Its roots can be traced back to ancient times, but the most significant events shaping its current state began in the early 17th century and intensified in the 20th century. Read here to learn more.\n\nNorthern Ireland is a part of the United Kingdom, lying north-east of the island of Ireland.\n\nNorthern Ireland has had several waves of immigrants and emigrants throughout the years, including Celtics from continental Europe and Vikings, Normans, and Anglo-Saxons. The region is close to Scotland and the sea passages that lead to England and Wales.\n\nBelfast, the nation\u2019s capital, is a contemporary city whose historic core suffered significant damage from aircraft bombardment during World War II.

The conflict over Home Rule contributed to the eventual partition of Ireland.\n\nThe Partition of Ireland (1921)\n\nThe Government of Ireland Act 1920 paved the way for the partition of Ireland into two self-governing entities: Northern Ireland, which remained part of the United Kingdom, and the Southern counties, which became the Irish Free State (now the Republic of Ireland) in 1922 following the Anglo-Irish Treaty.\n\nThis division formalized the sectarian divide, with a majority Protestant population in the North and a majority Catholic population in the South.\n\nThe Troubles (Late 20th Century)\n\n\u201cThe Troubles\u201d refers to a violent conflict that took place from the late 1960s to 1998, primarily in Northern Ireland but also affecting parts of the Republic of Ireland and England.\n\nThis period was marked by bombings, assassinations, and street violence, primarily between nationalist/republican groups (mainly Catholic) seeking unification with the Republic of Ireland, and unionist/loyalist groups (mainly Protestant) wanting to remain part of the UK.\n\nThe British Army was also heavily involved, both as peacekeepers and combatants. Over 3,500 people were killed during this time.\n\nGood Friday Agreement (1998)\n\nThe Good Friday Agreement, signed on April 10, 1998, was a major political development that brought an end to most of the violence of the Troubles.\n\nIt established a devolved system of government in Northern Ireland in which power would be shared between unionist and nationalist parties.\n\nIt also set the terms for cooperation between Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland, as well as between the Republic of Ireland and the UK.\n\n21st Century Challenges and Developments\n\nIn the years following the Good Friday Agreement, Northern Ireland has experienced relative peace and significant economic growth.\n\nHowever, it faces ongoing challenges related to sectarian divisions, political instability, and the legacy of the Troubles.\n\nThe Brexit referendum in 2016 introduced new tensions, particularly regarding the status of the border between Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland.\n\nThe political deadlock in Northern Ireland stemmed from the disagreement over the implementation of border controls between Britain and the Island of Ireland following Brexit.\nWhen the United Kingdom left the European Union, Northern Ireland, as part of the UK, became the only province with a land border with an EU member state, the Republic of Ireland.\nNorthern Ireland Protocol\n\nThe Northern Ireland Protocol is a crucial component of the Brexit agreement between the United Kingdom (UK) and the European Union (EU).\n\nIt was established to address the complex issue of the border between Northern Ireland (part of the UK) and the Republic of Ireland (an EU member state) following the UK\u2019s decision to leave the EU.\n\nThe Protocol seeks to prevent the reintroduction of a hard border on the island of Ireland, preserve the Good Friday Agreement (also known as the Belfast Agreement), and safeguard the peace process in Northern Ireland.\n\nKey Features of the Protocol:\n\nCustoms Arrangements: Under the Protocol, Northern Ireland continues to follow EU customs rules and regulations to prevent the need for customs checks on the island of Ireland. This avoids the creation of a hard border between Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland.\nSingle Market Rules: Northern Ireland also remains aligned with certain EU single market rules, particularly those related to goods. This ensures that goods can move freely between Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland without the need for regulatory checks.\nBorder in the Irish Sea: To implement these arrangements, a customs and regulatory border was effectively placed in the Irish Sea, separating Northern Ireland from the rest of the UK. This arrangement allows Northern Ireland to maintain its access to both the UK internal market and the EU single market.\nDemocratic Consent: The Protocol includes provisions for the democratic consent of the people of Northern Ireland, allowing the Northern Ireland Assembly to vote on whether to continue the Protocol\u2019s arrangements every four years.\n\nChallenges and Controversies:\n\nUnionist Opposition: The Protocol has faced significant opposition from unionist politicians and communities in Northern Ireland, who argue that it undermines Northern Ireland\u2019s place within the UK and creates economic barriers between Northern Ireland and the rest of the UK.\nImplementation Issues: The implementation of the Protocol has been challenging, leading to delays and disruptions in trade between Great Britain and Northern Ireland. Some businesses have struggled to adapt to the new customs and regulatory requirements.\nUK-EU Relations: Tensions have arisen between the UK and the EU over the implementation of the Protocol, with both sides accusing each other of failing to fully honor their commitments. This has strained relations and raised concerns about the stability of the Northern Ireland peace process.\nWhy is Northern Ireland in the news?\n\nOn February 3 2024, pro-Irish unity politician Michelle O\u2019Neill from the Sinn Fein party made history by becoming the first Nationalist First Minister of Northern Ireland, after the opposition Democratic Union Party (DUP), the largest pro-U.K. party, returned to government ending a two-year-long political deadlock in Northern Ireland.\n\nThe Good Friday Agreement (Belfast Agreement) of 1998 established the power-sharing arrangement known as consociationalism, which governs Northern Ireland.\n\nAccording to this concept, power ought to be distributed equally among the different sectarian factions in a state; in this instance, it should be divided between the Nationalists or Republicans, who support Irish unification, and the Loyalists or Unionists, who support the United Kingdom.\nThe Democratic Union Party (DUP) is a Nationalist political party, but Sinn Fein is the largest.\nFirst Minister status will go to the party with the most vote share, while Deputy First Minister will remain in the hands of the party with the second-highest vote percentage.\nA Unionist must hold one of these two positions, and a Nationalist the other. Both roles are equally important.\nConclusion\n\nThe history of the region is marked by colonization, division, conflict, and a striving for peace. Its complex past continues to influence its present and future, particularly in terms of political dynamics, community relations, and identity. The Good Friday Agreement remains a cornerstone of peace and power-sharing in Northern Ireland, even as the region navigates the challenges of changing political landscapes both domestically and internationally.\n\n-Article by Swathi Satish"

In the interconnected world of the 21st century, global trade is the backbone of the world economy, linking countries, industries, and markets. Read here to learn more about the impact of trade disruptions globally.\n\nThe UN\u2019s trade and development body, UNCTAD, has raised profound concerns over escalating disruptions to global trade.\n\nIt says that recent attacks on ships in the Red Sea, combined with geopolitical tensions affecting shipping in the Black Sea and the impacts of climate change on the Panama Canal, have given rise to a complex crisis affecting key trade routes.\n\nMaritime trade accounts for approximately 80% of the global movement of goods in international trade.\n\nTable of Contents\n\nGlobal trade disruptions\nCauses of Disruptions\nDisruptions in the Black Sea and Panama and Suez Canals\nPanama Canal\nImpact of Trade Disruptions\nStrategies for Mitigating Trade Disruptions\nConclusion\nGlobal trade disruptions\n\nThe interconnectedness of the world through trade also means that disruptions in one part of the world can have cascading effects globally.\n\nFrom natural disasters and pandemics to political instability and economic crises, various factors have caused significant disruptions in global trade.\n\n\ud83d\udc49 Which year are YOU targeting for success in the IAS/IPS/IFS Exam? \ud83d\ude80\n\n(1) \u21d2 UPSC 2025: Prelims cum Mains\n\n(2) \u21d2 UPSC 2026: Prelims cum Mains\n\n(3) \u21d2 UPSC 2027 Prelims cum Mains\n\nTip: Know more about ClearIAS Courses (Online/Offline)\n\nUnderstanding these disruptions is crucial for businesses, governments, and policymakers to develop strategies for resilience and sustainable growth.\n\nCauses of Disruptions\n\nNatural Disasters:\n\nEarthquakes, hurricanes, floods, and other natural disasters can severely impact trade by damaging infrastructure, disrupting supply chains, and halting production and transportation. The 2011 earthquake and tsunami in Japan, which affected the global supply of automobile parts and electronics, is a prime example.\n\nPandemics:\n\nThe COVID-19 pandemic illustrated how a health crisis could lead to unprecedented global trade disruptions. Lockdowns and border closures impacted manufacturing and logistics, leading to supply chain bottlenecks and a shortage of goods worldwide.\n\nPolitical and Economic Instability:\n\nTrade wars, tariffs, sanctions, and political instability can significantly disrupt global trade. For instance, the U.S.-China trade war led to increased tariffs, affecting global supply chains and market stability.\n\nTechnological Disruptions:\n\nCybersecurity threats and technological failures can also impact global trade. Cyber-attacks on major companies can halt operations, as seen in the case of the 2017 ransomware attack on Maersk, the world\u2019s largest container shipping company.\n\nGlobalization Backlash:\n\nRising protectionism and anti-globalization sentiments in many countries have led to policy changes that can disrupt global trade, such as Brexit and its impact on European trade.\nDisruptions in the Black Sea and Panama and Suez Canals\n\nThe Suez Canal, a critical waterway connecting the Mediterranean Sea to the Red Sea, handled approximately 12% to 15% of global trade in 2023.\n\nThe ongoing conflict in Ukraine has also triggered substantial shifts in oil and grain trades, reshaping established trade patterns.\n\nMeanwhile, the Panama Canal, another key artery for global trade, is grappling with a severe drought that has diminished water levels, resulting in a staggering 36% reduction in total transits over the past month compared to a year ago.\n\nThe long-term implications of climate change on the canal\u2019s capacity are raising concerns about enduring impacts on global supply chains. The crisis in the Red Sea, marked by Houthi-led attacks disrupting shipping routes, has added another layer of complexity.\n\nPanama Canal\n\nThe Panama Canal, an engineering marvel, stands as a testament to human ingenuity and a pivotal artery in global trade. Completed in 1914, this 82-kilometer waterway not only transformed the maritime landscape but also became an indispensable component of international trade and economics. Its significance in global commerce, geopolitical strategies, and maritime navigation is profound and multifaceted.\n\nStrategic Location and Historical Background\n\nStrategically located to connect the Atlantic and Pacific Oceans, the Panama Canal slices through the Isthmus of Panama in Central America. Before its construction, ships had to endure the perilous and extended Cape Horn route at the southern tip of South America. The demand for a shorter, safer passage led to the creation of this canal, fundamentally altering maritime trade routes.\n\nReduction in Shipping Time and Costs\n\nThe most direct impact of the Panama Canal is the substantial reduction in shipping time and costs.\nBy providing a shortcut, the canal diminishes the voyage distance by several thousand nautical miles, translating into reduced fuel consumption and operational costs.\nThis efficiency is a boon for global trade, as it enhances the viability and profitability of long-distance maritime transportation, particularly beneficial for the movement of goods between Asia and the eastern coast of the United States.\n\nBoost to Global Trade\n\nAs a conduit for international trade, the Panama Canal supports the movement of a significant percentage of the world\u2019s sea-bound freight.\nIt facilitates the transport of various commodities, including grains, crude oil, chemicals, and consumer goods, underlining its role in feeding global supply chains.\nThe canal\u2019s capacity to handle about 14,000 transits annually underscores its significance in maintaining the flow of global commerce.\n\nEconomic Impact\n\nEconomically, the Panama Canal is a crucial revenue stream for Panama, primarily through transit tolls.\nThe canal\u2019s operations contribute significantly to the country\u2019s GDP.\nBeyond its national economic impact, the canal indirectly influences the economies of several countries by bolstering trade efficiency and connectivity.\n\nInfluence on Shipping Industries\n\nThe canal\u2019s dimensions historically dictated ship designs, leading to the development of \u201cPanamax\u201d vessels, specifically built to traverse its locks and channels.\nThe recent expansion of the canal to accommodate larger \u201cNew Panamax\u201d ships has further influenced global shipping trends, encouraging the construction of bigger, more efficient vessels, and thereby revolutionizing maritime transport.\n\nRegional Development\n\nThe Panama Canal has been a catalyst for economic and infrastructural development in the region.\nIts presence has fostered the growth of logistics, maritime services, and industrial activities, not just in Panama but also in neighboring countries.\nThis development has implications for employment, skill development, and broader economic growth in the region.\n\nGeopolitical and Strategic Importance\n\nControl over the Panama Canal signifies control over one of the world\u2019s most strategic maritime passages.\nHistorically, this led to significant U.S. involvement in the canal and its eventual handover to Panama in 1999.\nThe canal\u2019s role in global politics and its strategic importance in times of conflict and peace cannot be overstated, making it a focal point in international relations.\n\nEnvironmental Considerations\n\nThe Panama Canal also has environmental dimensions.\n\nWhile it promotes fuel efficiency and reduces emissions through shorter routes, it poses ecological challenges, including water resource management and potential impacts on local biodiversity.\nBalancing the operational demands of the canal with environmental sustainability is an ongoing challenge.\n\nRead: The Panama Canal is running dry\n\nChallenges and Future Outlook\n\nDespite its significance, the Panama Canal faces challenges, including competition from alternative routes like the Suez Canal and the potential for new passages opened up by melting Arctic ice.\n\nAdditionally, the increasing size of cargo ships and global trade dynamics require continuous adaptation and expansion of the canal\u2019s infrastructure.\n\nImpact of Trade Disruptions\n\nGlobal implications: Increases in energy and food prices:\n\nProlonged interruptions, particularly in container shipping, pose a direct threat to global supply chains, raising the risk of delayed deliveries and higher costs.\nEnergy prices are witnessing a surge as gas transits are discontinued, directly impacting energy supplies, especially in Europe.\nThe crisis is also impacting global food prices, with longer distances and higher freight rates potentially cascading into increased costs.\nDisruptions in grain shipments from Europe, the Russian Federation, and Ukraine pose risks to global food security, affecting consumers and lowering the prices paid to producers.\n\nOther general implications:\n\nEconomic Slowdown: Trade disruptions can lead to reduced economic growth, inflation, and increased unemployment.\nSupply Chain Challenges: Disruptions can expose vulnerabilities in global supply chains, leading to delays, increased costs, and reduced efficiency.\nShift in Trade Patterns: Disruptions often force companies to diversify supply chains and explore new markets, leading to shifts in trade patterns.\nImpact on Small Businesses: Small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) are particularly vulnerable to trade disruptions due to their limited resources.\nImpact on developing countries: Developing countries are particularly vulnerable to these disruptions.\nStrategies for Mitigating Trade Disruptions\nDiversification of Supply Chains: Businesses are increasingly looking to diversify suppliers and logistics options to reduce dependency on a single source or route.\nInvestment in Technology: Investing in technology like AI, blockchain, and IoT can enhance supply chain resilience by improving visibility and predictive capabilities.\nStrategic Stockpiling: Maintaining strategic reserves of essential goods can help cushion the impact of disruptions.\nFlexible Business Models: Adopting more flexible business models, including localizing certain operations, can help companies adapt to changing scenarios.\nPolicy Measures: Governments can play a crucial role by creating policies that support trade resilience, such as trade agreements that include provisions for emergencies.\nConclusion\n\nGlobal trade disruptions, while challenging, also offer opportunities for companies and countries to innovate, adapt, and build more resilient systems. By understanding the causes and impacts of these disruptions, and by implementing effective strategies, the global economy can better withstand future shocks. In an era where change is the only constant, agility, and adaptability in global trade practices are not just beneficial but essential for long-term sustainability and growth.\n\n-Article by Swathi Satish"

President Roosevelt first used the term \u201cUnited Nations\u201d to refer to the countries that were joined against Germany, Japan, and Italy. On January 1, 1942, 26 countries signed the Declaration in Washington, DC, emphasizing their commitment to the objectives of the Atlantic Charter.\nDumbarton Oaks Proposal (1944-1945): The ideas of the United Nations were established at a meeting convened at Dumbarton Oaks for the foundation of the organisation. On October 7, 1944, the Big Four (China, the United Kingdom, the Soviet Union, and the United States) made a recommendation to all UN governments regarding the structure of the world organisation. Yet, there was still a dispute on the issue of the Security Council vote.\nTo that end, Roosevelt, Churchill, and Stalin met at Yalta and declared the subject resolved on February 11, 1945, summoning the San Francisco Conference.\nThe leaders assembled at the San Francisco Conference (United Nations Conference on International Organization) on April 25, 1945, to determine the ultimate framework of the United Nations Charter.\nThe actual UN Charter was ratified on October 24, 1945, by the five permanent members and other signing nations.\nComponents of the UN\n\nThe primary UN bodies are\n\n\ud83d\udc49 Which year are YOU targeting for success in the IAS/IPS/IFS Exam? \ud83d\ude80\n\n(1) \u21d2 UPSC 2025: Prelims cum Mains\n\n(2) \u21d2 UPSC 2026: Prelims cum Mains\n\n(3) \u21d2 UPSC 2027 Prelims cum Mains\n\nTip: Know more about ClearIAS Courses (Online/Offline)\n\nthe General Assembly,\nthe Security Council,\nthe Economic and Social Council,\nthe Trusteeship Council,\nthe International Court of Justice,\nand the UN Secretariat.\n\nWhen the UN was constituted in 1945, all six were established. Let us discuss all these in detail.\n\nGeneral Assembly\n\nThe primary decision-making, policy-making, and representative body of the UN is the General Assembly.\n\nAt the General Assembly, which is the only UN body with universal representation, there are representatives from each of the 193 UN Member States.\nThe whole UN membership gathers in New York\u2019s General Assembly Hall each September for the annual General Assembly session and general debate, to which many heads of state are invited and participate.\nA two-thirds majority of the General Assembly is necessary to decide on crucial issues like budgetary matters, admission of new members, and questions of peace and security.\nSome decisions are made by a simple majority.\nEach year, the General Assembly elects a president to hold office for a term of one year.\nSix main committees: The First Committee (Disarmament and International Security), the Second Committee (Economic and Financial), the Third Committee (Social, Humanitarian, and Cultural), the Fourth Committee (Special Political and Decolonization), the Fifth Committee (Administrative and Budgetary), and the Sixth Committee can all prepare resolution draughts for the General Assembly (Legal).\nOn each Main Committee and any other body that may be created and on which all Member States have the right to be represented, each Member State may be represented by one person.\nThese committees may also be given advisers, technical advisers, experts, or other people with comparable authority by the member states.\nADDITIONAL COMMITTEES\nThe General Committee: It meets occasionally during each session to assess the accomplishments of the General Assembly and its committees and to suggest ways to accelerate those accomplishments. It is made up of the Chairmen of the six Major Committees, the President of the General Assembly, and the 21 Vice Presidents of the Assembly. Vice-Presidents include the Security Council\u2019s five permanent members.\nDisciplinary Committee: Its duties include vetting the credentials of Member State delegates and reporting to the General Assembly.\nSecurity Council\n\nPer the UN Charter, it is in charge of maintaining global peace and security.\n\nFive permanent members\u2014China, France, Russia, the United Kingdom, and the United States\u2014as well as ten non-permanent members who were chosen for two-year terms by the General Assembly on a regional basis, make up the Security Council\u2019s fifteen members.\nWith the expiration of the terms of Estonia, Niger, St. Vincent and the Grenadines, Tunisia, and Vietnam, the UNSC gained five new non-permanent members in January 2022 (Albania, Brazil, Gabon, Ghana, and the United Arab Emirates).\nWhile Brazil is taking its eleventh turn, Albania is joining for the first time. The UAE has been on the council once, whereas Gabon and Ghana have each served there three times.\nIndia joined the UNSC as a non-permanent member in 2021 and will serve on the body for the next eight years, from 2021 to 2022.\nThe term \u201cveto power\u201d refers to the permanent member\u2019s ability to veto (reject) any Security Council resolution.\nThe five states\u2019 absolute veto power has been viewed as the UN\u2019s least democratic feature.\nAccording to critics, the primary reason for the international delay in war crimes and crimes against humanity is the veto power.\nThe United States, however, resisted joining the UN in 1945 unless it was granted a veto.\nThe League of Nations was ineffective in part because the United States was not a member.\nEconomic and Social Council (ECOSOC)\n\nIt serves as the main organisation for coordination, policy evaluation, policy discourse, and recommendations on issues relating to the economy, society, and the environment. It also oversees the execution of internationally recognized development objectives.\n\nThe General Assembly chose its 54 members for consecutive three-year mandates.\nIt serves as the main forum for reflection, discussion, and creative thinking on sustainable development at the UN.\nThe work of ECOSOC is organized around a yearly subject that has global significance for sustainable development. This guarantees focused attention among the diverse partners of ECOSOC and across the UN development system.\nIt receives reports from nine UN funds and programs, organizes the activities of the 14 UN specialized agencies, ten functional commissions, and five regional commissioners, and makes policy recommendations to the UN system and the Member States.\nTrusteeship Council\n\nUnder Chapter XIII of the UN Charter, it was created in 1945.\n\nTrust territories are non-self-governing areas that have been placed under administrative control by the United Nations Trusteeship Council.\nA League of Nations mandate, or the legal documents containing the internationally agreed-upon terms for managing the region on behalf of the League of Nations, was the legal status for some territories that were passed from one country\u2019s control to another after World War I.\nAfter the League of Nations ceased to exist in 1946, United Nations trust territories took over as the new owners of the remaining League of Nations mandates.\nIt had to oversee the administration of 11 Trust Territories by seven Member States from a global perspective and make sure that the necessary steps were made to get the Territories ready for self-rule and independence.\nAll Trust Territories had achieved independence or self-government by 1994. On November 1st, 1994, the Trusteeship Council ceased operations.\n\nAlso read: UN Millennium Development Goals (MDGs)- Clear IAS\n\nInternational Court of Justice (ICJ)\n\nThe main court of the United Nations is the International Court of Justice. The United Nations Charter established it in June 1945, and it officially got going in April 1946. The Permanent Court of International Justice (PCIJ), which was founded by the League of Nations in 1920, was replaced by the ICJ.\n\nSecretariat\nThe General Assembly appointed the Secretary-General for a five-year term that is renewable to serve as the Organization\u2019s leading administrative official.\nAntonio Guterres has also been named as the ninth UN Secretary-General (UNSG) for a second term commencing on January 1, 2022, and ending on December 31, 2026, by the UNGA.\nInternationally and locally recruited UN employees serve in duty stations and on peacekeeping missions throughout the world.\nFunds and Programs of the UN\n\nThe United Nations system, sometimes known as the \u201cUN family,\u201d is made up of the UN itself (which consists of six main institutions) and several connected programs, funds, and specialized agencies, each of which has its membership, management structure, and financial resources.\n\nUNICEF\nThe United Nations General Assembly established the United Nations Children\u2019s Fund (UNICEF), formerly known as the United Nations International Children\u2019s Emergency Fund, in 1946 to give food and medical treatment to children and mothers in nations devastated by World War II.\nThe mission of UNICEF was expanded in 1950 to include meeting the long-term requirements of children and women worldwide in developing nations.\nThe terms \u201cinternational\u201d and \u201cemergency\u201d were removed from the organization\u2019s name in 1953 when it officially joined the United Nations System, but the abbreviation \u201cUNICEF\u201d was kept.\nExecutive Committee A 36-member board develops policies, endorses initiatives, and supervises operational and financial strategies. The members are chosen by the Economic and Social Council (ECOSOC) of the United Nations, often for terms of three years.\nGovernments and private contributors both contribute to UNICEF.\nThe principal point of distribution for such necessities as vaccines, antiretroviral drugs for children and women with HIV, nutritional supplements, emergency shelters, family reunions, and educational supplies is UNICEF\u2019s Supply Division, which is situated in Copenhagen (Denmark).\n\nUNICEF\u2019s Recent Initiatives:\n\nChildren\u2019s Climate Risk Index\nFirst Global Report on Assistive Technology (GReAT).\nUNFPA\nThe United Nations Agency for Sexual and Reproductive Health is the United Nations Population Fund (UNFPA), formerly known as the United Nations Fund for Population Activities.\nIts mandate is set by the UN Economic and Social Council (ECOSOC).\nThe Sustainable Development Goals for Health (SDG3), education (SDG4), and gender equality are all directly addressed by UNFPA (SDG5)\nA future where every pregnancy is desired, \u201cevery childbirth is safe,\u201d and every young person\u2019s potential is realized is its stated goal.\nIn 2018, UNFPA started working towards three transformative goals that promise to alter the world for every man, woman, and child: ending unmet family planning needs; ending maternal deaths that can be prevented; putting an end to destructive behaviors and gender-based violence.\n\nUNFPA Publication: State of World Population Report\n\nUNDP\n\nThe global development network of the UN is known as the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP).\n\nThe United Nations General Assembly founded UNDP in 1965.\nWith an expanding focus on aiding the least developed nations, it offers developing countries expert advice, training, and grant support.\nRepresentatives from 36 different nations serve on the UNDP Executive Board rotationally.\nIt is exclusively supported by voluntary payments from its member countries.\nThe United Nations Sustainable Development Group (UNSDG), a network of 165 nations that brings together the 40 UN funds, programs, specialized agencies, and other organizations striving to implement the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development, places a prominent focus on UNDP.\n\nUNDP Publication:\u00a0 Human Development Index\n\nUNEP\n\nA worldwide environmental authority, the United Nations Environment Programme (UN Environment) encourages the consistent application of the environmental dimension of sustainable development within the framework of the United Nations.\n\nFollowing the United Nations Conference on the Human Environment (Stockholm Conference) in June 1972, it was established by the UN General Assembly. To evaluate climate change based on the most recent scientific findings, UNEP and the World Meteorological Organization (WMO) founded the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) in 1988.\n\nThe UNEP has been instrumental in the creation of global environmental agreements ever since its founding (MEAs). UNEP now hosts the secretariats for the following nine MEAs:\n\nConvention on Biological Diversity (CBD)\nConvention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora (CITES)\nConvention on the Conservation of Migratory Species of Wild Animals (CMS)\nVienna Convention for the Protection of the Ozone Layer\nMinamata Convention on Mercury\nBasel Convention on the Control of Trans-boundary Movements of Hazardous Wastes and Their Disposal\nStockholm Convention on Persistent Organic Pollutants\nRotterdam Convention on the Prior Informed Consent Procedure for Certain Hazardous Chemicals and Pesticides in International Trade\n\nHeadquarters: Nairobi, Kenya\n\nPublications\n\n\u2018Making Peace with Nature\u2019 report\nEmission Gap Report\nAdaptation Gap Report\nGlobal Environment Outlook\nFrontiers\nInvest in Healthy Planet\nMajor Campaigns:\nBeat Pollution\nUN75\nWorld Environment Day\nWild for Life.\nUnited Nations Environment Assembly\nThe UN Environment Program is overseen by the United Nations Environment Assembly (UNEA).\nIt is the highest-level environmental decision-making body in the world.\nIt meets every two years to establish priorities for international environmental legislation and formulate global environmental strategies.\nDuring the United Nations Conference on Sustainable Development, popularly known as RIO+20, it was established in June 2012.\nUN-Habitat\n\nThe United Nations program striving towards a better urban future is called United Nations Human Settlements Programme (UN-Habitat).\n\nIts goal is to advance the development of human settlements in a way that is socially and environmentally responsible and to ensure that everyone has access to an appropriate shelter.\nAs a result of the First UN Conference on Human Settlements and Sustainable Urban Development (Habitat I), which took place in 1976 in Vancouver, Canada, it was created in 1978.\nThe Habitat Agenda\u2019s dual objectives were established at the 1996 Istanbul, Turkey-hosted Habitat II conference; adequate housing for everyone and the creation of environmentally friendly human settlements on an urbanising planet.\nHabitat III, the third United Nations Conference on Housing and Sustainable Urban Development, took place in Quito, Ecuador, in 2016. It provided more information on SDG Goal 11: \u201cMake cities and human settlements inclusive, secure, resilient, and sustainable.\u201d\nThe headquarters of UN-Habitat is located at the United Nations Headquarters in Nairobi, Kenya.\nThe UN-Habitat recently highlighted problems with Jaipur city, including multi-hazard vulnerabilities, poor mobility, and a Green-Blue economy, and has developed a strategy to improve sustainability in the city.\nWFP\n\nThe World Food Programme (WFP) is the top humanitarian organization, saving and transforming lives while providing food aid in times of need and collaborating with local communities to promote nutrition and foster resilience.\n\nThe FAO (Food and Agricultural Organization) and the United Nations General Assembly created the World Food Program in 1963.\nThe report is the Global Network Against Food Crises\u2019s signature work (GNAFC). This is made possible by the Food Security Information Network (FSIN), a worldwide project co-sponsored by the FAO, WFP, and the International Food Policy Research Institute (IFPRI).\nIndia and the WFP inked a contract in February 2022 for the distribution of 50,000 MT of wheat that India agreed to supply to Afghanistan as humanitarian aid.\n\nWFP Initiatives:\n\nShare the Meal\nGlobal Report on Food Crisis\nUN Specialized Agencies\n\nThe United Nations specialized agencies are independent businesses that collaborate with the UN. Via negotiations, all were brought into a relationship with the UN. Some were around before the First World War. Some of them had ties to the League of Nations. The UN and other entities were both virtually simultaneously founded. To address new demands, the UN formed others.\n\nThe UN Charter permits the establishment of specialized agencies in Articles 57 and 63.\n\nFAO\nThe Food and Agricultural Organization (FAO) was established in 1945 at the first meeting of the newly formed United Nations in Quebec City, Canada.\nThe FAO is a specialized agency of the UN that directs global initiatives to end hunger.\nThe FAO is a source of expertise and information that aids transitioning developing nations in modernizing and improving their methods for farming, forestry, and fishing to ensure everyone has access to a healthy diet and food security.\nICAO\nThe International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) was founded in 1944 as a specialized UN agency per the Chicago Agreement.

This article delves into the intricacies of political party systems, exploring the types of parties that exist and examining the global landscape of party politics.\n\nPolitical parties are easily one of the most visible institutions in a democracy as for most ordinary citizens parties represent democracy.\n\nThe history of political parties is a tale of adaptation and evolution. From early factions in ancient Rome to the birth of modern political parties in 17th-century England and the development of multiparty systems in the 20th century, the concept of political parties has continually transformed to meet the needs of changing political landscapes.\n\nToday, political parties play a central role in representative democracies worldwide, representing diverse interests and shaping political history.\n\nTable of Contents\n\nHistory of political parties\nThe Role of Political Parties\nTypes of Political Party Systems\nThe Global Party System\nChallenges and Future\nConclusion\nHistory of political parties\n\nThe history of political parties is a complex and dynamic narrative that evolved over centuries in response to changing political, social, and economic circumstances.\n\nThe emergence of political parties can be traced back to the development of modern representative democracies and the evolving nature of political power.\n\n\ud83d\udc49 Which year are YOU targeting for success in the IAS/IPS/IFS Exam? \ud83d\ude80\n\n(1) \u21d2 UPSC 2025: Prelims cum Mains\n\n(2) \u21d2 UPSC 2026: Prelims cum Mains\n\n(3) \u21d2 UPSC 2027 Prelims cum Mains\n\nTip: Know more about ClearIAS Courses (Online/Offline)\n\nAncient Greece: In the city-states of ancient Greece, early forms of political organization and debate existed, but these did not resemble the modern concept of political parties. Instead, political decisions were often made by direct participation in assemblies.\nRoman Republic: The Roman Republic had factions and political groups, such as the Populares and Optimates, representing different classes and interests. However, these were not organized political parties with distinct platforms.\n\nDevelopment of Parliamentary Systems:\n\nThe roots of modern political parties can be traced to 17th-century England. During the reign of Charles II, conflicts arose between the Crown and Parliament, leading to the emergence of two factions: the Whigs and the Tories.\n\nWhigs: Represented urban interests, merchants, and support for parliamentary power.\nTories: Supported royal authority and the interests of the monarchy.\nThe Glorious Revolution saw the ascension of William of Orange to the English throne. This event marked a shift towards constitutional monarchy and parliamentary supremacy.\nThe Whigs and Tories continued to evolve, with the Whigs aligning with the principles of constitutional monarchy and parliamentary sovereignty.\n\nBirth of Modern Political Parties:\n\nThe early American political system did not initially have political parties as envisioned in the modern sense. However, during the debate over the ratification of the U.S. Constitution, two factions emerged:\n\nFederalists: Advocated for a strong central government and the ratification of the Constitution.\nAnti-Federalists: Opposed a strong central government without a Bill of Rights.\n\nThe first political parties, the Federalist Party and the Democratic-Republican Party, formed in the early 19th century.\n\nThe Democratic-Republicans, led by Thomas Jefferson, eventually split into the Democratic Party and the Whig Party.\nJacksonian Era: The Democratic Party, led by Andrew Jackson, and the Whig Party dominated U.S. politics during this period.\n\nIndustrialization brought about significant social and economic changes, leading to the rise of socialist and labor parties in Europe.\n\nIn the 19th century, social and economic changes led to the rise of reform movements advocating for workers\u2019 rights, women\u2019s suffrage, and other social causes.\nLabour unions and workers\u2019 parties emerged, advocating for workers\u2019 rights and social justice.\nThe Role of Political Parties\n\nPolitical parties are organized groups that seek to influence government policies and gain political power through the election of their candidates to public office.\n\nParties play a crucial role in aggregating diverse interests, formulating policy platforms, mobilizing voters, and providing a link between citizens and the government.\n\nFunctions of Political Parties:\n\nRepresentation: Parties represent the interests and ideologies of different segments of society.\nPolicy Formulation: Parties develop and promote policy agendas, reflecting the values and priorities of their constituents.\nMobilization: Parties mobilize voters, raising political awareness and participation.\nRecruitment of Leaders: Parties identify and groom political leaders for public office.\nLegitimacy: Parties contribute to the political system\u2019s legitimacy by offering voters a choice and fostering political stability.\nTypes of Political Party Systems\n\nPolitical party systems are categorized based on the number of significant parties and the degree of competition within a political landscape.\n\nSingle-Party System:\n\nA single-party system exists when only one political party is legally allowed to hold power.\nLimited political pluralism, restricted opposition, and dominance of a single ideology.\n\nTwo-Party System:\n\nIn a two-party system, two major political parties dominate the electoral landscape, with one of them typically forming the government.\nModerate political competition, a tendency toward centrist policies, and winner-takes-all electoral systems.\n\nMulti-Party System:\n\nA multi-party system features several political parties competing for power, with no single party consistently winning a majority.\nGreater political diversity, coalition governments, and proportional representation electoral systems.\n\nDominant-Party System:\n\nA dominant-party system occurs when multiple parties exist, but one party consistently holds power.\nPeriodic competitive elections, but the dominant party maintains a stronghold on governance.\n\nMulti-Party Coalition System:\n\nThis system emerges when no single party secures a majority, necessitating the formation of coalitions among multiple parties to govern.\nFrequent coalition-building, policy compromises, and fluid alliances.\n\nRead: Coalition governments in India\n\nThe Global Party System\n\nPolitical party systems vary significantly across countries, reflecting historical, cultural, and institutional factors.\n\nUnited States:\n\nTwo-Party Dominance: The United States operates under a two-party system, with the Democratic and Republican Parties dominating national politics.\nIdeological Diversity: Within each major party, there is a spectrum of ideological positions, contributing to a nuanced political landscape.\n\nUnited Kingdom:\n\nTwo-Party System: While the UK historically had a two-party system (Conservatives and Labour), the emergence of the Liberal Democrats and other parties has added complexity.\nCoalition Governments: The UK has experienced coalition governments, notably during periods of proportional representation.\n\nGermany:\n\nMulti-Party System: Germany operates under a multi-party system, with the Christian Democratic Union (CDU) and Social Democratic Party (SPD) being major players.\nProportional Representation: The German electoral system promotes the representation of multiple parties in the Bundestag.\n\nIndia:\n\nMulti-Party System: India has a multi-party system, with the Indian National Congress (INC) and the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) being two major national parties.\nRegional Parties: Regional parties play a significant role in state politics, contributing to the complexity of the Indian party system.\n\nChina:\n\nSingle-Party System: The People\u2019s Republic of China operates as a single-party system under the control of the Chinese Communist Party (CCP).\nAuthoritarian Characteristics: The CCP maintains a dominant role in governance, limiting political pluralism.\n\nSouth Africa:\n\nMulti-Party System: South Africa operates under a multi-party system, with the African National Congress (ANC) historically being the dominant party.\nDemocratic Transition: Post-apartheid, South Africa underwent a democratic transition, leading to increased party diversity.\nChallenges and Future\nPolarization: Growing ideological polarization can contribute to political gridlock and hinder effective governance.\nPopulism: The rise of populist movements challenges established party structures and norms.\n\nFuture Trends\n\nDigital Politics: The impact of technology on political communication, campaigning, and mobilization is likely to reshape party dynamics.\nGlobalization: Parties will increasingly grapple with the challenges and opportunities presented by globalization, affecting issues like trade, immigration, and international cooperation.\nConclusion\n\nPolitical party systems are dynamic entities that evolve in response to societal changes, geopolitical shifts, and ideological developments. Understanding the types of party systems and the diverse nature of political parties is crucial for analyzing the complexities of democratic governance worldwide. As countries continue to navigate the challenges of the 21st century, the role and structure of political parties will remain central to shaping the political landscape.\n\nRelated articles:\u00a0Freebies politics; Pressure groups\n\n-Article by Swathi Satish"

The 2nd summit focussed on sharing with countries of the Global South the key outcomes achieved in various G20 meetings throughout India\u2019s Presidency.\n\nThe VoGS Summit is an Indian initiative that has been designed to provide a common platform for the countries of the Global South to share their perspectives and priorities on several major issues.\n\nIt aims to find solutions for common challenges faced by developing countries through talks.\n\nTable of Contents\n\nGlobal south\nHistory of Global South\nBrandt line\nG77\nConclusion\nGlobal south\n\nThe term \u201cGlobal South\u201d refers to a grouping of countries or regions located primarily in the southern hemisphere, which are often characterized by lower income levels, less industrialization, and different social, political, and economic challenges compared to the more economically developed countries in the northern hemisphere, often referred to as the \u201cGlobal North.\u201d\n\n\ud83d\udc49 Which year are YOU targeting for success in the IAS/IPS/IFS Exam? \ud83d\ude80\n\n(1) \u21d2 UPSC 2025: Prelims cum Mains\n\n(2) \u21d2 UPSC 2026: Prelims cum Mains\n\n(3) \u21d2 UPSC 2027 Prelims cum Mains\n\nTip: Know more about ClearIAS Courses (Online/Offline)\n\nThe considerations related to the Global South that make them a grouping are:\n\nEconomic Disparities: Countries in the Global South generally face economic challenges, including lower per capita income, higher levels of poverty, and limited access to resources. Many of these nations rely heavily on agriculture, and there may be a lack of economic diversification.\nDevelopment Challenges: The Global South is often characterized by challenges related to development, including inadequate infrastructure, healthcare, and education. Access to basic services and social development indicators may be lower compared to the Global North.\nGlobalization and Dependency: The Global South is often seen as having a history of being economically and politically dependent on the Global North. This dependency can manifest through trade relationships, international debt, and global economic structures.\nColonial Legacy: The historical legacy of colonization has had a lasting impact on many countries in the Global South. Former colonies often continue to grapple with the social, economic, and political consequences of colonial rule.\nCultural Diversity: The Global South is culturally diverse, with a rich tapestry of languages, religions, traditions, and ethnicities. This diversity is often a source of strength and resilience for these regions.\nGeopolitical Considerations: The term Global South is also used in geopolitical discussions to refer to a bloc of nations that often share common positions on issues such as trade, climate change, and development assistance in international forums.\nGlobal South-South Cooperation: Some countries in the Global South have engaged in South-South cooperation, a form of collaboration where developing nations work together to address common challenges. This cooperation involves the exchange of resources, knowledge, and technology among countries in the southern hemisphere.\nChallenges and Opportunities: While the Global South faces numerous challenges, there are also opportunities for growth and development. Some nations in these regions have experienced economic success, improved social indicators, and increased influence on the global stage.\nEnvironmental Issues: The Global South is often disproportionately affected by environmental challenges, including climate change, deforestation, and loss of biodiversity. These issues can have severe consequences for communities that are heavily dependent on natural resources.\nRising Influence: In recent years, some countries in the Global South, particularly in Asia, have experienced rapid economic growth and increased geopolitical influence. This has led to shifts in the global balance of power.\nHistory of Global South\n\nGlobal South is intertwined with the broader historical processes of colonialism, decolonization, economic development, and global power dynamics.\n\nColonial Era (15th\u201320th centuries): The colonial era marked a period of European exploration, conquest, and colonization, during which European powers established empires in Africa, Asia, and the Americas.\n\nThe exploitation of resources forced labor, and the imposition of European cultural and political systems had lasting impacts on the societies of the colonized regions.\n\nDecolonization (mid-20th century): After World War II, a wave of decolonization occurred as former colonies sought independence. Many countries in Africa and Asia gained sovereignty from European colonial powers.\n\nThe process of decolonization led to the establishment of new nation-states but also left challenges, such as artificial borders, economic dependence, and social divisions.\n\nCold War Era (1945\u20131991): The Cold War rivalry between the United States and the Soviet Union influenced global politics. Some newly independent nations in the Global South aligned with one of the superpowers or pursued non-alignment.\n\nCold War dynamics contributed to geopolitical interventions and conflicts in the Global South, often exacerbating existing challenges.\n\nDevelopment and Economic Challenges: Many countries in the Global South faced economic challenges, including a legacy of underdevelopment, dependence on commodity exports, and debt burdens. Efforts to achieve economic development and reduce poverty became central concerns.\n\nNon-Aligned Movement (1961): The Non-Aligned Movement (NAM) was founded by newly independent countries seeking to remain neutral in the Cold War. The movement aimed to promote economic development, sovereignty, and international cooperation among nations of the Global South.\n\nGlobalization and Economic Shifts (late 20th century): The latter half of the 20th century saw increased globalization, with economic changes impacting countries in the Global South. Structural adjustment programs, trade liberalization, and globalization had mixed effects on different nations.\n\nRise of Emerging Economies (21st century): In the 21st century, certain countries in the Global South, often referred to as emerging economies, experienced rapid economic growth. China, India, Brazil, and others became influential players in the global economy.\n\nBrandt line\n\nThe Brandt Line refers to an imaginary division of the world into the \u201cNorth\u201d and the \u201cSouth\u201d based on economic disparities and development indicators. It was proposed by the German statesman and former Chancellor, Willy Brandt, in the 1980s. The Brandt Line is a visual representation of the economic and developmental divide between the more developed and less developed regions of the world.\n\nG77\n\nThe Group of 77 (G77) is a coalition of developing nations that was established on June 15, 1964.\n\nThe G77 was formed during the first session of the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development (UNCTAD) held in Geneva in 1964.\n\nThe group was formed within the United Nations to promote the collective economic interests of its member countries and to enhance their negotiating capacity on various international issues.\n\nThe G77 has since expanded its membership and plays a significant role in global diplomatic and economic forums.\n\nObjectives: The primary objectives of the G77 are to promote economic cooperation among its member countries, strengthen their negotiating capacity in international forums, and advocate for their common interests, particularly in the context of international economic and development issues.\n\nGlobal South Representation: The G77 represents the interests of developing countries, often referred to as the \u201cGlobal South.\u201d Member countries span various regions, including Africa, Asia, Latin America, and the Middle East.\n\nCooperation and Solidarity: The G77 emphasizes cooperation and solidarity among developing nations. It provides a platform for member countries to collaborate on issues such as trade, development assistance, climate change, and international economic policies.\n\nUnited Nations System: The G77 operates within the United Nations system and is actively involved in UN processes, negotiations, and conferences. It works to amplify the voices of developing nations and seeks to influence international policies to address the needs and concerns of its members.\n\nSouth-South Cooperation: The G77 promotes South-South cooperation, which involves collaboration among countries in the Global South to share resources, knowledge, and technology for mutual development. This approach is seen as an alternative to traditional North-South development models.\n\nAnnual Chairmanship: The G77 operates on a system of annual chairmanship. The chairmanship rotates among the regional groups represented in the G77, allowing different regions to lead the group and advocate for their specific concerns.\n\nGroup of 24 (G24): The G77 is often associated with the Group of 24 (G24), which is a subgroup that focuses on international monetary and financial issues. The G24 represents the interests of developing countries in discussions with institutions such as the International Monetary Fund (IMF) and the World Bank.\n\nThe G77 plays a crucial role in advocating for the interests of developing nations on issues such as trade, debt relief, climate change, sustainable development, and the reform of international institutions.\n\nConclusion\n\nIt\u2019s important to note that the terms \u201cGlobal South\u201d and \u201cGlobal North\u201d are generalizations, and there is considerable diversity within each grouping. Additionally, the terms themselves can be contested, and some argue that they oversimplify complex global dynamics. Nevertheless, the concepts are often used in discussions of global development, international relations, and social justice.\n\n-Article by Swathi Satish"

This includes systems such as antivehicle and antipersonnel mines, which, once activated, operate autonomously based on trigger mechanisms.\nNewer systems employing increasingly sophisticated technology include missile defense systems and sentry systems, which can autonomously detect and engage targets and issue warnings.\nOther examples include loitering munition (also known as suicide, kamikaze, or exploding drone) which contains a built-in warhead (munition) and waits (loiter) around a predefined area until a target is located by an operator on the ground or by automated sensors onboard, and then attacks the target.\nLand and sea vehicles with autonomous capabilities are also increasingly being developed. Those systems are primarily designed for reconnaissance and information gathering but may possess offensive capabilities.\n\nThese systems first emerged in the 1980s; however, their systems functionalities have since become increasingly sophisticated, allowing for, among other things, longer ranges, heavier payloads, and the potential incorporation of artificial intelligence (AI) technologies.\n\nPotential Advantages:\n\nProponents argue that LAWS could have potential advantages, such as faster decision-making, reduced human casualties, and improved precision in targeting. Advocates also suggest that autonomous systems could be programmed to adhere strictly to international humanitarian law.\n\nRole of AI in LAWS\n\nAutonomous weapons systems require \u201cautonomy\u201d to perform their functions in the absence of direction or input from a human actor.\n\nArtificial intelligence is not a prerequisite for the functioning of autonomous weapons systems, but, when incorporated, AI could further enable such systems.\nIn other words, not all autonomous weapons systems incorporate AI to execute particular tasks.\nAutonomous capabilities can be provided through pre-defined tasks or sequences of actions based on specific parameters, or through using artificial intelligence tools to derive behavior from data, thus allowing the system to make independent decisions or adjust behavior based on changing circumstances.\nArtificial intelligence can also be used in an assistance role in systems that are directly operated by a human.\nFor example, a computer vision system operated by a human could employ artificial intelligence to identify and draw attention to notable objects in the field of vision, without having the capacity to respond to those objects autonomously in any way.\nEthical and Legal Concerns\n\nThe development and deployment of LAWS have raised significant ethical and legal concerns.\n\nCritics argue that the lack of direct human control raises questions about accountability, responsibility, and the ability to ensure compliance with international humanitarian law, including the principles of distinction, proportionality, and military necessity.\nThe complex nature of AI algorithms and the unpredictability of conflict scenarios pose risks of unintended consequences.\nThere is a global worry about the potential for LAWS to make incorrect decisions, target civilians, or escalate conflicts without appropriate human oversight.\nConcerns have been raised about the dehumanization of warfare when lethal decisions are delegated to machines. It is argued that removing the human element from decision-making may result in a lack of empathy, accountability, and ethical judgment.\n\nSeveral campaigns, such as the Campaign to Stop Killer Robots, have emerged to advocate for a ban on fully autonomous weapons. These campaigns emphasize the need for human control over critical decisions in the use of force and the prevention of the development of weapons that could operate without meaningful human control.\n\nGlobal Stand on LAWS\n\nThe international community has engaged in discussions on LAWS at various forums.\n\nThese discussions include the Convention on Certain Conventional Weapons (CCW) within the framework of the United Nations. Some countries and non-governmental organizations advocate for a preemptive ban on fully autonomous weapons, while others argue for a more cautious and controlled approach to their development and use.\n\nSince 2018, United Nations Secretary-General Ant\u00f3nio Guterres has maintained that lethal autonomous weapons systems are politically unacceptable and morally repugnant and has called for their prohibition under international law.\n\nNational Policies\n\nSome countries have taken steps to address concerns related to LAWS through national policies. For example, some have declared their commitment to maintaining meaningful human control over weapon systems, while others have expressed support for the development of LAWS with appropriate safeguards.\n\nChina, Israel, Russia, South Korea, the United Kingdom, and the United States are investing heavily in the development of various autonomous weapons systems, while Australia, Turkey, and other countries are also making investments.\n\nIn 2018, Austria, Brazil, and Chile recommended launching negotiations on a legally binding instrument to ensure meaningful human control over the critical functions of weapons systems.\n\nIndia\u2019s stand on LAWS\n\nAt the UN General Assembly in October 2013, India supported a proposal to begin multilateral talks on lethal autonomous weapons systems.\n\nIndia is exhibiting a practical attitude towards international affairs by maneuvering in the domain of autonomous weaponry.\n\nIndia understands the value of AI in national defense plans despite the UNGA rejecting its proposal for autonomous weapons, particularly in light of the country\u2019s military superiority over China.\nDespite its capabilities in AI, India admits it is not as advanced as China and the United States when it comes to using this technology for military purposes.\nConclusion\n\nThe ongoing debates surrounding Lethal Autonomous Weapons Systems highlight the need for careful consideration of ethical, legal, and security implications.\n\nBalancing the potential benefits of autonomous technologies with the need for accountability and adherence to international humanitarian law remains a complex challenge for the global community.\n\nRelated articles:\u00a0Weapons of Mass Destruction; Directed Energy Weapons\n\n-Article by Swathi Satish"

Remains of that canal may now be discovered in Geneva, which is close to Suez.\n\nThe Canal was left for sand deposition and a dam was formed, thus, isolating the Bitter Lakes; which suffered from the absence of maintenance for a very long time, from the Red Sea.\n\nIn 610 BCE Necho II (also known as Nek\u00f3s) did everything in his tried to re-dig the Canal, but only managed to connect the Bitter Lakes to the Nile failing to connect them to the Red Sea.\nIn 510 BCE, Darius I reconnected the Bitter Lakes and the Nile, but, like his predecessor, failed to connect them to the Red Sea except via small canals not suitable for navigation except during the flood season of the Nile.\nIn 285 BCE Ptolemy II managed to overcome all the challenges that faced his predecessors as he restored navigation to the entire Canal after successfully digging the part between the Red Sea and the Bitter Lakes to replace the small unnavigable canals.\nin 98 CE, during the reign of the Roman Emperor Trajan, there was a need for the Canal for trade purposes so he re-dug it. It started in Cairo; at the bay mouth, and ended in El-Abbasa where it connects to the old Nile branch in Zagazig.\nThe Byzantines (circa 400 CE) neglected the Canal completely until it became unnavigable due to sand deposition.\nIn 641 CE Amr Ibn El-A\u2019as reopened the Canal for navigation and named it the Amir El-Mo\u2019menin Canal.\nBy 760 CE, the Abbasid Caliph, Abu Jafar El-Mansur, ordered the Canal be filled with sand so as not to be used in the transport of supplies to the people of Mecca and Medina who rebelled against his rule.\n\nThe navigation between the two seas stopped for approximately eleven centuries during which land routes were used to transport Egyptian trade.\n\nIn 1820, Mohammad Ali Pasha ordered part of the Canal be fixed for irrigation purposes of the lands between El-Abbasa and El-Qassasin.\n\nThe Suez Canal\u2019s actual history starts with the First Concession; and the other concessions that followed to the groundbreaking then the completion of the digging on August 18th, 1869, and the inauguration ceremony on November 17th, 1869.\n\nThe first concession, which granted Ferdinand de Lesseps the right to establish a company responsible for digging the Suez Canal, was issued on November 30th, 1854.\nThe second concession was issued on January 5th, 1856.\nThe Universal Company of the Maritime Canal of Suez was established on December 5th, 1858.\nThe digging started on April 25th, 1859 despite objections from Britain and the Ottoman Empire.\n\nThe Suez Canal was initially owned and operated by the Suez Canal Company, which was a French and Egyptian venture. However, due to financial difficulties, Egypt sold its shares to the United Kingdom in 1875, making the canal an international waterway.\n\n1882: The British successfully managed to occupy Egypt after the Urabi Revolt, seized the Company\u2019s facilities, and stopped traffic through it for some time.\n\n1888: The Constantinople Convention- An agreement was made between France, Austria, Hungary, Spain, Britain, Italy, the Netherlands, Russia, and Turkey to draw a final system that ensured freedom of navigation through the Suez Canal.\n\nSuez crisis\n\nThe Suez Crisis was a pivotal event in the canal\u2019s history.\n\nIn 1956, Egyptian President Gamal Abdel Nasser nationalized the canal, leading to a crisis involving the United Kingdom, France, and Israel.\n\nThe crisis resulted in military intervention by these nations, but due to international pressure, they eventually withdrew.\n\nThe United Nations Emergency Force (UNEF) was deployed to supervise the withdrawal of foreign troops, and Egypt resumed control of the canal.\n\nRead:\u00a0Crossroads 1960-1970\n\nSix-Day War (1967) and Closure\n\nDuring the Six-Day War in 1967, the Suez Canal was closed by Egypt, and its blockade continued for several years. The closure significantly impacted global shipping and trade routes.\n\nThe Suez Canal was reopened in 1975, and efforts have been made to modernize and expand its capacity.\n\nIn 2015, Egypt inaugurated the New Suez Canal, a major expansion project aimed at increasing the canal\u2019s capacity and allowing for the simultaneous passage of ships in opposite directions.\n\nThe Ever Given mishap\n\nIn March 2021, the large container ship Ever Given became lodged across the Suez Canal, blocking one of the world\u2019s most crucial waterways for nearly a week.\n\nThe blockage of the Suez Canal had a significant impact on global trade, as the canal was a key route for approximately 12% of the world\u2019s trade. Hundreds of vessels, including container ships, oil tankers, and other cargo vessels, were stranded on both ends of the canal, waiting for the Ever Given to be refloated.\n\nThe incident highlighted the vulnerabilities of global shipping routes and supply chains. It prompted discussions about the need for improved navigation and safety measures in key waterways. The crisis also led to increased scrutiny of large container vessels and the potential risks associated with their size.\n\nImportance of the Suez Canal\n\nThe Suez Canal is strategically located, providing a direct and time-saving maritime route between Europe and the Indian Ocean.\n\nShips using the canal avoid the lengthy and perilous journey around the southern tip of Africa, known as the Cape of Good Hope, which significantly reduces transit times and fuel consumption.\n\nApproximately 12% of the world\u2019s trade passes through the Suez Canal. It is a major conduit for container ships, bulk carriers, oil tankers, and other vessels, facilitating the transportation of goods, commodities, and energy resources between major global markets.\nIt allows ships to cut transit times and operational costs compared to alternative routes. For example, a voyage from Europe to India or East Asia through the Suez Canal is significantly shorter than the alternative route around Africa.\nThe Suez Canal is a key route for the transportation of energy resources, especially oil and liquefied natural gas (LNG).\nIs there a need for an alternate route?\n\nDespite its importance, the Suez Canal\u2019s vulnerability to blockages, accidents, or geopolitical tensions underscores the need for alternative routes and diversification in global maritime trade.\n\nThe Suez Canal is a narrow passage, and incidents like ship groundings or blockages can disrupt the flow of maritime traffic. The Ever Given incident in 2021 highlighted the potential risks associated with relying heavily on a single key waterway.\nGeopolitical factors, such as conflicts or changes in governance in the region, can impact the security and accessibility of the Canal.\nDiversifying trade routes by developing and utilizing alternative pathways, such as the Northern Sea Route (Arctic route) or the Cape of Good Hope, can enhance resilience in the face of unforeseen disruptions.\nBen Gurion Canal Project\n\nNamed after Israel\u2019s founding father, David Ben-Gurion, the idea originated in the 1960s as an alternative maritime route connecting the Red Sea with the Mediterranean, bypassing the Suez Canal.\n\nThe idea is to cut a canal through the Israeli-controlled Negev Desert from the tip of the Gulf of Aqaba \u2013 the eastern arm of the Red Sea that juts into Israel\u2019s southern tip and south-western Jordan \u2013 to the Eastern Mediterranean coast.\nIt will create an alternative to the Egyptian-controlled Suez Canal that starts from the western arm of the Red Sea and passes to the southeastern Mediterranean through the northern Sinai Peninsula.\n\nThere are suggestions that Israel wants to seize control of Gaza and destroy Hamas to take advantage of the canal\u2019s economic potential.\n\nThe Ben Gurion Canal Project would significantly affect geopolitics and international trade if it were to be constructed. By avoiding the Suez Canal and opening up a new maritime route between Europe and Asia, it would lessen Egypt\u2019s influence over international commerce.\n\nRead:\u00a0Global Trade Disruptions\n\n-Article by Swathi Satish"

It is a landmark arms control agreement with several key provisions. Read here to gather detailed information on the treaty.\n\nThe PTBT requires parties to abstain from carrying out nuclear explosions in any environment where such explosions cause radioactive debris outside the limits of the State that conducts an explosion.\n\nIn 1954, India made the first proposal calling for an agreement to ban nuclear weapons tests. In 1958, the United States, the Soviet Union, and the United Kingdom began a Conference on the Discontinuance of Nuclear Tests in Geneva, aimed at reaching an agreement on an effectively controlled test ban.\n\nThe Conference did not come to fruition because the sides could not reach an agreement on the issue of verification procedures. On 5 August 1963, the Partial Test Ban Treaty (PTBT) \u2014 also known as the Limited Test Ban Treaty (LTBT) \u2014 was signed in Moscow by the United States, the Soviet Union, and the United Kingdom.\n\nTable of Contents\n\nPartial Test Ban Treaty (PTBT)\nVerification and Compliance\nSignatories of PTBT\nImpact of nuclear tests\nUnderwater nuclear tests\nAtmospheric nuclear tests\nConclusion\nPartial Test Ban Treaty (PTBT)\n\nThe Partial Test Ban Treaty (PTBT), also known as the Limited Test Ban Treaty, is an international treaty that was signed on August 5, 1963 and entered into force on October 10, 1963.\n\nThe PTBT bans all nuclear explosions in three specific environments: the Earth\u2019s atmosphere, outer space, and underwater.\nThese prohibitions were seen as necessary to reduce the global spread of radioactive fallout and the environmental and health risks associated with nuclear testing.\nThe treaty allows for underground nuclear testing, provided that it does not result in the release of radioactive debris into the atmosphere. Underground testing is less environmentally hazardous compared to atmospheric, space, or underwater tests.\nVerification and Compliance\nThe PTBT encouraged signatory states to negotiate additional agreements for verification and monitoring of compliance with the treaty\u2019s provisions.\nThese negotiations led to the 1974 Threshold Test Ban Treaty (TTBT) and the 1976 Peaceful Nuclear Explosions Treaty (PNET), which established specific verification procedures.\n\nWhile the PTBT focused on the limitation of nuclear testing, it did not address nuclear disarmament or the complete prohibition of nuclear weapons. Instead, it contributed to the de-escalation of the arms race between the United States and the Soviet Union during the Cold War.\n\n\ud83d\udc49 Which year are YOU targeting for success in the IAS/IPS/IFS Exam? \ud83d\ude80\n\n(1) \u21d2 UPSC 2025: Prelims cum Mains\n\n(2) \u21d2 UPSC 2026: Prelims cum Mains\n\n(3) \u21d2 UPSC 2027 Prelims cum Mains\n\nTip: Know more about ClearIAS Courses (Online/Offline)\n\nSignatories of PTBT\n\nThe treaty formally went into effect on 10 October 1963. Since then, 123 other states have become party to the treaty. Ten states have signed but not ratified the treaty.\n\nThe PTBT was signed by the United States, the United Kingdom, and the Soviet Union as the three main nuclear-armed states at the time. It was open for accession by other states, and a significant number of countries later joined the treaty.\n\nThe PTBT does not provide for international verification; however, it is understood that each party may do so by its national technical means.\n\nWith the signing of the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty (CTBT) in September 1996, the PTBT became redundant. However, should a PTBT party withdraw from the CTBT, or not sign the CTBT, it would still be bound by the provisions of the PTBT.\n\nImpact of nuclear tests\nUnderwater nuclear tests\n\nUnderwater nuclear tests, which involve the detonation of nuclear devices beneath the surface of the ocean, can have several environmental, geopolitical, and security impacts.\n\nOcean Pollution: Underwater nuclear tests release radioactive materials into the ocean, contaminating the water and potentially impacting marine life. Radioactive isotopes can be transported over long distances by ocean currents.\nMarine Ecosystem Damage: The release of radioactive contaminants can harm marine life and ecosystems. The effects can include genetic mutations in fish and other aquatic species, disruptions in food chains, and long-term damage to biodiversity.\nWater Quality: Nuclear tests can cause a temporary increase in water temperature and a decrease in oxygen levels, which can lead to the death of marine organisms near the test site.\nLong-Term Effects: Radioactive contamination can persist in the environment for extended periods, potentially affecting marine ecosystems and human health over the long term.\nDestruction of Coral Reefs: Underwater nuclear tests can cause significant damage to coral reefs, which are critical marine ecosystems. Shockwaves and radiation from the tests can lead to the bleaching and destruction of coral reefs, affecting marine biodiversity.\nContaminated Seafood: Radioactive contamination from underwater nuclear tests can enter the food chain when marine organisms, such as fish, consume contaminated water and organisms. This contamination can pose health risks to individuals who consume seafood from affected regions.\nAtmospheric nuclear tests\n\nAtmospheric nuclear tests have significant and far-reaching impacts on the atmosphere, environment, and human health. The detonation of nuclear devices releases a tremendous amount of energy, which can lead to various atmospheric effects.\n\nShockwaves and Blast Effects: The explosion of a nuclear device generates shockwaves that travel through the atmosphere. These shockwaves can destroy the ground, including damage to buildings and structures. The energy released during the explosion can also lead to the creation of a powerful fireball, which can cause intense heat and pressure changes in the atmosphere.\nMushroom Cloud Formation: The iconic mushroom-shaped cloud that results from a nuclear explosion is created as a result of the rapid rise of hot air and debris from the blast. This cloud can extend high into the atmosphere, carrying with it radioactive particles and other materials from the ground.\nRadioactive Fallout: Nuclear tests release a variety of radioactive isotopes into the atmosphere. These isotopes can be carried by winds and dispersed over large areas, leading to radioactive fallout. Radioactive fallout can contaminate the environment, affecting soil, water, and vegetation. It can also pose health risks to humans and wildlife.\nElectromagnetic Pulse (EMP): Nuclear explosions can produce electromagnetic pulses that disrupt or damage electronic devices and electrical systems over a wide area. These effects can extend beyond the blast zone and affect communication, transportation, and infrastructure.\nNuclear Winter Hypothesis: The explosion of a large number of nuclear weapons, especially in a nuclear conflict, could have a global cooling effect. The debris, dust, and soot released into the atmosphere can block sunlight, leading to a drop in temperatures. This scenario is often referred to as a \u201cnuclear winter,\u201d which could have devastating consequences for agriculture and ecosystems.\nStratospheric Ozone Depletion: Some nuclear tests, especially those involving the detonation of high-altitude nuclear devices, can contribute to the depletion of stratospheric ozone. The release of chlorine and other chemicals from the explosion can lead to reactions that break down ozone molecules, contributing to the thinning of the ozone layer.\nLong-Term Health Effects: Exposure to radioactive fallout and ionizing radiation from nuclear tests can have long-term health effects on individuals, including an increased risk of cancer, birth defects, and other radiation-related illnesses.\nConclusion\n\nThe PTBT is often considered a precursor to the more comprehensive Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons (NPT), which was opened for signature in 1968. The NPT aimed to prevent the spread of nuclear weapons and promote disarmament.\n\nThe Partial Test Ban Treaty represented a significant step toward reducing the environmental and health hazards associated with nuclear testing. It helped limit the global spread of radioactive fallout while allowing for continued nuclear testing in a safer, underground environment.\n\nHowever, it did not address the complete elimination of nuclear weapons, which remains a goal of subsequent arms control and disarmament efforts.\n\nEfforts to reduce the environmental and atmospheric impacts of nuclear testing have led to a significant reduction in such tests since the mid-20th century.\n\n-Article by Swathi Satish"

It conducted nuclear tests during the mid-20th century and maintains a significant nuclear arsenal.\nRussia: As the successor state to the Soviet Union, Russia inherited the Soviet nuclear arsenal. It is one of the two countries with the largest nuclear arsenals globally.\nUnited Kingdom: The United Kingdom developed its nuclear weapons in the 1950s. It maintains a small but powerful nuclear deterrent.\nFrance: France conducted its first nuclear test in 1960 and is one of the five recognized nuclear-armed states under the NPT.\nChina: China conducted its first nuclear test in 1964 and is another recognized nuclear-armed state under the NPT.\nIndia: India conducted its first successful nuclear tests in 1998, declaring itself a nuclear-armed state. It is not a signatory to the NPT.\nPakistan: Pakistan conducted its nuclear tests in 1998, officially declaring itself a nuclear-armed state. It is also not a signatory to the NPT.\nIsrael: Israel is widely believed to possess nuclear weapons, although it has not officially confirmed its nuclear arsenal. It is not a signatory to the NPT.\nNorth Korea (Democratic People\u2019s Republic of Korea): North Korea conducted nuclear tests and declared itself a nuclear-armed state in the early 21st century. Its nuclear program has been a source of international concern.\nSupport and Advocacy\n\nThe CTBT has received widespread support from the international community, non-governmental organizations, and disarmament advocates who see it as a critical step toward nuclear disarmament.\n\nAdvocates emphasize its role in preventing further nuclear testing and curbing the development of advanced nuclear weapons.\n\nCTBT is seen as a crucial step toward nuclear non-proliferation and disarmament. Compared to more than 2000 nuclear tests between 1945 and 1996, less than a dozen tests have been conducted after its adoption.\nThe CTBT acts as a barrier to the further spread of nuclear weapons. If all states ratify and adhere to the treaty, it reduces the incentive for non-nuclear-armed states to seek nuclear weapons and curtails horizontal proliferation.\nA comprehensive ban on nuclear testing contributes to global stability and security. It reduces the likelihood of nuclear arms races and lowers the potential for misunderstandings and miscalculations related to nuclear weapons.\nNuclear testing, particularly in the atmosphere and underground, has had severe environmental and health consequences. Support for the CTBT often stems from concerns about the human and environmental impacts of nuclear testing.\nThe CTBT includes a robust international monitoring and verification system. This system uses seismic, hydroacoustic, infrasound, and radionuclide detection to detect and confirm nuclear explosions. This verifiability is a key factor in gaining support for the treaty.\nThe CTBT hinders advancements in nuclear weapon technology. The prohibition of nuclear testing makes it challenging for states to develop new, more sophisticated nuclear weapons or delivery systems.\nThe CTBT reinforces the global norm against nuclear testing. It signals a commitment by the international community to halt nuclear testing permanently and creates a precedent for other disarmament measures.\nChallenges\n\nThe main challenge to the CTBT is the failure of some key countries, particularly those with nuclear weapons programs, to ratify the treaty. This has prevented its entry into force.\n\nAdditionally, the CTBT faces political and security challenges, as some states remain skeptical about its effectiveness and view it as an impediment to their national security interests.\nNorth Korea has conducted multiple nuclear tests since the CTBT was opened for signature in 1996. These tests, which violate the spirit of the treaty, have created challenges for achieving its entry into force.\nGeopolitical tensions and disputes among states can hamper the progress of disarmament and non-proliferation efforts, including the CTBT. Tensions and mistrust among nuclear-armed states can impede the treaty\u2019s entry into force.\nConclusion\n\nEfforts continue to encourage the ratification of the CTBT by all Annex 2 countries and to promote its entry into force. The CTBT is seen as an important step in preventing nuclear proliferation and advancing global efforts for nuclear disarmament and non-proliferation.\n\nRelated posts:\n\nNuclear Supply Group (NSG)\nWeapons of Mass destruction\nPartial test ban treaty\n\n-Article by Swathi Satish"

With more than 6 million new permanent immigrants (not including Ukrainian refugees), permanent migration to OECD countries reached a record level in 2022.\n\nThis was driven by increases in humanitarian and managed labor migration, along with accompanying family members.\nMore than one in three OECD\u00a0countries registered their highest levels in at least 15\u00a0years, with several countries, such as Canada and the United\u00a0Kingdom, reporting the highest figures on record.\nTemporary labor migration, especially of the seasonal kind, also registered a strong increase.\nThe number of admissions of international students neared 2\u00a0million for the first time.\nAs of June 2023, there were around 4.7 million displaced Ukrainians in OECD countries. Germany, Poland, and the United States host the highest number of refugees from Ukraine in absolute terms, while Estonia, the Czech Republic, and Lithuania have received the highest number as a share of the population.\nIndia has emerged as the top country of origin of new citizens in OECD countries in 2021 with 4 lakh new migrants (excluding students).\nThe report sheds light on the increasing focus on policy responses to climate-induced displacement in recent years. Few OECD countries have explicit policies to address this issue.\n\nImmigrant mothers face disproportionate disadvantages, both compared with immigrant women without children and vis-\u00e0-vis their native-born peers.\n\nWhile migrant women tend to have more children than their native-born peers, their total fertility rate is still below the replacement rate (2.1 children per woman) in most OECD countries.\nThe gap in employment rates between immigrant and native-born mothers is 20 percent.\nIndividual preferences and cultural factors are the main barriers to maternal employment.\nMigrant mothers are often trapped in inactivity due to childcare responsibilities.\nSummary of the report 2023\nPermanent-type migration to OECD\u00a0countries increased by 26% in 2022 compared with 2021. Preliminary figures for 2023 suggest a further increase.\nFamily migration remained the primary category of entry for new permanent-type migrants, representing 40% of all permanent-type migration, while managed labor migration and free mobility both accounted for 21% each.\nThe top origin countries for asylum applicants within the OECD in 2022 were Venezuela (221\u00a0000), Cuba (180\u00a0000), Afghanistan (170\u00a0000) and Nicaragua (165\u00a0000).\nIn more than half of OECD\u00a0countries, the employment rate of migrants is at the highest in more than two decades.\nImmigrant mothers face a disproportionate disadvantage, both compared with immigrant women without children and vis-\u00e0-vis their native-born peers. On average across the OECD, the gap in employment rates between immigrant and native-born mothers is 20\u00a0percentage points.\nLabor Migration Within and Outside India\n\nLabor migration within and outside India is a significant and complex phenomenon driven by economic, social, and demographic factors. India has one of the world\u2019s largest migrant populations, both within the country and in various international destinations.\n\nInternal Labor Migration:\n\nInternal labor migration in India is primarily driven by economic factors. Individuals and families often move from rural areas to urban centers or industrial regions in search of better job opportunities and higher wages.\nBoth skilled and unskilled labor migrate within India. Skilled labor often includes professionals, such as information technology (IT) workers, engineers, and healthcare professionals, who move to major cities for better career prospects. Unskilled labor comprises those who work in construction, agriculture, and other labor-intensive sectors.\nSeasonal or cyclic migration is common, particularly in agriculture. Workers may travel to different regions for short periods to engage in seasonal activities such as planting and harvesting.\nInternal migration often reflects regional economic disparities. People from economically disadvantaged states in the north and east of India often migrate to more prosperous states in the south and west.\nInternal migrants face various challenges, including inadequate housing, social discrimination, and limited access to healthcare and education. Many live in informal settlements and have insecure employment.\n\nThe Indian government has introduced policies and programs to address internal labor migration, such as the One Nation, One Ration Card scheme, which aims to provide portability for food subsidies for migrants.\n\nLabor Migration Outside India:\n\nIndian labor migration to foreign countries includes both skilled and unskilled workers. Skilled professionals, particularly in the IT and healthcare sectors, often move to countries in North America, Europe, and the Middle East. Unskilled laborers may find work in construction, domestic work, or other low-wage industries in the Middle East and Southeast Asia.\nThe Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) countries are significant destinations for Indian labor migrants, particularly from Kerala and other southern states. Workers in these countries often face challenging working conditions.\nInternational migrants from India send substantial remittances back to their families, contributing significantly to the Indian economy.\nIndian migrant workers in some regions face challenges such as exploitation, poor working conditions, and human rights abuses. The government has taken steps to improve the welfare and protection of these migrants.\nThe Indian government has established various programs and initiatives to support its overseas citizens, including the Pravasi Bharatiya Divas and the eMigrate system for overseas employment.\nIndia has an Emigration Act to regulate the recruitment and conditions of migrant workers traveling to certain countries to protect their rights and ensure their well-being.\n\nMany Indian migrants eventually return to India, bringing their skills and experiences. Return migration can contribute to the country\u2019s development.\n\nLabor migration is a complex and multifaceted issue in India, with both internal and international dimensions. The Indian government, along with various state governments, is actively engaged in addressing the challenges and opportunities associated with labor migration to ensure the welfare and protection of its citizens.\n\nAlso read: Brain drain-the great Indian migration\n\nConclusion\n\nThe International Migration Outlook is a valuable resource for policymakers, researchers, international organizations, and civil society groups interested in understanding and managing international migration.

However, the movement gained momentum in the 1970s and 1980s, marked by several significant events.\n\nOperation Blue Star (1984): A major turning point in the Khalistan movement was the Indian government\u2019s military operation to remove Sikh militants from the Golden Temple complex in Amritsar, Punjab, in 1984. This operation, known as \u201cOperation Blue Star,\u201d resulted in significant casualties and damage to the holiest Sikh shrine and inflamed Sikh sentiments.\nAssassination of Prime Minister Indira Gandhi (1984): In retaliation for Operation Blue Star, Prime Minister Indira Gandhi was assassinated by her Sikh bodyguards in October 1984. This event triggered anti-Sikh riots in which thousands of Sikhs were killed in Delhi and other parts of India.\nPunjab Insurgency (1980s): The 1980s saw the rise of Sikh militant groups, such as the Khalistan Commando Force (KCF), Babbar Khalsa, and others, which launched an armed insurgency in Punjab, seeking to establish Khalistan as an independent state.\nThe bombing of Air India (1985): Sikh militants were also blamed for the 1985 bombing of an Air India Boeing 747 flying from Canada to India in which all 329 people on board were killed off the Irish coast.\nOperation Black Thunder (1986-88): Operation Black Thunder-I was conducted by the National Security Guard in April 1986 to flush out extremists and terrorists from Golden Temple Complex, Amritsar. The second part of the operation was code-named Operation Black Thunder-II and was conducted from 10 May to 19 May 1988.\n\nThe Indian government responded to the insurgency with a massive counterinsurgency campaign, which included alleged human rights abuses. This period was marked by violence, disappearances, and alleged extrajudicial killings.\n\nBy the early 1990s, the Sikh insurgency had largely been defeated by the Indian security forces, and many Sikh militant leaders were either killed or captured.\nWhile the armed insurgency waned, residual support for Khalistan continued among some Sikh diaspora communities, primarily in countries like Canada, the United Kingdom, and the United States.\nAdvocacy and lobbying efforts for Khalistan still exist in some Sikh communities abroad.\n\nThe demand for Khalistan is not a mainstream political movement in India today. However, it remains a topic of debate and discussion, particularly among certain sections of the Sikh diaspora.\n\nGeopolitical implications of the Khalistan issue\n\nThe Khalistan issue has significant geopolitical implications, primarily for India and its relations with other nations. It has the potential to affect diplomatic, security, and economic relations, and it remains a complex and sensitive matter for India\u2019s domestic and foreign policy.\n\nIndia\u2019s Territorial Integrity: The Khalistan issue challenges India\u2019s territorial integrity and sovereignty. It is a secessionist movement that seeks to carve out a separate state from Indian territory. The Indian government considers this a threat to its unity and national integrity.\nRelations with Pakistan: Historically, Pakistan has been accused of supporting and sheltering Sikh militants advocating for Khalistan. This has led to tensions and conflicts in India-Pakistan relations. The Khalistan issue has the potential to strain these relations further.\nIndia-Canada relations: The issue has been a bone of contention in the bilateral ties. India has been upset about frequent demonstrations and vandalism by Sikh separatists and their supporters at Indian diplomatic missions in Canada. As of recently, the issue has put a hold on the trade treaty between the countries.\nInternational Diplomacy: India has actively lobbied against any support for the Khalistan movement from foreign governments. The issue can impact India\u2019s diplomatic relations with countries that may be seen as supporting the movement or providing a platform for Khalistani separatists.\nSecurity Concerns: The Khalistan movement has led to security concerns within India, with periodic outbreaks of violence and terrorism. Addressing these concerns can strain India\u2019s resources and attention.\nRole of Diaspora: The Sikh diaspora, particularly in countries like Canada, the United Kingdom, and the United States, has played a role in advocating for Khalistan. This can influence the relationships between India and these countries.\nCounterterrorism Cooperation: India\u2019s concerns about terrorism related to the Khalistan issue may lead to increased cooperation with other nations in counterterrorism efforts.\nHuman Rights Concerns: The handling of the Khalistan issue by Indian authorities has raised human rights concerns. International human rights organizations may engage with the issue, potentially affecting India\u2019s international image.\nDomestic Politics: In India, the Khalistan issue has domestic political implications. It can be used as a political tool by different parties to gain support or criticize the government\u2019s handling of the situation.\nEconomic Ties: The geopolitical implications of the Khalistan issue can extend to economic ties. Trade and economic relations between India and other nations can be influenced by the political stance they take regarding the Khalistan movement.\n\nThe Khalistan issue can shape public opinion in India and other countries. It can lead to protests, demonstrations, and debates on issues related to sovereignty, self-determination, and human rights.\n\nAlso read: Northern Ireland Conflict\n\nWay forward\n\nIt\u2019s important to note that the Sikh community is diverse, and not all Sikhs support the idea of Khalistan. Many Sikhs are committed to the principles of Sikhism, which emphasize peace, equality, and social justice, rather than separatism.\n\nThe Khalistan issue continues to be a sensitive and complex matter with historical, religious, and political dimensions, and it remains a topic of debate and discussion both in India and among Sikh communities abroad.\n\nA peaceful, open, and honest dialogue with all stakeholders, including Sikh community leaders and organizations, is crucial. It\u2019s essential to understand their concerns and aspirations.\n\nIt is equally crucial to address extremist and radicalizing elements within the Sikh community or any other group that may be promoting separatism. Law enforcement agencies should work to prevent radicalization and extremism while respecting individual rights.\n\nWatch the detailed video on the issue here.\n\nRelated article: Five Eyes Alliance\n\n-Article by Swathi Satish"

It provides a comprehensive framework for diplomatic relations to ensure the smooth conduct of diplomacy and the protection of diplomatic agents and missions.\n\nThe convention applies to diplomatic missions, which include embassies and legations, as well as to diplomatic agents, such as ambassadors, charg\u00e9s d\u2019affaires, and other accredited representatives of a sending state in a receiving state.\n\nSome features of the convention are:\n\nInviolability: One of the core principles of the VCDR is the inviolability of diplomatic agents and missions. This means that diplomatic agents and their premises are immune from the jurisdiction of the host state. The receiving state must protect the premises and agents against intrusion, search, and arrest.\nDiplomatic Immunity: Diplomatic agents enjoy various forms of immunity, including personal inviolability, exemption from taxes, and immunity from civil and criminal jurisdiction. This immunity facilitates their role in representing their home country and conducting diplomatic business.\nFreedom of Communication: Diplomatic agents have the right to communicate freely with their government. The VCDR ensures that diplomatic bags, documents, and communications are protected and not to be opened or detained.\nNon-Interference in Internal Affairs: The Vienna Convention explicitly states that diplomatic agents must not interfere in the internal affairs of the host state. They are expected to conduct their diplomatic activities in a manner consistent with the laws and regulations of the receiving state.\nDuty to Respect Laws and Regulations: Diplomatic agents are obligated to respect the laws and regulations of the host state. They must not abuse their privileges and immunities.\nTermination of Diplomatic Relations: The convention outlines the procedures for the termination of diplomatic relations between states, including the withdrawal of a diplomatic agent and the closure of a diplomatic mission.\nConsular Relations: The Vienna Convention on Consular Relations, adopted in 1963, complements the VCDR by establishing rules for consular relations between states. While the VCDR primarily deals with diplomatic missions, the Convention on Consular Relations focuses on consular missions and officers.\nOptional Protocols: The VCDR has optional protocols, which include additional provisions and reservations. States may choose to adopt these protocols to modify certain aspects of the convention to meet their specific needs.\nWhich other laws govern international diplomatic relations?\nVienna Convention on Consular Relations (1963): Similar to the Vienna Convention on Diplomatic Relations, this treaty governs the establishment and conduct of consular relations between states. It outlines the rights and duties of consular officers and the consular premises\u2019 inviolability.\nCustomary International Law: Customary international law consists of long-standing practices and norms accepted by states. It plays a crucial role in diplomatic relations, as some diplomatic practices have developed over centuries and are considered customary.\nBilateral and Multilateral Agreements: Many countries establish diplomatic relations through bilateral agreements, outlining the specifics of their diplomatic ties. Multilateral agreements, such as the United Nations Charter, can also influence diplomatic relations.\nState Sovereignty: The principle of state sovereignty is a foundational concept in international relations. It asserts that each state has the right to conduct its affairs without external interference. This principle is central to diplomatic relations.\nRecognition of States: The recognition of a state\u2019s sovereignty and territorial integrity is a critical aspect of diplomatic relations. States formally recognize each other, indicating their willingness to engage in diplomatic relations.\nCustomary Courtesy: Diplomatic relations are also guided by the principles of good faith and customary courtesy. States are expected to engage with each other respectfully and cooperatively.\nInternational Organizations: Various international organizations, such as the United Nations and regional organizations, play roles in facilitating diplomatic relations, especially in conflict resolution and peacekeeping efforts.\nTreaties and Conventions: International treaties and conventions, such as those related to human rights, environmental protection, and trade, can influence diplomatic relations. States may engage in diplomatic efforts to negotiate, implement, and comply with these agreements.\nDiplomatic Protocols: Specific protocols and guidelines govern diplomatic practices, including the presentation of credentials, the exchange of diplomats, and diplomatic ceremonies. These are often rooted in tradition and international norms.\nWhat is diplomatic immunity?\n\nDiplomatic immunity is a set of privileges and immunities granted to diplomats and foreign diplomatic personnel who are stationed in a foreign country as part of their diplomatic missions.\n\nIt is a fundamental principle of international law and diplomatic practice. The main purpose of diplomatic immunity is to facilitate the conduct of international relations and ensure the safety and security of diplomats.\n\nExemption from Criminal Jurisdiction: Diplomats are immune from the criminal jurisdiction of the host country. They cannot be arrested, detained, or prosecuted for any crime, regardless of its nature, while they are serving in their diplomatic capacity. This immunity extends to their family members and diplomatic staff.\nExemption from Civil Jurisdiction: Diplomats also enjoy immunity from the civil jurisdiction of the host country. They cannot be sued in host country courts for civil matters, such as contractual disputes or property disputes.\nInviolability of Diplomatic Premises: The embassy or diplomatic mission itself is considered inviolable. Host country authorities cannot enter these premises without the permission of the sending state. This ensures that diplomatic correspondence and property remain secure.\nProtection of Personal Inviolability: Diplomats and their families are protected from any form of harassment, including personal searches and taxation. They are also exempt from customs duties and immigration controls.\nDuty to Respect Local Laws: While diplomats enjoy immunity from the host country\u2019s laws, they must respect and adhere to the laws and regulations of the host country. This includes respecting traffic rules and local customs.\nTermination of Diplomatic Immunity: Diplomatic immunity can be waived by the sending state, and it may also be terminated under certain conditions, such as if a diplomat engages in criminal activities that are deemed particularly serious by the host country.\nConsular Immunity: Consular officers, who handle issues related to visas, passports, and services for their country\u2019s citizens in the host country, also enjoy a level of immunity. However, this immunity is typically not as extensive as that granted to diplomatic personnel.\nConclusion\n\nThe Vienna Convention on Diplomatic Relations has been ratified by a large majority of countries and is recognized as customary international law.\n\nIt has greatly contributed to the orderly conduct of international diplomacy, the prevention of diplomatic disputes, and the promotion of peaceful relations between states.\n\nThe Vienna Conventions on Diplomatic and Consular Relations provide a comprehensive framework for diplomatic conduct, but diplomacy also relies on state practice, customary international law, and evolving global norms.\n\nRelated articles:\n\nIndia\u2019s soft power and cultural diplomacy\nForeign Relations Notes\nForeign Relation notes you shouldn\u2019t miss!\nInternational Relations\n\n-Article by Swathi Satish"

            "[META]": "Last updated on October 16, 2023 by ClearIAS Team",
            "[CONTENT]": "The Olympic Games, often referred to as the Olympics, is a global sports event that brings together athletes from around the world to compete in various sports and disciplines. The history of the Olympic Games is rich and spans thousands of years. Read here to learn about the story of the Olympics.\n\nThe proposal from the Organising Committee of the Olympic Games Los Angeles 2028 (LA28) to include five new sports has been accepted by the International Olympic Committee (IOC)\u00a0Session held in Mumbai. Cricket (T20), Baseball/softball, flag football, lacrosse, and squash\u00a0will be in the program at LA28.\n\nThe history of the Games goes back around 3,000 years, to the Peloponnese in Ancient Greece. Sports contests organized at Olympia took place every four years and acquired the name Olympic Games.\n\nThe exact reasons for the birth of the Games are still unknown, as history has become mixed up with mythology.\n\nTable of Contents\n\nAncient Olympics (c. 776 BCE \u2013 394 CE)\nRevival of the Modern Olympics (Late 19th Century)\nWinter Olympics\nModern Olympics\nInternational Olympic Committee\nChallenges\nConclusion\nAncient Olympics (c. 776 BCE \u2013 394 CE)\n\nThe origins of the Olympics can be traced back to ancient Greece, with the first recorded Olympic Games held in Olympia in 776 BCE.\n\nThese ancient games were held every four years in Olympia to honor the Greek god Zeus. They featured athletic competitions, including foot races, discus throwing, and combat sports like wrestling and boxing.\n\n\ud83d\udc49 Which year are YOU targeting for success in the IAS/IPS/IFS Exam? \ud83d\ude80\n\n(1) \u21d2 UPSC 2025: Prelims cum Mains\n\n(2) \u21d2 UPSC 2026: Prelims cum Mains\n\n(3) \u21d2 UPSC 2027 Prelims cum Mains\n\nTip: Know more about ClearIAS Courses (Online/Offline)\n\nIn addition to the Olympics, there were other major Panhellenic Games held in ancient Greece, including the Pythian Games at Delphi and the Isthmian Games at Corinth.\nThese games attracted athletes from various Greek city-states and helped foster a sense of unity among the Greek people.\nThe four-year interval between the Ancient Games editions was named an \u201cOlympiad\u201d, and was used for dating purposes at the time: time was counted in Olympiads rather than years.\n\nThere were originally three main criteria for participating in the ancient Olympic Games.\n\nThe athlete had to be male, of Greek origin, and freeborn. Women (exceptions were made for owners of horses), slaves, and foreigners were excluded.\nAfter the conquest of Greece by Rome in 146 BC, the Romans were able to join the Greek athletes.\n\nThe Olympic Games continued for several centuries but declined during the Roman period. The games were banned by the Roman Emperor Theodosius I in 394 CE, marking the end of the ancient Olympics.\n\nRevival of the Modern Olympics (Late 19th Century)\n\nThe idea of reviving the Olympic Games was proposed by Pierre de Coubertin, a French educator, in the late 19th century.\n\nHe believed that the Olympics could promote international understanding and goodwill through athletic competition.\nThe International Olympic Committee (IOC) was founded in 1894, and the first modern Olympic Games were held in Athens in 1896.\n\nThe modern Olympics quickly gained popularity and expanded to include various sports and events.\n\nWomen competed for the first time at the 1900 Games in Paris. Of a total of 997 athletes, 22 women competed in five sports: tennis, sailing, croquet, equestrianism and golf.\nSince 1991, any new sport seeking to join the Olympic program must have women\u2019s competitions.\nWith the addition of women\u2019s boxing to the Olympic program, the 2012 Games in London were the first in which women competed in all the sports on the program.\nIn the early years, the Olympics were strictly for amateur athletes. However, this changed over time, and the Olympics gradually opened up to professional athletes, allowing them to participate.\n\nThe Olympics have often been influenced by global events and politics. They were canceled during World War I and World War II.\n\nThe Games have also been the stage for political protests and boycotts, with notable incidents occurring during the 1968 Mexico City Olympics and the 1980 and 1984 Olympics.\nWinter Olympics\n\nThe Winter Olympics were introduced in 1924, and the Paralympic Games for athletes with disabilities began in the mid-20th century.\n\nThe first Winter Games were held in Chamonix (France), in 1924. Initially called the \u201cInternational Winter Sports Week\u201d, this event was renamed the \u201c1st Olympic Winter Games\u201d only in 1926 at the IOC Session in Lisbon.\n\nFrom 1924 to 1992, the Summer and Winter Games were each held in the same year, every four years.\n\nAfter 1992, the Summer and Winter Games are each still held every four years but the Summer Games are celebrated during the first year of an Olympiad, and the Winter Games are held in the third year.\n\nIn 1948, Sir Ludwig Guttmann organized a sports competition involving 16 World War II veterans with spinal cord-related injuries in Stoke Mandeville, England. Four years later, competitors from Holland joined, and the international movement, now known as the Paralympic Movement, was born.\n\nModern Olympics\n\nThe Olympic Games have continued to evolve, introducing new sports and disciplines, such as basketball, snowboarding, and skateboarding.\n\nThe number of participating nations has also increased, reflecting the global nature of the event.\n\nThe Olympic Games are not just about sports but also promote values like friendship, respect, and excellence. The Olympic motto is \u201cCitius, Altius, Fortius\u201d (Faster, Higher, Stronger).\n\nThe next Olympics will be held in:\n\nIn Paris, France, in 2024.\nIn Milan and Cortina d\u2019Ampezzo, in Italy, in 2026.\nIn Los Angeles, USA, in 2028.\nIn Brisbane, Australia, in 2032.\nInternational Olympic Committee\n\nThe International Olympic Committee is the guardian of the Olympic Games and the leader of the Olympic Movement.\n\nIt acts as a catalyst for collaboration between all Olympic stakeholders, including the athletes, the National Olympic Committees, the International Federations, the Organising Committees for the Olympic Games, the Worldwide Olympic Partners and Olympic broadcast partners.\nIt also collaborates with public and private authorities including the United Nations and other international organisations.\nChallenges\n\nThe modern Olympics face challenges related to issues like doping, commercialization, and the environmental impact of hosting the games. There is also ongoing debate about the choice of host cities and the cost of organizing the event.\n\nHosting the Olympic Games is a massive financial undertaking for the host city and country. The costs of infrastructure development, security, and event organization can lead to substantial financial burdens and the risk of cost overruns.\nThe environmental impact of hosting the Games is a growing concern. There is pressure to ensure sustainable practices in infrastructure development, transportation, and event management. Host cities are encouraged to consider long-term benefits beyond the Games.\nSecurity threats are a constant challenge for Olympic organizers. Protecting athletes, officials, and spectators from potential terrorist attacks or security breaches requires extensive planning and resources.\nEnsuring a level playing field and preventing doping scandals remains a challenge. Anti-doping measures are continually evolving to detect and deter cheating by athletes.\nThe physical and mental well-being of athletes is increasingly in focus. Issues like athlete abuse, harassment, and the pressures of competition need to be addressed to create a healthy and safe environment for competitors.\nDeveloping extensive infrastructure for the Games often results in underutilized facilities post-event. Ensuring a productive and sustainable legacy for these structures is a challenge.\nGeopolitical tensions can impact the participation of certain countries or disrupt the diplomatic and peaceful spirit of the Games.\nPublic support for hosting the Games can fluctuate, with some host cities experiencing significant opposition due to concerns about costs, displacement of residents, and other factors.\nClimate-related challenges, such as extreme weather conditions or environmental changes, can affect the scheduling and safety of outdoor events.\nAdvances in technology impact the Games, from improving athletic performance to enhancing the viewing experience.\nEnsuring the ethical conduct of officials and administrators is a constant challenge. Concerns about corruption, transparency, and fair decision-making need to be addressed.\nConclusion\n\nThe Olympic Games have become one of the world\u2019s most-watched and celebrated sporting events, bringing together athletes and nations in the spirit of competition and international cooperation. The Games continue to evolve, adapt to contemporary challenges, and uphold their historical values.\n\nRelated article:\u00a0Target Olympic Podium Scheme\n\n-Article by Swathi Satish"

The presence of the in-exile Dalai Lama propels India into the bilateral issue regularly. Read here to learn the history of China-Tibet relations.\n\nTibet is an autonomous region located in the Himalayas, historically characterized by a unique culture and Tibetan Buddhism.\n\nIn 1950, the People\u2019s Liberation Army of China entered Tibet, leading to the signing of the Seventeen Point Agreement in 1951, which formally incorporated Tibet into the People\u2019s Republic of China.\n\nIn 1959, a Tibetan uprising against Chinese rule led to the exile of the 14th Dalai Lama, the spiritual leader of Tibetan Buddhism, to India.\n\nThe Dalai Lama and a Tibetan government-in-exile continue to advocate for Tibetan autonomy and the preservation of Tibetan culture and religion.\n\nTable of Contents\n\nChina-Tibet: Historical Background\nTibetan Autonomy\nChinese stakes in Tibet\nIndian stance on the China-Tibet issue\nGlobal stance on the China-Tibet issue\nConclusion\nChina-Tibet: Historical Background\n\nTibet has a history dating back over 2,000 years. In ancient times, Tibet was a collection of independent tribes and kingdoms.\n\n\ud83d\udc49 Which year are YOU targeting for success in the IAS/IPS/IFS Exam? \ud83d\ude80\n\n(1) \u21d2 UPSC 2025: Prelims cum Mains\n\n(2) \u21d2 UPSC 2026: Prelims cum Mains\n\n(3) \u21d2 UPSC 2027 Prelims cum Mains\n\nTip: Know more about ClearIAS Courses (Online/Offline)\n\nBuddhism was introduced to Tibet in the 7th century CE when the Tibetan king, Songtsen Gampo, married Princess Bhrikuti of Nepal and Princess Wencheng of China, who were both Buddhists.\n\nThe Tibetan Empire, which reached its zenith in the 8th century, extended its influence over a vast territory, including parts of China, India, Nepal, and Central Asia. During this period, Buddhism was promoted and became the dominant religion in Tibet.\n\nMongol Influence: The Tibetan Empire eventually fragmented into smaller kingdoms. In the 13th century, Tibet came under Mongol influence when the Mongol ruler Kublai Khan established the Yuan Dynasty in China.\n\nThe Ganden Phodrang Government: In the 17th century, the Fifth Dalai Lama established the Ganden Phodrang government, which combined religious and political authority in Tibet. The Dalai Lama became the spiritual and temporal leader of Tibet.\n\nBritish and Chinese Collusions: In the 19th century, British India and China vied for influence in Tibet. The 13th Dalai Lama, Thubten Gyatso, sought help from the British, which led to the 1914 Simla Accord, recognizing Tibet as an autonomous region under Chinese suzerainty.\n\nChinese Invasion: In 1950, the People\u2019s Liberation Army of the newly established People\u2019s Republic of China invaded Tibet, leading to the 1951 Seventeen Point Agreement, which officially incorporated Tibet into the People\u2019s Republic of China.\n\nTibetan Autonomy\n\nTibetans\u2019 discontent with Chinese rule culminated in a failed uprising in 1959, which led to the exile of the 14th Dalai Lama, Tenzin Gyatso, and many Tibetans to India. The Dalai Lama established a government-in-exile in Dharamsala, India.\n\nDuring China\u2019s Cultural Revolution (1966-1976), many Tibetan monasteries and cultural artifacts were destroyed, and Tibetan religious practices were severely restricted.\nIn 1965, the Tibet Autonomous Region (TAR) was established, granting Tibetans a degree of autonomy within the framework of the Chinese government.\nTibetan communities exist in various countries, primarily in India, Nepal, and the West, where they maintain their cultural and religious traditions.\nThe Tibetan government-in-exile, also known as the Central Tibetan Administration (CTA), continues to operate in India and seeks greater autonomy for Tibet within the framework of the Chinese constitution.\n\nChina maintains that Tibet is an integral part of its territory and has implemented policies aimed at integrating Tibet into the Chinese state. However, Tibetans and many international observers argue that these policies have eroded Tibetan culture and autonomy.\n\nRepression and Human Rights Concerns: Human rights organizations and governments have raised concerns about the Chinese government\u2019s treatment of Tibetans, including restrictions on religious practices, cultural suppression, and political repression. There have been reports of protests and self-immolations by Tibetans in response to these policies.\n\nChinese stakes in Tibet\n\nEconomic Development: China has invested significantly in Tibet\u2019s economic development, including infrastructure projects, but critics argue that these initiatives often benefit Chinese settlers more than Tibetans and can lead to environmental degradation.\n\nDialogue: There have been several rounds of talks between representatives of the Dalai Lama and the Chinese government, but progress has been limited, and no lasting resolution has been reached.\n\nSome countries and international organizations have expressed concern about the Tibet issue and called for dialogue between the Chinese government and the Tibetan leadership. However, China strongly opposes any external interference in what it considers its internal affairs.\n\nThe annexation of Tibet and the consequent China-Tibet issues have had a prominent impact on the relations with India. Tibet acted as a buffer region between China and India until the annexation.\n\nIndian stance on the China-Tibet issue\n\nIndia\u2019s stance on the China-Tibet issue is complex and multifaceted, influenced by historical, political, and strategic considerations.\n\nRecognition of Tibet as Part of China: Since 1950, China has claimed Tibet as an integral part of its territory. India, like most countries, recognizes Tibet as part of the People\u2019s Republic of China.\n\nThis recognition is based on diplomatic norms and the \u201cOne China\u201d policy, which means acknowledging China\u2019s sovereignty over Tibet.\nIndia has engaged in economic relations with China, including trade and investment. Balancing economic interests with political and security concerns is a delicate challenge for India in its dealings with China.\n\nRefuge for Tibetan Government-in-Exile: India has been a refuge for Tibetans who fled Tibet following the 1959 Tibetan uprising against Chinese rule.\n\nThe Dalai Lama, Tibet\u2019s spiritual leader, and the Tibetan government-in-exile established their headquarters in Dharamshala, India.\nIndia has provided sanctuary to the Tibetan diaspora and allows them to operate a government-in-exile and maintain their cultural and religious practices.\nIndia has allowed the Dalai Lama to travel within the country and internationally. This has sometimes resulted in tensions between India and China, with China objecting to such visits.\n\nThe Tibetan government-in-exile has advocated the \u201cMiddle Way\u201d approach, seeking genuine autonomy for Tibet within the framework of the Chinese constitution rather than independence.\n\nIndia has supported this approach, emphasizing a peaceful resolution of the Tibet issue through dialogue between the Chinese government and Tibetan representatives.\nIndia has expressed concerns about human rights violations and restrictions on religious and cultural freedoms in Tibet. These concerns align with India\u2019s broader commitment to human rights and democratic principles\n\nThe India-China border dispute, particularly in the Himalayan region, has been a longstanding issue. India\u2019s concerns about Chinese territorial claims in border areas have influenced its approach to the Tibet issue.\n\nThe border conflict, including the 1962 Sino-Indian War, has strained relations and influenced India\u2019s stance.\n\nIndia has engaged in sporadic discussions with China on the Tibet issue, although progress has been limited. The border dispute and broader geopolitical dynamics have often overshadowed these talks.\n\nRead:\u00a0India-China border disputes\n\nGlobal stance on the China-Tibet issue\n\nThe Chinese government maintains that Tibet is an integral part of China and has sovereignty over the region. It argues that Tibet has historically been part of Chinese territory and that its policies are aimed at modernizing and developing the region.\n\nSupport for Tibet\u2019s Autonomy or Independence:\n\nIndia: India recognizes Tibet as an autonomous region of China but has provided asylum to the Tibetan spiritual leader, the Dalai Lama, and the Tibetan government-in-exile. India has called for a peaceful resolution and greater autonomy for Tibet.\nTibetan Government-in-Exile: The Tibetan leadership, under the Dalai Lama, has advocated for genuine autonomy for Tibet within the framework of the Chinese constitution. Some factions within the Tibetan diaspora have called for full independence.\nOther Countries: Several Western countries, including the United States, Canada, and some European nations, have expressed support for greater autonomy, human rights, and religious freedoms in Tibet. Some have met with the Dalai Lama, which has led to tensions with China.\n\nNon-Interference and Neutrality:\n\nSeveral countries, particularly those with political and economic ties to China, maintain a neutral stance on Tibet. They emphasize non-interference in China\u2019s internal affairs and prioritize diplomatic relations and economic cooperation with China overtaking a stance on Tibet.\nSome countries that share borders with Tibet, such as Nepal and Bhutan, take a cautious approach by not explicitly recognizing Tibet\u2019s status or advocating for Tibetan autonomy. They prioritize maintaining positive relations with China.\n\nHuman Rights Concerns:\n\nInternational human rights organizations have expressed concerns about human rights abuses in Tibet, including restrictions on religious freedom and cultural suppression. They call for improved human rights conditions and more transparent governance in the region.\n\nUnited Nations: The UN generally does not take a position on the sovereignty of Tibet but has raised concerns about human rights issues in the region. China\u2019s influence and role in international organizations can affect the discussion of Tibet-related matters.\n\nConclusion\n\nThe future of Tibet remains uncertain. China has a strong grip on the region, and the international community has been unable to broker a solution that satisfies both Tibetan aspirations for autonomy and China\u2019s territorial integrity concerns.\n\nThe China-Tibet issue is a sensitive and complex matter with cultural, political, and human rights dimensions. It continues to be a subject of debate and concern in the international community, with ongoing calls for dialogue and a peaceful resolution to the longstanding tensions between Tibet and the Chinese government.\n\nRead:\u00a0Resolve Tibet Act 2024\n\n-Article by Swathi Satish"

These partnerships can influence the port\u2019s prospects.\nGeopolitical Implications\n\nChabahar Port has geopolitical implications in the broader context of regional power dynamics. It provides India with a presence in Iran and the ability to counterbalance China\u2019s influence in the region, particularly through its Belt and Road Initiative (BRI).\n\nU.S. sanctions on Iran have had implications for Chabahar Port\u2019s development and operations. While India has received a waiver for its activities at the port for its role in facilitating Afghan trade, the sanctions have still affected investment and financing.\n\nChabahar is not only a port but also aims to become a transportation hub, connecting landlocked Central Asian countries to global markets through a combination of sea, rail, and road routes.\n\nSignificance of Chabahar Port for India\n\nIndia has been a key player in the development and operation of Chabahar Port. The Indian government has invested in the port\u2019s infrastructure and has been involved in upgrading its facilities to make it a viable transit route for Indian goods bound for Afghanistan and Central Asia.\n\nChabahar Port holds significant geopolitical importance for India for several reasons:\n\nAccess to Afghanistan and Central Asia: Chabahar Port serves as a strategic gateway for India to access landlocked Afghanistan and Central Asian countries. It provides an alternative and more direct trade route to the region compared to traditional routes that pass through Pakistan. This access is vital for India\u2019s economic and strategic interests in the region.\nDiversification of Trade Routes: By circumventing Pakistan, which has historically imposed restrictions on India\u2019s trade with Afghanistan and Central Asia, Chabahar Port diversifies India\u2019s trade routes. This reduces India\u2019s dependence on a single corridor and enhances its trade resilience.\nEnergy Security: The Port allows India to access energy resources in Iran and the broader region. It opens up opportunities for India to invest in Iran\u2019s energy sector and secure a more stable energy supply.\nCounterbalancing China\u2019s Influence: Chabahar Port is strategically located near the Chinese-operated Gwadar Port in Pakistan, which is part of the China-Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC). India\u2019s presence in Chabahar serves as a counterbalance to China\u2019s growing influence in the region and allows India to protect its interests in the Indian Ocean.\nStrengthening Regional Connectivity: India has invested in the development of the Chabahar-Zahedan railway line, which will connect Chabahar Port to Afghanistan and further into Central Asia. This infrastructure project enhances regional connectivity and promotes economic integration among countries in the region.\nHumanitarian and Development Assistance: Chabahar Port facilitates India\u2019s humanitarian and development assistance efforts in Afghanistan. It enables the transport of goods and supplies for reconstruction projects and humanitarian aid, contributing to stability and development in Afghanistan.\nStrategic Presence in the Indian Ocean: Chabahar Port extends India\u2019s maritime reach and presence in the Indian Ocean. It bolsters India\u2019s maritime capabilities and supports its efforts to ensure maritime security and freedom of navigation in the region.\nEnhanced Maritime Trade: Chabahar Port offers India an alternative maritime route to reach markets in the Persian Gulf, the broader Middle East, and beyond. It reduces transit time and shipping costs for Indian goods.\nGeopolitical Leverage: India\u2019s engagement in Chabahar provides it with geopolitical leverage in the region. It allows India to engage with Iran, Afghanistan, and Central Asian countries and contribute to regional stability.\n\nIndia and Iran have a long-standing agreement, signed in 2002, to develop Chabahar into a full deep sea port, the it has been extended to include the port with the International North\u2013South Transport Corridor (INSTC).\n\nAlso read:\u00a0India\u2019s connectivity projects\n\nRecent developments\n\nMay 2024: The Long-Term Bilateral Contract on Chabahar Port Operation was signed between Indian Ports Global Limited (IPGL) of India and the Port & Maritime Organisation (PMO) of Iran, enabling the operation of Shahid-Behesti port in the Chabahar Port Development Project for 10 years.\n\nThis is the first time India will take over the management of an overseas port.\n\nThe US warned of \u201cpotential risk of sanctions\u201d after India inked a 10-year agreement for running the Chabahar Port in Iran.\nIn November 2018, the US had exempted India from certain sanctions for the development of the Chabahar Port and the construction of a railway line.\nWay forward\n\nChabahar Port is a crucial component of India\u2019s broader geopolitical and economic strategy in the region. It enhances India\u2019s connectivity, trade, and influence, while also serving as a counterbalance to the expanding presence of other regional and global powers in the Indian Ocean and Central Asia.\n\nThe Port has the potential to enhance regional connectivity and trade, particularly for Afghanistan and Central Asian nations.\n\nIts development is seen as a significant step toward strengthening economic ties and regional stability in South Asia and beyond. However, challenges, including geopolitical tensions and financing issues, continue to impact its progress.\n\nThe future of Chabahar depends on several factors, including geopolitical developments, international sanctions, competition with other regional ports, infrastructure development, and regional security.\n\nWhile it holds significant promise as a trade and transport hub, its full realization may require ongoing efforts and cooperation among regional and international stakeholders. The evolving dynamics in the region will continue to shape the port\u2019s future role and importance.\n\n-Article by Swathi Satish"

It typically includes various sideline meetings and dialogues on specific topics.\n\nThe East Asia Summit has identified six priority areas of cooperation, namely:\n\nEnvironment and Energy\nEducation\nFinance\nGlobal health issues and pandemic diseases\nNatural disaster management\nASEAN Connectivity.\n18th East Asia Summit\n\nThe 18th East Asia Summit was held in Jakarta, Indonesia on 6-7 September 2023.\n\nIndia reiterated the importance of the EAS mechanism and reaffirmed our support to further strengthen it underlined India\u2019s support for ASEAN centrality and called for ensuring a free, open, and rules-based Indo-Pacific.\nIndia also called for a cooperative approach to address global challenges including terrorism, climate change, and resilient supply chains for essential items including food and medicines, and for energy security.\nIndia\u2019s steps in the area of climate change and our initiatives such as ISA, CDRI, LiFE, and OSOWOG were also highlighted.\n\nAt the 20th ASEAN-India Summit, India presented a 12-point proposal for strengthening India-ASEAN cooperation covering connectivity, digital transformation, trade, and economic engagement, addressing contemporary challenges, people-to-people contacts, and deepening strategic engagement, as follows:\n\nEstablishing multi-modal connectivity and economic corridor that links South-East Asia-India-West Asia-Europe\nOffered to share India\u2019s Digital Public Infrastructure Stack with ASEAN partners\nAnnounced ASEAN-India fund for Digital Future focusing on cooperation in digital transformation and financial connectivity\nAnnounced renewal of support to the Economic and Research Institute of ASEAN and East Asia (ERIA) to act as a knowledge partner for enhancing our engagement.\nCalled for collectively raising issues being faced by Global South in multilateral fora\nInvited ASEAN countries to join the Global Centre for Traditional Medicine being established by WHO in India\nCalled for working together on Mission LiFE\nOffered to share India\u2019s experience in providing affordable and quality medicines to people through Jan-Aushadhi Kendras\nCalled for collective fight against terrorism, terror financing, and cyber-disinformation\nInvited ASEAN countries to join the Coalition for Disaster Resilient Infrastructure (CDRI)\nCalled for cooperation in disaster management\nCalled for enhanced cooperation on maritime safety, security, and domain awareness\nSignificance of East Asia Summit\n\nThe East Asia Summit is considered one of the most important regional forums in the Asia-Pacific region.\n\nIt brings together major regional powers, including China, India, Japan, and the United States, providing a platform for diplomatic engagement and cooperation on a wide range of issues.\n\nThe EAS complements other regional forums like ASEAN and the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) forum.\n\nThe agenda of the East Asia Summit covers a broad spectrum of political, economic, and security issues. Some of the key areas of discussion include:\n\nRegional Security: Addressing regional security challenges, including territorial disputes, nuclear proliferation, and counterterrorism.\nEconomic Cooperation: Promoting regional economic integration, trade liberalization, and sustainable development.\nClimate Change and Environment: Collaborating on climate change mitigation and environmental protection.\nPublic Health: Discussing health security issues, including responses to pandemics such as COVID-19.\nInfrastructure Development: Enhancing regional connectivity and infrastructure development.\nDisaster Management: Coordinating disaster response and management efforts.\nMaritime Cooperation: Promoting peaceful resolution of maritime disputes and cooperation in the South China Sea.\nIndia and EAS\n\nIndia is one of the founding members of the East Asia Summit, which was established in 2005.\n\nIndia\u2019s participation in the EAS provides it with a platform to engage with major East Asian and ASEAN nations on issues of strategic importance. It allows India to strengthen its political, economic, and security ties with the region.\n\nRegional Security: The EAS discussions encompass regional security challenges, including maritime security, counter-terrorism, and non-proliferation. India has a significant interest in these discussions, given its strategic location in the Indian Ocean region.\nEconomic Cooperation: Economic cooperation and integration are key components of the EAS agenda. India is actively involved in discussions related to trade, investment, and regional economic integration through initiatives like the Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership (RCEP), which includes many EAS members.\nDisaster Management and Climate Change: The EAS provides a platform for member countries to cooperate on disaster management, climate change, and environmental sustainability. India participates in these discussions given its vulnerability to natural disasters and its commitment to addressing climate change.\nCOVID-19 Pandemic Response: The COVID-19 pandemic has brought additional focus on health security and pandemic response. India has actively participated in EAS discussions related to pandemic response, vaccine distribution, and strengthening health systems.\nASEAN Centrality: The East Asia Summit recognizes the centrality of ASEAN in regional affairs. India\u2019s participation aligns with its Act East policy, which seeks to deepen engagement with ASEAN countries and the broader Asia-Pacific region.\n\nAt the East Asia Summit in Bangkok in November 2019, India unveiled India\u2019s Indo-Pacific Oceans Initiative (IPOI), which is aimed at forging partnerships to create a secure and stable maritime domain.\n\nIn the area of Education, at the 4th East Asia Summit (EAS), held in Thailand on 24-25 October 2009, the EAS Leaders endorsed the proposal for the revival of Nalanda University, to bring together the brightest minds from all the countries of Asia. The idea was first mooted by former President APJ Abdul Kalam in 2006.\n\nAPEC vs EAS\n\nThe Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) and the East Asia Summit (EAS) are two distinct regional forums in the Asia-Pacific region, each with its focus and membership.\n\nAPEC\n\n\t\n\nEAS\n\n\n\nAPEC is a larger and more inclusive forum that includes 21 member economies from across the Asia-Pacific region, including North America (e.g., the United States and Canada), East Asia (e.g., China, Japan, South Korea), Southeast Asia (e.g., Indonesia, Malaysia, Vietnam), and Oceania (e.g., Australia, New Zealand).\n\t\nThe East Asia Summit is a smaller and more exclusive forum, consisting of 18 member countries. EAS is primarily focused on the East Asian region.\n\n\nAPEC\u2019s primary focus is on promoting economic cooperation and trade liberalization among its member economies. It aims to create a free and open trade and investment environment, reduce trade barriers, and enhance economic integration in the Asia-Pacific region.\n\t\nThe East Asia Summit addresses a broader range of issues beyond economics, including political and security matters. It seeks to promote strategic dialogue and cooperation on regional and global challenges, such as terrorism, maritime security, and non-proliferation.\n\n\nAPEC operates on a voluntary and non-binding basis. Decisions made within APEC are not legally binding, and it functions as a forum for dialogue, cooperation, and consensus-building.\n\t\nThe East Asia Summit allows for more binding commitments, particularly in the realm of political and security cooperation. Member countries may undertake specific actions or agreements to address regional challenges.\n\n\nAPEC\u2019s inclusiveness is one of its defining features, as it brings together a diverse group of economies, including both developed and developing nations, for discussions on economic matters.\n\t\nEAS has a strong strategic and security-oriented focus, making it distinct from APEC, which primarily focuses on economic matters.\n\nAPEC and the East Asia Summit are both important regional forums in the Asia-Pacific region, but they serve different purposes and have distinct memberships.\n\nAPEC emphasizes economic cooperation and trade liberalization, while the East Asia Summit addresses a broader range of political, security, and strategic issues in addition to economic matters.\n\nConclusion\n\nThe East Asia Summit plays a vital role in shaping the regional dynamics of the Asia-Pacific and addressing various challenges faced by member states. It reflects the region\u2019s commitment to multilateralism and diplomatic engagement in resolving regional and global issues.\n\nPrevious year questions\n\nQ.

Through GVCs, countries trade more than products; they trade know-how and make things together. Imports of goods and services matter as much as exports to successful GVCs. Read here to understand the significance of GVCs.\n\nCompanies used to make things primarily in one country. That has all changed. Today, a single finished product often results from manufacturing and assembly in multiple countries, with each step in the process adding value to the end product.\n\nGVCs integrate the know-how of lead firms and suppliers of key components along stages of production and in multiple offshore locations. The international, inter-firm flow of know-how is the key distinguishing feature of GVCs.\n\nHow countries engage with GVCs determines how much they benefit from them.\n\nRecently, the G20 trade and investment ministers meeting called for a \u2018framework for mapping GVCs\u2019 for building resilient and sustainable Global Value Chains (GVCs) to withstand future shocks.\n\nTable of Contents\n\nGlobal value Chains (GVCs)\nBenefits of GVCs\nChallenges of Global Value Chains\nFramework for mapping GVCs\nReviving GVC growth\nConclusion\nGlobal value Chains (GVCs)\n\nGlobal value Chains represent the complex network of production and distribution processes that span multiple countries and involve various stages of production for goods and services.\n\n\ud83d\udc49 Which year are YOU targeting for success in the IAS/IPS/IFS Exam? \ud83d\ude80\n\n(1) \u21d2 UPSC 2025: Prelims cum Mains\n\n(2) \u21d2 UPSC 2026: Prelims cum Mains\n\n(3) \u21d2 UPSC 2027 Prelims cum Mains\n\nTip: Know more about ClearIAS Courses (Online/Offline)\n\nGVCs involve the participation of numerous firms, suppliers, and intermediaries in different countries, each contributing to the creation of a final product or service.\n\nKey Characteristics of Global Value Chains are-\n\nFragmentation of Production: GVCs involve the division of production processes into different stages, often located in different countries. Each country specializes in specific stages of production, capitalizing on its comparative advantages.\nInterconnectedness: GVCs rely heavily on international trade to transport intermediate goods and components across borders. This interconnectedness leads to increased trade and cross-border investment.\nDiverse Participants: GVCs include various participants, such as suppliers, manufacturers, service providers, and distributors. These participants can range from small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) to multinational corporations.\nCoordination and Governance: The success of GVCs relies on effective coordination and governance mechanisms to ensure smooth collaboration among various participants. This can involve contracts, partnerships, and technological platforms.\nTechnology and Innovation: GVCs often require the adoption of advanced technologies and innovation to enhance efficiency and quality at different stages of production.\nSupply Chain Risks: The interconnected nature of GVCs can lead to vulnerabilities in case of disruptions, such as natural disasters, political instability, or supply chain issues.\nBenefits of GVCs\nEfficiency: GVCs allow countries and firms to focus on their strengths and specialize in specific stages of production, leading to cost savings and increased efficiency.\nEconomic Growth: Participation in GVCs can stimulate economic growth, especially in developing countries, by attracting foreign direct investment (FDI), creating jobs, and enhancing exports.\nAccess to Markets: GVCs provide access to global markets, enabling firms to reach a wider customer base.\nTechnology Transfer: Companies participating in GVCs can benefit from technology transfer, as they engage with more technologically advanced partners.\nChallenges of Global Value Chains\nUneven Distribution of Benefits: The benefits of GVC participation are not equally distributed. Developing countries may face challenges in capturing a fair share of the value added due to power dynamics and resource limitations.\nDependency and Vulnerability: Overreliance on GVCs can make economies vulnerable to disruptions and changes in global demand.\nLabor and Social Concerns: Labor conditions and wages can be contentious issues within GVCs, as some stages of production might occur in regions with lower labor standards.\nEnvironmental Impact: GVCs can result in increased resource use and environmental degradation, particularly if environmental regulations are lax in certain stages of production.\nFramework for mapping GVCs\n\nThe world remains in the middle of a multi-dimensional crisis that raises global challenges, such as macroeconomic instability, food insecurity, and disruptions across Global Value Chains (GVCs).\n\nThis crisis is undermining resilient, sustainable, and inclusive economic growth, and poses a threat to economic development and global trade growth, with a particular impact on developing countries and Micro, Small, and Medium Enterprises (MSMEs).\nGVCs have become increasingly complex over time. This has contributed to increased dependencies and heightened vulnerabilities to disruptions.\nGVCs in some sectors face significant challenges in responding quickly and effectively to significant disruptions.\nThis underscores the importance of work towards GVC mapping, and believe that a mapping framework can help members identify opportunities for building resilience within GVCs.\n\nMaking GVCs work for sustainable and inclusive development:\n\nBy expanding their participation in GVCs and moving up the value chain, including through sustainable and inclusive investment, countries, particularly many developing countries can spur their economic growth.\nThere exists a significant gap between some developing and developed countries in GVC participation.\nThe participation in GVCs also partially depends on the capacity of countries to attract global production, including by promoting and fostering linkages between foreign enterprises and domestic companies, particularly MSMEs.\nThus, it is important to promote open, inclusive, non-discriminatory, predictable, and transparent conditions that foster sustainable investment.\nReviving GVC growth\n\nIt is important to identify solutions, including digital solutions that can help sustain a high level of GVC participation and can revive GVC growth.\n\nThis goal can be accomplished through enhanced regulatory cooperation, capacity-building efforts, provisions for accessible information, transparency in rules and regulations, and streamlining of administrative procedures.\n\nUnder a generic framework, it is important to identify key dimensions to help evaluate the resilience of GVCs both at the sectoral and product levels.\n\nThe following non-exhaustive set of indicators can help with such evaluation, including by domestic authorities:\n\nConcentration of suppliers and markets: Heavy reliance on a small group of players or concentration in the buyers/seller market can significantly impact the resilience of a GVC.\nThe volatility of trade volume and value: GVCs that are subjected to a high degree of uncertainty in terms of supply and demand experience outsized volatility in terms of both volumes and value of trade.\nUpstreaming of an industry or product: An industry or a product that is situated upstream of a GVC has the potential to disrupt the entire chain through spillover effects.\nDownstream of an industry or product: Industries or products that are dependent on multiple inputs through various stages are more susceptible to frequent disruptions.\nCritical nature of industry and product: Resilience and robustness in certain industries and products can be considered critical given their end-use.\nProduct attributes: Products with long lead times in the production process or with limited shelf life can be critical from a replacement/timing perspective.\nConnectivity: Logistics & communication infrastructure, customs efficiency, and information technology networks are important elements for GVC resilience.\n\nConsulting with stakeholders, including industry can provide additional insights and expertise that can further augment GVC mapping efforts.\n\nConclusion\n\nThe global value chains play a significant role in the modern global economy, enabling countries and firms to benefit from specialization, technological advancement, and international trade.\n\nHowever, their dynamics can also present challenges that need to be addressed for more inclusive and sustainable economic growth.\n\n-Article by Swathi Satish"

            "[META]": "Last updated on January 30, 2024 by ClearIAS Team",
            "[CONTENT]": "Non-tariff barriers (NTBs) restrict imports or exports of goods and services without involving the imposition of tariffs. They could come in the form of regulations, standards, testing, certification, or pre-shipment inspection that are aimed to protect human, animal, or plant health and the environment. Read here to learn more about them.\n\nThere are several challenges facing Indian exports, foremost among them being a lack of demand from Western countries amid rising global inflation brought on by protracted geopolitical tensions.\n\nHowever several non-tariff obstacles hamper the export of commodities. For example, the EU\u2019s recent Carbon Border Adjustment Mechanism (CBAM) is seen as an NTB.\n\nTable of Contents\n\nNon-tariff barriers\nForms of Non-Tariff Barriers\nExamples of NTBs\nNon-trade barriers faced by India\nEffect on developing countries\nWay forward\nNon-tariff barriers\n\nNon-tariff barriers (NTBs) or non-tariff measures (NTM) are a type of trade barrier that restricts imports or exports of goods and services without involving the imposition of tariffs (taxes on imports).\n\nUnlike tariffs, which are explicit taxes on goods at the border, non-tariff barriers encompass a wide range of policy measures and regulations that can hinder international trade.\nThese barriers are often more subtle and can be more complex to identify and address.\n\nAccording to the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development (UNCTAD), the official definition of non-tariff barriers or measures is broad:\n\nNTMs are policy measures other than ordinary customs tariffs that can potentially have an economic effect on international trade in goods, changing quantities traded, prices, or both.\nA detailed classification is therefore critical to identify and distinguish among the various forms of NTMs.\n\nThe International Classification of Non-tariff Barriers follows a taxonomy of all measures considered relevant in today\u2019s international trade.\n\n\ud83d\udc49 Which year are YOU targeting for success in the IAS/IPS/IFS Exam? \ud83d\ude80\n\n(1) \u21d2 UPSC 2025: Prelims cum Mains\n\n(2) \u21d2 UPSC 2026: Prelims cum Mains\n\n(3) \u21d2 UPSC 2027 Prelims cum Mains\n\nTip: Know more about ClearIAS Courses (Online/Offline)\n\nIt comprises technical measures, such as sanitary or environmental protection measures.\nIt also includes other measures traditionally used as instruments of commercial policy, e.g. quotas, price control, export restrictions, or contingent trade protective measures.\nFinally, the International Classification of NTBs also comprises behind-the-border measures, such as competition, trade-related investment measures, government procurement, or distribution restrictions.\nForms of Non-Tariff Barriers\n\nNTBs can take various forms, including:\n\nImport Licensing: Requiring importers to obtain licenses or permits before importing certain goods. These licenses can be used to limit the number of imports or control the entry of specific products.\nQuotas: Imposing quantitative restrictions on the quantity of certain goods that can be imported or exported during a specific period. Quotas limit the supply of foreign products in the domestic market.\nTechnical Barriers to Trade (TBT): These include technical regulations, standards, and conformity assessment procedures that can make it difficult for foreign products to comply with domestic regulations. TBTs can be legitimate measures to protect health, safety, or the environment, but they can also be used as trade barriers.\nSanitary and Phytosanitary Measures (SPS): These are measures related to food safety and animal and plant health. SPS measures are meant to protect human, animal, and plant life, but they can be used as barriers to trade if applied arbitrarily.\nSubsidies and Countervailing Measures: Subsidies provided by governments to domestic industries can distort international trade. Countervailing measures can be imposed to counter the adverse effects of such contributions.\nCustoms and Administrative Procedures: Cumbersome customs procedures, excessive documentation requirements, and bureaucratic delays at borders can impede the smooth flow of goods.\nRules of Origin: These determine the nationality of a product and are used to ensure that products benefitting from preferential trade agreements originate from the eligible countries.\nLocal Content Requirements: Mandating that a certain percentage of a product must be produced domestically or that a specific number of components must be sourced locally.\nIntellectual Property Protection: Inadequate or inconsistent protection of intellectual property rights (patents, copyrights, trademarks) can create trade barriers, especially in knowledge-intensive industries.\nCurrency Controls: Restrictions on currency exchange can impact the ability to conduct international transactions.\nDiscriminatory Government Procurement Practices: Favoring domestic suppliers in government procurement contracts can limit market access to foreign goods and services.\nContingent trade-protective measures: Measures implemented to counteract particular adverse effects of imports in the market of the importing country contingent upon the fulfillment of specific procedural and substantive requirements.\nExamples of NTBs\n\nSanitary and Phytosanitary Measures\n\nA requirement limiting the use of hormones and antibiotics in the production of meat\nA sample test on imported oranges to check for the residue level of pesticides\n\nTechnical barriers to trade\n\nRestrictions on toxins in children\u2019s toys\nRefrigerators need to carry a label indicating their size, weight, and electricity consumption level\n\nPre-shipment inspection and other formalities\n\nLive animals need to be cleared at a designated customs office for inspection\nThe requirement that goods must be shipped directly from the country of origin, without stopping at a third country\n\nContingent trade-protective measures\n\nCountry A imposes anti-dumping duty on imports of biodiesel products from country B, to offset injurious dumping by country B found to exist via an investigation.\nCountry A imposes a countervailing duty on imports of semiconductors from country B, to offset the subsidies granted by country B on the production of semiconductors found to exist via an investigation\n\nQuantity control\n\nOnly hotels and restaurants are allowed to import alcoholic drinks\nA quota of 100 tons of tuna fish can be imported any time of the year\n\nPrice control measures\n\nA minimum import price is established for fabric and apparel\nImports of fresh blueberries may enter free of duty between 1 January to 31 May, while in other months seasonal duties apply\n\nExport related measures\n\nExports of processed seafood products must be inspected for sanitary conditions\nExports of cultural heritage objects \u2013 sculptures or precious \u2013 are prohibited\nNon-trade barriers faced by India\n\nAccording to an assessment, 80 percent of India\u2019s trade is subject to some or the other non-tariff barrier.\n\nThe key Indian exports that routinely face high NTBs are:\n\nChilies, tea, basmati rice, milk, poultry, bovine meat, fish, and chemicals products to the EU;\nSesame seed, shrimp, Medicines, and Apparel to Japan;\nFood, meat, fish dairy, and industrial products to China.\nFruits and shrimp exports face barriers in the US.\nBovine Meat in South Korea\nCeramic tiles to Egypt, chili to Mexico, medicines to Argentina, microbiological regents to Saudi Arabia, and electrical, medical devices, and household appliances to Brazil.\n\nThe majority of Indian exporters struggled with lengthy and complicated license, approval, and laboratory testing requirements.\n\nFurthermore, several nations established their own rules and regulations that did not conform to international norms. These put a heavy financial burden on exporters to comply with such strict restrictions.\n\nBecause they occasionally need to alter their manufacturing procedures and may be lacking in production technology or infrastructure, this affects their overall worldwide exports.\n\nIndia signing several free trade agreements is an opportunity to get the non-tariff barriers removed during the negotiations that will help Indian exports become more competitive.\n\nIndia has recently signed free trade agreements with UAE and Australia and is negotiating FTAs with the UK, EU, and Canada.\nEffect on developing countries\n\nNon-tariff barriers can have significant and often adverse effects on developing countries. While these barriers are used by various governments for different reasons, they can disproportionately impact the economies of developing nations.\n\nReduced Export Opportunities: Non-tariff barriers limit the access of goods from developing countries to the markets of developed nations. This can hinder the ability of developing countries to export their products, especially those that are labor-intensive or produced by small and medium-sized enterprises.\nHigher Export Costs: Compliance with complex and varying regulations related to non-tariff barriers can raise the cost of producing and exporting goods. This can make products from developing countries less competitive in the global market.\nNegative Economic Growth: NTBs can limit the growth of industries in developing countries by restricting access to foreign markets. This prevents these countries from fully benefiting from globalization and global value chains.\nImpeded Industrialization: Developing countries often rely on exporting raw materials. Non-tariff barriers can discourage value addition and industrialization, as they hinder the export of processed or value-added products.\nUndermined Agricultural Exports: Agricultural products are especially susceptible to non-tariff barriers such as sanitary and phytosanitary standards. Developing countries that heavily depend on agriculture can face challenges in exporting their products due to these barriers.\nReduced Foreign Direct Investment (FDI): Non-tariff barriers can make it less attractive for foreign investors to enter markets in developing countries, as these barriers increase uncertainty and risk.\nInhibited Technology Transfer: Developing countries often seek access to advanced technologies from developed nations. NTBs can limit the transfer of technology by creating obstacles to the import of machinery, equipment, and knowledge-intensive products.\nUnfair Trade Relations: Non-tariff barriers can reinforce the power imbalances between developed and developing countries in global trade negotiations. Developing countries may find it difficult to negotiate and address these barriers effectively.\nHealth and Safety Risks: In some cases, non-tariff barriers related to health and safety can be used as a pretext for protectionism. While these measures are intended to protect consumers, they can sometimes exclude products that are safe but produced in developing countries.\nAdministrative Burden: Complying with the diverse and changing requirements of non-tariff barriers can be a bureaucratic challenge for developing countries. This administrative burden can deter exporters and hamper economic growth.\n\nMost of these barriers are put by developed countries and regions like the US and the European Union.\n\nThe biggest Non-Tariff Barrier is on the horizon of the Carbon Border Adjustment Mechanism or carbon tax.\n\nFirst proposed by the European Union, now other developed countries like the UK and the US are planning something along the same lines.\nThe protests against the carbon tax have been registered by the developing countries and the issue could also come at the World Trade Organisation.\n\nAlso read: Foreign Trade of India: Concepts of International Trade\n\nWay forward\n\nThe usage of non-trade barriers has grown over the past several decades to support a variety of domestic agendas, public policy goals, and development initiatives, particularly those connected to achieving the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs).\n\nEven though they are legal, many Non-Tariff Barriers have evolved into significant trade barriers since they are sometimes opaque and boost prices, particularly for suppliers in poor nations.\n\nThe ability of developing nations to effectively comply with the standards of such measures ultimately determines how effectively they can participate in global markets.\n\nAddressing non-tariff barriers requires international cooperation, negotiations, and transparency.\n\nOrganizations like the World Trade Organization (WTO) play a role in monitoring and addressing NTBs to promote fair and open trade.\n\nReducing non-tariff barriers can lead to increased trade, economic growth, and improved market access for all trading partners.\n\nAlso read:\u00a0Global trade disruptions\n\n\u00ad-Article by Swathi Satish"

Rainfall is relatively scarce and unreliable, and droughts are common. The region experiences hot temperatures during the dry season and mild temperatures during the wet season.\nThe vegetation in the Sahel is mainly composed of grasslands, shrubs, and acacia trees. The landscape is a transition zone between the arid Sahara Desert to the north and the more humid savannas to the south.\nThe Sahel region is prone to desertification, which is the process of fertile land turning into desert due to various factors, including climate change, overgrazing, deforestation, and unsustainable agricultural practices. Desertification poses significant challenges to agriculture, food security, and the livelihoods of the people in the region.\n\nThe Sahel region is home to a diverse range of ethnic groups and cultures. It is inhabited by various pastoralist and agricultural communities, as well as nomadic groups.\n\nThe region faces various socio-economic and political challenges, including poverty, unemployment, and ethnic tensions.\nThese factors have contributed to the movement of people within the region and towards neighboring countries, leading to migration and occasional conflicts.\nThe region has been affected by recurrent humanitarian crises, including food insecurity and displacement of populations due to conflicts and environmental factors.\n\nThe Sahel region has gained international attention due to its complex challenges, and various international organizations, including the United Nations, the African Union, and regional bodies, are actively engaged in providing assistance and support for development, peacekeeping, and humanitarian efforts.\n\nThe Sahel region\u2019s environmental and socio-economic challenges, combined with its strategic location as a transit route for migration and potential threats from extremist groups, have made it an area of focus for regional and global policymakers in terms of development, security, and humanitarian efforts.\n\nAlso Read:\u00a0Sudan Crisis\n\nWhat led to the coup in Niger?\n\nNiger faces a variety of security challenges-\n\nThe Sahelian insurgency led by IS Sahel and the al-Qaeda-affiliated JNIM in the west\nThe ISWAP and Boko Haram insurgency in the southeastern Diffa region, a mix of IS Sahel militancy and banditry in the central Tahoua region\nOrganized bandit gangs in Maradi along the southern border with Nigeria, and the gold-rich Agadez.\nThe Agadez region lies along the border with Libya, Algeria, and Chad, and has become a smuggling route for armed groups, among them Chadian and Sudanese rebels, drug traffickers, and organized criminal gangs.\n\nAlthough Niger was handling the insurgencies considerably better than Mali and Burkina Faso before their coups, the mutinous Niger soldiers have cited this deteriorating security situation as the cause of their rebellion.\n\nBecause of the escalating turmoil, some people now think that the only way to put an end to it is by severe military repression; this is why the coup appears to have widespread support in some areas.\n\nDesertification is spreading from the Sahara into the Sahel as a result of climate change, which exacerbates the instability in the area. According to experts, the Sahel region is seeing the fastest global temperature rise.\n\nConsequences\n\nGlobally, the coup in Nigeria has implications as many of the actions against trafficking and migration by the Nigerian government become futile.\n\nBy agreeing to accept hundreds of migrants from Libyan detention facilities, President Bazoum\u2019s administration has worked alongside European nations to curb the flow of migrants over the Mediterranean Sea.\nIn what used to be a crucial transit area between neighboring nations in West Africa and those farther north, he has also clamped down on people traffickers.\n\nRegionally, the coup will make the Sahel region already bereft of instability more fragile.\n\nAlso Read:\u00a0European Refugee Crisis\n\nPrevious year question\n\nQ.

            "[CONTENT]": "India has the opportunity to cash in on the China plus one strategy as more firms seek to diversify their supply chains. Many global companies have recently announced investments in India adding to the idea. Read here to understand the significance of the strategy for India.\u00a0\u00a0\n\nIn recent years, many companies have adopted a China Plus One, Plus One, or C+1 strategy to build new manufacturing units outside the People\u2019s Republic.\n\nFor almost 30 years, Western companies have invested heavily in China, attracted by its low labor and production costs, and the considerable and growing size of its domestic consumer market.\n\nThis ended up creating an overconcentration of their business interests in China, which is risky as it gives one country a monopoly over supply chains.\n\nTable of Contents\n\nChina Plus One strategy\nChina Plus One: Opportunity for India\nChallenges\nWay forward\nChina Plus One strategy\n\nThe \u201cChina Plus One\u201d strategy refers to a business strategy adopted by companies, especially multinational corporations, to diversify their production and supply chain activities by adding an alternative manufacturing or sourcing location to China.\n\nThis approach became popular as a response to various factors, including rising costs in China, geopolitical uncertainties, and the desire to mitigate risks associated with overreliance on a single production base.\n\n\ud83d\udc49 Which year are YOU targeting for success in the IAS/IPS/IFS Exam? \ud83d\ude80\n\n(1) \u21d2 UPSC 2025: Prelims cum Mains\n\n(2) \u21d2 UPSC 2026: Prelims cum Mains\n\n(3) \u21d2 UPSC 2027 Prelims cum Mains\n\nTip: Know more about ClearIAS Courses (Online/Offline)\n\nThe key reasons behind the birth of the China Plus One strategy are:\n\nCost considerations: Over time, labor and production costs in China have increased, making it less attractive for some industries to continue manufacturing solely in China. Companies seeking cost-effective solutions often look for alternative locations with lower labor costs.\nRisk diversification: Relying heavily on a single manufacturing location, especially in a politically or economically volatile region like China, can expose companies to risks such as supply chain disruptions, trade tensions, and policy changes.\nAccess to new markets: Establishing manufacturing facilities in a different country can provide companies with improved access to local markets and potentially reduce trade barriers or tariffs.\nProximity to customers: Setting up production facilities closer to target markets can reduce transportation costs and lead times, allowing companies to be more responsive to customer demands.\nTalent pool and innovation: Some companies may seek to tap into the skilled labor force and technological capabilities of other countries to foster innovation and improve product development.\nThere are also new business obstacles to overcome. For instance, due to a stringent data privacy rule that dictates how they must acquire and retain data, global technology companies have been leaving or reducing their presence in mainland China.\n\nThe China Plus One strategy does not necessarily mean companies are moving away from China altogether.\n\nInstead, they are diversifying their operations and establishing a presence in additional locations while still maintaining their manufacturing or sourcing activities in China.\nPopular destinations for companies implementing the China Plus One strategy include other countries in Southeast Asia, such as Vietnam, Thailand, Malaysia, and Indonesia, which offer lower labor costs and attractive investment incentives.\nThese countries have seen increased foreign direct investment (FDI) as a result of companies seeking to complement their operations in China.\n\nIt\u2019s worth noting that the effectiveness and success of the China Plus One strategy depend on various factors, including the industry sector, regulatory environment, infrastructure, political stability, and labor force capabilities in the chosen alternative location.\n\nCompanies need to carefully evaluate the benefits and risks of diversification to ensure a smooth and successful implementation of this strategy.\n\nChina Plus One: Opportunity for India\n\nThe China Plus One strategy can be advantageous for India for several reasons.\n\nAs multinational corporations (MNCs) and businesses look to diversify their production and sourcing activities away from China, India presents itself as an attractive alternative destination.\n\nLarge and Growing Consumer Market: India has a massive domestic market with a population of over 1.3 billion people. As a result, many companies are interested in establishing a presence in India to tap into this vast consumer base and take advantage of the growing middle class with increasing purchasing power.\nCost-Competitive Manufacturing: India offers competitive labor costs compared to many developed countries, making it an attractive destination for labor-intensive industries seeking to lower their production expenses.\nSkilled Labor Force: India has a large pool of skilled and educated workers, especially in sectors like information technology (IT), engineering, pharmaceuticals, and services. This skilled workforce can be beneficial for high-tech and knowledge-based industries.\nImproving Infrastructure: India has been investing in infrastructure development, including transportation networks, ports, and logistics, which can improve supply chain efficiency and reduce costs for businesses.\nGovernment Incentives: The Indian government offers various incentives and concessions to attract foreign direct investment (FDI) and promote domestic manufacturing. These incentives include tax benefits, subsidies, and streamlined regulatory procedures.\nStrategic Geopolitical Location: India\u2019s location provides businesses with access to markets in South Asia and the Middle East, offering opportunities for regional expansion and trade.\nEconomic Reforms: India has been implementing economic reforms to improve the ease of doing business and attract more foreign investment. These reforms are aimed at creating a conducive environment for businesses to operate and grow.\nSupportive Ecosystem: India has a thriving entrepreneurial ecosystem with a mix of startups and established companies across various industries. This ecosystem can foster innovation and collaboration for companies entering the Indian market.\n\nAlso read: Indian Economy 2023: Predictions and Challenges\n\nChallenges\n\nHowever, it\u2019s important to note that while India offers significant advantages for companies considering the China Plus One strategy, it also presents its own unique set of challenges.\n\nThese challenges may include bureaucratic complexities, infrastructure gaps in some regions, regulatory hurdles, and occasional changes in policy frameworks.\n\nInfrastructure Deficiencies: While India has been making efforts to improve its infrastructure, there are still deficiencies in transportation, logistics, and power supply in certain regions. Inadequate infrastructure can lead to increased operational costs and supply chain disruptions.\nBureaucratic Red Tape: India\u2019s bureaucratic processes and regulatory environment can be complex and time-consuming. Obtaining permits, licenses, and approvals for setting up and running businesses may involve navigating through various government agencies and can lead to delays.\nLabor Regulations: India has stringent labor laws that vary from state to state, and compliance can be challenging. Employers must navigate labor disputes, restrictions on hiring and firing, and other labor-related complexities.\nLand Acquisition: Acquiring land for industrial purposes can be a cumbersome process, often involving legal and social hurdles. Companies may face resistance from local communities and encounter delays in land acquisition procedures.\nInconsistent Policy Implementation: Despite efforts to improve the business environment, policy implementation can be inconsistent across different states and regions in India. Companies may encounter uncertainties due to sudden policy changes or varying interpretations of regulations.\nSkill Mismatch: While India has a large pool of educated and skilled workers, there can be a mismatch between the skills demanded by industries and the skills available in the workforce. Companies may need to invest in training and upskilling programs for their employees.\nTaxation and Customs Duties: India\u2019s complex tax system, including various state and central taxes, can be challenging for businesses to navigate. Additionally, customs duties and tariffs can impact the cost competitiveness of imported raw materials and finished goods.\nIntellectual Property Rights (IPR) Protection: Ensuring adequate protection of intellectual property rights can be a concern in India. Companies must take measures to safeguard their innovations and technologies from potential infringement.\nCultural and Language Differences: India is a diverse country with multiple languages and cultural nuances. Understanding and adapting to regional differences can be crucial for successful market entry and business operations.\nWay forward\n\nThe Zero-Covid policy of Beijing, the resulting supply chain disruptions, and the lengthy lead times from China ultimately gave the China-Plus-One approach a boost for many multinational corporations.\n\nIn industries including machinery, autos, transportation, and electrical equipment, the EU, Mexico, Taiwan, and Vietnam have emerged as the clear beneficiaries of the China plus one model.\n\nHowever, researchers claim that India did not considerably profit from this trade diversion, except little gains in the equipment industry.\n\nOne of the causes is India\u2019s diminishing involvement in global value chains. Compared to other emerging nations, it has a more restrictive trade policy that is not motivated by the desire to integrate with global value chains.\n\nAdditionally reticent to create preferential trade deals has been India. Regional commercial agreements were avoided. India has to change its trade strategy to benefit from the increasingly well-liked China-plus-one approach.\n\nDespite the challenges, many companies have successfully implemented the China Plus One strategy in India and have leveraged the country\u2019s vast market potential and competitive advantages.\n\nThorough market research, local partnerships, and a long-term perspective are essential for navigating the complexities and seizing opportunities in India.\n\nCompanies looking to expand their operations to India need to conduct thorough market research and understand the specific opportunities and risks involved in each sector and location.\n\n-Article by Swathi Satish"

The rollout is a critical step forward in the fight against one of the leading causes of death on the continent.\n\nSince 2019, Ghana, Kenya, and Malawi have been delivering the malaria vaccine through the Malaria Vaccine Implementation Programme (MVIP), coordinated by WHO and funded by Gavi, the Vaccine Alliance, the Global Fund to Fight AIDS, Tuberculosis and Malaria, and Unitaid.\n\nThe RTS, S/AS01 vaccine has been administered to more than 1.7 million children in Ghana, Kenya, and Malawi since 2019 and is safe and effective, resulting in both a substantial reduction in severe malaria and a fall in child deaths.\n\nTable of Contents\n\nGlobal Alliance for Vaccines and Immunisation (GAVI)\nSignificance of the Global Alliance for Vaccines and Immunisation\nConclusion\nGlobal Alliance for Vaccines and Immunisation (GAVI)\n\nBy the late 1990s, the progress of international immunisation programs was stalling.\n\nNearly 30 million children in developing countries were not fully immunized against deadly diseases, and many others went without any immunization at all.\n\nThe challenge was an acute market failure; powerful new vaccines were becoming available, but lower-income countries simply could not afford most vaccines.\n\n\ud83d\udc49 Which year are YOU targeting for success in the IAS/IPS/IFS Exam? \ud83d\ude80\n\n(1) \u21d2 UPSC 2025: Prelims cum Mains\n\n(2) \u21d2 UPSC 2026: Prelims cum Mains\n\n(3) \u21d2 UPSC 2027 Prelims cum Mains\n\nTip: Know more about ClearIAS Courses (Online/Offline)\n\nIn response, the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation and a group of founding partners brought to life an elegant solution to encourage manufacturers to lower vaccine prices for the poorest countries in return for long-term, high-volume, and predictable demand from those countries.\n\nIn 2000, that breakthrough idea became the Global Alliance for Vaccines and Immunisation \u2013 today Gavi, the Vaccine Alliance.\n\nGAVI, The Vaccine Alliance was set up as a Global Health Partnership in 2000 to create equal access to new and underused vaccines for children living in the world\u2019s poorest countries.\n\nIn particular, the alliance aims at accelerating access to vaccines, strengthening countries\u2019 health and immunization systems, and introducing innovative new immunization technology.\nSince its inception, it has subsequently supported the immunization of an additional 326 million children and prevented a potential 5.5 million deaths.\n\nWhile the Secretariat oversees the day-to-day operations of the Vaccine Alliance, the Board is responsible for giving strategic direction and policy-making.\n\nThe Board is comprised of 18 \u201crepresentative\u201d seats, 9 seats for independent or \u201cunaffiliated\u201d individuals, and one seat for\u00a0 CEO.\n\nUNICEF, WHO, the World Bank\u00a0and the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation hold permanent seats.\nConstituency representatives serve on a time-limited basis.\nIndependent Board members are private individuals with no professional connection to allaince\u2019s work.

This disruption means 80 million children will miss out on life-saving vaccines.

According to the 2023 Global Gender Gap Index-\n\nNo country has yet achieved full gender parity, although the top nine countries (Iceland, Norway, Finland, New Zealand, Sweden, Germany, Nicaragua, Namibia, and Lithuania) have closed at least 80% of their gap.\nFor the 14th year running, Iceland (91.2%) takes the top position. It also continues to be the only country to have closed more than 90% of its gender gap.\nFor the 146 countries covered in the 2023 index, the Health and Survival gender gap has closed by 96%, the Educational Attainment gap by 95.2%, the Economic Participation and Opportunity gap by 60.1%, and the Political Empowerment gap by 22.1%.\n\nAt the current rate of progress over the 2006-2023 span, it will take 162 years to close the Political Empowerment gender gap, 169 years for the Economic Participation and Opportunity gender gap, and 16 years for the Educational Attainment gender gap.\n\nThe time to close the Health and Survival gender gap remains undefined.\n\nGender gaps in the global labor market\n\nThe state of gender parity in the labor market remains a major challenge. Not only has women\u2019s participation in the labor market globally slipped in recent years, but other markers of economic opportunity have been showing substantive disparities between women and men.\n\nBetween the 2022 and 2023 editions, parity in the labor-force participation rate increased from 63% to 64%.\nWomen continue to face higher unemployment rates than men, with a global unemployment rate of around 4.5% for women and 4.3% for men.\nThe share of women \u2019s representation in the workforce and leadership across industries is skewed at 32.2%- nearly 10 percentage points lower.\nScience, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) occupations are an important set of jobs that are well-remunerated and expected to grow in significance and scope in the future.\nWomen make up almost half (49.3%) of total employment across non-STEM occupations, but just 29.2% of all STEM workers.\nGender Gaps in Political Leadership\n\nMuch like in the case of the representation of women in business leadership, gender gaps in political leadership continue to persist.\n\nAlthough there has been an increase in the number of women holding political decision-making posts worldwide, achieving gender parity remains a distant goal and regional disparities are significant.\nAs of 31 December 2022, approximately 27.9% of the global population, equivalent to 2.12 billion people, live in countries with a female head of state.\nBy 2022, the share of women in parliaments has risen steadily to 22.9%. Significant strides have also been made in terms of women\u2019s representation in local government globally.\nOut of the 117 countries with available data since 2017, 18 countries, including Bolivia (50.4%), India (44.4%), and France (42.3%), have achieved representation of women of over 40% in local governance.\n\nAlso read: Gender Pay Parity\n\nIndia and Gender Gap Report\n\nIndia is now ranked 127 out of 146 nations in terms of gender parity, up from 135 last year, according to the annual Gender Gap Report, 2023.\n\nThe fact that the gender gap has closed by 64.3% is an improvement, but this is hardly a reason for celebration.\n\nIndia has a window of opportunity to improve in each of the index\u2019s four key metrics- economic participation and opportunity, educational attainment, health and survival, and political empowerment- so that one-half of the world\u2019s most populous nation can contribute to the economy, growth, and general well-being of society.\n\nThanks to local initiatives after the 73rd and 74th amendments, India has made progress in education and political empowerment, with a representation of women of over 40% in local administration.\n\nHowever, just 15.1% of lawmakers are female, which is \u201cthe highest for India since the first edition in 2006.\u201d\nThis ought to motivate Parliament to move the issue forward by passing the long-delayed Women\u2019s Reservation Bill, which calls for allocating 33% of the Lok Sabha and State Legislative Assemblies\u2019 seats to women. The bill was originally presented in the House back in 1996.\nTake into account the following to grasp the current situation of women\u2019s involvement in politics: Only in 2023 did Nagaland, which was established as a state in 1963, elect its first two female legislators.\n\nIndia scores quite low in terms of ensuring equal access for men and women to economic participation and opportunity, with less than 40% parity.\n\nOn the one hand, there are increases in salary and income parity, yet the percentages of women in technical and senior posts have decreased.\nAlthough an improvement in the sex ratio at birth has increased parity after more than a decade of modest development, India\u2019s performance in terms of health and survival remains a cause for worry.\nGirls must have access to education at all stages of secondary and postsecondary education, and they also require paid employment.\nMany women lack the time and energy to choose a paid job because they wind up performing so much unpaid work at home.\nAll development indicators, including nutrition, would immediately improve if females have access to a job-assured education.\nThis will also end the cycle of early marriage leading to poor mother and child health.\n\nIf the pandemic exposed the frailty of life, it was exponentially harsher for women because of the decline in their labor force participation rates, which affected household earnings.\n\nEven when they do find employment, women are frequently restricted by patriarchal and cultural standards; in addition, there are significant safety issues.\nAlthough the pandemic may have slowed down efforts to close the gender pay gap by 2030, progress must still be made.\n\nAlso read: Names of Reports published by Organisations: Memorize Faster\n\nWay forward\n\nIn the private sector, the scope of gender parity action by pioneering firms has begun to broaden from a focus on the workforce to whole-of-business approaches encompassing inclusive design, inclusive supply chains, and community impact.\n\nIncreasing women\u2019s economic participation and achieving gender parity in leadership, in both business and government, are two key levers for addressing broader gender gaps in households, societies, and economies.\n\nCollective, coordinated, and bold action by private- and public-sector leaders will be instrumental in accelerating progress toward gender parity and igniting renewed growth and greater resilience.\n\nRecent years have seen major setbacks and the state of gender parity still varies widely by company, industry, and economy. Yet, a growing number of actors have recognized the importance and urgency of taking action, and evidence of effective gender parity initiatives is solidifying.\n\n-Article by Swathi Satish"

Their acceptance of a peacekeeping operation provides the UN with the necessary freedom of action, both political and physical, to carry out its mandated tasks.\nIn the absence of such consent, a peacekeeping operation risks becoming a party to the conflict, being drawn towards enforcement action, and away from its fundamental role of keeping the peace.\n\nImpartiality\n\nImpartiality is crucial to maintaining the consent and cooperation of the main parties, but should not be confused with neutrality or inactivity.\nUnited Nations peacekeepers should be impartial in their dealings with the parties to the conflict, but not neutral in the execution of their mandate.\n\nNon-use of force except in self-defense and defense of the mandate\n\nUN peacekeeping operations are not an enforcement tool. However, they may use force at the tactical level, with the authorization of the Security Council, if acting in self-defense and defense of the mandate.\n\nThe Security Council has a vital role in securing this commitment and cooperation while providing missions with realistic and clear mandates.\n\nPeacekeepers protect civilians, actively prevent conflict, reduce violence, strengthen security, and empower national authorities to assume these responsibilities.\n\nThis requires a coherent security and peacebuilding strategy that supports the political strategy.\nUN peacekeeping helps host countries to become more resilient to conflict, laying the groundwork to sustain long-term peace, including by addressing the root causes of conflict.\nFunctions of UN Peacekeeping\n\nUN peacekeeping is also committed to working smarter and using modern technology as well as other innovations. All of this allows our peacekeepers to:\n\nProtect civilians\nPrevent conflicts\nBuild Rule of Law and security institutions\nPromote human rights\nEmpower women\nDeliver field support\n\nPeacekeepers are called upon not only to maintain peace and security but also to facilitate the political process, protect civilians, and assist in the disarmament, demobilization, and reintegration of former combatants.\n\nThey also play a key role in supporting democratic efforts such as organizing elections, protecting and promoting human rights, and assisting in the creation and restoration of the rule of law.\n\nPeacekeeping in Africa\n\nAfrica continues to have more peacekeeping missions than any other continent. Since 1960, there have been more than thirty UN peacekeeping missions across Africa, the most of any region.\nIndia and Peacekeeping\n\nIndia has a rich legacy of contribution to UN Peacekeeping operations and is one of the largest contributors of troops.\n\nIt has contributed approximately 2,75,000 troops to peacekeeping missions so far, with around 5,900 troops currently deployed in 12 UN Missions.\nIndian Army personnel have operated under difficult conditions in challenging terrains and have displayed exemplary professionalism, humane approach, courage, and valor, to the extent of making the supreme sacrifice to defend the UN mandates.\n159 Indian Army soldiers have made the supreme sacrifice to ensure peace across the globe.\nApart from the current deployment, India has pledged one Infantry Battalion Group and Corvette with Helicopter, as hard power and an Engineer Company & Signal Company as Force enablers, to be deployed at the behest of the UN.\nThe Indian Army has established a Centre for UN Peacekeeping (CUNPK) in New Delhi to impart niche training in peacekeeping operations.\n\nIn keeping with the need for women peacekeepers in conflict areas under UN mandate, India has deployed Female Engagement Teams (FETs) in MONUSCO and UNISFA (the second largest women contingent after Liberia).\n\nIndia has also deployed Women Military Police in UNDOF and women staff officers / military observers in various missions.\nCriticism\n\nUN peacekeeping missions on the continent have been criticized for a wide range of problems, including mismanagement, failure to act when civilians are under threat, rights abuses by peacekeepers, and financing troubles.\n\nPeacekeeping forces have also been accused of committing human rights abuses, including pervasive allegations of sexual abuse and exploitation.\nThough UN investigations into such allegations have increased in recent years, very few lead to prosecutions and none has resulted in a public conviction.\nUN peacekeepers have immunity from prosecution in the countries where they are deployed, leaving their home countries to undertake legal action.\nSome critics argue that peacekeeping missions are too costly given their mixed success, and that they are too reliant on funding from a few major donors.\nThe veto power of the Security Council\u2019s permanent members can delay or weaken peacekeeping mandates, such as in Sudan\u2019s Darfur region.\nConclusion\n\nThe challenges faced by peacekeepers are greater than ever, with rising global tensions, more complex conflict, and a proliferation of misinformation and disinformation, which impedes their work and threatens their safety.\n\nDespite these obstacles, peacekeepers persevere, alongside many partners, in the collective pursuit of peace.\n\nMore than fifty thousand troops are deployed for UN operations in Africa and tens of thousands more are deployed for regionally led missions in countries where civil wars and insurgencies have killed civilians and threatened to destabilize surrounding regions.\n\nReports of sexual and other abuses by UN peacekeepers have drawn particular condemnation in recent years and prompted some reforms.\nStill, heated debate persists about how to make these missions more effective, such as by looking to non-UN initiatives to bring peace to conflict-stricken parts of Africa.\n\nIn 2018, UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres launched the Action for Peacekeeping (A4P) initiative.\n\nIt focuses on developing more targeted peacekeeping mandates with clear political strategies, improving the safety of peacekeepers as well as civilians in mission areas, and better training troops.\nIn tandem, the Security Council unanimously adopted a resolution aimed at improving leadership and accountability in peacekeeping, in response to the reports of sexual exploitation and abuse by peacekeepers.\n\n-Article written by Swathi Satish"

In the Red Sea, Houthi militants have planted naval explosives that pose a threat to it. These mines have been hit by several cargo ships in the Red Sea, and they have also claimed the lives of nearby fishermen.\nBecause it provides the majority of its energy supply, the Strait of Malacca off the coast of Malaysia is crucial for East Asian nations like China and Japan. A blockade will have a 25% impact on global commerce and a 33% impact on oil trade.\nChokes in the Suez Canal route\u2019s maritime traffic can obstruct international trade and trap commercial ships in perilous situations in constrained spaces.\nChallenges of NSR\nAt best, the Arctic is not a benign environment, and as the earth warms, it is getting more unstable.\nThe Arctic is seeing twice as rapid a rise in surface temperatures as the rest of the world.\nExtreme cold occurrences are occurring more frequently in Russia and Europe as a result of this heat reducing the stability of the polar vortex air circulation.\nThe paths of northern storms are also altering due to unusual jet stream patterns.\nThe Laptev Strait\u2019s shallow depth, which is a few hundred miles east of the Lena River\u2019s mouth, is the NSR\u2019s main obstacle.\nThe strait restricts the size of ships passing the NSR to those with an Arcticmax draught of 12 meters.\nAnalysts have also noted that the new channel, which is far away and scantly supervised, may be used by terrorists to transport weapons.\nAs Russia and China intensify their efforts, the High North\u2019s growing economic potential, which is thought to hold a fourth of the world\u2019s untapped petroleum reserves, has also elevated the region to the status of \u201cprofound importance\u201d for NATO.\nShips and workers navigating the NSR face dangers due to unpredictable and harsh weather conditions as well as inadequate search-and-rescue resources and infrastructure.\nWay forward\n\nRussia and China are evaluating the possibility of joining the Northern Sea Route with China\u2019s Silk Road to create a global and competitive route connecting East Asia to Europe.\n\nThese trends point to the potential for Russia and China to eventually unite their influence to control the NSR and the majority of global trade.\n\nThe NSR is equally crucial for Japan and South Korea as it is for China and Russia. Both countries are the leading industrial nations of the East, increasingly using the northeastern passage.\n\nExperts anticipate that the Northern Sea Route will be fully operational and able to handle most of the volume of international commerce by 2030.\n\nThe Suez Canal will continue to be utilized for marine trade, particularly between Turkey and South and Southeast Asia and the Mediterranean region.\n\nIt is yet to see how the West will react to the rising power of China and Russia along the new route. The future of global commerce is uncertain given this continuous game of strategy in a hitherto uncharted international trade corridor.\n\n-Article written by Swathi Satish"

While CBAM\u2019s implementation is still being worked out, we at least know the scheme\u2019s scope.\n\nThe new levy is to deter carbon-intensive processes and encourage manufacturers to \u201cgreen\u201d as much of their processes as possible.\n\nThe levy would mirror the EU\u2019s carbon market price to prevent \u201ccarbon leakage\u201d.\nThat\u2019s when the EU\u2019s emission reduction efforts are offset by increased emissions outside the bloc through relocation of production to non-EU countries with less ambitious climate policies, or offset through increased imports of carbon-intensive products.\nCompanies in countries with a domestic carbon pricing regime equivalent to the EU\u2019s will be able to export to the EU without buying CBAM certificates.\n\nCBAM will initially cover several specific products in some of the most carbon-intensive sectors at risk of \u201ccarbon leakage\u201d:\n\niron and steel (including some downstream products such as nuts and bolts)\ncement\nfertilizers\naluminum\nelectricity\nhydrogen (which was recently added because it is mainly produced with coal in non-EU countries).\n\nCBAM is part of the \u201cFit for 55 in 2030 package\u201d, the EU\u2019s plan to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by at least 55% by 2030 compared to 1990 levels, in line with the European Climate Law.\n\nThe EU\u2019s primary mechanism for incentivizing industry to decarbonize is through carbon pricing and to meet its 2050 targets; these prices will need to rise substantially.\n\nIndia and Carbon Border Adjustment Mechanism\n\nCBAM has been criticized as a trade-restrictive policy, especially by developing countries like India, which has set a target of becoming carbon neutral by 2070.\n\nIndia has expressed concerns about CBAM at various international forums, including the World Trade Organization (WTO), emphasizing the importance of non-discriminatory treatment for the same products and warning that such measures could lead to protectionist practices.\n\nIndia\u2019s exports of energy-intensive goods including steel, aluminum, cement, and fertilizers are anticipated to suffer significantly from the EU\u2019s adoption of the CBAM.\nIn the EU market, Indian exporters are expected to see increased pricing, less competitiveness, and decreased demand for their products.\nImplementing the CBAM is expected to pose a significant challenge to India\u2019s metal sector. In 2022, 27 percent of India\u2019s exports of iron, steel, and aluminum products went to the EU.\nStarting January 1, 2026, the EU will begin collecting carbon tax on each consignment of steel and aluminum, which will result in Indian firms paying an amount equivalent to 20-35 percent of tariffs.\n\nThe impact of CBAM on India will depend on the carbon intensity of the exported products and their substitutes in the EU market.\n\nIf there are no low-carbon substitutes for Indian products in the EU market, then the impact of CBAM on Indian exports may be limited.\n\nIndia has to put in place a carbon pricing mechanism, develop low-carbon technology, and maintain its competitiveness in the global market while reducing the effects of CBAM.\nThis will assist Indian companies in adhering to CBAM rules and lowering the carbon intensity of their products. India must also re-evaluate its export strategy and find new markets for its goods to maintain their competitiveness in the face of CBAM\u2019s effects on the EU market.\nSteps Taken by India\n\nThe Indian government is also considering several measures to address the potential impact of the EU\u2019s carbon border tax:\n\nNegotiating with the EU: Talks with the EU to provide a discount or exemption for Indian manufacturing. The intention is to prevent unfairly taxing Indian businesses for their emissions.\nDeveloping a carbon pricing mechanism: Developing a national carbon pricing system to incentivize businesses to cut their emissions. This will increase the competitiveness of Indian enterprises and assist India\u2019s policies in complying with the EU\u2019s carbon reduction targets.\nPromoting renewable energy: Encouraging renewable energy sources to cut carbon emissions, such as solar and wind power. To assist the Indian industry in switching to greener energy sources, the government intends to continue investing in renewable energy infrastructure.\nInvesting in carbon capture technology: Investigating how carbon capture and storage (CCS) technology may be used to lower emissions of carbon from manufacturing operations. Before they are discharged into the environment, this technology collects carbon emissions and stores them below.\nGlobal Concerns\n\nCompanies and countries outside the EU may raise two concerns over CBAM:\n\nIt places a carbon charge on companies from countries that did not primarily cause climate change.\nAccording to the EU, CBAM is designed to be in full compliance with WTO rules and international climate law.\nHowever, questions have been raised over the consistency of CBAM with international trade law and environmental principles.\nGiven its innovative nature and global impact, it is likely to be the subject of a legal challenge to the WTO.\n\nThe trade tensions that measure such as the EU CBAM and the US Inflation Reduction Act can cause are also being raised.\n\nGiven the very different ways the EU and the United States have chosen to incentivize decarbonization, finding equivalence between the two blocs will be challenging.\nWay forward\n\nIndia\u2019s manufacturing industry is expected to be significantly affected by the EU\u2019s new carbon border tax, especially companies that export products to the EU.\n\nThe Indian government is taking proactive steps to ensure the country\u2019s manufacturing industry remains competitive by reducing carbon emissions and promoting renewable energy sources.\n\nIndia is also laying the foundation for the creation of a carbon market. In this regard, the Ministry of Power published a draft of the Carbon Credits Trading Scheme (CCTS) on March 27, 2023.\nThe draft comprehensively outlines the institutional framework and operational mechanisms that will govern the forthcoming carbon credit market in India.\n\nUnder the provisional agreement, CBAM will begin to operate from October 2023 onwards. Initially, a simplified CBAM would apply with importers obliged to collect and report carbon data.\n\nFrom 2026 onwards, the full CBAM will kick in and the levy linked to the EU\u2019s carbon market price will be payable.\nIf companies cannot provide emissions data or their data are regarded by the EU as unacceptable, they will face punitive default values for emissions.\nAccording to the European Commission, several countries, including Canada and Japan, are planning initiatives like CBAM.\n\nThe world needs to find a way to square the need to take climate action with the fundamental principles that underpin the global trading system. The year 2023 will be critical in working through how best to do this.\n\nRelated Posts\nSecurity Challenges and Their Management in Border Areas\nCross-Border Insolvency\nIndia\u2019s Connectivity Projects\nIndia-China Border Disputes \u2013 What is the Doklam Issue?\nRedrawal of National Boundaries\n\n-\u00adArticle written by Swathi Satish"

For about 2000 years, the region was influenced by the Old Kingdom of Egypt.\n\nTill about 1720 BCE, the middle kingdom of Egypt had control over the Kush regions.\nAfter Egyptian power was revived during the New Kingdom (1570\u20131100 BCE), the pharaoh Ahmose I incorporated Kush as an Egyptian-ruled province governed by a viceroy.\n\nThe region was an important part of the 25th dynasty of Egypt or the Nubian Dynasty.\n\nThe Kushites adopted Egyptian ways and worshipped the Egyptian gods by this time.\n\nThe Christianization of Nubian kingdoms in the 6th century CE declined the Egyptian influence in the region.\n\nThe region of present Khartoum was important for the reason that the Blue and White Nile combined there to form the Nile.\n\nIslam was already present on the Sudanese Red Sea coast and the adjacent territories since the 7th century, but the Nile Valley did not undergo Islamization until the 14th-15th century, following the decline of the Christian kingdoms.\n\nIn the early 16th Century, the Ottoman Empire and Funj Sultanate conquered much of the former Nubian Empire.\n\nBy the 1820s, Muhammad Ali Pasha (suzerain of the Ottoman Sultan) of Egypt seized most of present-day Sudan and was known for his oppressive rule till 1848.\n\nDuring this time, British missionaries traveled from modern-day Kenya to Sudan to convert the local tribes to Christianity.\n\nFrom 1885 to 1899, Muhammad Ahmad took over the region and established the Mahdist state, as a result of resentment against Turco-Egyptian and British rulers.\n\nSince 1898, European countries like Belgium, and France along with the British started to claim various regions of Sudan.\n\nFinally, by 1900, an Anglo-Egyptian Sudan was established by other Europeans ceding territories to the British.\nOver the years, the discrimination between the southern and northern regions led to conflicts.\nIn February 1953, the United Kingdom and Egypt concluded an agreement providing for Sudanese self-government and self-determination.\nBy 1956, Sudan gained independence.\n\nThe history of Sudan has been marred by internal conflict since its independence in 1956, including the First Sudanese Civil War (1955\u20131972), the Second Sudanese Civil War (1983\u20132005), and the War in Darfur (2003\u20132010), which culminated in the secession of South Sudan in 2011 and a subsequent civil war there (2013\u20132020).\n\nSudan crisis 2023\n\nAn apparent power struggle between the two major factions of Sudan\u2019s military dictatorship led to the outbreak of violence.\n\nThe paramilitaries of the Rapid Support Forces (RSF), a group of militias, support the former warlord Gen Mohamed Hamdan Dagalo, also known as Hemedti, while the Sudanese military forces generally support Gen Abdel Fattah al-Burhan, the de facto ruler of the nation.\n\nThe power battle dates back to the years before a 2019 uprising that toppled tyrant, Omar al-Bashir. During that time, he amassed powerful security forces that he purposefully pitted against one another.\n\nAn ultimate clash looked imminent after attempts to transition to a democratic civilian-led administration failed after Bashir\u2019s downfall, with diplomats in Khartoum warning that they expected such an eruption of violence in early 2022.\n\nIt is feared that the conflict may intensify, destabilize the area, and harm Sudan\u2019s relationships with its neighbors.\n\nThe western border of Chad with Sudan has already been sealed off.\nWhile the unrest in Khartoum was occurring, a few Egyptian troops were kidnapped in northern Sudan.\nEthiopia, Sudan\u2019s eastern neighbor, is currently suffering the effects of a two-year conflict in the Tigray area.\nAnd South Sudan, which achieved independence from Sudan in 2011 has been plagued by ethnic warfare ever since will be concerned about the expansion of turmoil in Sudan.\nGlobal Concerns on Sudan Crisis\n\nSudan is located in an unstable region that borders the Red Sea, the Sahel, and the Horn of Africa.\n\nThe likelihood of a smooth transition to a civilian-led administration is hampered by its strategic location and agricultural resources, which have attracted regional power struggles.\n\nGlobally, countries are concerned about the escalation of the ongoing crisis in Sudan due to both personal vested interests as well as for the stability of Africa.\n\nRussia recently secured a deal to gain port access for its navy with al-Bashir. Along with US sanctions, the ongoing crisis will jeopardize Russia\u2019s desire to expand its influence in the African regions.\nThe US and other Western powers will be glad that al-Bashir is toppled, as he was charged with genocide and war crimes by the International Criminal Court over the Darfur conflict.\n\nSignificant geopolitical factors are also at play, as the US, Saudi Arabia, the UAE, and other countries compete for influence in Sudan.\n\nThe transformation in Sudan has been viewed by Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates as a chance to counteract Islamist influence in the area.\nThey are members of the \u201cQuad,\u201d which also includes the US, Britain, and the UN, and has funded mediation in Sudan.\nWestern nations are concerned about the possibility of a Russian facility on the Red Sea, which Sudanese military officials have agreed upon.\nIndia\u2019s Response to Sudan Crisis\n\nIndia and Sudan have had relations since ancient times when the Nile Valley Civilization and the Indus Valley Civilization mutually interacted. The Nile and the Red Sea also provided well-known routes to Indian traders and visitors.\n\nIndia and Sudan have maintained cordial and friendly relations.\n\nSudan Block in India\u2019s National Defence Academy was set up with the funding of one hundred thousand pounds from the Sudanese Government in recognition of the sacrifices of Indian troops in the liberation of Sudan in the North African Campaign during World War II.\n\nIndia is the second largest exporter to Sudan after China.\n\nIndia mainly sells sugar and confectionery, chemicals and pharmaceuticals, machinery and equipment, transport equipment, iron and steel, manufactured goods, textiles and apparel, foodstuffs, etc.\nIndia buys minerals and fuels, raw hides and skins, agricultural products, leather, metals, ores, etc.\n\nThe Sudan crisis has put thousands of Indian lives in danger in the capital city of Khartoum. As many as 4,000 Indians are currently trapped in the crisis-hit nation.\n\nIndia is coordinating closely with various countries, including the US, the UK, and Saudi Arabia, to ensure the safety and security of Indian nationals in violence-hit Sudan.\n\nRelated articles:\u00a0Coup in Niger; ECOWAS\n\n-\u00adArticle written by Swathi Satish"

Read here to learn more about the partnership.\n\nThe UK is the first non-founding member to join the CPTPP and the second biggest economy in the bloc after Japan.\n\nThe step has been taken a year after Britain\u2019s exit from the European Union. It is also the first European country to join the trade bloc.\n\nThe CPTPP members account for about 8% of UK export, thus this membership will provide UK businesses with newer opportunities through myriad sectors.

This would have made the club the world\u2019s largest free trade deal.\n\nBut in 2017, President Trump withdrew from the deal on his first day in office. The remaining countries continued talks, eventually signing the CPTPP in March 2018.\n\nThe CPTPP gives signatory countries greater access to one another\u2019s markets and reduced tariffs on trade on the vast majority of items.\n\nTariffs remain on some particularly sensitive areas to some countries \u2013 for example, Japan\u2019s rice industry.\nIn return, countries cooperate on regulations and standards.\n\nCPTPP removes 99% of tariffs on goods and services, just like the original TPP did, all the member countries have agreed to cut down on wildlife trafficking. That helps elephants, rhinoceroses, and marine species the most.\n\nIt prevents environmental abuses, such as unsustainable logging and fishing. Countries that don\u2019t comply will face trade penalties.\n\nCPTPP vs TPP\n\nThe CPTPP keeps all the core content of the TPP and stands open for the US to rejoin. However, as many as 20 articles of the TPP document have been postponed or revised.\n\nThe CPTPP will delay requirements for member countries to change their laws and practices.\nThe CPTPP also suspends the time term of copyright in case of unreasonable delays in licensing.\nMembers of the agreement will not have to extend protection terms from 50 to 70 years.\n\nThe agreement\u2019s impact has shifted.\n\nThe TPP states that it will go into force if the member nations\u2019 combined GDP in 2013 equals 85% of the combined GDP of the 12 signatory countries.\nThe eleven remaining nations had to alter this when the US withdrew because it represented 60% of the TPP\u2019s overall GDP.\nConsequently, the CPTPP may easily become effective 60 days after signing if at least six countries accept it.\nThe updated agreement also includes additional rules for the CPTPP\u2019s future participation, withdrawal, and flexible review procedures.\nImportance of CPTPP\n\nThe prospects for economic growth in the current market are pretty miserable. Two-thirds of respondents to the World Economic Forum\u2019s Chief Economist\u2019s Outlook 2023 predicted a global recession in 2023.\n\nThe UK joined the grouping intending to strengthen its trading links around the world post-Brexit.\n\nIf more countries were to join the CPTPP, this could be beneficial.\n\nCosta Rica and Ecuador have also applied to join their Pacific Rim counterparts, while Uruguay, Thailand, the Philippines, and South Korea have also expressed an interest.\nChina launched a bid to join in 2021, but it does not currently appear interested as the US is reconsidering its stance.\nTaiwan has also sent its request to join the trade bloc.\n\nThe CPTPP recognizes the challenges facing Small and Medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) in establishing export markets and includes outcomes to help make this task easier in the CPTPP region.\n\nThe new trade bloc will integrate the efforts of the existing partnerships in the Asia Pacific region like APEC, RCEP, ASEAN, etc.\n\nChallenges\n\nThe signatories\u2019 sovereignty is severely constrained by the pact.\n\nSignatories\u2019 state-owned companies are limited in what they may do and are subject to international courts.\n\nThe deal might provide benefits to high-income workers more than the small and medium-scale workers.\n\nFree trade agreements contribute to income inequality in high-wage countries. They promote cheaper goods from low-wage countries.\n\nCompetition has been increasing among the member countries of the CPTPP in terms of investment and export which challenges domestic companies, particularly SMEs and state-owned companies.\n\nAccording to CPTPP, all state-owned companies have to meet transparency in the operation and information provision.\n\nIn the framework of CPTPP, competition with foreign companies puts pressure on state-owned enterprises to receive and enjoy preferences from the state on which they are grounded.\n\nSuch state-owned enterprises have to handle pressure to be innovative in the way of operation, management, and evaluation of their business.\nIndia\u2019s Stand on CPTPP\n\nIndia has recognized that the sweeping economic concessions required to join CPTPP have too far-reaching consequences, similar to RCEP.\n\nIndia opted out of the bloc because it wants to impose stricter labor and environmental regulations on its other partners.\nAdditionally, the CPTPP draft contains incredibly specific requirements for investment protection, safeguards for the host state\u2019s regulatory authority, and the imposition of extensive transparency standards.\n\nAs with the US, India also may be left on the outside looking in as crucial issues such as data localization and environmental standards are debated and decided.\n\nPrevious year question\n\nQ.

The two countries have deepened their strategic partnership through initiatives like the Quad, a grouping of four democratic countries that includes Japan and Australia, aimed at promoting a free and open Indo-Pacific region.\n\nAt the same time, India\u2019s relationship with China has been more complex and fraught with tension, as the two countries compete for influence in the region and clash over territorial disputes along their shared border.

The relationship between the two countries has seen a remarkable transformation from the period of the Cold War.\n\nThe relationship between India and the United States is multifaceted and covers a wide range of areas such as trade, defense, energy, and counter-terrorism. The strategic partnership between the two countries is based on shared values of democracy, freedom, and respect for human rights.\n\nTrade has been one of the key areas of engagement between India and the United States. The two countries have seen a significant increase in trade in the last two decades, with bilateral\u00a0trade reaching over USD 119.42 billion (2021-2022)\u00a0as against USD 80.51 billion in 2020-21. The United States is one of India\u2019s top trading partners, with India being the ninth largest trading partner for the United States.\n\nHowever, trade relations between the two countries have not always been smooth. There have been disputes over market access, intellectual property rights, and tariff barriers. Despite these challenges, both countries have made efforts to address these issues and deepen their economic ties.\n\nDefence has emerged as another key area of cooperation between India and the United States. In recent years, India has become one of the largest buyers of American defense equipment, with the United States becoming India\u2019s second-largest defense supplier after Russia.\n\nIn addition, the two countries have conducted joint military exercises and signed several defense agreements to enhance defense cooperation. The United States has also designated India as a Major Defense Partner, which has provided India with access to advanced military technology.\n\nEnergy is another area where India and the United States have been working closely together. India has set ambitious targets for renewable energy and has been working with the United States to achieve these targets. The two countries have launched several initiatives such as the US-India Strategic Energy Partnership and the Clean Energy Finance Forum to promote clean energy and sustainable development.\n\nCounter-terrorism is another area of cooperation between India and the United States. Both countries have been affected by terrorism and have been working together to combat this threat. The United States has designated several terrorist groups based in India as Foreign Terrorist Organizations and has provided support to India in its fight against terrorism.\n\nIndia China Relations\n\nIndia and China are two of the largest and most populous countries in the world. Both countries have a long history and rich cultural heritage, but in recent years, their relationship has been marked by tension and conflict.\n\nHistorically, India and China had a relatively stable relationship, with both countries engaging in trade and cultural exchange. However, in the 20th century, tensions began to rise as China became more aggressive in its territorial claims in the region.\n\nOne of the main points of contention between India and China is the border dispute in the Himalayan region of Ladakh. The two countries share a 3,488-kilometer-long border, which has never been properly demarcated. In 1962, the two countries went to war over the border issue. Since then, there have been sporadic clashes and incidents of violence along the border.\n\nIn recent years, tensions have escalated further, with both countries increasing their military presence along the border. In June 2020, a violent clash broke out between Indian and Chinese troops in the Galwan Valley in Ladakh, resulting in the deaths of Indian soldiers and an unknown number of Chinese soldiers.\n\nThe incident led to a further deterioration of the relationship between the two countries, with India imposing economic sanctions on China and banning Chinese apps and investments. China, in turn, has refused to back down on its territorial claims in the region and has continued to increase its military presence along the border.\n\nThe India-China relationship is further complicated by their competing geopolitical interests. China has been expanding its influence in the region through its Belt and Road Initiative, a massive infrastructure project that seeks to connect Asia, Europe, and Africa.\n\nIndia, on the other hand, sees China\u2019s growing influence as a threat to its own security and has been working to counter it through its \u201cAct East\u201d policy, which seeks to deepen ties with other countries in the region.\n\nChina\u2019s Influence in Indian Neighbouring Countries\n\nChina\u2019s influence in India\u2019s neighboring countries has been a growing concern for India in recent years. China has been seeking to increase its economic and strategic presence in the region through its Belt and Road Initiative (BRI) and other initiatives.\n\nOne of the countries where China has increased its influence is Pakistan. China has invested heavily in infrastructure projects in Pakistan, including the China-Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC), which is a part of the BRI. China has also provided military and economic assistance to Pakistan, which has complicated India\u2019s relationship with its Western neighbor.\n\nChina has also been seeking to increase its influence in Nepal, Sri Lanka, and the Maldives, which are all located in India\u2019s immediate neighborhood. China has provided economic assistance and invested in infrastructure projects in these countries, which has given it greater leverage in its internal affairs.\n\nIn addition to its economic and strategic investments, China has also been engaging in soft power diplomacy in the region, including by establishing Confucius Institutes and promoting Chinese culture and language.\n\nIndia has been concerned about China\u2019s growing influence in the region, as it sees it as a threat to its own security and regional stability. India has sought to counter China\u2019s influence through increased economic engagement and strategic partnerships with its neighboring countries. India has also been working with other like-minded countries, including Japan and the United States, to promote a vision of a free and open Indo-Pacific region, which is seen as a counter to China\u2019s strategic ambitions.\n\nIndia and US Efforts to Counter China\u2019s Influence\n\nIn recent years, India and the United States have taken steps to counter China\u2019s growing influence in the region. Both countries share concerns over China\u2019s aggressive territorial claims in the South China Sea, its expanding military presence in the Indian Ocean region, and its economic and technological dominance.\n\nOne of the ways in which India and the United States are working together to counter China is through increased cooperation in the security and defense sectors. In 2016, India and the United States signed a Logistics Exchange Memorandum of Agreement (LEMOA), which allows for the sharing of military logistics and supplies.\n\nThis was followed by the signing of the Communications Compatibility and Security Agreement (COMCASA) in 2018, which allows for secure communication between the militaries of both countries.\n\nIn addition to these agreements, the two countries have been conducting joint military exercises, including the Malabar naval exercise, which also involves Japan and Australia. The exercises aim to increase interoperability between the militaries of the four countries and to send a message of deterrence to China.\n\nIndia and the United States have also been working to deepen economic ties in order to counter China\u2019s economic influence in the region. In 2017, the two countries launched the Strategic Energy Partnership, which aims to increase cooperation in the areas of energy security, trade, and investment.\n\nThe United States has also been pushing for India to become a member of the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) forum, which would give India a greater say in shaping economic policies in the region.\n\nAnother way in which India and the United States are countering China is through their collaboration in the technology sector. The United States has been pushing for India to become a part of its \u201cClean Network\u201d initiative, which aims to exclude Chinese technology companies from participating in critical telecommunications infrastructure.\n\nIndia has also taken steps to limit Chinese technology companies access to its market, including banning Chinese apps such as TikTok and WeChat.\n\nWhile India and the United States share concerns over China\u2019s growing influence in the region, their efforts to counter it are not without challenges. India\u2019s traditionally non-aligned foreign policy and its ongoing border dispute with China complicate its efforts to align more closely with the United States.\n\nAdditionally, the United States\u2019 own shifting foreign policy priorities under the Biden administration may affect its willingness to engage in the region.\n\nConclusion\n\nOverall, the India-USA-China triangle is a key driver of regional and global politics and will continue to shape the strategic landscape in the coming years. As India seeks to balance its relationships with these two major powers, it will need to navigate a complex set of geopolitical, economic, and security challenges, while promoting its own interests and strategic objectives.\n\nArticle Written By: Priti Raj"

Treaty was negotiated under United Nations Convention on Laws of the Sea (UNCLOS) of 1982 which governs countries\u2019 rights regarding marine resources.\n\nThe Treaty of High Seas, also known as the Biodiversity Beyond National Jurisdiction (BBNJ) Treaty, will create a new body to manage the conservation of ocean life and establish Marine Protected Areas (MPAs) on high seas.\n\nIt will put limits on how much fishing can take place, exploration activities like deep sea mining, etc.\n\nAlso read: Marginal seas of the world\n\nTable of Contents\n\nUN High Seas Treaty or Treaty of High Seas\nWhat are the high seas?\nSignificance of the High Seas Treaty\nWay forward\nUN High Seas Treaty or Treaty of High Seas\n\nSince 2017, an Inter-Governmental Conference established by the United Nations General Assembly has been negotiating an agreement under UNCLOS that would allow for more effective management and protection of the high seas.\n\n\ud83d\udc49 Which year are YOU targeting for success in the IAS/IPS/IFS Exam? \ud83d\ude80\n\n(1) \u21d2 UPSC 2025: Prelims cum Mains\n\n(2) \u21d2 UPSC 2026: Prelims cum Mains\n\n(3) \u21d2 UPSC 2027 Prelims cum Mains\n\nTip: Know more about ClearIAS Courses (Online/Offline)\n\nThis internationally legally binding instrument is often referred to as the Biodiversity in Areas Beyond National Jurisdiction treaty, or \u201cBBNJ treaty.\u201d\n\nThis treaty focuses on four main areas:\n\nConservation and sustainable use of marine biological diversity in ABNJ, including marine genetic resources\nArea-based management tools, including marine protected areas (MPA)\nEnvironmental impact assessments\nCapacity building and the transfer of marine technology\n\nAn intergovernmental meeting at the UN on March 4, 2023, approved the United Nations High Seas Treaty as a part of the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea (UNCLOS).\n\nThe major decision is the agreement to place 30% of the world\u2019s international waters into protected areas (MPAs) by 2030.\nThe deal, which covers about two-thirds of the ocean outside of state borders, will offer a legal framework for creating sizable marine protected areas (MPAs) to guard against the extinction of animals and distribute the genetic riches of the high seas.\nBy creating the Conference of the Parties (COP), member nations will be able to be held accountable for matters like governance and biodiversity.\nArrangements for sharing marine genetic resources, such as biological material from plants and animals in the ocean. These can have benefits for society, such as pharmaceuticals and food.\nRequirements for environmental assessments for deep sea activities like mining.\n\nAlso read: Movements of ocean water: Waves, Tides and Ocean Currents\n\nWhat are the high seas?\nCourtesy: NOAA\n\nThe high seas are defined by international law as all parts of the ocean that aren\u2019t included in the exclusive economic zone, the territorial sea, the internal waters of a country, or the archipelagic waters of an archipelagic country.\n\nThis means that the high seas and associated resources are not directly owned or regulated by any country.\n\nWorldwide oceans make up around two-thirds of international waterways. This implies that all nations have the freedom to fish, ship, and conduct research there.\n\nThe high seas are some of the most biologically productive in the world \u2013 teeming with plankton and home to ocean giants like predatory fish, whales, and sharks.\nThe seabed sequesters tremendous amounts of carbon and the ocean volume traps heat, slowing the effects of climate change on land and in the atmosphere dramatically.\nHigh seas begin at the border of countries\u2019 EEZ, which extend up to 370km from coastlines.\nHowever, up until today, just 1% of these high seas waters have been adequately safeguarded.\n\nThe high seas and seabed areas beyond the limits of national jurisdiction (ABNJ) play a critical role in maintaining life on Earth.\n\nAs a result, problems including climate change, overfishing, and shipping traffic pose a threat to the marine species that inhabit the vast bulk of the high seas.\nBut, the current framework of governance related to the conservation of marine biodiversity in ABNJ is weak and is characterized by large gaps.\nGaps include the absence of rules to establish cross-sectorial marine protected areas (MPAs) and other effective conservation tools.\n\nThe seafloor beyond the limits of the coastal continental shelf is what is termed \u201cthe Area\u201d by the 1982 United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea (UNCLOS).\n\nThe International Seabed Authority (ISA) is mandated to regulate the exploration for, and exploitation of, seabed mineral resources in the Area for the benefit of humankind.\nThe ISA has the power to allocate certain parts of the Area to countries for exploration and mining.\nMany other activities (like fishing and shipping) also occur on the high seas, and several regional and sectoral organizations with different responsibilities contribute to its governance, which has been characterized as fragmented.\nSignificance of the High Seas Treaty\n\nSubscribe to the ClearIAS YouTube Channel for more informative videos on UPSC preparation, tips, and strategies.

This helps in better collaboration between different multilateral agreements within the UN conventions as well.\n\nAlso read: UNCLOS Maritime zones\n\nWay forward\n\nHow to appropriately share marine genetic resources (MGR) and any earnings were one of the main issues that separated poor and industrialized countries.\n\nDue to their potential for application in pharmaceuticals and cosmetics, MGR, which are made up of the genetic material of bacteria, corals, krill, seaweed, and deep-sea marine sponges, are gaining more scientific and commercial interest.\n\nThe process for establishing marine protected zones and the paradigm for environmental impact analyses of anticipated high seas operations were other contentious issues.\n\nThe high seas treaty will place 30 percent of the world\u2019s oceans into protected areas, put more money into marine conservation, and covers access to and use of marine genetic resources.\n\nThe treaty must first be formally adopted at a later session, and then it only enters into force once enough countries have signed up and legally passed it in their own countries.\n\nHence, even though this breakthrough is significant, there is still a long way to go in terms of implementation.\n\n-Article written by Swathi Satish"

The first meeting, held in 1971 was originally known as the European Management Forum until it was changed to WEF in 1987.\n\nThe Forum\u2019s stated purpose is to enhance the state of the world by bringing together leaders from business, politics, academia, and other areas of society to influence global, regional, and industrial agendas.\n\nKey Highlights of Davos Summit 2023\n\nA few important key highlights of Davos Summit 2023 are:\n\nReal Estate Emissions\n\nThe World Economic Forum (WEF) reports that the leaders of real estate and other industries have committed to reducing their buildings-related emissions by 50% by 2030 and achieving Net Zero by 2050.\n\n\ud83d\udc49 Which year are YOU targeting for success in the IAS/IPS/IFS Exam? \ud83d\ude80\n\n(1) \u21d2 UPSC 2025: Prelims cum Mains\n\n(2) \u21d2 UPSC 2026: Prelims cum Mains\n\n(3) \u21d2 UPSC 2027 Prelims cum Mains\n\nTip: Know more about ClearIAS Courses (Online/Offline)\n\nThis is a significant measure in addressing global warming since emissions from real estate contribute to almost 40% of all greenhouse gas emissions related to energy, yet the sector is frequently excluded from decarbonization plans, as per WEF.\n\nA coalition of Trade Ministers on Climate\n\nOver 50 countries have come together to launch a new Coalition of Trade Ministers on Climate to boost international cooperation on climate, trade, and sustainable development. Stakeholders from around the world have emphasized the value of free trade, even in the current global economic climate of fragmentation.\n\nThey recognize the free trade system as a global public good that has contributed to economic growth and enhanced humanity\u2019s freedom and believes that it can never be forsaken.\n\nClimate Action, Biodiversity Loss\n\nAccording to the Global Risks Report 2023 published by the World Economic Forum (WEF) on January 12, 2023, the two most critical risks confronting the world in the coming decade are \u2018failure to mitigate climate change\u2019 and \u2018failure of climate change adaptation\u2019, followed by \u2018natural disasters and extreme weather events\u2019 and \u2018Biodiversity loss and ecosystem collapse\u2019. Additionally, \u2018natural disasters and extreme weather events\u2019 are also ranked as the second-most severe risk that the world should be prepared for in the next two years.\n\nThe adoption of the Kunming-Montreal Global Biodiversity Framework (GBF) at the 15th Conference of Parties (COP15) to the UN Convention on Biological Diversity (CBD) marks a notable achievement in terms of worldwide efforts to address biodiversity.\n\nChief Economists Outlook\n\nThe Chief Economist\u2019s Outlook has been launched, and it adopts a cautious tone. Two-thirds of those surveyed expect a global recession in 2023. The report examines key trends in the economic environment, including the prospects for growth, inflation, and monetary and fiscal policy. It highlights the importance of reskilling to prepare current and future workforces for the green transition, the digital transition, and the jobs of the future.\n\nOn Ukraine\n\nUkraine continues to request additional military assistance to combat its conflict with Russia, as well as more financial aid to rebuild once the conflict concludes. The country has emphasized that commitments to the reconstruction fund should commence immediately rather than after the war concludes, stating that \u201cthe more we do now, the less we will have to do in reconstruction,\u201d according to Odile Fran\u00e7oise Renaud-Basso, the President of the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development (EBRD).\n\nGiving to Amplify Earth Action\n\nA new initiative called Giving to Amplify Earth Action (GAEA) has been launched to leverage philanthropic capital to unlock funding for the climate crisis. GAEA aims to generate the USD 3 trillion needed each year from public and private sources to tackle climate change and nature loss.\n\nAlthough philanthropic giving totaled USD 810 billion in 2021, only 2% went towards reducing emissions. More than 45 major philanthropic, public, and private sector partners support GAEA.\n\nProjects Launched\n\nOver 50 \u201chigh-impact initiatives\u201d were introduced at the event, according to the Press Trust of India (PTI). Maharashtra Institution for Transformation (MITRA) has signed an agreement with the forum on urban transformation to provide the state government with \u201cstrategic and technical direction.\u201d Additionally, a thematic center focusing on healthcare and life sciences is scheduled to be established in Telangana. The Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness and Innovations (CEPI) has set a goal of developing new vaccines to combat future pandemics.\n\nGlobal Collaboration Village\n\nThe WEF has announced the launch of its own metaverse platform, called the Global Collaboration Village. The digital world, which looks like the actual town of Davos where the organization meets once a year, is designed to facilitate more efficient collaboration between world leaders.\n\nIndian Participation\n\nIndia has been collaborating with the WEF for 36 years, and this year, it is represented by a high-level delegation that includes Union Ministers, Chief Ministers, and Business leaders. India\u2019s focus areas at the WEF are investment opportunities, the infrastructural landscape, and its inclusive and sustainable growth story.\n\nDespite the COVID-19 crisis, India has crossed many barriers and repositioned itself as the fastest-growing economy. Prominent indicators for India to see robust economic growth include the World Bank\u2019s latest India development update, which predicts India\u2019s real GDP growth at 6.9 % in FY22-23, compared to 8.7 % in FY21-22.\n\nIndia@100: Realising the potential of a USD 26 trillion economy\n\nIndia has launched a report titled \u2018India@100: Realising the potential of a USD 26 trillion economy\u2019 on the sidelines of the summit. The report predicts that India\u2019s economy will reach USD 26 trillion by 2047, the 100th year of the country\u2019s independence.

Canada, through this plan, has designated four regions to focus on China, India, the North Pacific (Japan and Korea), and ASEAN. It refers to the\nIndo-Pacific, to which it also belongs, is \u201ca new horizon of opportunity.\u201d\nIn addition, it recognises that the largest diaspora in Canada is made up of \u201cpeople of Indo-Pacific origin\u201d (it has named 40 nations). 60% of Canada\u2019s overseas students live there, and \u201c1 in 5 Canadians have family ties to the area.\u201d\nThe United States, the European Union, Germany, France, and the United Kingdom have all boosted or are considering growing their presence in the region, and several of Canada\u2019s \u201cclosest allies\u201d have done the same.\nThe Indo-Pacific region is quickly becoming as the worldwide hub for economic dynamism and strategic difficulty.\n$1.7 billion in investment over five years, allocated to infrastructure projects through the US-led G7 Partnership for Global\nInfrastructure and Investment, $403 million for a third frigate in the Indian Ocean, and increased involvement in regional military drills.\nSignificance of Indo-Pacific Policy\n\nFollowing points describe the significance of the \u2018Indo-Pacific strategy\u2019.\n\nChoosing \u201cAsia Pacific\u201d over \u201cIndo-Pacific\u201d in Indo-pacific strategy:\nThe final G7 country to embrace the Indo-Pacific paradigm is Canada, which has 20% of its people born in the region.\nWith \u201cAsia Pacific,\u201d it was earlier more comfortable.\nChange in Canada\u2019s China policy:\nA sequence of actions from the previous year indicated a shift in Canada\u2019s stance on China, including a dramatic tightening of investment regulations to stop Chinese state businesses from seizing control of its crucial minerals and mines sector.\nA motion to label China\u2019s treatment of its Uighur minority as \u201cgenocide\u201d was approved by the Canadian Parliament.\nAlso prohibited was Huawei 5G.\nIndia-Canada ties after a freeze between 2020-2022 over several issues\nJoly\u2019s (Canadian Foreign Minister) visit is particularly significant because she was scheduled to visit Delhi again next month for the G-20 Foreign Minister\u2019s meeting and the G-20 summit later this year,\nbut she opted to travel to India instead for a stand-alone visit that is anticipated to pave the way for a continued thawing of ties between India and Canada after a freeze between 2020 and 2022 over several issues including attacks on people and establishments of Indian ancestry by Kha\nThe visit, which was primarily centred on Canada\u2019s recently unveiled Indo-Pacific policy, which names India as an important country, is considered as an effort by both sides to get bilateral relations back on track after several tumultuous years.\nNotably, the MEA press statement made no mention of the current hostilities resulting from alleged pro-Khalistani graffiti in Canada.\nPrime Minister Narendra Modi met with Canadian PM Justin Trudeau in June last year and is scheduled to welcome him for the G-20 conference in Delhi in September this year as well.\n2023- the year of India-Canada reset\nGiven the convergence of Indo-Pacific strategies, ongoing trade negotiations that could result in an Early Progress Trade Agreement (EPTA), and a series of high-level meetings this year, 2023 might turn out to be the year of India and Canada\u2019s reset.\nBefore a Comprehensive Economic Partnership Agreement, India is also negotiating the EPTA in addition to attracting investment from Canadian capital (CEPA).\nThere is a market for Canadian products and services in India, from clean technology to essential minerals and educational initiatives.\nOpportunities available for India to contribute to strengthening the region\u2019s various sectors\n\nIndia can effectively participate in the regions growing dynamism through its contributions in many areas.\n\nEnergy and Environment by Indo-pacific strategy:\nUtilizing cutting-edge technology like green hydrogen and focusing on areas like the blue economy where pre-existing frameworks and processes may be used to foster tighter economic cooperation are two ways to drive growth in the Indo-Pacific region.\nEconomy and Trade Linkages:\nAn important area of concern for the Indo-Pacific region is trade and economics. India\u2019s primary assets are its approach to regional finance and credit, supply chain resilience, and the soft power it derives from its extensive diaspora network.\nSecurity of Indo-pacific strategy:\nThe security domain forms the basis of the Indo-Pacific. Investigating the Indo-human, Pacific\u2019s marine and cyber security issues provides a multifaceted understanding of the problems there.\nScience and Technology:\nIn the Indo-Pacific area, where countries have a variety of capabilities, the technological exchange is crucial. India can make a contribution to international cooperation on data, digitization, and earth observation satellites by making use of its current technology infrastructure.\nIndia\u2019s Policy for Indo-pacific strategy\nA free, open, inclusive region.\nA common rules-based order for the region\nEqual access to common spaces on sea and in the air, as a right under international law\nCircumventing power rivalries through partnerships\nIndia aims to be a Net Security Provider, offer humanitarian assistance and acquire a solid and comprehensive strategic situational awareness of developments in the IOR.\nWhat forces are causing the world to turn to the Indo-pacific strategy?\nVast Natural Resources\nChina as a factor\nNon- Traditional Threats\u2013 piracy, illegal fishing, human trafficking, terrorism, and environmental dangers.\nThe region makes up:\n65% of the global population,\n44% of the planet\u2019s surface area,\n2% of global GDP,\n46% of global trade in goods.\nConclusion\n\nIt is impossible to overstate the significance of the Indo-Pacific area in India\u2019s foreign policy. The profusion of bilateral and multilateral initiatives in the Indo-Pacific, in which India is increasingly taking part, shows a rising convergence of world powers there. Both nations appear to be aware that Canada\u2019s vote-bank constraints and India\u2019s security worries must be overcome to try a bilateral relationship reset. India\u2019s strategic significance was emphasised in Canada\u2019s Indo-Pacific strategy.\n\nBased on a shared mistrust of China, it provides a larger staging area for the two to interact while attempting to strengthen economic ties and invest in supply chain resilience. China\u2019s escalating rivalry and provocations highlight the need for India to define a practical and strategic role for itself in the Indo-Pacific. The Indo-Pacific is currently the most crucial region in terms of geopolitics, and the moment is opportune to refocus on regional geopolitics.\n\nArticle written by Aseem Muhammed"

Although almost all of the South China Sea\u2019s coastal nations have ratified and signed the UNCLOS, its interpretation is still a subject of intense debate. Another maritime conflict is taking place in the East China Sea.\n\nAlso Read:\u00a0 COP26: UN Climate Change Conference 2021 \u2013 ClearIAS\n\nMaritime Zones under UNCLOS\n\nUnder UNCLOS, the oceans are divided into the following maritime zones, each of which has a distinct legal status:\n\nInternal Waters\nArchipelagic Waters\nTerritorial Sea\nContiguous Zone\nExclusive Economic Zone\nContinental Shelf\nHigh Seas\n\nLet us discuss more on these divisions.\n\nBaseline\n\nThe low-water line of the coasts as recognised by the coastal state is the maritime zone baseline.\n\nInternal Waters\nShips must abide by the laws and regulations of the coastal or port State when entering internal seas (Port State Control).\nInternal waters of the State include the seas on the landward side of the territorial sea\u2019s baseline.\nThe coastal State also has the right to take the appropriate action to prevent any violation of the conditions governing admission of those ships to internal waters or such a call in the case of ships travelling to internal waters or a call at a port facility outside internal seas.\nThere is no right of innocent passage unless territorial sea straight baselines are used to enclose waters that weren\u2019t previously internal waters.\nArchipelagic Waters\nThe major islands must be included in the archipelagic baselines.\nThe sea must be contained inside the archipelagic baselines in an area that is at least nine times smaller than the enclosed land area.\nExcept for up to 3% of the total number of baselines encompassing any archipelago, no archipelagic baseline may be longer than 100 nautical miles, with a maximum length of 125 nautical miles.\nThe archipelagic baselines must not deviate from the archipelago\u2019s overall layout in any meaningful way.\nTerritorial Sea\nThe territorial sea extends outward 12 nautical miles from its baselines.\nBased on the circle of the planet, a nautical mile (nm) is equivalent to one minute of latitude. It is far farther than a land mile (1 nautical mile equals 1.1508 land miles or 1.85 kilometres).\nThe coastal states have sovereign authority over the territorial sea. These rights extend to the seabed, the subsoil, and even the airspace in addition to the surface.\nHowever, the innocent passage of the territorial sea restricts the powers of coastal governments.\nContiguous Zone\nFrom its baselines, the contiguous zone extends out to sea up to 24 nautical miles.\nIn between the territorial sea and the high seas, it acts as a transitional zone.\nThe coastal state has the power to enforce fiscal, immigration, sanitary, and customs regulations within its borders and in its territorial waters.\nIn contrast to the territorial sea, the contiguous zone only grants state sovereignty over the ocean\u2019s surface and floor.

But these Russian settlers were driven out by Chinese soldiers between 1652 and 1689, but after 1689, China and Russia reached a trade agreement, the Treaty of Nerchinsk.\n\nThe present-day Mongolia region did not have a well-demarcated border between the Russian and Chinese kingdoms which stirred problems in the trade routes.\n\nIn 1729, just before his death, Peter the Great decided to deal with the border problem. The result was the Treaty of Kyakhta which defined the northern border of what is now Mongolia and opened up the Kyakhta caravan trade southeast to Peking.\n\nThe two empires\u2019 zones of authority collided in what is now eastern Kazakhstan and Western Xinjiang as the Chinese Empire established its rule over Xinjiang in the 1750s and the Russian Empire grew into Kazakhstan at the start and in the middle of the 19th century.\n\nTrade between the two nations in the area was made legal by the Kulja Treaty in 1851.\n\nIn 1858, during the Second Opium War, China grew increasingly weaker as the \u201cSick man of Asia\u201d while Russia strengthened and eventually annexed the north bank of the Amur River and the coast down to the Korean border in the \u201cUnequal Treaties\u201d of Treaty of Aigun (1858) and the Convention of Peking (1860).\n\nOver the next century, there were several border disputes and treaties signed between the two regions. Russia and Japan were both trying to take advantage of the weakened Chinese kingdom.\n\nSino-Soviet Split 1961\n\nThe Sino-Soviet split was the dissolution of political ties between the People\u2019s Republic of China and the Soviet Union as a result of differences resulting from their dissimilar understandings and applications of Marxism-Leninism during the Cold War (1947\u20131991) as influenced by their respective geopolitics.\n\nNikita Khrushchev visited China in 1958 and later Mikhail Gorbachev in 1989, after which there was a change in China-Russia relations.\n\nThe remnants of the Sino-soviet split lessened even more after the death of Mao Zedong in 1976, but the relations were still poor until the breakup of the Soviet Union in 1991.\n\nA decade after the Soviet Union broke up, disappointed and humiliated by the way the West had downgraded it, and deep in economic crisis, Russia turned to China.\n\nIn 2001, the close relations between the two countries were formalized with the Treaty of Good-Neighborliness and Friendly Cooperation, a twenty-year strategic, economic, and controversially implicit military treaty.\n\nThe United States\u2019 sanctions against Russia for its 2014 annexation of Crimea helped push Russia to a warmer relationship with China.\n\nChina does not recognize Russia\u2019s annexation of Crimea, and Russia does not support China\u2019s claims in the South China Sea. Nevertheless, China and Russia currently enjoy the best relations they have had since the late 1950s.\nAlthough they have no formal alliance, the two countries do have an informal agreement to coordinate diplomatic and economic moves and build up an alliance against the United States.\nLatest developments in China-Russia relations\n\nBoth the Chinese and Russian political systems are seen as authoritarian, with power being centralized in the hands of a single, long-serving leader in both countries.\n\nWhile Russia is a multiparty system ruled by Putin\u2019s United Russia party, China is a one-party state run by the Chinese Communist Party.\nTo maintain their power, both regimes have clamped down on domestic dissent and undercut the rule of law.\n\nFrom 2003 until 2013, mutual trade increased 7.7 times; in 2014 the scale of bilateral operations increased even more.\n\nThe Power of Siberia gas pipeline deal was signed which ensured the annual gas supply to China.\n\nIn January 2022, the two countries signed a deal for a pipeline, Power of Siberia 2, which will add 10 bcm of gas to the annual supply for 30 years.\n\nChina is Russia\u2019s largest trading partner as of now.\n\nThe two countries agreed to work towards speeding up the linking of the Russia-led Eurasian Economic Union and the Chinese Belt and Road Initiative.\n\nRussia also supported China\u2019s claim on Taiwan but China has not publicly supported Russia\u2019s war in Ukraine.\n\nBut Chinese officials have refused to condemn Russia for the war, and have blamed the United States and the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) for provoking Russia.\nDuring the 2008 global financial crisis, China and Russia saw the United States and the West decline.\n\nTogether, they worked to boost collaboration with each other as well as with emerging economies, such as Brazil and India through the BRIC grouping. (South Africa joined the group in 2010, and it was renamed the BRICS.)\n\nChina has focused on promoting trade and economic development, while Russia has supported the security and political stability of allied former Soviet republics.\n\nDespite having divergent interests in Central Asia, they have avoided conflict and worked together to maintain regional security through the Shanghai Cooperation Organization.\n\nChina and Russia don\u2019t have a formal alliance, and their militaries have never engaged in combat alongside one another, but defense cooperation has increased since 2014.\n\nGlobal implications of China-Russia relations\n\nThe growing bilateral alliance has led the US and Western countries to become united against the front.\n\nRussia\u2019s invasion of Ukraine has assisted the US in Europe in reviving and enlarging the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO).\nThe concern over Chinese territorial expansion in Asia has also been sparked by the Russian invasion. As a result, the US\u2019s bilateral partnerships with Australia and Japan have grown stronger.\n\nPacifist powers like Japan and Germany have spoken up against the alliance and its expansionist policies.\n\nBeing the third and fourth-largest economies in the world, respectively, Japan and Germany\u2019s mobilization dramatically change the correlation of forces between the West and the Russia-China axis.\nTo counter the security threats from China and Russia, Germany and Japan have also committed to increasing their defense budget.\n\nUS\u2019s Asian partners attended the NATO summit in June 2022 for the first time, and NATO committed to actively influencing the power dynamics in the Indo-Pacific region.\n\nFor China, its alliance with Russia during the Ukraine crisis may hamper the trade relations with the EU and other Eurasian countries.\n\nChina-Russia relations\u2019 Impact on India\n\nIndia is faced with its issues in how to handle relations between an ancient enemy and an old friend, while the warming China-Russia relationship undermines the Western-led world system.\n\nThe Sino-Russian partnership\u2019s effects on the India-Russia defense relationship, a crucial fulcrum of relations between New Delhi and Moscow, are essentially what motivate India\u2019s interests.\n\nAccording to the theory, the strengthening of Sino-Russian strategic and commercial ties as well as India\u2019s strategic and security cooperation with the US could lead Russia to lose interest in future defense supplies and possibly halt crucial deliveries of equipment and spare parts during emergencies.\nIncreased military cooperation between China and Russia as a result of the alliance could endanger Indian security by enhancing their military prowess.\n\nThe necessity to limit China\u2019s growing influence in the region apprises Indian foreign policy in Eurasia.\n\nThere are numerous economic and security convergences between Russia\u2019s Eurasian Economic Union program and India\u2019s outreach to Central Asia, especially on counterterrorism.\n\nBy continuing to put pressure on radical Islamist groups operating in the area and serving as a counterbalance to China, cooperation between India and Russia can offer a genuine balance in the region that includes Eurasia, Afghanistan, Pakistan, and Iran.\n\nWay forward\n\nThe China-Russia relationship is getting more and more unbalanced as China\u2019s economic and military capabilities are anticipated to increase in the years to come relative to Moscow\u2019s.\n\nFurthermore, China won\u2019t need a weakened partner if it can gradually stop importing Russian commodities like coal, gas, and oil. Moscow and Beijing are expected to get closer in 2023, but it\u2019s unclear whether this partnership will last.\n\nIndia should rebalance its defense imports to reduce the risk associated with reliance on a single source, according to an essential lesson learned from the situation in Ukraine.\n\nAs China gains significance for Russia, it is crucial to preserve the strength of that country\u2019s relationship with India as a counterbalance to its growing economic reliance on Beijing.\n\nIndia has a great deal of potential to help and supplement the Russian economy in general. It also has its reasons for wanting to continue having access to Russian energy and defense supplies.\n\nThe extent to which this trade potential can be realized, given the unprecedented Western sanctions and the considerable economic downturn in Russia, remains to be seen.\n\n\u00ad-Article written by Swathi Satish"

It has been counting down the minutes and seconds for 76 years, but on 24th January 2023, it was set to 90 seconds to midnight, which is the closest it has ever been to the actual time. The point of destruction is symbolized by midnight in mythology. Read here to know about the doomsday clock.\n\nAccording to the Bulletin of the Atomic Scientists, the Doomsday Clock is a symbol that denotes the propensity for a human-caused global calamity.\n\nThis year, the Science and Security Board of the Bulletin of the Atomic Scientists moves the hands of the Doomsday Clock forward, largely (though not exclusively) because of the mounting dangers of the war in Ukraine.\n\nThe Clock now stands at 90 seconds to midnight-the closest to the global catastrophe it has ever been.\n\nTable of Contents\n\nHistory of the Doomsday clock\nSources of threat influencing the doomsday clock\nNuclear risk\nClimate change\nBiological threats\nDisruptive technologies\nCriticism of the Doomsday clock\nHistory of the Doomsday clock\n\nThe Doomsday clock was created by Albert Einstein and researchers from the University of Chicago who worked on the Manhattan Project to create the first atomic weapons, by combining nuclear explosion imagery with the apocalypse (midnight) and the countdown to zero (zero) of modern culture.\n\nThe Doomsday Clock is set every year by the Bulletin\u2019s Science and Security Board in consultation with its Board of Sponsors, which includes 10 Nobel laureates.\n\n\ud83d\udc49 Which year are YOU targeting for success in the IAS/IPS/IFS Exam? \ud83d\ude80\n\n(1) \u21d2 UPSC 2025: Prelims cum Mains\n\n(2) \u21d2 UPSC 2026: Prelims cum Mains\n\n(3) \u21d2 UPSC 2027 Prelims cum Mains\n\nTip: Know more about ClearIAS Courses (Online/Offline)\n\nThe Science and Security Board (SASB) is comprised of a select group of globally recognized leaders with a specific focus on nuclear risk, climate change, and disruptive technologies.\nThe SASB provides the Bulletin with objective external perspectives on trends and issues in these related fields and connects the organization to outside experts.\n\nThe Clock\u2019s original setting in 1947 was seven minutes to midnight. It has since been set backward eight times and forwards 17 times for a total of 25, the farthest from midnight being 17 minutes in 1991, and the nearest being 90 seconds, set on January 24, 2023.\n\nAt 17 minutes to midnight, the clock was furthest from doomsday in 1991 as the Cold War ended and the US and Russia (then the Soviet Union) signed the Strategic Arms Reduction Treaty (START).\nSources of threat influencing the doomsday clock\n\nA deeper significance exists for \u201cMidnight\u201d than only the ongoing danger of war. When the scientists from The Bulletin of the Atomic Scientists evaluate what Midnight and \u201cglobal disaster\u201d actually mean in a specific year, they take several factors into account.\n\nPossible sources of threat include nuclear threats, climate change, bioterrorism, and artificial intelligence. They might also include politics, energy, weaponry, diplomacy, and climate science.\n\nNuclear risk\n\nBeyond the Ukraine conflict, previous trends of expansion and modernization of nuclear arsenals continue, with little progress to show in negotiations with either North Korea or Iran over their nuclear programs.\n\nUS and Russian nuclear forces are still constrained by New START, but there is no certainty the treaty will be extended beyond 2026.\nChina\u2019s considerable expansion of its nuclear capabilities is particularly troubling, given its consistent refusal to consider measures to enhance transparency and predictability.\nNorth Korea has greatly stepped up its intermediate- and longer-range missile testing.\nIran continues to increase its uranium enrichment capacity, albeit under international safeguards outside the confines of the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action that once restrained it.\nIndia continues to modernize its nuclear arsenal with new delivery systems now under development to complement or replace existing nuclear-capable aircraft, land-based delivery systems, and sea-based systems.\nPakistan has an arsenal of similar size and continues to expand its warheads, delivery systems, and fissile material production.\nThe United States, Russia, and China are now pursuing full-fledged nuclear weapons modernization programs, setting the table for a dangerous new \u201cthird nuclear age\u201d of competition.\nLong-standing concerns about arms racing in South Asia and missile arms races in Northeast Asia complete a dismal picture that needs to be addressed.\n\nAs a matter of priority, all five permanent members of the UN Security Council including Russia should make a renewed commitment to confront nuclear dangers through arms control efforts and strategic stability agreements.\n\nClimate change\n\nDue to Russia\u2019s position as the world\u2019s second-largest producer of natural gas and oil, behind the United States, the invasion of Ukraine triggered a rush to achieve energy independence, notably in the European Union.\n\nTwo competing dynamics have resulted from this in terms of climate change:\n\nThe elevated energy prices have spurred investment in renewables and motivated countries to implement policies that support renewables development.\nHigh natural gas prices have driven a race to develop new gas supplies, spurring investment in natural gas production and export infrastructure in the United States, the EU, Africa, and elsewhere, largely financed by major oil and gas transnationals and investment firms.\n\nAll G7 countries have pledged to end public financing of international fossil fuel projects this year.\n\nThe Beyond Oil and Gas Alliance, a group of eight countries, has formally committed to end new concessions, licensing, or leasing rounds for oil and gas production and exploration, and to set a timeline for ending production that is consistent with their Paris Agreement pledges.\n\nAs a consequence, global carbon dioxide emissions from burning fossil fuels, after having rebounded from the COVID economic decline to an all-time high in 2021, continued to rise in 2022 and hit another record high.\n\nThe rise in emissions in 2022 accelerated the ongoing increase in the concentration of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere, which will continue so long as emissions of carbon dioxide continue.\n\nNot only did weather extremes continue to plague diverse parts of the globe, but they were more evidently attributable to climate change.\n\nCountries of West Africa experienced floods that were among the most lethal in their histories, owing to a rainfall event that was assessed to be 80 times more likely because of climate change.\nExtreme temperatures in Central Europe, North America, China, and other regions of the Northern Hemisphere this past summer led to water shortages and soil drought conditions that led in turn to poor harvests, further undermining food security at a time when the Ukraine conflict has already driven food price increases.\nIt is Pakistan, however, that faced the year\u2019s most dramatic manifestation of Earth\u2019s increasingly volatile climate: intense floods due to a \u201cmonsoon on steroids\u201d that inundated one-third of the country.\n\nCountries were unable, however, to adopt a formal decision to agree to phase out fossil fuels, and even more disappointing, they did essentially nothing to assure that previous commitments to reach net zero greenhouse gas emissions would be fulfilled.\n\nBiological threats\n\nThe existing biological threat landscape makes clear that the international community needs to improve its ability to prevent disease outbreaks, detect them quickly when they occur, and respond effectively to limit their scope.\n\nDevastating events like the COVID-19 pandemic can no longer be considered rare, once-a-century occurrences.\n\nThe total number and diversity of infectious disease outbreaks have increased significantly since 1980, with more than half caused by zoonotic diseases.\n\nLaboratory accidents continue to occur frequently.\n\nOpportunities for human error, limited understanding of novel disease characteristics, lack of local government knowledge about the types of research occurring in labs in their jurisdictions, and confusion about lab safety requirements all challenge current laboratory biosafety and biosecurity programs.\n\nLeaders around the world must confront the possibility of global catastrophic biological risks.\n\nBiological events could lead to sudden, extraordinary, widespread disasters that test or exceed the collective capability of national and international governments and the private sector to control.\n\nPathogens are not stopped by national borders. Devastating illness, widespread death, and disease-induced disaster can be avoided if countries around the world cooperate on global health strategies and make investments in science, technology, research, and development in the biosecurity sector.\n\nDisruptive technologies\n\nThreats from disruptive technologies are varied sorts of threats to the global environment.\n\nDisruptive technology displaces an established technology and shakes up the industry or a ground-breaking product that creates a completely new industry.\n\nThe extensive use of surveillance technologies has disturbing implications for human rights and poses a distinct threat to civil society.\nThe world continues to suffer from widespread cyberattacks.\nCriticism of the Doomsday clock\n\nThe Clock has become a universally recognized indicator of the world\u2019s vulnerability to the global catastrophe caused by manmade technologies.\n\nMany researchers have expressed concern about the permanent high alert set by the doomsday clock for humanity and policy making.\n\nThere has also been criticism that it is not consistent and not based on objective indicators of security.\n\nThere have also been statements regarding the doomsday clock being a political agenda.\n\n\u00ad-Article written by Swathi Satish"

The world\u2019s most populous nation experiencing a population decline of up to 8,50,000 in 2022 will have a profound impact on both China and the rest of the world.\n\nOn January 17, Beijing reported that there were 10.41 million deaths and 9.56 million births in China in 2017.\n\nAfter unexpectedly abandoning its zero-tolerance policy against the covid in early December 2022, China experienced an increase in mortality connected to the covid.\nThis year will probably see more Covid-related deaths than usual since infections are still spreading across the nation and because fatalities typically follow illnesses by a few weeks.\nThe number of deaths this year may increase as a result of that outbreak.\n\nLessons can be learned from China\u2019s demographic tale by nations that have attempted significant social engineering efforts.\n\nChina has been attempting and failing for the better part of two decades to encourage families to increase birth rates, which have been falling since the government enacted a strict \u201cone-child policy\u201d in 1980.\nThe late implementation of a \u201ctwo-child policy\u201d in 2016 to address the situation did not elicit the positive response that the planners had anticipated for a relaxation announced with fanfare.\nAccording to a government survey, 70% of respondents said they could not afford to have more children.\n\nThe demographic shift is already affecting China\u2019s economy.\n\n875 million people between the ages of 16 and 59 were in the labor force in 2022, down around 75 million from 2010.\nLabor-intensive jobs are leaving the country, primarily for Southeast Asia, as wages rise.\nMeanwhile, there were now 280 million people over the age of 60, a rise of 30 million.\nBy 2050, there will be 487 million senior people or 35% of the population.\nAccording to China\u2019s National Working Commission on Aging, by 2050, the GDP will be devoted to elderly health care at a rate of 26%.\nThere are indications that China is already headed in the direction of Japan\u2019s example of a protracted era of falling GDP and a dwindling workforce.\n\nAccording to a study by the Research Institute of Economy, Trade, and Industry of Japan, the proportion of children and elderly people in China in 2020 was comparable to that in Japan in 1990.\n\nFurthermore, China arrived at this turning point earlier than Japan, whose fertility rate dropped from 1.75 to 1.29 in the preceding four decades whereas China\u2019s decreased from 2.74 to 1.28.\nThe study noted that India\u2019s proportion of children and seniors in 2020 was comparable to China\u2019s in 1980, right before that country\u2019s economic growth began.\nThat was only made feasible by utilizing its demographic dividend to the fullest by making significant investments in health care and education to create a workforce capable of running what would eventually become the world\u2019s factory.\n\nThere are also societal repercussions-\n\nAs the population ages, there will be fewer employees to pay for pensions and healthcare, which will result in a rise in demand for these services and put pressure on China\u2019s social security system.\nBecause many young people are already working to support their parents and two sets of grandparents, there will also be fewer people to care for the elderly.\n\nAlso read: Fertility Rate in India: Reasons for Decline\n\nGlobal impact of China\u2019s population decline\n\nChina\u2019s problems may affect the rest of the globe because of its importance as the engine of the global economy.\n\nThe epidemic has demonstrated how China\u2019s internal issues can impact the flow of trade and investment, as border controls and lockdowns hurt supply chains.\nA weakening Chinese economy could undermine China\u2019s goal to surpass the US as the greatest economy, in addition to slowing down global growth.\nIn the next twenty to thirty years, China\u2019s limited capacity to respond to this demographic shift will probably result in slower growth results and have an impact on its capacity to compete with the United States on the global stage.\nChina has assumed a central position in global supply chains, so anything that affects China will have knock-on effects on the world economy.\n\nSuch problems are not exclusive to China. The population is aging quickly in other East Asian nations as well, including South Korea and Japan.\n\nA similar population decrease has long plagued numerous European countries, including Germany and Italy.\n\nThe situation in China, however, is unique. Its population is aging and declining yet it is still a middle-income nation, which makes financing socio-economic development more difficult.\n\nResponse of the Chinese government\n\nOfficials in China have increased their efforts to support larger families, notably through a multi-agency plan unveiled last year to expand maternity leave and provide tax discounts and other benefits to families.\n\nThey want to create a legislative framework that will increase fertility rates while lowering the price of childbearing, childrearing, and education.\n\nThey also intend to develop aged care programs and services, implement a proactive national policy in response to population aging, and improve services for elderly persons who are living alone.\n\nThe common people are asking for wider national reforms. Issues like low salaries and high rents increase the financial pressure on the earning member.\n\nConclusion\n\nThere have been many opinions that the population decrease is good as it would free up more resources needed to increase the standard of living and boost economic growth.\n\nSome researchers think that the smaller population will benefit from climate change and the environment, especially during the exponentially accelerating global warming and biodiversity loss.\n\nThe world\u2019s population expansion makes it difficult to end global hunger and poverty, as well as to slow down climate change, but China is not the only country that is concerned about its population loss and its age demographics, which are becoming more skewed.\n\nDue to low birth rates and outward migration, the U.N. predicts that 61 nations or territories would see population declines of 1% or more between 2022 and 2050.\n\nThe World Health Organization predicts that by 2030, one in six persons would be 60 years old or older.\n\n\u00ad-Article written by Swathi Satish"

The federal capital was Belgrade.\n\nThe Socialist Republic of Serbia and the socialist autonomous province of Kosovo were part of the new federation.\n\nBy 1948, Yugoslavia distanced itself from the Soviet Union and started its brand of socialism under Josip Broz Tito.\n\nThe socialist political philosophy called Titoism rose during the cold war period.\nIt is characterized by a broad Yugoslav identity, workers\u2019 self-management, political separation from the Soviet Union, and leadership in the Non-Aligned Movement.\n\nIn 1963, the nation was renamed the Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia with Tito as President for life.\n\nThe ethnic tensions and economic crisis raked the country for a long duration after this.\n\nAfter Tito\u2019s death on 4 May 1980, ethnic tensions grew in Yugoslavia.\n\nThe Albanian majority in Kosovo demanded the status of a republic in the 1981 protests in Kosovo while Serbian authorities suppressed this sentiment and proceeded to reduce the province\u2019s autonomy.\n\nThe Yugoslav wars started amid protests among the different Republics and autonomous provinces.\n\nIn 1991, Slovenia and Croatia became the first republics to declare independence from Yugoslavia.\nLater in 1991, the Republic of Macedonia also declared independence and gained sovereignty without resistance from Belgrade.\nIn 1992, Bosnia and Herzegovina\u2019s independence was recognized by the US and other European states.\nIn 1992, Serbia and Montenegro formed the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia.\nIn 2006, Montenegro became an independent nation after a referendum, leaving Serbia as the successor of FR Yugoslavia.\nIn February 2008, the Republic of Kosovo declared independence from Serbia, leading to an ongoing dispute on whether Kosovo is a legally recognized state.\n\nYugoslavia finally broke down into seven independent nations namely-\n\nBosnia and Herzegovina (Capital: Sarajevo)\nCroatia (Capital: Zagreb)\nKosovo (Capital: Pristina)\nMontenegro (Capital: Podgorica)\nNorth Macedonia (Capital: Skopje)\nSerbia (Capital: Belgrade)\nSlovenia (Capital: Ljubljana)\nKosovo-Serbia Conflict\n\nThe Kosovo War was an armed war that took place in Kosovo\u00a0from 28 February 1998 to 11 June 1999. The forces of the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia, or Serbia and Montenegro, which had previously governed Kosovo, engaged in it.\n\nAlbanian-majority Kosovo declared independence with the backing of the West, following a 1998-99 war in which NATO intervened to protect ethnic Albanians.\n\nAround 50,000 ethnic Serbs living in northern Kosovo refuse to recognize the government in Pristina or the status of Kosovo as a separate country. They have the support of many Serbs in Serbia and its government.\n\nThe modern Albanian-Serbian conflict has its roots in the expulsion of Albanians in 1877-1878 from areas that were incorporated into the Principality of Serbia.\n\nExpelled Albanians settled in Kosovo and between 1876 and 1878 there were attacks on and in 1901 massacres of Kosovan Serbs.\nTensions between the Serbian and Albanian communities in Kosovo simmered throughout the 20th century and occasionally erupted into major violence, particularly during the First Balkan War (1912-13), World War I (1914-18), and World War II (1939-45).\nCurrent status of the conflict\n\nSerbs in Kosovo want to create an association of majority-Serb municipalities that would operate with greater autonomy. Serbia and Kosovo have made little progress on this and other issues since committing in 2013 to the EU-sponsored dialogue.\n\nSince 2022 fresh ethnic tension has flared up between Kosovo-Serbia. The Serbs have been putting up roadblocks and Belgrade had increased armed presence on the border.\n\nGlobal response to Kosovo-Serbia Conflict\n\nKosovo has been a source of tension between the West, which supported its independence, and Russia for more than 20 years.\n\nRussia backs Serbia in its attempts to prevent Kosovo from joining international organizations like the UN.\n\nNATO has about 3,700 troops stationed in Kosovo to maintain the peace. The alliance said it would intervene in line with its mandate if stability in the area were jeopardized.\nThe European Union Rule of Law Mission in Kosovo (EULEX), which arrived in 2008, still has around 200 special police officers there.\n\nThe European Union and the United States are concerned about the continued tense situation in the north of Kosovo.\n\nOver 100 countries like the US, France, and Germany have recognized the Republic of Kosovo and established diplomatic relations.\n\nIndian stand on the Kosovo-Serbia issue\n\nIndia has been on the side of Serbia in the Kosovo-Serbia Conflict.Severalf countries, including Mexico, Brazil, China, India, and Brazil, do not recognize Kosovo.\n\nIndia has insisted that UNSC Resolution 1244, which intended to create an \u201cinterim government for Kosovo\u201d to resolve the political turmoil there at the time, conflicts with Kosovo\u2019s proclamation of independence.\n\nThis goes back to the fact that Jawaharlal Nehru and then Yugoslavian President Tito were founders of the Non-aligned movement.\nBelgrade, the capital of Serbia, was the host of the First Summit of the Non-Aligned Movement in September 1961.\n\nSince Yugoslavia\u2019s dissolution, India and Serbia have developed closer connections. The increased flow of individuals between the two countries is one example of this.\n\nIndian people are no longer required to obtain visas for stays of up to 30 days in Serbia since 2017, which significantly increased the number of Indian tourists that travel there.\n\nBut India and Kosovo share a trade body known as India-Kosovo Trade Commerce Economic Office (IKCEO) inaugurated in November 2022.\n\nIKCEO is a trade association, independent of the government, formed by business people in Kosovo and those in India.\nThe basic idea is to find common ground and let some business roots open, especially for sectors like agriculture, energy, and tourism.\n\nAlso read: Disintegration of the USSR (1991): Reasons and Impact\n\n\u00ad-Article written by Swathi Satish"

The menace of terrorism has always been a threat to global peace and financing the activities by states and other sources is on the rise.

Let us examine the advantages of nuclear-powered submarines over conventional submarines.\n\nAdvantages of nuclear-powered submarines over conventional submarines\nA nuclear-powered submarine (SSN) gives a navy the capability to reach far out into the ocean and launch attacks.\nNuclear propulsion, being completely independent of the air, does not need the surface frequently, as is necessary for conventional submarines.\nThe huge amount of power generated by the nuclear reactor helps the nuclear submarines to operate at high speed for long periods of time and the current generations of nuclear submarines do not need to be refuelled throughout their 25-year lifespans.\nIn news:\n\nAUKUS grouping came into prominence when Australia ended a multi-billion dollar contract with France signed in 2016 to build 12 diesel-electric submarines to replace its existing Collins submarine fleet. It instead signed a new defence pact with US and UK. The deal marks the first time the US has shared nuclear propulsion technology with an ally apart from the UK.\n\nChina\u2019s response\n\nRelations between the three allies and China were already at a low. The AUKUS deal did not name China directly but was widely understood to be in response to its expansionism in the South China Sea and aggression towards Taiwan. It drew a swift response from Beijing. A Chinese foreign ministry spokesperson said the three countries were in the grip of an \u201cobsolete cold war zero-sum mentality and narrow-minded geopolitical concepts\u201d and should \u201crespect regional people\u2019s aspiration [\u2026] otherwise they will only end up hurting their own interests\u201d.\n\nWhy should India worry?\n\nIndia has been placed on the Strategic Trade Authorisation-1 (STA-1) list in 2018 after being recognized as a \u2018major defence partner\u2019 in 2016. Despite this, no major technology has been shared with India till now. This is a concern for India given that Australia is now acquiring one of the most advanced technologies of the US, under the aegis of AUKUS.\n\nConclusion\n\nDespite indifference towards AUKUS, India\u00a0may derive secondary benefits from the AUKUS arrangement\u00a0having three advanced nations with arguably the most sophisticated military power in the world coming together to support a free and open Indo-Pacific in the light of the increasingly assertive attitude of China in the region. This could provide\u00a0some degree of deterrence to China. Also, India\u2019s concerns regarding \u2018encirclement\u2019 by China\u00a0may be partially mitigated by AUKUS.\n\nRelated article: Five Eyes Alliance\n\nArticle written by: Caroline\u00a0"

Both the countries\u00a0have strong historical ties that are based on mutual respect and cooperative efforts that benefit both parties. Read to know more about India-Russia Relations.\n\nThis relationship between India and Russia officially began following the collapse of the Soviet Union. Since 1947, India and Russia have had cordial connections. Through investment in heavy machinery manufacturing, mining, energy production, and steel plants, Russia assisted India in achieving its aim of economic self-sufficiency. The citizens of both countries have supported this strategic alliance, which has endured the test of time.\n\nIndia and Russia has recently commemorated 75 years of diplomatic relations. This has happened in the midst of the battle between Russia and Ukraine.\n\nTable of Contents\n\nHistory of India-Russia Relations\nPolitical Relations\nDefense Relations\nEnergy Relations\nTrade Relations\nCultural Relations\nSignificance\nIn the news\nWay Forward\nHistory of India-Russia Relations\n\nUSSR was India\u2019s most trusted Ally. USSR not only contributed to India\u2019s security, it has been a pillar of India\u2019s scientific and industrial development.\n\nImmediately after the end of the cold war, Russia adopted a Pro-West policy, it came under US pressure. Russia denied technology transfer related to cryogenic engines and even insisted on settling the debts in dollars.\n\nHowever very soon it realized that it could not trust the west and reviewed its treaty of peace and friendship with India.\n\nIt was during Putin\u2019s visit that India-Russia relations entered into a strategic partnership in 2000, which was elevated into Special and Privileged partners in 2010.\n\n\ud83d\udc49 Which year are YOU targeting for success in the IAS/IPS/IFS Exam? \ud83d\ude80\n\n(1) \u21d2 UPSC 2025: Prelims cum Mains\n\n(2) \u21d2 UPSC 2026: Prelims cum Mains\n\n(3) \u21d2 UPSC 2027 Prelims cum Mains\n\nTip: Know more about ClearIAS Courses (Online/Offline)\n\nThe two nations are participants in several international organizations and connectivity initiatives. This comprises the Shanghai Cooperation Organization\u00a0and the BRICS (Brazil, Russia, India, China, and South Africa) nations, the Group of Nuclear Suppliers (NSG), and the United Nations Security Council (UNSC).\n\nPolitical Relations\n\nThe highest level of institutionalized conversation in the strategic partnership between India and Russia occurs at the annual summit meeting between the Prime Minister of India and the President of the Russian Federation.\n\nThe order of St. Andrew the Apostle, Russia\u2019s highest state decoration, was presented to Prime Minister Narendra Modi on April 12, 2019, as per an executive decree approved by President Putin. The order was given to the prime minister in recognition of his outstanding contribution to the establishment of cordial connections between the Russian, and Indian peoples and a privileged strategic partnership between Russia and India.\n\nAnnual meetings are held by two intergovernmental commissions: the IRIGC-TEC for trade, economic, scientific, technological, and cultural cooperation and the IRIGC-MTC for military-technical cooperation.\n\nNew Delhi needs Moscow\u2019s support to gain\u00a0a permanent seat on the UN Security Council.\n\nDefense Relations\n\nOne of the main pillars of bilateral relations between India and the former Soviet Union and later with Russia was its defense cooperation.\n\nMilitary-technical cooperation between India and Russia has developed from a buyer-seller model to one that involves collaborative research, development, and manufacture of cutting-edge defense technology and systems.\n\nIn Vladivostok, the inaugural Tri-Services exercise known as \u201cINDRA 2017\u201d was held. Examples of such landmark cooperation include the BrahMos Missile System and the licensed production of SU-30 aircraft and T-90 tanks in India.\n\nAdditionally, Russia is crucial in helping the Indian Navy with its submarine-related projects. Russia supplied the first submarine of the \u201cFoxtrot Class\u201d for the Indian Navy.\n\nIndia and Russia signed a historic deal in October 2018 to buy five S-400 Triumf surface-to-air missile defense systems\u2014among the strongest missile defense systems in the world\u2014for $5.43 billion, ignoring the CAATSA statute of the United States.\n\nIndia\u2019s nuclear submarine program is reliant on Russia. The only aircraft carrier used by India, INS Vikramaditya, is similarly Russian in origin.\n\nEnergy Relations\n\nAccording to the International Energy Agency, India will surpass Japan this year to become the third-largest oil consumer in the world. By 2040, India is predicted to have the highest rate of growth in the world\u2019s crude demand.\n\nIt is necessary to revitalize the oil and gas investments and exports between Russia and India. India is buying more oil from Russia at cheaper prices.\n\nIn terms of the peaceful use of nuclear energy, Russia is a crucial ally for India. It acknowledges India as a nation with cutting-edge nuclear technology and a spotless non-proliferation record.\n\nIn India, the Kudankulam Nuclear Power Plant (KKNPP) is being constructed with Russian assistance.\n\nTogether with the Ministry of Science and Technology, DAE signed a trilateral Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) on cooperation in the execution of the Rooppur NPP construction project in Bangladesh.\n\nTrade Relations\n\nIndia, which has one of the fastest-growing economies in the world, is viewed as a potential solution by Russia for its economic woes.\n\nRussia\u2019s governmental and corporate sectors would be open to be working with the Make in India initiative.\n\nConstruction, large-scale infrastructure projects like dedicated freight corridors and industrial clusters, smart cities, and engineering services are areas where Russian companies have expressed a readiness to invest in India while also exchanging technology and expertise.\n\nMajor investment opportunities in Russia are being investigated by Indian businesses, particularly in the natural resources of coal, fertilizer, hydrocarbons, minerals, and rare earth metals.\n\nThe trade percentage between the two countries significantly decreased from 2013 to 2016. However, it started to rise after 2017, and a steady rise was also seen in 2018 and 2019.\n\nCultural Relations\n\nIndian studies have a long history in Russia. In addition to teaching Hindi, Russian educational institutions also teach Tamil, Marathi, Gujarati, Bengali, Urdu, Sanskrit, and Pali.\n\nRussians are generally interested in Indian dance, music, yoga, and Ayurveda.\n\nTo encourage intercultural exchanges between Russia and India, there are ongoing cultural projects.\n\nThe Year of Indian Culture \u201cNamaste Russia\u201d was launched by the President of India on May 10 in Moscow.\n\nAt the State Duma of the Russian Federation, an exhibition commemorating Mahatma Gandhi\u2019s 150th birthday and detailing his connection with Russian author Leo Tolstoy was unveiled on October 2.\n\nSignificance\n\nOne of the biggest arms exporters to India has been Russia.\n\nA turning point in India-China ties was caused by Chinese aggression in eastern Ladakh\u2019s border regions, but it also showed how Russia may help ease tensions with China.\n\nNew economic engagement sectors, such as mining, agro-industrial, and high technology, including robotics, nanotechnology, and biotechnology, are projected to emerge in addition to conventional cooperation areas like weaponry, hydrocarbons, nuclear energy, and diamonds.\n\nIndia\u2019s influence in the Arctic and the Far East of Russia is expected to grow. Projects involving connectivity could also benefit.\n\nIn the news\n\nThe 22nd India-Russia Annual Summit, held in Moscow on July 8-9, 2024, saw significant discussions and agreements between Prime Minister Narendra Modi and Russian President Vladimir Putin. Key highlights of the summit include:\n\nEconomic Cooperation: Both leaders emphasized enhancing economic ties, particularly in the energy, manufacturing, and technology sectors. They discussed expanding cooperation in the field of nuclear energy and space exploration.\nDefence Collaboration: The summit focused on strengthening defence cooperation, with joint military exercises and technology transfer agreements. The continuation of defence supplies and the potential co-development of advanced defence systems were also key topics.\nRegional and Global Issues: Modi and Putin exchanged views on regional stability and global security, focusing on the situations in Afghanistan, Syria, and Ukraine. They also discussed counter-terrorism efforts and the importance of a multipolar world order.\nCultural and Educational Ties: There was an agreement to enhance cultural exchanges and academic collaborations, including student exchange programs and research partnerships between universities.\nEnergy Security: Discussions included increasing oil and gas supplies to India and collaborating on renewable energy projects to enhance energy security for both nations.\nTrade and Investment: Both leaders expressed the desire to boost bilateral trade and investment, with a target to achieve a substantial increase in trade volume by 2030.\nWay Forward\n\nThough there are serious concerns, India and Russia need to be transparent and maintain the channels of communication.\n\nIndia is one such country that will not go against the rise of China. On the other hand, Russia may have to pay a considerable price if Russia goes for allowing China\u2019s dominance in Central Asia. India should use its position for Bridge building against the rising China.\n\nAt the same time, Russia should also not forget the role of Pakistan in the split of the USSR which Putin himself considers the biggest geopolitical disaster.\n\nIndia should draw Red Line. Russia can go ahead with the partnership with Pakistan and China in the present age of interdependence. Yet Russia should not take any action which can cause India\u2019s security. India needs Candid dialogue.\n\nIndia did the right thing in reminding Russia that one old friend is better than two new ones.\n\nRussia is not the USSR and India of the 21st century is not dependent on Russia as it used to be.\n\nIndia should look at Russia with clear-eyed realism. As middle powers, there is a lot Delhi and Moscow can do with each other.\n\nThe nostalgic open relationship may be useful but cannot drive the relationship at present. The weakest aspect of India Russia relationship is that it is government-government relations. It\u2019s high to strengthen economic engagement and people-to-people contact.\n\nIn order to improve their positions during a period of change in the international order, both India and Russia will need to learn how to manage their relationships in the face of difficulties arising from both bilateral and regional as well as global forces.\n\nArticle written by Chetna Yadav"

This period came to a natural end during the late 1960s as the experimental phase of nuclear energy evolved into commercial and industrial development.\n\nBy early 1970, the Agency\u2019s role had changed to one where the major emphasis was placed on providing a forum for coordinating the national nuclear programmes of member countries, particularly in the health, safety and regulatory areas.\n\nIn the early 1990s, in the wake of the dissolution of the Soviet Bloc, the Agency followed the lead of the OECD and initiated a limited programme of outreach, focusing primarily on the countries of Central and Eastern Europe and former Soviet Europe.\n\nWhile the Agency has evolved in important ways, it has maintained the key features from which it derives its comparative advantage, including the homogeneity of its membership, its flexible working methods, the depth and quality of its technical work, and its small size and cost-effectiveness.\n\nThe name was changed on 20 April 1972 to its current name after Japan\u00a0became a member.\n\nGovernance of Nuclear Energy Agency (NEA)\nSteering Committee:\nThe NEA is governed by the Steering Committee for Nuclear Energy, which reports directly to the OECD Council. This committee is primarily made up of senior officials from national atomic energy authorities and associated ministries.\nIt oversees and shapes the work of the Agency to ensure its responsiveness to member countries\u2019 needs, notably in establishing the biennial programmes of work and budgets.\nStanding technical committees and joint undertakings:\nThe NEA framework of standing technical committees, joint international undertakings, and Secretariat-serviced, separately-funded bodies allows the Agency to be flexible and responsive.\nAfter 60 years of international service, NEA\u2019s scientific and technical work is at the forefront of knowledge. Through the work of over 70 working parties and expert groups, the NEA publishes consensus positions on key issues to provide credible references and examples of best practices.\nNEA joint projects and information exchange programmes also allow interested members and non-members to join forces in carrying out research projects on a cost-sharing basis.\nSecretariat:\nIn 2021, the NEA Secretariat is composed of 104 staff members from 19 countries.\nProfessional staff are often specialists from national administrations and research institutes, bringing their experience to the Agency for two to five years on average.\nMember countries of NEA:\n\nNEA currently consists of 34 countries from Europe, North America and the Asia-Pacific region. In 2021, Bulgaria was accessioned to NEA as its most recent member. In 2022, following Russia\u2019s invasion of Ukraine, Russia\u2019s membership was suspended.\nTogether they account for approximately 85% of the world\u2019s installed nuclear capacity. Nuclear power accounts for almost a quarter of the electricity produced in NEA Member countries. The NEA works closely with the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) in Vienna and with the European Commission in Brussels.\nWithin the OECD, there is close coordination with the International Energy Agency and the Environment Directorate, as well as contacts with other directorates, as appropriate.\nIndia and China are not member states but are Strategic partners\nStatute of NEA\nThe\u00a0Statute\u00a0of the NEA takes the form of a Decision originally adopted by the Council of the Organisation for European Economic Co-operation on 20 December 1957 and subsequently approved by the OECD Council on 30 September 1961.\nAt that time, the Agency\u2019s members included European countries only, and it was called the European Nuclear Energy Agency. In line with the Agency\u2019s growing membership, the Statute was amended by successive decisions of the Council, and the name of the Agency has changed accordingly.\nFinally, the Statute was modernised by several decisions of the Council in 1978, 1992 and 1995.\nActivities and operations of NEA:\n\nTo fulfil its mission, the Agency will:\n\nServe as a forum for sharing and analysing information and experience among member countries,\nFoster international cooperation in the nuclear field,\nHelp member countries pool and maintain their technical expertise and human infrastructure, and support their nuclear activities,\nProvide member countries with nuclear policy analyses,\n\nTo fulfil its mission the NEA will pursue work within the following sector-specific activities:\n\nNuclear safety research\nNuclear safety regulation\nNuclear economics\nRadioactive waste management\nRadiological protection and public health\nNuclear law and liability\nNuclear science\nThe Data Bank\nInformation and communication\nThe NEA also provides technical secretariat services for the following initiatives:\nGeneration IV International Forum (GIF)\nInternational Framework for Nuclear Energy Cooperation (IFNEC)\nMultinational Design Evaluation Programme (MDEP)\n\nArticle written by Aseem Muhammed"

The latest members are Saint Kitts and Nevis; and Tonga, which joined the IAEA in 2022.\nThe current Director-General of the organisation is Rafael Mariano Grossi.\nFunctions of International Atomic Energy Agency\n\n1. Works with its Member States and multiple partners worldwide for Promoting and assisting the research, development and practical applications of peaceful uses of nuclear technologies.\n\n2. Establishing and administering safety guards to ensure that such research/development, etc., by the IAEA is not used for military purposes.\n\n3. Applying, under the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty (NPT) and other international treaties, mandatory comprehensive safeguards in non-nuclear-weapon states (NNWS) parties to such treaties.\n\nIAEA Governance\n\nThe IAEA has two policymaking bodies. They are- the General Conference and Board of Governors.\n\n1. General Conference of IAEA: It is made up of each of the IAEA\u2019s member nations, and it convenes annually for its regular session. The yearly regular budget is established by General Conference, and it also handles extra-budgetary monies and voluntarily provided contributions to the Technical Cooperation Fund.\n\n2. Board of Governors: It consists of 35 members.\u00a0Each board members have one vote. The Board generally meets five times a year. Its key functions are-\n\nRecommendations to the General Conference on IAEA activities and budget.\nResponsible for publishing IAEA standards.\nResponsible for making most of the policies of the IAEA.\nAppoints the Director General subject to General Conference approval.\n\n3. Secretariat: Vienna International Centre, in Vienna, Austria, serves as home to the IAEA Secretariat. The Director-General and six Deputy Director-Generals oversee the Agency\u2019s six principal divisions. The professional and administrative personnel of the IAEA make up its Secretariat.\n\nInternational Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) and India\nSince 1957, India has been a founding member of the IAEA.\nIn January 2020, India joined the IAEA Response and Assistance Network (RANET). Response and Assistance Network (RANET)is a group of countries that provide assistance in reducing the consequences of nuclear or radiological emergencies.\nThe IAEA certified the nuclear power plant at Rawatbhata in Rajasthan in 2012, which drew criticism as the power plant had two incidents of leakage of nuclear material earlier that year.\nIAEA Safeguards\nSafeguards are activities by which the IAEA can verify that a State is living up to its international commitments not to use nuclear programmes for nuclear-weapons purposes.\nSafeguards are based on assessments of the correctness and completeness of a State\u2019s declared nuclear material and nuclear-related activities.\nVerification measures include on-site inspections, visits, and ongoing monitoring and evaluation.\nBasically, two sets of measures are carried out in accordance with the type of safeguards agreements in force with a State.\nOne set relates to verifying State reports of declared nuclear material and activities.\nAnother set enables the IAEA not only to verify the non-diversion of declared nuclear material but also to provide assurances as to the absence of undeclared nuclear material and activities in a State.\nIssues with International Atomic Energy Agency\nThe International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) has no authority to trump the sovereignty of any UN member state.\nThe five permanent members of the UNSC, who collectively own some of the largest nuclear arsenals in the world, are never criticised by the IAEA for their nuclear hegemony.\nThe IAEA made up for what it lacked in genuine authority over sovereign nations by fostering some strong leadership whose activities helped keep the non-proliferation debate on the world agenda.\nAdditionally, the IAEA has shown to be poor at shielding nuclear discussions from the influence of power politics.\nThis was especially evident when Pakistan continued its nuclear weapons programme in the 1980s despite the American authorities having access to overwhelming proof.\nDue to the U.S. and Pakistan\u2019s collaboration on the Afghan front, they were unable to properly pursue the matter through the IAEA.\nWhen great nations supported the Agency\u2019s operations in Iran, the unequal authority generated results.\nIAEA- Iran Challenge\nIran pledged to follow the rules governing nuclear facilities under the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA), which was signed by Iran and other major world powers, including the United States. Iran also welcomed international inspections by the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA).\nThe Iran-P5+1 (China, France, Russia, the United Kingdom, the United States, and Germany) talks that took place between 2013 and 2015 led to the JCPOA. Iran consented to drastically reduce its stockpiles of heavy water, enriched uranium, and centrifuges\u2014all essential components for nuclear weapons.\nAs part of the JCPOA, Iran also promised to put in place a mechanism that would grant access to its nuclear sites to IAEA inspectors, preventing Iran from secretly developing nuclear weapons.\nUp until 2020, Iran was governed and observed by the IAEA.

Voting is used to make decisions if consensus cannot be achieved.\nA president and two vice presidents are chosen by the members to serve three-year terms as the Assembly\u2019s leaders.\nFour organs:\nThere are four organs of the International Criminal Court (ICC): Presidency, Judicial Division, Office of the Prosecutor and Registry.\nThe ICC has established several field offices in the nations where investigations are taking place.\nThe International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) is the organisation in charge of inspecting the detention facility where those arrested by the ICC are sent.\nThe fact that it had a cooperation arrangement with the UN while not being a United Nations organisation must also be recognised.\nWhat are its functions?\n\nThe ICC\u2019s duties are structured to be consistent with the member states\u2019 current judicial systems.\n\nThe International Criminal Court (ICC) can only prosecute a person when the country in question is unable to do so. Instead of replacing national courts, the ICC seeks to supplement them.\n\nThe ICC seeks to put an end to impunity and ensure that those who commit serious crimes against humanity are brought to justice.\n\nIt is controlled by the Rome Statute, an international law. The Statute becomes effective on July 1, 2002.\n\nIt uses English and French as its working languages. English, French, Arabic, Chinese, Spanish, and Russian are the six official tongues.\n\nWhat about ICC\u2019s Jurisdiction and Working?\n\nThe organisation can only continue its operations in the member nations because of the restricted jurisdiction of the ICC, which prevents it from exercising universal jurisdiction.\n\nGenocide, crimes against humanity, war crimes, and aggression are the four international crimes over which the ICC has jurisdiction under the Rome Statute.\n\nThe following circumstances give rise to the ICC\u2019s jurisdiction:\n\nThe ICC can use its jurisdiction on genocides that occurred after 1 July 2002.\nThe ICC can use its jurisdiction to look into a war crime if the crime is committed by one of its member countries or in such a country\u2019s territory.\nThe ICC has jurisdiction over cases referred to by the United Nations Security Council.\nWhat are the Limitations of the International Criminal Court (ICC)?\n\nThere are certain conditions and limitations to the functioning of the International Criminal Court:\n\nAs there is no specialised police force or authority in place for the ICC, the organisation depends on several nations to arrest and transfer guilty parties to prison facilities.\nThe selection of cases by the ICC is very selective\nCritics of the Court contend that there are insufficient safeguards against political prosecutions or other abuses, as well as inadequate checks and balances on the prosecutor and judges\u2019 authority.\nThe International Criminal Court has previously been charged with favouring powerful nations.\nThe ICC is lacking in both human capital and financial resources.\nThe ICC has come under fire for allegedly being biassed and acting as an instrument of Western imperialism, prosecuting primarily the leaders of tiny, helpless governments while disregarding the crimes perpetrated by wealthy and more robust ones.\nFor the ICC to be functional, state participation is required. This makes it less effective since criminals may seize power and escape being brought to justice by the ICC.\nIndia and International Criminal Court (ICC)\n\nIndia chose not to ratify the Rome Statute due to national interests, state sovereignty, the difficulty in locating fair prosecutors, the difficulty in gathering evidence, and the difficulty in defining crime.\n\nEven though particular nations do not have diplomatic connections with one another, international police collaboration is made possible via the International Criminal Police Organization (Interpol).\n\nHow is ICC Different from ICJ?\nParameter\n\t\nICC\n\t\nICJ\n\n\nYear court established\n\t\n2002\n\t\n1946\n\n\nLocation\n\t\nHague, Netherlands\n\t\nHague, Netherlands\n\n\nUN Relation\n\t\nIndependent- may receive case referrals from UN Security Council\n\t\nOfficial court of the UN, known as the World Court\n\n\nCase types\n\t\nCriminal prosecution of individuals\n\t\nContentious between parties, and advisory opinions\n\n\nSubject matter\n\t\nGenocide, crimes against humanity, war crimes, crimes of aggression\n\t\nMaritime disputes, sovereignty, natural resources, trade, treaty violations and treaty interpretations, human rights, etc.\n\n\nFunding\n\t\nContributions from parties to the Rome Statute, voluntary contributions from the UN, governments, corporations, organisations, etc.\n\t\nUN\n\nArticle written by: Aseem Muhammed"

It has been introduced in the Uruguay round of talks.\n\nAgriculture is the most protected both in North and South. Agricultural negotiations are most politicized in both the North and South.\n\nThese negotiations are the major issues in the Doha round of talks.\n\nIt is a major area of concern for developing countries as it is the main commodity they export. It is the major export of the forex and generates resources for poverty alleviation.\n\nWhat is the challenge for WTO and developing nations?\nDeveloped countries maintain huge subsidies whereas developing countries can afford only nominal subsidies.\nIn developing countries, the per capita land holding is very small whereas in developed countries it is very large.\nIn developing countries, most of the farmers are subsistence whereas in developed they are commercial.\nDeveloping countries have unfavorable climatic zones whereas developed countries are in favorable climatic zones.\nIn developing countries around 70% of the population depends on agriculture for employment. Whereas in developed countries just three to four percent are dependent on agriculture.\nIn developing countries, the average share of GDP is 30% whereas in developed the share is just 3%.\nIn developed countries, agriculture is just a matter of Commerce whereas in developing countries it is the way of life.\n\nAlso read: Sanitary and Phytosanitary Measures\n\nDoha round of talks\n\nThe fourth ministerial conference in 2001 led to the adoption of the Doha development agenda.\n\nThis adoption was considered a victory for developing countries. The developed countries adopted the agenda because the Doha talks happened after the 2001 incident. The international community wanted to show that nations are together in the fight against terrorism.\n\nWhat is the unique feature of the Doha round?\n\nIt is not a trade round, it is a development round. Priority was a development over trade. Since agriculture is the main concern of developing countries agriculture is the most important agenda.\n\nAt Doha, member countries accepted the principle of special and differential responsibility.\n\nThey have accepted in the hope that the Doha talks will be adopted in the framework of the \u2018single undertaking\u2019, It means that nothing is accepted until everything is accepted.\n\nIn WTO, agricultural negotiations are going on under three pillars\nMarket Access\nExport Subsidies\nDomestic Support\nThe theme of negotiations\nOpen and liberalization\nNon-discrimination\nSpecial and differential responsibilities.\n\nSpecial and Differential Treatment (S&D): The WTO recognizes the need for special treatment for developing countries through provisions such as Special and Differential Treatment. These provisions acknowledge the developmental needs and capacities of different countries.\n\nOperationalization Challenges: Despite the existence of S&D provisions, operationalizing them effectively remains a challenge. Tailoring trade agreements to accommodate the diverse needs of developing countries requires ongoing efforts.\n\nIssues related to market access\nMarket access means reducing barriers. There can be two types of barriers, tariff and non-tariff.\nDeveloped countries have already lowered their tariff. Developing countries continue to maintain tariffs.\nEven when developed countries have reduced tariffs. It has not been possible for developing countries to increase their export.\nThe reason is that developed countries impose non-tariff barriers. For example, sanitary and phytosanitary measures.\nThe imposition of anti-dumping duty is also without transparency. Even developing countries use such protectionist measures. For example, India even uses quantitative restrictions.\n\nIn the context of market access, there is a lack of consensus over two measures, special safeguard measures and special products.\n\nSpecial safeguard measures: Developing countries can trigger tariff walls in case of an import surge.\nSpecial product: Developing countries can keep some products out of the liberalization.\n\nThe products should have a linkage with rural development, employment, and livelihood concern.\n\nHowever, the problem lies in the number of items. The developing countries want to keep as many items as possible.\n\nExport subsidy: The matter was resolved in the Nairobi package. In the Nairobi package, the decision to eliminate the subsidies given on the export of Agricultural goods was taken.\nDomestic support: Domestic support is the most controversial issue. The developed countries continue to maintain huge subsidies. Whereas there have been many restrictions on the subsidies given by developing countries.\n\nOne of the worst impacts of the WTO policy has been that it adversely impacted not only agriculture which is the backbone of the economy but even food security.\n\nIt is the impact of WTO policies on agriculture that agriculture is stagnating and showing negative trends.\n\nSince WTO policies have come into existence the number of farmer\u2019s suicide has increased. The problem of Hunger and malnutrition has become acute. Due to this in\u00a0India, there has been a surge in left-wing extremism.\n\nDomestic subsidies are classified into 3 boxes\n\nGreen box: They are not considered as trade distorting and hence there are no limitations. They are primarily meant for research and development.\n\nAmber box: The subsidies that result in increased production are in the Amber box. They are considered trade-distorting and hence there are limitations on these subsidies. They were primarily used by developing countries.\n\nBlue box: This is a part of the Amber box but is not considered trade distorting because they do not increase the production but rather decrease the production. For example, given for livestock, animal husbandry, etc.\n\nThe leaders of the developing countries feel that the developed countries have fooled them. They played with the boxes and shifted their subsidies from the Amber box to the green box.\n\nAnd developing countries lacked enough expertise to understand the technicalities of such agreements.\n\nHow has WTO affected food security?\nThe developed countries have surplus production and they want to export food items to the developing countries.\nDeveloped countries have also opted for an overall cap whereas developing countries have gone for a product-wise option.\nDeveloped countries can give accumulator subsidies, and they can concentrate the entire amount of two to three crops.\nDeveloped countries manipulated the price of agricultural produce.\nDeveloping countries exposed their farmers to price fluctuations in the Global markets.\nTo get better prices, the farmers opted for cash crops. There have been limitations on the government in the context of the amounts of subsidies they can give.\nThe prices of food items have been manipulated to affect production as well as reach.\nBecause of WTO norms, the government cannot release food even when they are getting rotten.\nDeveloped countries suggest importing cheaper food grains to address food security. They criticize the huge corruption in the PDS system of the developing country.\nThey accuse developing countries are procuring the food items to later dump these items in the international market.\nActual performance\n\nIn theory, WTO appears to be favorable to developing countries. However, in practice, it has impacted adversely the developing countries.\n\nThese so-called equal voting rights have not benefited developing countries because the developed countries use various bargaining tools like green room diplomacy.\n\nWTO dispute settlement body is too costly and hence developing countries cannot afford the use of the body. Some developing countries are too poor to even pay the rent for the office in Geneva.\n\nThe mechanism could be employed only by well-off countries.\n\nWTO policies in agriculture have impacted food security in developing countries.\n\nStill, it is important to note that the success of WTO is in the interest of the developing countries subject to the condition they can retain solidarity.\n\nMultilateralism is always better because in a Bilateral Framework, developing countries, especially small countries do not have bargaining power. It is also very important for India.\n\nOnly through WTO India can get a favorable trade environment.\n\nConclusion\n\nThe relationship between the WTO and developing countries is dynamic and evolving. While the organization has mechanisms in place to address the unique challenges faced by developing nations, there is recognition that more needs to be done. Balancing the interests of diverse economies within a global trading framework requires ongoing efforts, reforms, and a commitment to inclusivity. As the global economic landscape continues to shift, the role of the WTO in promoting fair and equitable trade for all remains a crucial aspect of international economic governance.\n\nArticle written by Chetna Yadav."

A deal for the water sharing of the Ganges River already exists between the two countries, and both parties are striving to complete agreements for the water sharing of the other common rivers. Additionally, both countries are working together to conserve the entire Sunderbans ecosystem, which is a valuable source of biodiversity.\n\nIndia-Bangladesh are also engaged in regional cooperation through multilateral forums such as BIMSTEC (Bay of Bengal Multi-Sectoral Technical and Economic Cooperation), SAARC (South Asian Association for Regional Cooperation), and IORARC (Indian Ocean Rim Association for Regional Cooperation), etc.\n\nKushiyara River Water Agreement\n\nKushiyara River Water Agreement is the first water-sharing agreement since the landmark Ganga Waters Treaty, of 1996.\n\nUnder this, a memorandum of understanding (MoU) was signed between the countries on the sharing of the waters of the Kushiyara River, a distributary of the Barak River which flows through Assam, and then enters Bangladesh.\n\nThe region of lower Assam in India and Sylhet in Bangladesh have witnessed deadly floods that highlighted the early need for cooperation.\n\nThe agreement will solve flood management-related and irrigation-related issues between the two countries.\n\nAs per the agreement, the people will benefit from the water that will flow through a network of canals benefiting the farmers. It will be beneficial for the farmers involved in Boro rice, which is the rice cultivated during the dry season of December to February.\n\nIndia-Bangladesh Trade relations\n\nBangladesh has become India\u2019s leading South Asian trading partner and the world\u2019s fourth-largest market for Indian exports in the years 2021\u20132022.\n\nExports to Bangladesh increased by more than 66% during FY 2020-21 and FY 2021-22, from $9.69 billion to $16.15 billion.\n\nIndia is Bangladesh\u2019s second-largest trading partner and Asia\u2019s top market destination for exports.\n\nBilateral trade between both countries increased at an unprecedented rate of approximately 44% from $10.78 billion in 2020-21 to $18.13 billion in 2021-22, despite Covid-19-related difficulties.\n\nRaw cotton, non-retail pure cotton yarn, and electricity are India\u2019s key exports to Bangladesh. In contrast, pure vegetable oils, non-knit men\u2019s suits, and textile waste are its main imports from Bangladesh.\n\nIndia-Bangladesh: CEPA\n\nEven though there have been unofficial discussions about CEPA since 2018, the pandemic has heightened urgency. Chinese investments in Bangladesh initially sparked India, but after both economies experienced an economic shock, New Delhi and Dhaka wanted to pick up the pace.\n\nA major goal of the CEPA is to close the trade imbalance between the two countries, with a concentration on trade in goods, services, and investment.\n\nBangladesh is eager to finalize the CEPA in a year as it prepares to transit into a developing country by 2026, after which it may no longer be eligible for trade privileges that it presently enjoys as a least-developed country.\n\nIndia-Bangladesh:\u00a0Areas of Conflict\n\nThere are several areas of conflict between both countries.\n\nTeesta River Dispute\n\nTeesta River is a major source of irrigation for the paddy-growing region of India and Bangladesh. A fair distribution of Teesta waters, along the lines of the 1996 Ganga Water Treaty, is what countries were aiming for.\n\nTo keep the river\u2019s water flow to a minimum, an agreement was concluded in 2011 that gave India 42.5% of the water, Bangladesh 37.5%, and the remaining 20% of the river\u2019s water flow free rein. Due to some disagreement, this agreement has not been put into effect to this point.\n\nFarakka Barrage Dispute\n\nAlthough the two countries successfully reached an agreement about the sharing of the Ganga waters in 1996, there is still a long-standing disagreement regarding India\u2019s building and operation of the Farakka Barrage, which was built to augment the river Hooghly\u2019s water supply.\n\nBangladesh is worried about not receiving a fair share of water during the dry season and about some of its areas being inundated when India releases extra water during the monsoon season.\n\nWater is a state subject in India, hence the bottleneck is the lack of agreement between the state government of Bengal and India to review the dam\u2019s relevance and make certain concessions to Bangladesh.\n\nInsurgency\n\nOne of the main points of disagreement between India-Bangladesh is insurgency. According to media sources, the United Liberation Front of Assam (ULFA), the National Democratic Front of Bodoland, and the National Liberation Front of Tripura all ran camps in Bangladesh in 2001.\n\nAdditionally, there are suspicions that the ULFA has several successful income-generating ventures in Bangladesh that it uses to fund its insurgent operations in India.\n\nIllegal Migration\n\nThe flow of migrants across the Bangladeshi border as a result of the country\u2019s unrest has further strained the relationship between the two countries. The inhabitants of the Indian states bordering Bangladesh, including Tripura, Mizoram, Assam, Meghalaya, and West Bengal, have experienced substantial socio-economic-political challenges as a result of the significant influx of these migrants across the border.\n\nCountering China\u2019s Influence\n\nEnhancing India\u2019s connection with Bangladesh by assisting Bangladesh with nuclear technology, artificial intelligence, modern farming methods, and the exchange of flood data helps in countering China\u2019s influence in Bangladesh.\n\nBorder Disputes\n\nTensions along the border between Bangladesh and India are nothing new. A 4,096 km long land border and a 180 km long marine border separate India from Bangladesh. The Comilla\u2013Tripura land border, which stretches for 6.5 kilometres, has not been demarcated, leaving the border dispute unresolved.\n\nSharing River Water\n\nOne of the main issues between the two countries is the disagreement over water. There are 54 rivers that both India and Bangladesh share. To maximize the benefits of their shared river systems, the two nations have a bilateral Joint Rivers Commission (JRC), which was set up in June 1972. Its duties include developing flood control measures, formulating proposals for advance flood warnings, flood forecasting, and cyclone warnings, as well as researching flood control and irrigation projects.\n\nRead:\u00a0Bangladesh protests: What are the implications of the political upheaval?\n\nArticle Written By: Priti Raj"

However it could not come into existence and place of LIEO, a set of treaties dealing with different terms of International Trade and aspects came into existence in 1948 known as GATT (General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade).\n\nGATT was dealing with trade in goods, especially non-agricultural goods. Gradually agricultural goods also became an essential component of external trade.\nEven the share of the service sector started increasing. New areas of trade like IPR emerged.\nThe volume of trade has become so large that business as usual was not possible. There was a need for an institution to formulate the rules governing different aspects of foreign trade.\nWith the end of the Cold War, the number of countries participating in external trade became too many.\nThe structural reforms also force the economy to open up. It was realized by the developing countries that trade not aid can address their poverty.\nUltimately Uruguay\u2019s round of talks ended. 123 countries accepted these trade agreements. This has led to the establishment of the World Trade Organization which came into existence in 1995.\nIndia is the original member of the World Trade Organization.\n\nRead: Marrakesh agreement\n\nPurpose of World Trade Organization\nTo establish rule of law in international trade.\nTo ensure free and fair trade.\nTo maintain transparency and predictability in international trade.\nTo contribute to the development of developing countries.\nWTO and developing countries\nThe WTO classifies nations into developed, developing, and least developed countries (LDCs).\nThe terms \u201cdeveloped\u201d and \u201cdeveloping\u201d countries are not defined by the WTO.\nThe members declare themselves whether their countries are \u201cdeveloped\u201d or \u201cdeveloping.\u201d\nHowever, other members have the right to challenge the member\u2019s choice to use a provision that is available to developing nations.\nLike IMF and World Bank where a system of weighted voting exists, in WTO also each country has an equal vote.

It meets every two years.\n\nGeneral council: The body works out the year for the formulations of the proposal.\n\nTrade Policy Review Board: One of the main objectives of WTO is to maintain transparency and accountability. Therefore the body undertakes policy reviews of members from time to time. It is also one reason why WTO has been considered intrusive.\n\nTrade dispute body: The WTO\u2019s important contribution to the stability of the global economy is dispute settlement, which is the foundational element of the multilateral trading system.\n\nThe resolution of disputes is of the utmost importance, preferably by a mutually acceptable solution, and provisions have been created for the process to be carried out in a timely and effective manner.\n\nWorld Trade Organization Dispute Resolution\n\nThe WTO is an international organization that also handles dispute resolution.\n\nWhen a member country feels that a country has violated WTO regulations, it will file a complaint with the WTO\u2019s dispute body.\n\nIf the consultation fails, a panel will be formed with the help of all the members to resolve the conflict.\n\nThe panel will communicate the decision of the dispute settlement to WTO members, who have the option to disagree with it.\n\nIf the judgment is upheld, the member nation that broke the rules is required to amend its laws to comply with the WTO Agreement.\n\nAnd if this isn\u2019t done, the violating country and the complaining country may come to an agreement on compensation; if not, the complaining country may take appropriate retaliation.\n\nIn a nutshell, the World Trade Organization (WTO) is the only international body in charge of implementing international trade laws. It ensures that trade continues to move as easily, reliably, and freely as possible.\n\nThe WTO\u2019s future role is critical for keeping the post-World War II liberalized economic system on a global scale. India and other developing economies can lay a solid foundation for a successful WTO while defending the interests of developing nations at a time when nations are threatening to exit the WTO, making it dysfunctional.\n\nArticle written by Chetna Yadav."

Stay updated with our latest content and enhance your exam readiness.\n\nFor chairmanship, the BIMSTEC follows the alphabetical order. The rotation of the BIMSTEC Chairmanship began with Bangladesh.\n\nPurpose of BIMSTEC\n\nBIMSTEC was established as an alliance to combat the negative consequences of globalization by leveraging the physical proximity of the world\u2019s fastest-growing economies and utilizing local resources.\n\nSouth Asian and South East Asian nations working together economically and technologically along the Bay of Bengal coast.\n\nThe alliance strengthens ties between the seven nations and serves as a link between South Asia and South-East Asia.\n\nInstitutional Mechanisms\n\nThe highest policy-making body in the BIMSTEC process is the BIMSTEC Summit, which is composed of the heads of state or government of the member states.\n\nThe External Ministers of Member States participate in the Ministerial Meeting, the second highest policy-making body of BIMSTEC.\n\nSenior Officials of the Member States\u2019 Foreign Ministries serve as the representative for the Senior Officials\u2019 Meeting.\n\nEvery month in the BIMSTEC Secretariat in Dhaka, the BIMSTEC Working Group is attended by the ambassadors of the BIMSTEC Member Countries to Bangladesh or their representatives.\n\nThe two key forums to guarantee the private sector\u2019s active engagement are the Business Forum and the Economic Forum.\n\nSignificance of BIMSTEC\n\nThe primary goal of India\u2019s Look East strategy was first implemented in 1991 and later renamed Act East policy in 2014.\n\nIt is to advance strategic, cultural, and economic ties with the Asia and Pacific area.\nThe inclusion of these Asian nations gives India the chance to advance its act East policy objectives.\nThe Strait of Malacca links the Pacific Ocean to the Indian Ocean. The Strait of Malacca is used for the transit of about a quarter of all traded products worldwide.\nGeographically, Indonesia, Malaysia, and Singapore encircle the Strait of Malacca. Due to their direct connection, the Bay of Bengal and the Strait of Malacca, this cluster may directly affect trade through the Strait of Malacca.\nTo kick off a wave of port-led development along India\u2019s coastline, the Sagarmala project was created.\nAll of this will result in a booming economy in the coastal states of India, and India will undoubtedly benefit from the presence of developing market economies in the region in the shape of this grouping.\nAround 1.5 billion people live in the BIMSTEC region, which accounts for around 22% of the world\u2019s population and offers a sizable market.\nBIMSTEC member states, which have a total gross domestic product (GDP) of 3.8 trillion, have been able to maintain an average 6.5% economic growth trajectory in recent years and exhibit strong development potential.\nAround 15,792 square kilometres of mangrove forests, 8,471 square kilometres of coral reefs, seagrass meadows, delicate estuaries, and sea turtle nesting grounds can all be found in the Bay of Bengal.\nWith an annual fish catch of about six million tonnes, or 7% of the global catch, and a market value of about $4 billion, it is also a significant fishing location.\nThe association offers the northeastern states of India the chance to prosper economically by connecting them to the Bay of Bengal region via Bangladesh and Myanmar.\nDue to the expansion of China\u2019s Belt and Road Initiative, the grouping enables India to fight China\u2019s encroaching influence in nations along the Bay of Bengal.\nIndia aims to be a world power and \u201cVishwaguru,\u201d and by using this platform, India can demonstrate to the rest of the world its outstanding leadership\u2019s innate abilities to establish a new global order.\nIssues\nBIMSTEC intended to convene ministerial meetings annually and summits every two years.\u00a0However, only five summits have been held in the 25 years leading up to 2022, demonstrating a lack of continuity in the meetings.\nA strong BIMSTEC requires friendly and calm bilateral relations among all of its member states. Given the development of relations between Bangladesh and Myanmar, India and Sri Lanka, and India and Nepal in recent years, this has not been the case.\nDisappointingly, there is a lack of connectedness in the institutions of the infrastructure, energy, digital, and financial sectors that connect individuals for travel, trade, and cultural exchanges.\nDespite the implementation of the Asian Development Bank-supported Master Plan for Transport Connectivity, little progress has been made thus far (ADB).\nOcean governance hasn\u2019t been a high-priority problem for the member states, despite the Bay\u2019s essential role in the economies of the BIMSTEC countries.\nThe majority of these member states still have obsolete colonial rules in place that regulate the area\u2019s waters.\nIn the Bay, illegal activities like drug trafficking, human trafficking, and terrorism are all quite prevalent.\nLarge amounts of untreated waste are entering the Bay as a result of industrial expansion in coastal areas.\nDue to the leaching of plastic and untreated trash from rivers and the Indian Ocean, a dead zone with no oxygen where no fish can survive is beginning to form.\nThe 14 areas of cooperation included in BIMSTEC\u2019s focus, which is fairly broad, include things like connectivity, public health, agriculture, etc. It is advised that BIMSTEC stick to its limited areas of specialization and work well with them.\nDue to the development of another sub-regional initiative, the Bangladesh-China-India-Myanmar (BCIM) Forum, which actively includes China as a participant, more concerns have been raised about BIMSTEC\u2019s unique potential.\nBIMSTEC Free Trade Area Framework Agreement\n\nTo promote trade and investment between the parties and persuade outsiders to trade and invest more actively with the BIMSTEC countries, all of the member countries have signed the BIMSTEC Free Trade Area Framework Agreement (BFTAFA).\n\nTo facilitate trade between the member nations, the draft of the BIMSTEC Coastal Shipping Agreement was designed to simplify coastal shipping within 20 nautical miles of the coastline.\n\nThe cost-efficient, environmentally friendly, and quicker coastal shipping routes will be used for much of the freight traffic between the member nations once the agreement is operational when it is ratified.\n\nIn news\n\nThe Bay of Bengal Initiative for Multi-Sectoral Technical and Economic Cooperation (BIMSTEC) will now be open to new members and observers after a historic first charter of the grouping came into force on 20 May 2024.\n\nWith the coming into force of the charter which was adopted in the 5th\u00a0summit of the BIMSTEC leaders, the grouping has acquired a \u2018legal personality\u2019 and will be able to enter into structured diplomatic dialogue with other groupings and countries.\nConclusion\n\nBIMSTEC holds huge geo-strategic significance. It brings India closer to three strategic regions, ie Bay Of Bengal, the Mekong region, and the sub-Himalayan region.\n\nThe three factors which shape the formation of any Regional organization are the market economy, the movement of people across the border, and the political factor. All of these are missing. Instead of a trade deficit, there is a trust deficit.\n\nThere is a need to increase the regional integration and cooperation in this scenario. BIMSTEC should focus on new areas such as the blue economy, the digital economy, etc.\n\nBuilding creative business models specifically for women and integrating female entrepreneurs into supply chains can be beneficial.\n\nIndia will need to take the initiative in mitigating any concerns about inter-organizational power imbalances among the smaller members and work to promote greater cross-border connectivity and the flow of investments by lowering barriers to the movement of people and goods to realize its trade and economic potential.\n\nArticle written by Chetna Yadav"

There is an urgent need for regional integration.\n\nThe 21st century has changed the idea of security, create complex interdependence, and compelled neighbors to change their approach.\n\nThe old Kautilyan approach where the neighbor is a natural enemy is hardly sustainable.\n\nHistory: It is the brainchild of Zia-ur-Rehman the Bangladesh President and came into existence in 1985.\n\nThe objective of SAARC is peace and prosperity.\n\nThe principle of SAARC is based on the principles of Panchsheel which are based on respect for sovereignty and non-interference in the domestic affairs\n\nThe decision-making at SAARC is decided by consensus.\n\nThe achievements of SAARC according to Manmohan Singh depend upon how we look at it.\n\nIn comparison to European Union and ASEAN, it has no significant achievement as the intra-regional trait is stagnant. There is no chance of SAFTA coming into existence, as well as the idea of the South Asian community is unthinkable.\n\nGenerally, its achievements are the satellite, the South Asian University, the South Asian food Bank, the South Asian film festival, the South Asian milk grid, the South Asian agency for disaster the South Asian Federation games.\n\nStructure of SAARC\n\nCouncil: It is the highest policy-making body. Government leaders from the individual member nations serve as the council\u2019s representatives.\n\nCouncil of Ministers: The Council of Ministers is made up of foreign ministers, and it usually meets twice a year.\n\nAreas for SAARC Nations\u2019 Cooperation\nAgricultural development\nTourism and Human Resource Development\nEconomic, Trade, and Finance\nSocial Services\nNatural disasters, the environment, and biotechnology\nEducation, health, culture, and other factors\nRaising awareness and reducing poverty\nTransportation, Science, Energy, and Technology\nThe importance of SAARC\n\nSAARC nations cooperate in their efforts because they have a shared political outlook, as well as traditions relating to dress, food, and culture.\n\nTo boost their internal trade, the member nations established a free trade zone.\n\nThe SAARC has also significantly aided the advancement of track-two projects and civil society.\n\nThe region is bothof the most fertile and densely populated regions in the world.\n\nNo alternative can bring South Asian nations together for mutually beneficial diplomatic relations.\n\nThe SAARC countries share issues including poverty, illiteracy, malnutrition, natural disasters, internal strife, industrial and technological backwardness, low GDP, and a fragile socio-economic situation.\n\nSince SAARC is the largest regional cooperation organization, its significance in establishing stability and enacting effective change in the area is becoming more evident.\n\nIssues\n\nThe reason for the failure of the organization is India-Pakistan relations. The two largest SAARC countries are responsible for the failure to a great extent yet there are some structural and fundamental problems in SAARC.\n\nOne of the reasons for the failure is that SAARC is a platform with a negative mindset.\n\nSAARC would be an India-dominated platform was the reason Pakistan opposed it. Later Pakistan thought not to leave India and joined to oppose India\u2019s proposal.\n\nIn other regional organizations, there has been an external factor but there was no push factor here rather South Asia became praise to superpower rivalry\n\nPakistan is still suffering from an Identity crisis hence it wants to strengthen its separate identity rather than strengthening the South Asian identity. Pakistan has been trying to be recognized as a part of West Asia.\n\nIn 2016, Pakistan objected to India\u2019s proposed SAARC satellite project, which was subsequently abandoned.\n\nEven Sri Lanka tries to be a part of southeast Asia. It is said that South Asia is a name looking for a place on the map. It is a new name for the Indian subcontinent which ensures the centrality of India\n\nIndia has been seen as a Bully Big Brother since the integration of Sikkim, and the formation of Bangladesh. The Indian neighbors look at India as an imperialist power. They tend to look toward China as the counterweight.\n\nIndia lacks soft power in the region. India doesn\u2019t differ from other neighbors in terms of governance and Human Development. In some contexts, India\u2019s performance is even worse than others\n\nThe decision-making process based on consensus is also problematic and there is a need that the countries should adopt some sort of qualified method.\n\nUnder SAARC, numerous agreements have been negotiated and institutional frameworks created, but they have not been properly put into practice.\n\nSAARC was advised to work on transforming South Asia into a Free Trade Area by 2010, a Customs Union by 2015, and an Economic Union similar to the EU by 2020. It is still just a dream.\n\nLittle has been done by SAARC to combat the coronavirus outbreak. When the nations most needed each other, they did nothing.\n\nRead:\u00a0Revival of SAARC\n\nProspects\n\nThere is no light at the end of the tunnel. India-Pakistan relations are at their worst and thus the chances are very poor. India has already shifted its focus towards BIMSTEC. However, at present Pakistan is maintaining the ritual to keep it alive as China wants entry into SAARC.\n\nIndia does not want China\u2019s entry as India will become weak in its region. India is not against the expansion of this but it insists on its consolidation of it.\n\nThe SAARC has the power to unite nations. In the words of Nelson Mandela, \u201cIf you want to make peace with your opponent, you have to work with your opponent.\u201d Then he becomes your partner.\n\nAllowing SAARC to deteriorate and lose relevance severely impairs our capacity to respond to the reality and growing problems that SAARC nations are currently experiencing.\n\nThe \u201cASEAN minus X\u201d model, which allows countries who are unwilling to join the consensus to join at a later time while not impeding members that want to move forward could be adopted by SAARC.\n\nThe organization represents the South Asian identity of the member countries. It should be looked into by the member nations to see if it can help to keep the area peaceful and stable.\n\nFormer Prime Minister Manmohan Singh once said that I dream of a day while retaining our respective National identities one can have breakfast in Amritsar, lunch in Lahore, and dinner in Kabul that is how our forefathers live and that is how I want our children to live.\n\nArticle written by Chetna Yadav."

India has signed three sister-city agreements for Kathmandu-Varanasi, Lumbini-Bodhgaya, and Janakpur-Ayodhya.\n\nHumanitarian aid: Nepal is located in an ecologically fragile region that is vulnerable to earthquakes and floods. It continues to be the principal beneficiary of humanitarian aid from India.\n\nThe weakness of India-Nepal Relations:\n\nThe biggest problem is closeness. Closeness if not handled with sensitivity creates many problems. In reality, India does not have a Nepal policy. The Nepal policy is a subset of our China policy.\n\nWe always see Nepal through the prism of China. And even in the age of complex interdependence, we tend to look Nepal China relations with a zero-sum approach.\n\nIt shows nothing but a lack of confidence, which gives room to Nepali politicians to play the China card. Our policy or approach in Nepal resembles Pakistan\u2019s approach in Afghanistan.\n\nThe way Pakistan wants strategic depth, in a similar manner India wants to micro-manage Nepali affairs.\n\nIndia wants whosoever rules Nepal should be completely controlled by India. Thus, India\u2019s insecurity results in a lack of a second policy toward Nepal.\n\nPandit Nehru who talked about Panchsheel, non-interference in domestic affairs, and non-alignment had no hesitation in declaring at the Indian Parliament that India\u2019s security would have priority over Nepal\u2019s sovereignty.\n\nHe openly held that we cannot tolerate Nepal following a policy of equal distance.\n\nNepali should not be allowed to have an intimate relationship with any other country. However, India could not ensure Nepal moved toward China.\n\nOn the other hand, the Nepali politician calls Nepal a YAM between two large boulders. It wants to take advantage of the unique location between the two Asian giants- the elephant and the Dragon.\n\nProblems when India deals with Nepal:\n\nNepal is politically unstable and has extremely fractured politics. If there is political stability and a manageable fraction, it is easy for any country to deal with Nepal.\n\nThere is a lack of professionalism on the part of India. Most of the ambassadors have been from UP and Bihar. They have family ties and hence they are unable to get the right perspective of the ground-level situation\n\nSince India feels extreme insecurity it avoids leaders having a base at the grassroots and going for pliant persons who can be puppets and who are in power because of India\u2019s support.\n\nThere are multiple stakeholders in India\u2019s Nepal policy, for example, different Ministries, pressure groups, family.\n\nIndia often disappoints because it is unable to fulfill its promises. It is said that India promises and China delivers.\n\nWhen India deals with Nepal it sometimes overlooks the protocol. For example, the 1950 Treaty was signed by the Prime Minister of Nepal but from India\u2019s side, India\u2019s Ambassador signed it.\n\nNepal\u2019s grievances against India:\n\nNepal does not like the intervention of India in their domestic affairs even in the constitution.\n\nNepal feels that India does not allow it to pursue independent foreign policy, especially concerning China\n\nIndia is a big bullying brother who uses its muscular policy when Nepal tries to take independent decisions\n\nNepal\u2019s constitution:\n\nAfter the April earthquake because of the criticism from the international donors, the Nepalese produced the constitution in September 2015. It resulted in a political earthquake.\n\nAs a consequence, a new movement started by madhesis and janjatis. The Assembly has also been acting as the parliament.\n\nIndia only held that it will take that Nepal has a constitution and not \u2018the\u2019 constitution. On the other hand, the international community has congratulated Nepal.\n\nAll Nepali elites joined hands in the creation of a constitution. It marginalized the Madhesis and Janjatis. Before the pronouncement of the constitution, India provided huge earthquake relief.\n\nPrime Minister Narendra Modi has visited Nepal. He gave his opinion on the constitution while addressing the Nepal parliament. He said that the constitution should look like a bouquet of flowers.\n\nIssues or conflicts in the India-Nepal Relations:\n\n1950 Treaty: It reflects China\u2019s expansionist design. According to Mao, the five Himalayan Kingdoms are the five fingers or the five digits of China i.e Bhutan, Sikkim, Nepal, Tibet, and Arunachal Pradesh.\n\nFeatures of treaty\n\nIndia recognizes Nepal as a Sovereign state.\n\nNational treatment of each other citizens, also in terms of employment including public sector employment\n\nIndia being a big brother has relinquished its right to seek public-sector employment in Nepal\n\nNepal will give primacy to India in infrastructure development, hydropower, and business opportunities.\n\nThere will be freedom of movement.\n\nProblems in treaty\n\nThe 1950 treaty has been a major bone of contention between India-Nepal Relations. There is no problem with the treaty. The problem is in the secret letters exchanged with the treaty.\n\nSecret letters\n\nBoth countries shall not tolerate any act of aggression against each other. In such cases, they will go for effective consultation and will take all necessary steps.\n\nNepal shall not import arms from any other country without the permission of India. It can also do so only when India cannot fulfill Nepal\u2019s requirements.\n\nNepal\u2019s criticism:\n\nIt goes against the sovereignty of Nepal. The Treaty was signed by Rana and thus lacks legitimacy.\n\nWhatever benefits Nepal gets from India is like a drop in the ocean and on the other hand, India gets just proportionate benefits\n\nWhat India should do?\n\nIndia should ask Nepal to discontinue the Treaty.\n\nBecause the Treaty has lost relevance. Nepal has several times imported arms from China. Nepal has developed a closeness to China.\n\nThe treaty provides the basis to carry on the anti-India agenda and Blackmail India. Nepal will never revise the treaty or abrogate it.\n\nNepal cannot absorb such a huge number of Nepalese working in India.\n\nHydro-Electricity:\n\nNepal imports electricity from India. It suffers from power cuts at least 16 hours per day minimum.\n\nNepal is reluctant to work with India on the production of electricity.\n\nNepal grievances:\n\nIndia plans large-scale dams and Nepal is in the earthquake zone.\n\nIndia insists on a monopoly over power management.\n\nIndia insists Nepal should give primacy to India whereas Nepal wants open tenders with other countries for a better price.\n\nUnder Narendra Modi\u2019s government, India and Nepal entered into power-sharing arrangements which include joint investment, development, marketing, setting up of infrastructure, and transmission lines.\n\nModi\u2019s mantra for Nepal is HIT- Highways, information ways, and transmission lines.\n\nKala Pani dispute:\n\nA triangular land on the tri-junction of India Nepal China. It comes on the route of Mansarovar.\n\nSince 1962 India has had a military post. Nepal claims the territory under China\u2019s pressure.\n\nAs per the Treaty of Sagauli 1816, the river Kali is a natural boundary. The land in the West is Indian territory and the East in Nepal.\n\nWay Forward\n\nTo protect the interests of everyone who has been impacted on both sides of the border, Nepal and India should reopen the water dialogue and develop new policies.\n\nToday, it is important to steer clear of territorial nationalism rhetoric. It has set the stage for a peaceful conversation in which both parties show compassion. They consider what is practical.\n\nFor the neighborhood\u2019s first policy to take hold, India must be a considerate and giving partner.\n\nIn terms of interpersonal relationships, administrative cooperation, and political exchanges, India should be more proactive with Nepal.\n\nIndia should be more proactive in its interactions with Nepal on the political, bureaucratic, and interpersonal levels.\n\nIn the meantime, India should steer Nepal toward more inclusive discourse in the spirit of friendship while continuing its policy of staying out of Nepal\u2019s domestic affairs.\n\nArticle written by Chetna Yadav."

            "[CONTENT]": "What is Gujral doctrine? What is its significance for India in the contemporary geopolitical situation? What are the various issues facing the doctrine? Read further to know more.\n\nA doctrine is a stated principle of government policy, mainly in foreign or military affairs.\n\nFrom this, it is clear that a doctrine can be either a military doctrine or a foreign policy doctrine.\n\nOur topic of discussion, the Gujral doctrine is an example of a foreign policy doctrine.\n\nTable of Contents\n\nWhat is Gujral doctrine?\nBrief history\nApplicability of Gujral doctrine\nSignificance of Gujral doctrine\nIssues facing Gujral Doctrine\nWay forward\nConclusion\nWhat is Gujral doctrine?\n\nThe Gujral Doctrine is a set of five guiding principles for dealing with India\u2019s close neighbors. These five guiding principles are the result of the conviction that India\u2019s stature and power are inextricably linked to the nature of its ties with its neighbors. Thus, it acknowledges the paramount significance of amicable, cordial relationships between neighbors.\n\nThese ideas include:\n\nIndia doesn\u2019t demand anything in return from its neighbors, such as Bangladesh, Bhutan, the Maldives, Nepal, and Sri Lanka, but instead provides what it can in a spirit of confidence and good faith.\nNo South Asian nation should permit the use of its territory to harm the interests of another nation in the region.\nNo nation should meddle in another\u2019s domestic affairs.\nEach South Asian nation is required to respect the sovereignty and territorial integrity of the other.\nAll of their differences should be resolved through cordial bilateral dialogue.\nBrief history\n\nThe chief architect of the Gujral doctrine is I K Gujral, India\u2019s former prime minister as\u00a0 well as foreign minister. He outlined these concepts in September 1996 in a speech at Chatham House, and he later reaffirmed them at the Bandaranaike Centre for International Studies(BCIS), Colombo in January 1997.\n\n\ud83d\udc49 Which year are YOU targeting for success in the IAS/IPS/IFS Exam? \ud83d\ude80\n\n(1) \u21d2 UPSC 2025: Prelims cum Mains\n\n(2) \u21d2 UPSC 2026: Prelims cum Mains\n\n(3) \u21d2 UPSC 2027 Prelims cum Mains\n\nTip: Know more about ClearIAS Courses (Online/Offline)\n\nJournalist Bhabani Sen Gupta later referred to the philosophy as such in his piece, \u2018India in the Twenty-First Century in International Affairs\u2019.\n\nApplicability of Gujral doctrine\n\nThe Gujral doctrine is applicable in a wide range of contexts, including politics, global politics, and culture. In terms of internal security, it is highly applicable. Now, we shall examine how the Gujral Doctrine applies in various fields.\n\nIncreasing people-to-people contacts: Gujral encouraged P2P interactions, particularly between India and Pakistan, in an effort to create the conditions for the two countries to resolve their differences amicably.\nWater sharing with Bangladesh: Using this technique, India and Bangladesh came to an agreement in 1996 over the sharing of Ganga water. After this agreement, Bangladesh was able to draw much more water throughout the dry season.\nThe confidence-building measures that China and India agreed upon in November 1996 were also a part of their efforts to strengthen bilateral ties and temporarily suspend the border conflict. As a result, the border issue with China was frozen for several years.\nConflict resolution: A deal with Nepal to tame the Mahakali river for the purpose of creating hydropower resolved the conflicts that existed between India and Nepal.\u00a0 Additionally, agreements were made to continue the development partnership with SriLanka.\nAdditionally, it sparked the beginning of a composite dialogue with Pakistan. The foundation of the composite dialogue was the idea that genuine problem-solving talks applied to all types of relationships. Even though some disagreements may still not be settled (Kashmir, terrorism), cooperation must start on agreed-upon terms in agreed-upon domains (commerce, tourism, culture, etc).\nSignificance of Gujral doctrine\nPakistan: In its empire, Britain used the divide-and-conquer strategy for 200 years. In a sea of enmity, antagonism, distrust, and suspicion, India and Pakistan emerged as two independent nations. New conflicts and tensions over religion (the \u201ctheory of the two nations\u201d), territory (Kashmir), and national aspirations were added to this inherited pool.\nBangladesh: The creation of Bangladesh intensified the strategic rivalry between Pakistan and India.\nNepal: The two close neighbors are at a strategic impasse as a result of domestic politics in Nepal.\nSriLanka: India and SriLanka now have a significant gulf in their ties, thanks to the Tamil Tigers\u2019 armed insurrection in Jaffna.\nBangladesh: The topic of illegal migration between India and Bangladesh has long been divisive.\nIssues facing Gujral Doctrine\n\nThe Belt and Road plan has increased China\u2019s footprint in the region, and the logic of better connectivity within the region is frequently overridden by growing security concerns.\n\nThe lack of resources makes development cooperation a weaker component of India\u2019s neighborhood policy.\nIndia cannot match the quantity of resources that China can use in our neighborhood to gain influence.\nIndia\u2019s desire to further open its market to its neighbors has decreased as a result of the current recession in its economy.\nIndia\u2019s borders serve as conduits for security risks such as transnational terrorism, illicit trade, and drug trafficking.\nThe Mumbai bombings in November 2008 exposed the flaws in this theory, which holds that \u201cinherent kindness\u201d may not hold true when living next to openly hostile neighbors.\nWay forward\n\nWithout a doubt, the problems that India must face in its neighborhood now are more complicated and more dangerous than they were twenty years ago.\n\nIndia would have to re-plan its neighborhood policy in an era of shifting geopolitics and altered power dynamics.\nGreater effort must be put into pursuing connectivity, while security issues must be handled with low-cost, high-performance, and dependable technology solutions already in use elsewhere in the world.\nIndia should extend national treatment to its ports and transportation system in order to become the preferred transit country for all of its neighbors.\nConclusion\n\nIndia\u2019s \u201cNeighborhood first\u201d policy must be rooted on ongoing involvement at all political and interpersonal levels, using the strong cultural links that are particular to India\u2019s relationships with its neighbors.\n\nArticle written by: Caroline Abraham"

India is\u00a0not in the\u00a0grouping\u00a0and\u00a0has applied for membership.\n\nAlso read: Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership (RCEP) \u2013 Will it counter TPP?\n\nOrigin and Development of APEC:\n\nThe necessity of a permanent body to coordinate the economic relations among the market-oriented nations of the Pacific rim was voiced by the then Australian Prime Minister, Robert Hawke, in January 1989.\n\nThe Pacific Economic Cooperation Council (PECC), which consisted of a group of business, academics and government representatives and had been holding informal discussions since 1980, endorsed this proposal, and the first meeting of the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) was held in Canberra, Australia, on November 6-7, 1989.\n\nThe meeting was attended by five Pacific industrial economies (Australia, Canada, Japan, New Zealand and the US), the then members of\u00a0ASEAN (Indonesia, Malaysia, Thailand, Singapore, the Republic of Korea and Brunei) and South Korea.\n\nHowever, as the concept of regional economic groupings gained ground throughout the world, it was decided to institutionalize the grouping. The 1991 Ministerial Meeting at Seoul, South Korea, adopted a declaration outlining the objectives and organizational structure of APEC and approved the membership of China, Hong Kong (Hong Kong at that time was still under lease to the UK) and Taiwan.\n\nThe institutionalization of APEC was completed in 1992 when the Bangkok Ministerial Meeting decided to establish a permanent Secretariat in Singapore\n\nThe 21 Members Economies are Australia, Brunei, Canada, Indonesia, Japan, South Korea, Malaysia, New Zealand, Philippines, Singapore, Thailand, United States, Taiwan, Hong Kong, China, Mexico, Papua New Guinea, Chile, Peru, Russian and Vietnam.\n\nIn 1994 during the\u00a0Bogor, Indonesia summit, APEC set the\u00a0Bogor Goals of \u201cfree and open trade and investment in the Asia-Pacific by 2010 for industrialized economies and 2020 for developing economies.\u201d\n\nAPEC leaders adopted the Putrajaya Vision 2040, a new 20-year growth vision to replace the Bogor Goals named after the Indonesian town where leaders agreed in 1994 to free and open trade and investment.\n\nObjectives of APEC:\n\nThe broad objectives are to provide a forum for discussion on a wide range of economic issues and to promote multilateral cooperation among the market-oriented economies of the region\n\nSpecifically, APEC aims to promote economic and technical cooperation among the members by stimulating the flow of goods, services, capital and technology; developing a liberalized trade and investment regime; to encourage private investment, and supporting \u2018open regionalism\u2019.\n\nIt also works on promoting and accelerating regional economic integration.\n\nBy enhancing human security, the organisation try to Facilitate a favourable and sustainable business environment.\n\nAlso read: CPTPP (Comprehensive and Progressive Agreement for Trans-Pacific Partnership)\n\nAsia Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) Structural setup:\n\nAPEC consists of Annual Ministerial Meetings, Senior Officials Meeting, Working Groups and a Secretariat.\n\nThe governing body of APEC is the Annual Ministerial Meeting of the foreign and trade ministers of all the member-states. The chairmanship of the meetings rotates every year among the members.\n\nThe Senior Officials Meetings, consisting of representatives of all the member-states, are held annually and are responsible for the implementation of policies framed by Ministerial Meetings.\n\nThere are ten Working Groups dealing with Telecommunications, Trade and Investment Data, Fisheries, Tourism, Transportation, Trade Promotion, Investment and Technology, Human Resource Development, Regional Energy Cooperation and Marine Resource Conservation, and two ad hoc groups dealing with Regional Trade Liberalization and Economic Policy.\n\nThe Secretariat is headed by the Executive Director who holds a term of one year.\n\nMember Countries:\n\nThe founding members of APEC were Australia; Brunei Darussalam; Canada; Indonesia; Japan; Korea; Malaysia; New Zealand; the Philippines; Singapore; Thailand; and the United States.\n\nFunctions of Asia Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC):\n\nAPEC works to help\u00a0all residents of the Asia-Pacific\u00a0participate in the\u00a0growing economy.\n\nAPEC projects provide\u00a0digital skills training\u00a0for\u00a0rural communities\u00a0and help\u00a0indigenous women\u00a0export their products abroad.\n\nRecognizing the\u00a0impacts of climate change, APEC members also implement initiatives to\u00a0increase energy efficiency and promote sustainable management of forest and marine resources.\n\nThe forum adapts to allow members to deal with important\u00a0new challenges\u00a0to the region\u2019s economic well-being. This includes ensuring\u00a0disaster resilience, planning for pandemics, and addressing terrorism.\n\nAchievements of APEC:\n1. Growth and Development of the Region\nAs a result of APEC\u2019s work, there has been a\u00a0surge in growth in the region, with real GDP increasing from USD 19 trillion in 1989 to USD 42 trillion in 2015.\nFurther,\u00a0per capita income in the region rose by\u00a074%\n2. Promotion of regional economic integration and trade:\nThe APEC\u00a0removed trade barriers between members, harmonized standards and regulations, and streamlined customs procedures which have enabled goods to move more easily across borders.\nTo improve behind-the-border barriers to trade, APEC has been working to foster transparency, competition and better-functioning markets in the Asia-Pacific through regulatory reform, improving the public sector and corporate governance, and strengthening the legal infrastructure.\nAverage tariffs fell from 17% in 1989 to 5.2% in 2012.\nAPEC region\u2019s total trade increased over\u00a0seven times\u00a0outpacing the rest of the world with two-thirds of this trade occurring between member economies.\n3. Ease of Doing Business\nAPEC launched its\u00a0Ease of Doing Action Plan\u00a0in\u00a02009\u00a0with an aim of making it cheaper, easier and faster to do business in the region.\nBetween 2009 and 2015, member countries improved the ease of doing business in the Asia-Pacific by 14.8% across all areas of the initiative\n4. Initiatives for a cleaner environment\nAPEC has been encouraging the development of\u00a0clean technologies and greener growth\u00a0across the region by lower tariffs on environmental goods.\nAPEC has helped urban planners develop\u00a0low-carbon model town plans\u00a0for a series of cities throughout the Asia-Pacific.\nThese cities are\u00a0reducing their carbon footprint\u00a0by adopting a set of\u00a0carbon emission reduction targets and energy-efficient initiatives from solar panels to electric vehicles.\n5. Inclusive growth\nAPEC has launched a wide variety of initiatives that have helped foster\u00a0SME development\u00a0in the Asia-Pacific region.\nIn 2005, the APEC SME Innovation Center was established in Korea to help improve the competitiveness of SMEs in the region through hands-on business consulting.\nIn 2013, The APEC Start-up Accelerator Network was launched to promote entrepreneurship and innovation by connecting technology start-ups with funding and mentors.\n6. Cooperation and Consensus\nAPEC operates as a\u00a0cooperative, multilateral economic and trade forum.\nMember economies participate on the basis of\u00a0open dialogue and respect for the views of all participants.\nIn APEC, all economies have an equal say and decision-making is reached by\u00a0consensus.\nThere are\u00a0no binding commitments or treaty obligations. Commitments are undertaken on a\u00a0voluntary basis\u00a0and\u00a0capacity-building\u00a0projects help members implement APEC initiatives.\nAPEC\u2019s structure is based on both a\u00a0\u201cbottom-up\u201d\u00a0and\u00a0\u201ctop-down\u201d\nFour core committees and their respective working groups provide strategic policy recommendations to APEC Leaders and Ministers who annually set the\u00a0vision\u00a0for\u00a0overarching goals\u00a0and\u00a0initiatives.\nThe working groups are then tasked with implementing these initiatives through a variety of\u00a0APEC-funded projects.\nMembers also take\u00a0individual and collective actions to carry out APEC initiatives in their individual economies with the assistance of APEC capacity-building projects.\nIndia and APEC:\nAPEC\u2019s efforts have focused on simplifying regulatory arrangements; reducing barriers to foreign trade and investment; and, cultivating a culture of economic openness, dialogue, and cooperation.\nIndia has long been interested in APEC. It unsuccessfully requested APEC membership in the late 1990s and was subsequently not considered because of a moratorium on new members initiated in 1997. The moratorium was finally lifted in 2010.\nIntegrating an economy, the size of India\u2019s would be a major step toward regional connectivity in the Asia-Pacific.\nIndia has been an important destination for APEC members\u2019 foreign investment over the past 25 years, with three APEC economies\u2014Singapore, Japan, and the United States\u2014among the top five countries providing FDI inflows into India.\nAn improvement in investment-friendly policies has contributed to India\u2019s becoming the world\u2019s top greenfield FDI destination in the first half of 2015, after being the ninth-largest global FDI recipient in 2014, and the fifteenth largest the previous year.\nWhy India has not got membership in APEC?\nIndia was\u00a0denied\u00a0APEC membership in 2007 on the ground that\u00a0its economy was not integrated into the global system.\nLack of consensus\u00a0on including any new member\nFears of disrupting consensus\u00a0procedures\nExtra-regional status of India\u00a0might undermine APEC\u2019s geographic net beyond the\u00a0Pacific Rim.\nA large trade deficit in India\nAPEC members do not view India\u2019s politics and policies as\u00a0supportive of wide regional integration and wider trade options.\nWhy APEC needs India?\nIndia is the region\u2019s\u00a0third largest\u00a0and now\u00a0fastest growing major economy. APEC economies, which account for 60 per cent of global GDP, are experiencing sluggish growth\u00a0and must look for opportunities to bring new markets\nIndia is also projected to be the\u00a0world\u2019s third largest economy by 2030\u00a0and will need well over $1 trillion of investment in infrastructure over the next decade.\nWith\u00a0Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP) trade agreement becoming a reality APEC needs to reinvent itself.\nOn the supply side,\u00a0India\u2019s labour force, which will be the largest in the world by 2030, will help offset the impact of\u00a0ageing populations and\u00a0shrinking workforces\u00a0in APEC economies.\nIndia\u2019s trade\u00a0with APEC economies, which has\u00a0grown rapidly\u00a0over the last fifteen years will grow further once it joins APEC.\nA forward-looking commitment to India\u2019s economic future is precisely the kind of bold initiative needed to boost stubbornly sluggish regional and global growth.\nAdvantages for India:\nMembership in APEC would allow India to\u00a0negotiate trade, integrate with the global economy, and\u00a0help boost growth.\nIndia\u2019s inclusion in APEC will give a boost to its \u2018Act East Policy\u2018 and will further integrate the Indian economy into the Asia-Pacific economic milieu.\nApart from facilitating greater regional economic integration, APEC promotes the development of\u00a0small and medium enterprises\u00a0in the member countries by removing hurdles for trading\u00a0across borders.\nAPEC mechanisms and best practices will help Indian officials and businesses become more\u00a0competitive\u00a0and\u00a0better prepared\u00a0for the\u00a0changing global economy.\nThe inclusion of India in APEC will act as a catalyst for further economic reforms in the country.\nIssues and challenges:\nTrade War \u2013\u00a0APEC members have conflicting aims and objectives toward world trad e. Rising protectionism and the US-China Trade war\u00a0threatens economic growth in the region. The 2018 APEC Summit, to produce a joint communique because of tensions between the US and China over trade and security issues.\nCreation of Sub-Regional Agreements\u00a0\u2013 Many APEC economies seek to reach sub-regional free trade agreements has a negative impact on the roles APEC was originally expected to play in the region. The negotiations over\u00a0Trans-Pacific Partnership\u00a0and\u00a0Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership (RCEP)\u00a0further undercut the importance of APEC.\nShrinking Economy due to Covid\u00a0\u2013 The\u00a0Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC)\u00a0region is expected to post a\u00a07 per cent economic decline in 2020\u00a0due to the impact of\u00a0Covid-19.\nRising Unemployment \u2013\u00a0The region\u2019s\u00a0unemployment rate\u00a0is projected\u00a0to rise to 5.4 per cent in 2020\u00a0from\u00a08 per cent in 2019, or an additional 23.5 million workers being unemployed in 2020.\nWay Forward:\nIndia could take a more proactive approach in its international investment and trade negotiations.\nIndia would have to overcome strong domestic protectionist sentiments and build a robust, reliable, long-term domestic constituency for trade reform.\nAPEC might also consider changes to its current decision-making processes to mitigate concerns among current members that expanding membership would dilute the forum\u2019s impact.\nAPEC could welcome India as a member after securing assurances that India would implement specific measures to signal its commitment to APEC\u2019s mission.\nThe APEC member countries should\u00a0work together\u00a0to ensure their\u00a0collective\u00a0and\u00a0individual interests\u00a0are best represented.\nAt a time of global and regional geopolitical disturbances, the Covid pandemic situation and domestic challenges, it is of immense importance to find a wise solution that is designed to promote sustainable and equitable growth and development according to the specific circumstances of the Asia-Pacific region.\nThe rise of India as one of the global economic power and its changing regional economic and political influence necessitates that India is included in APEC. This would ensure free and open trade and investment in the Indo-Pacific region and foster growth.\nRelated Posts\nAct East Policy: Latest Developments\nAssociation of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN)\nEast Asia Summit\n\nArticle written by: Aseem Muhammed"

The non-permanent members are elected for two years regularly, and each of the G4 members has served more than a decade in UNSC since its inception.\n\nOutcomes of the recent meeting:\nThe G4 believed that immediate reform of the UN decision-making bodies was required due to the complexity and interrelation of the world\u2019s concerns.\nThey reaffirmed their shared commitment to work toward text-based agreements that result in Reformed Multilateralism as well.\nThey emphasized that the General Assembly lacked openness and failed to make \u201creal progress\u201d in the Inter-Governmental Negotiations (IGN).\nThey reaffirmed their support for the permanent and temporary representation of African nations.\nThe Ministers agreed that to increase the Council\u2019s capacity to effectively address the complex and changing issues related to international peace and security, developing nations and significant donors to the UN must play a greater role and be more present.\nInter-Governmental Negotiations (IGN):\n\nIGN is a collection of national governments working within the UN to enhance the Security Council\u2019s reform.\n\nThe IGN is composed of several different international organizations, namely:\n\nAfrican Union\nG4 nations\nUniting for Consensus Group (UfC)\n69 Group of Developing Countries\nArab League\nCaribbean Community (CARICOM)\nGlobal support to G4 countries\n\nThe United Kingdom, France, and United States supported the G4\u2019s bid to expand permanent and non-permanent seats of the UNSC.\n\nAll five members have at different points supported India\u2019s claim to permanent membership but with conditions attached to their agendas. For example, China would support India but not Japan.\n\nOpposition to G4: the Coffee Club\n\nThe Uniting for Consensus (UfC), or the Coffee Club, emerged in the 1990s in opposition to the potential extension of permanent seats on the UN Security Council.\n\nUnder the direction of Italy, it seeks to oppose the applications for permanent members put out by the G4 countries and is requesting a consensus before any decision is made regarding the structure and makeup of the Security Council.\n\nItaly, along with Pakistan, Mexico and Egypt founded the Coffee Club in 1995 to reject the proposal to increase the number of permanent seats in the UNSC.\n\nThe Uniting for Consensus group contends that an increase in permanent seats will exacerbate the inequality among the member nations and lead to the cascading expansion of several privileges.\n\nOther core members of this grouping are: Canada, Spain, Turkey, Argentina, and Malta.\n\nThe need for UNSC reforms\n\nThe global scenario has changed a lot since World War II, and the economic balance has shifted. The G4 countries are the best example of such a shift of balance.\n\nOther global powers are growing faster economically and will beat the P5 also. Hence, it is necessary to reform the Council concerning the current trend.\n\nThe inability of the Security Council to effectively address the challenges vividly demonstrates the urgent need for UN Security Council reform to better reflect contemporary geopolitical realities, and to enhance its effectiveness and the legitimacy and implementation of its decisions.\n\nThe IGN is constrained by a lack of openness and transparency and must be guided by the decision-making requirements and working methods laid out in the Charter of the United Nations and the rules and procedures of the General Assembly.\n\nAll in all, the presence of more developing nations is required to enhance the reach and response of the council effectively.\n\n-Article written by Swathi Satish"

It sits in the so-called \u201cfirst island chain\u201d, which includes a list of US-friendly territories that are crucial to US foreign policy.\n\nIt has been governed independently of mainland China, officially the People\u2019s Republic of China (PRC), since 1949.\n\nThe PRC views the island as a renegade province and vows to eventually unify Taiwan with the mainland.\n\nIn Taiwan, which has its own democratically elected government and is home to twenty-three million people, political leaders have differing views on the island\u2019s status and relations with the mainland.\n\nTable of Contents\n\n\ud83d\udc49 Which year are YOU targeting for success in the IAS/IPS/IFS Exam? \ud83d\ude80\n\n(1) \u21d2 UPSC 2025: Prelims cum Mains\n\n(2) \u21d2 UPSC 2026: Prelims cum Mains\n\n(3) \u21d2 UPSC 2027 Prelims cum Mains\n\nTip: Know more about ClearIAS Courses (Online/Offline)\n\nHistory of Taiwan\nChina-Taiwan relations\nRole of the US in the China-Taiwan issue\nRecognition to Taiwan\nConsequences of US-China-Taiwan tensions\nIndia\u2019s stand on the China-Taiwan issue\nWay forward\nHistory of Taiwan\n\nThe first known settlers in Taiwan were Austronesian tribal people, who are thought to have come from modern-day southern China.\n\nThe island was first mentioned in Chinese records in 239 CE when an emperor sent an expeditionary force to explore the area.\n\nIt was under Dutch control from 1624 to 1661.\n\nThen Taiwan was administered by China\u2019s Qing dynasty from 1683 to 1895.\n\nThe largest demographic groups on the island now are Hakka Chinese who fled the mainland in the 17th century.\n\nThe Qing dynasty had to surrender Taiwan to Japan in 1895 after it lost in the First Sino-Japanese War.\n\nAfter World War II, Japan surrendered and relinquished control of territory it had taken from China. The Republic of China (ROC) which was one of the victors in the war began ruling Taiwan with the consent of its allies, the US and the UK.\n\nDuring the civil war in China, Mao Zedong\u2019s Communist army took the reign of the mainland by defeating the Kuomintang (KMT). The remnants of the KMT government and their support fled to Taiwan in 1949.\n\nThey established a government in exile in Taiwan which led the island for the next 25 years. The successors allowed more democratization over the years as the locals protested against the authoritarian rule.\n\nPresident Lee Teng-hui, known as Taiwan\u2019s \u2018father of democracy, led constitutional changes, which eventually made way for the election of the island\u2019s first non-KMT president, in 2000.\n\nThe present-day conflict arose out of the fact that the ROC government-in-exile at first claimed to represent the whole of China, which it intended to re-occupy. It held China\u2019s seat on the United Nations Security Council and was recognized by many Western nations as the only Chinese government.\n\nBut by the 1970s some countries began to argue that the Taipei government could no longer be considered a genuine representative of the hundreds of millions of people living in mainland China.\n\nThen in 1971, the UN switched diplomatic recognition to Beijing and the ROC government was forced out. In 1978, China also began opening up its economy. Recognizing opportunities for trade and the need to develop relations, the US formally established diplomatic ties with Beijing in 1979.\n\nSince then the number of countries that recognize the ROC government diplomatically has fallen drastically to about 15.\n\nNow, despite having all the characteristics of an independent state and a political system that is distinct from China, Taiwan\u2019s legal status remains unclear.\n\nChina-Taiwan relations\nCourtesy: BBC\n\nBy the 1980s Taiwan relaxed rules on visits and investments in China. In 1991, it proclaimed that the war with the People\u2019s Republic of China was over.\n\nChina proposed the so-called \u2018one country, two systems\u2019 option, which it said would allow Taiwan significant autonomy if it agreed to come under Beijing\u2019s control.\n\nTaiwan rejected the offer and Beijing\u2019s insisted that Taiwan\u2019s ROC government is illegitimate \u2013 but unofficial representatives from China and Taiwan still held limited talks.\n\nBeijing claims that Taiwan is bound by an understanding known as the\u00a01992 Consensus, which was reached between representatives of the\u00a0Chinese Communist Party (CCP) and the Kuomintang (KMT) party that ruled Taiwan at that time.\nHowever, the two sides do not agree on the content of this consensus, as it was never intended to address the question of Taiwan\u2019s legal status.\n\nIn 2000, the Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) came into power in Taiwan which promoted the idea of independence which alarmed mainland China.\n\nIn 2008, KMT came into power and tried to restore the one China system through economic relations.\n\nIn 2016 the current President of DPP came into power hence re-affirming the idea of independence again.\n\nSince 2018, Beijing had been putting pressure on international companies and forums to list Taiwan as part of China.\n\nBy 2020, Hong Kong had seen months of protests against the growing influence of mainland China on the island.\n\nLater that year\u00a0China\u2019s implemented a national security law in Hong Kong\u00a0which was another sign of Beijing\u2019s assertion.\n\nEconomically, the trade and investments between Taipei and Beijing have been increasing. This causes the Taiwanese to worry that their economy is now dependent on China.\n\nRole of the US in the China-Taiwan issue\n\nIn 1979, the United States established formal diplomatic relations with the PRC. At the same time, it severed its diplomatic ties and abrogated its mutual defense treaty with the ROC.\n\nOfficially, the US acknowledges the \u201cOne-China\u201d policy, which recognizes only one Chinese government in Beijing and has formal ties with Beijing rather than Taipei.\n\nBut Washington\u2019s actions have been that of strategic ambiguity where it has proclaimed that it would intervene militarily if China were to invade Taiwan. The US has also pledged to supply Taiwan with defensive weapons. Beijing has repeatedly urged Washington to stop selling weapons and cease contact with Taipei.\n\nThe Trump administration had increased the arms trade to Taiwan which escalated tension between China-Taiwan and the Biden administration is continuing the weapons trade with Taipei.\n\nThe issue of Taiwan has strained the relations between US and China. Beijing has condemned the support of Washington to Taipei and has increased military exercises around Taiwan Strait in recent times.\n\nThe visit of US house speaker Nancy Pelosi to Taiwan has heightened the tensions between the countries.\n\nChina has kick-started one of the most significant military exercises in the Taiwan straits and put economic sanctions on the island.\nRecognition to Taiwan\n\nChina rejects Taiwan\u2019s participation as a member in UN agencies and other international organizations that limit membership to states. Taipei regularly protests its exclusion; the United States also pushes for Taiwan\u2019s meaningful participation in such organizations.\n\nAmid the COVID-19 pandemic, Taipei criticized the World Health Organization (WHO) for giving in to Beijing\u2019s demands and continuing to bar Taiwan\u2014which mounted one of the\u00a0world\u2019s most effective responses\u00a0to COVID-19 in the first two years of the pandemic\u2014from attending the organization\u2019s World Health Assembly as an observer. Ministers from the Group of Seven (G7) countries have called for Taiwan\u2019s inclusion in WHO forums.\n\nTaiwan does, however, hold member status in more than forty organizations, most of them regional, such as the Asian Development Bank and the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation forum, as well as the World Trade Organization. It holds observer or another status on several other bodies.\n\nOnly\u00a0fourteen states\u00a0maintain official diplomatic ties with Taiwan. No government has ever simultaneously maintained formal diplomatic ties with both China and Taiwan.\n\nConsequences of US-China-Taiwan tensions\n\nThe US-Taiwan relations are fuelling the military assertiveness of China in the Taiwan Strait. Such conflict has the potential to lead to a US-China confrontation.\n\nThe cross-strait tensions can have a negative impact on Taiwan\u2019s vital semiconductor chip manufacturing industry. Companies in Taiwan were responsible for more than 60 percent of the revenue generated by the world\u2019s semiconductor contract manufacturers in 2020.\n\nTaiwan Strait is one of the major global trade routes with almost 20% of global trade passing through the strait. Any military activity between China-Taiwan will disrupt the global supply chain creating a crisis on the international stage.\n\nIndia\u2019s stand on the China-Taiwan issue\n\nIndia does not have formal diplomatic ties with Taiwan yet as it recognizes the One China policy. But since 1995, both sides have maintained representative offices in each other\u2019s capitals that function as de facto embassies.\n\nBut as India-China ties have been under stress lately, India has been playing up its relationship with Taiwan.\n\nAs a part of India\u2019s Act East Foreign Policy, India has sought to cultivate extensive ties with Taiwan in trade and investment as well as developing cooperation in science & technology, environmental issues, and people-to-people exchange.\n\nThe\u00a0India-Taipei Association (ITA)\u00a0and\u00a0Taipei Economic and Cultural Centre (TECC)\u00a0in New Delhi are examples of the exchange.\nWay forward\n\nThe Russian-Ukraine war is been observed by the world and especially in China, so Beijing will analyze the consequences of the ongoing war before any action against Taiwan. But the Chinese economy is far more than the Russian economy hence that will also be taken into consideration.\n\nAny escalation in the Taiwan Strait will affect the whole Indo-Pacific security and trade.\n\nCountries like Japan, and Australia have urged China to cease the military exercises and missile test fires around Taiwan, which shows that Chinese aggression has started affecting the nations already."

It\u2019s also known as the\u00a0\u201cSummit on Financial Markets and the World Economy\u201d\u00a0and represents\u00a080%\u00a0of the global GDP.\n\nThe summit\u00a0gathers leaders from the European Union and the following countries:\n\nCanada\nFrance\nGermany\nItaly\nJapan\nthe United Kingdom\nthe United States.\n\nIt is capable of setting the global agenda because decisions taken by these major economic powers have a real impact. The political direction set by these leaders on a policy issue will have a \u201cripple\u201d effect across many other international organizations and institutions.\n\nThus, decisions taken at the G7 are not legally binding but exert strong political influence.\n\nG-7 in numbers\n\nThe aggregate GDP of G-7 member states makes up nearly 31% of the global economy, 10% of the world\u2019s population, and 21% of global carbon dioxide emissions.\n\nIn all G7 countries, annual public sector expenditure exceeded revenue in 2021. Most G7 countries also had a high level of gross debt, especially Japan, Italy, and the US.\n\nThe G7 countries are important players in global trade. The US and Germany in particular are major export nations.\n\nInitiatives by G-7\n\nDuring the 1980s, the G7 broadened its areas of concern to include issues of international security, human rights, and global security; for example, during this period, the G7 concerned itself with the ongoing\u00a0Iran-Iraq War\u00a0and\u00a0Soviet occupation of Afghanistan.\n\nIn response to mounting concern over\u00a0money laundering, the Financial Action Task Force on Money Laundering (FATF)\u00a0was established by the\u00a0G-7 groping in Paris in 1989.\n\nIn the 1990s, it launched a debt-relief program for the 42 heavily indebted poor countries (HIPC); provided $300 million to help build the Shelter Structure over the damaged reactor at Chornobyl, and established the Financial Stability Forum to help in \u201cmanaging the international monetary system\u201d.\n\nAfter the G7 meeting in Berlin in May 2022, the climate, energy, and environment ministers made a new pledge to decarbonize electricity sectors by 2035.\n\nTheir decision was based on the backdrop of the ongoing Russo-Ukrainian War which has given a renewed sense of urgency to expedite the transition to cleaner energy sources.\n\nOver the years, the G7 has faced several geopolitical challenges that have led some international analysts to question its credibility or propose its replacement by the G20.\n\nChallenges\n\nThe forum\u2019s small and relatively homogenous membership promotes collective decision-making, but critics note that it often lacks follow-through and that its membership excludes necessary emerging powers.\n\nRussia\u2019s actions are one of the biggest challenges faced by the grouping and the actions against the Ukraine Invasion haven\u2019t been strong enough.\n\nAlongside the Russia challenge, there is a growing sense that China poses a \u201cthreefold threat\u201d to G7 countries- economically, ideologically, and geopolitically.\n\nChina\u2019s repression of Uyghurs in the Xinjiang region and its crackdown in Hong Kong has drawn condemnation from G7 members.\nIts massive\u00a0Belt and Road Initiative (BRI)\u00a0has prompted concerns about Beijing\u2019s influence over developing countries.\n\nThe build back better world was announced last year to counter the BRI but the idea fell through. This year again another global infrastructure funding plan of 600 billion dollars has been unveiled to rival the BRI.\n\nConclusion\n\nG7 still has value because all member countries are grappling with similar issues. \u00a0The 2022 summit concentrates more on the war in Ukraine and the need to reduce dependence on Russian energy, especially in Europe.\n\nAdditionally, the bloc faces a looming global food crisis from the war, which has already resulted in shortages of wheat and other crops. G7 members are also contending with surging energy prices, contributing to record inflation.\n\nClimate concerns are always a part of such forum discussions but they may take a backseat this time due to the energy crisis."

Industrialized countries became a minority among developing countries, the budget grew five-fold and the number of officials quadrupled.\n\nThe ILO established the Geneva-based International Institute for Labour Studies in 1960 and the International Training Centre in Turin in 1965. The organization won the Nobel Peace Prize on its 50th anniversary in 1969.\n\nThe ILO played a major role in the emancipation of Poland from dictatorship by giving its full support to the legitimacy of the Solidarnosc Union.\n\nIn the post-cold war period, ILO emphasized the importance of placing social justice at the heart of international economic and social policies.\n\n1999 underlined work as an instrument of poverty alleviation and the ILO\u2019s role in helping to achieve the Millennium Development Goals, including cutting world poverty in half by 2015.\n\n\u2018Decent Work for all is possible but societies have to make it happen\u2019- It is precisely with this imperative that the ILO established its\u00a0Global Commission on the Future of Work\u00a0as part of its initiative to mark its centenary in 2019.\n\nWorld of work report\n\nThe ninth edition of the ILO Monitor on the \u2018World of Work\u2019 found that after significant gains made during the last quarter of 2021, the number of hours worked globally dropped in the first quarter of 2022.\n\nThis means that about 11.2 crore jobs might have been lost during this period, according to the report.\n\nThe fresh lockdowns in China, the\u00a0conflict between Ukraine and Russia, and the global rise in the\u00a0prices of food and fuel\u00a0are cited as the main reasons for the findings.\n\nKey findings of the ILO report:\n\nThe divergence between richer and poorer economies:\n\nA great and growing divergence between richer and poorer economies continues to characterize the recovery.\nWhile\u00a0high-income countries experienced a recovery in hours worked, low- and lower-middle-income economies suffered setbacks\u00a0in the first quarter of the year with a 3.6 and 5.7% gap respectively when compared to the pre-crisis benchmark.\n\nReduction in working hours:\n\nBoth India and Lower-Middle-Income countries experienced a deterioration in the gender gap in work hours in the second quarter of 2020.\n\nWorkplace closures:\n\nThese recent reductions in strict workplace closures were particularly pronounced in Europe and Central Asia, where currently 70% of workers face either only recommended closures or none at all.\n\nLabour incomes:\n\nIn 2021, three out of five workers lived in countries where average annual labour incomes had not yet recovered to their level of the fourth quarter of 2019.\n\nInformal employment:\n\nWomen in the informal sector were impacted more, but it has rebounded faster than the formal employment sector.\n\nAbout India:\n\nFor every 100 women at work before the pandemic, 12.3 women would have lost their job on average through the entire period considered by the report.\nIn contrast, for every 100 men, the equivalent figure would have been 7.5.\nHence, the pandemic seems to have exacerbated the already substantial gender imbalances in employment participation in the country.\nWomen\u2019s employment in India has come down, particularly in sectors such as healthcare as a result of the Covid-19 pandemic.\nRecommendations in the report:\n\nILO has been proposing decent jobs and decent wages so that the purchasing capacity of workers is improved.\n\nThe ILO adopted a Global Call to Action for a Human-Centred Recovery from the Covid-19 crisis that is inclusive, sustainable, and resilient, providing a detailed set of recommendations addressed to governments, employers\u2019 and workers\u2019 organizations, and the international community.\n\nTimely and effective support is needed to protect and maintain the purchasing power of labour income and overall living standards.\n\nMacroeconomic policies are needed to combat inflation emerging as a policy challenge.\n\nTo promote recovery over the longer term, well-designed sectoral policies are needed to promote the creation of decent jobs, while aiming at formalization, sustainability, and inclusiveness.\n\nThe International Labour Organization promotes Global Accelerator for Jobs and Social Protection for Just Transitions, with its aim of creating at least 400 million jobs by 2030, primarily in the green, digital and care economy, and extending social protection floors to over 4 billion people currently not covered, is an important initiative.\n\nPrevious year question\n\nQ.

The dispute is concerning four islands.\n\nThe islands are part of the Ring of Fire belt of geologic instability circling the Pacific.\n\nIt contains at least 100 volcanoes, of which 35 are still active, and many hot springs.\nEarthquakes and tidal waves are common phenomena over these islands.\nHistory of Kuril Islands Dispute\n\nThe Kuril island chain was annexed by the soviet union during the Kuril island landing operation at the end of World War II.\n\nThe Kuril Islands dispute between Japan and Russia is over the sovereignty of the South Kuril Islands.\n\nThe islands in dispute are:\n\nIturup or Etorofu Island\nKunashir or Kunashiri Island\nShikotan Island\nHabomai Island\n\nThese islands are known as\u00a0Southern Kurils by Russia whereas Japan calls them the Northern Territories.\n\nThe Kurils were originally inhabited by the Ainu people. Later after several explorations in the 17th and 18th centuries, they were later settled by the Russians and Japanese.\n\nThe Ainu are the indigenous people of the lands surrounding the Sea of Okhotsk, including Hokkaido Island, Northeast Honshu Island, Sakhalin Island, the Kuril Islands, and the Kamchatka Peninsula and Khabarovsk Krai, before the arrival of the Yamato Japanese and Russians.\nThe Ainu or the Aynu, also known as the Ezo in the historical Japanese texts.\nAfter the annexation of the Hokkaido islands by Japan, the Ainu have all but nearly assimilated into Japanese culture.\nAgreements between Japan and Russia over the Kuril Islands\n\nThe first Russo-Japanese agreement to deal with the status of\u00a0Sakhalin\u00a0and the\u00a0Kuril Islands\u00a0was the 1855\u00a0Treaty of Shimoda, which first established official relations between Russia and Japan.\n\nTreaty of Shimoda (1855):\n\nIn\u00a01855,\u00a0Japan and Russia concluded the\u00a0Treaty of Shimoda,\u00a0which gave control of the four southernmost islands to Japan and the remainder of the chain to Russia.\n\nTreaty of Saint Petersburg (1875):\n\nIn the\u00a0Treaty of Saint Petersburg, signed between the two countries in\u00a01875,\u00a0Russia ceded possession of the Kurils to Japan in exchange for uncontested control of Sakhalin Island.\n\nThe Russo-Japanese War of 1904\u20135 was a military disaster for Russia. The 1905 Treaty of Portsmouth, which concluded at the end of this war, gave the southern half of Sakhalin Island to Japan.\n\nDuring World War II Japan was an ally of Germany and USSR had an understanding of it. But later on, Soviet and Japanese soldiers were on opposite sides.\n\nYalta Agreement (1945):\n\nIn\u00a01945, as part of the\u00a0Yalta agreements (formalized in the 1951 Treaty of Peace with Japan),\u00a0the islands were ceded to the Soviet Union, and the Japanese population was repatriated and replaced by the Soviets.\n\nSan Francisco Peace Treaty, 1951\n\nThis treaty was signed between the Allies and Japan in 1951 and stated that Japan must give up all right, title, and claim to the Kuril Islands, but it also does not recognize the Soviet Union\u2019s sovereignty over them.\n\nThe above two treaties after World war complicated the issues further leading to modern-day disputes over the Kuril Islands.\n\nJapan-Soviet Joint Declaration (1956):\n\nIn 1956, diplomatic ties were restored between Japan and Russia by\u00a0Japan-Soviet Joint Declaration.\n\nDuring the 1956 peace talks between Japan and the Soviet Union, the Soviet side proposed to settle the dispute by returning Shikotan and Habomai to Japan.\n\nJapan agreed to this and the declaration ended the state of war between the two countries. But the Kuril Islands dispute persisted in the form of interpretation of territorial provisions.\n\nLatest developments:\n\nDespite a series of agreements, the dispute continues and\u00a0Japan still claims historical rights to the southernmost islands\u00a0and has tried repeatedly to persuade the Soviet Union and, from 1991, Russia to return those islands to Japanese sovereignty.\n\nIn\u00a02018,\u00a0the Russian President and the Japanese Prime Minister met on the sidelines of the\u00a0East Asia Summit and decided to end the territorial dispute with the Japanese PM agreeing to negotiate based on the 1956 declaration.\n\nThis showed that Japan has given up the two islands to maintain peace with Russia.\n\nHowever, Russia indicated that the joint declaration signed by Japan and the Soviet Union in 1956\u00a0neither mentions a basis for returning Habomai and Shikotan nor clarifies which country has sovereignty over the islands.\n\nIn 2019, the Japanese PM made it clear that the country is\u00a0not in the favour of withdrawing control over the Islands. Japan also believes that the islands are an inherent part of the nation\u2019s territory, therefore, it aims to sign the peace treaty after the territorial issue is resolved.\n\nImportance of Kuril Islands\n\nWhy are the Kuril Islands been contested so aggressively by two developed nations? The major reason is resources.\n\nNatural resources:\n\nThe islands are surrounded by rich fishing grounds and are thought to have offshore reserves of oil and gas.\nAlso, rare\u00a0rhenium deposits have\u00a0been found on the Kudriavy volcano on Iturup.\nNickel-based superalloys of rhenium are\u00a0used in the combustion chambers, turbine blades, and exhaust nozzles of jet engines.\n\nTourism:\n\nTourism is also a potential source of huge income, as the islands have several volcanoes and a variety of birdlife that can be utilized for adventure activities.\n\nStrategic Importance:\n\nIn 2020, Russia deployed\u00a0missile systems\u00a0in the region and also plans a\u00a0submarine project, and intends to prevent any American military use of the islands.\n\nCultural Importance:\n\nThe Japanese people, especially conservatives in Hokkaido, are emotionally attached to the islands.\n\nGlobal stand on the Kuril Island dispute\n\nThe European Parliament 2005 called on Russia to return to Japan to the occupied south Kuril Islands.\n\nThe United States recognizes Japan\u2019s sovereignty over the islands.\n\nChina has gone back and forth on the issue depending on its relation with Russia.\n\nThe South Korean government has mostly kept a neutral stance over the Russia-Japan dispute as it also has claims over what it calls Dokdo Islands. South Korea and Japan are in a diplomatic dispute over this for more than 300 years.\n\nWay forward\n\nThe interest of both countries cannot be satisfied fully in any agreement on this issue but a midway has to be devised.\n\nThe militarization of the islands by Russia is considered to be its strategy to strengthen its position in the pacific via the North Sea route which worries Japan.\n\nThe interests of the Ainu people should also be taken into account as they are the native inhabitants of the islands.\n\nThe resolution of the dispute is important or else it will add to the already unstable indo-pacific region."

The economic advancement required a huge amount of aid to help the war-torn landscapes. Help was also needed to establish industries and produce food, while the threat from Germany and the Soviet Union prevailed.\n\nThe Marshall Plan (1948): The US viewed the new Europe as economically strong, rearmed, and integrated which was important to prevent the communist expansion across the continent.\n\nHence, the Secretary of State George Marshall proposed a plan of huge economic aid to Europe known as the Marshall Plan or European Recovery Program, which facilitated European economic integration and promoted the idea of shared interests and cooperation between the United States and Europe.\n\nHowever, the Soviet Union refused to participate in the Marshall Plan and did not even allow its satellite states in Eastern Europe to accept economic assistance. This led to more division between the East and the West.\n\nMembers of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO)\n\nThe original members were Belgium, Canada, Denmark, France, Iceland, Italy, Luxembourg, the Netherlands, Norway, Portugal, the UK, and the US.\n\nLater the original signatories were joined by Greece and Turkey (1952), West Germany (1955; Germany from 1990); Bulgaria, Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania, Romania, Slovakia, and Slovenia (2004); Albania and Croatia (2009); Montenegro (2017); and North Macedonia (2020).\n\nFrance withdrew from the\u00a0integrated\u00a0military command of NATO in 1966 but remained a member of the organization; it resumed its position in NATO\u2019s military command in 2009.\n\nArticles 5 and 6 of the North Atlantic Treaty:\n\nArticle 5: An armed attack against one or more of them in Europe or North America shall be considered an attack against them all; and consequently they agree that, if such an armed attack occurs, each of them, in the exercise of the right of individual or collective self-defense recognized by Article 51 of the Charter of the United Nations, will assist the Party or Parties so attacked by taking forthwith, individually and in concert with the other Parties, such action as it deems necessary, including the use of armed force, to restore and maintain the security of the North Atlantic area.\n\nArticle 6 defines the geographic scope of the treaty as covering \u201can armed attack on the territory of any of the Parties in Europe or North America.\u201d Other articles commit the allies to strengthening their democratic institutions, building their collective military capability, to consulting each other, and remaining open to inviting other European states to join.\n\nOrganization of North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO)\n\nThe North Atlantic Council was established soon after the treaty came into effect. It is composed of ministerial representatives of the member states, who meet at least twice a year. At other times the council, chaired by the NATO secretary-general, remains in permanent session at the ambassadorial level.\n\nSupreme Allied Commander Europe (SACEUR) by the North Atlantic Council (NATO\u2019s governing body)\u00a0 was formed after World War II in December 1950.\n\nThe position of SACEUR has always been held by an American, the secretary-generalship has always been held by a European.\n\nThe\u00a0Military Committee, consisting of representatives of the military chiefs of staff of the member states, subsumes two strategic commands:\u00a0Allied Command Operations (ACO) and\u00a0Allied Command Transformation (ACT). ACO is headed by the SACEUR and located at Supreme Headquarters Allied Powers Europe (SHAPE) in Casteau, Belgium.\n\nThe Warsaw Pact\n\nThe Paris Agreement admitted the membership of West Germany to NATO in 1950 prompting the soviet union to form the Warsaw Pact alliance in central and eastern Europe the same year.\n\nWarsaw Pact, formally Warsaw Treaty of Friendship, Cooperation, and Mutual Assistance, (May 14, 1955\u2013July 1, 1991) treaty establishing a mutual-defence organization (Warsaw Treaty Organization) composed originally of the Soviet Union and Albania, Bulgaria, Czechoslovakia, East Germany, Hungary, Poland, and Romania (Albania withdrew in 1968, and East Germany in 1990.)\n\nThe treaty (which was renewed on April 26, 1985) provided for a unified military command and the maintenance of Soviet military units on the territories of the other participating states.\n\nAfter the democratic revolutions of 1989 in Eastern Europe, the Warsaw Pact became moribund and was formally declared \u201cnonexistent\u201d on July 1, 1991, at a final summit meeting of Warsaw Pact leaders in Prague, Czechoslovakia. Deployed Soviet troops were gradually withdrawn from the former satellites, now politically independent countries.\n\nThe decades-long confrontation between Eastern and Western Europe was formally rejected by members of the Warsaw Pact, all of which, except the Soviet successor state of Russia, subsequently joined NATO.\n\nRussia-NATO Relations\n\nRussia has constantly raised the issue of the eastward expansion of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO). Over the years Russia-NATO relations have seen many ups and downs.\n\n1994: Russia joined the partnership for peace program with NATO.\n\n2002: the Russia-NATO council was established to handle security issues and other joint projects.\n\n2014: The annexation of Crimea by Russia caused the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) to unanimously end all cooperation with Russia. But the NATO-Russia council was not suspended.\n\n2021: Eight Russian diplomats were expelled from Brussels where the Russian mission to NATO was present. Russian President Vladimir Putin stated his displeasure with the North Atlantic Treaty Organization\u2019s expansion into Ukraine which in the end led to the present Russia-Ukraine conflict.\n\nRecent developments\nFinland became NATO\u2019s 31st member on 4 April 2023, upon depositing its instrument of accession to the North Atlantic Treaty.\nHungary\u2019s parliament approved Sweden\u2019s NATO accession on February 26, 2024, clearing the last hurdle before the historic step by the Nordic country whose neutrality lasted through two world wars and the simmering conflict of the Cold War.\nSweden is leaving 200 years of neutrality and military non-alignment behind and joining NATO."

The population includes mostly ethnic Russians but has Ukrainians and Crimeans as well.\n\nIn the 18th century, Crimea was annexed by the Russian empire. Following the Russian Revolution, Crimea became an autonomous region in the Soviet Union.\n\nIn 1954, Soviet leader Nikita Khrushchev, a Ukrainian by birth, transferred Crimea to Ukraine. \u00a0But the status of Crimea remained disputed since then.\n\nIn February 2014, post-Ukrainian Revolution, Russian troops were deployed in Crimea. A referendum on reunification with Russia was held in March in which 90% population favoured joining Russia. Despite opposition from Ukraine, Russia formally annexed Crimea in March 2014.\n\nRead here for in-depth details of the Euromaidan, Ukrainian revolution, and Crimean annexation.\n\nThe Minsk agreements between Russia-Ukraine\n\nFollowing the 2014 Ukraine revolution and the Euromaidan movement, civil unrest erupted in the Donetsk and Luhansk regions (together called the Donbas region) in Eastern Ukraine which borders Russia.\n\nThe majority population in these regions are Russians and it has been alleged that Russia fuelled anti-government campaigns there. Russia-backed insurgents and the Ukrainian military engaged in armed confrontations in the region.\n\nMINSK I\n\nIn September 2014, talks led to the signing of the Minsk protocol (Minsk I) by the Trilateral Contact Group involving Ukraine, Russia, and the Organisation for the Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE). It is a 12 point ceasefire deal involving provisions like weapon removal, prisoner exchanges, humanitarian aid, etc. But the deal broke following violations by both sides.\n\nMINSK II\n\nIn 2015, yet another protocol termed Minsk II was signed by the parties. It included provisions to delegate more power to the rebel-controlled regions. But the clauses remain un-implemented due to differences between Ukraine and Russia.\n\nOrganization for Security and Co-operation in Europe (OSCE)\n\nThe Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe (OSCE) is the world\u2019s largest security-oriented intergovernmental organization with observer status at the United Nations. It is based in Vienna, Austria. It has 57 members spanning across Europe, Asia, and North America. India is not a member. Decisions are made by consensus.\n\nIts mandate includes issues such as arms control, promotion of human rights, freedom of the press, and fair elections. It has its origins in the mid-1975 Conference on Security and Co-operation in Europe (CSCE) held in Helsinki, Finland. In 1994, CSCE was renamed the OSCE. It was created during the Cold War era as an East-West forum.\n\nRussia-Ukraine conflict: Present Day\n\nThe latest episode of the Russian troop display near the Ukraine border is linked to all the previous issues. Not just Russia, but the United States and the European Union have stakes in Ukraine.\n\nWhile Russia shares centuries-old cultural ties with Ukraine, the US and the European Union see Ukraine as a buffer between Russia and the West.\n\nRussia seeks assurance from the West that Ukraine would not be made part of NATO which has anti-Russian ambitions. But the US is not ready to budge on Russia\u2019s demands.\n\nThe sudden rise in tensions can be attributed to the following factors:\n\nThe newly elected President of Ukraine, Volodymyr Zelensky, has been harsh on Russian supporters in Ukraine and has been going against Moscow\u2019s interests.\nPerceivably undecisive administration in the US under the new President Joe Biden and Washington\u2019s chaotic exit from Afghanistan.\nRussian President Vladimir Putin\u2019s immense interest in Ukraine. Putin maintains that Ukraine is the \u201cred line\u201d the West must not cross.\nIndia\u2019s stand on Russia- Ukraine conflict\n\nIndia has long maintained a cautious silence on the Russia-Ukraine conflict issue. But recently India has spoken in the matter and called for peaceful resolution of the issue through sustained diplomatic efforts for long-time peace and stability.\n\nNew Delhi and Moscow have a time-tested and reliable relationship especially with Russia being a major arms supplier to India.\n\nIndia has risked US sanctions under Countering America\u2019s Adversaries Through Sanctions Act (CAATSA) by the buying S-400 missile defence system from Russia.\n\nOn the other hand, India also needs the support of the US and EU in balancing its strategic calculus.\n\nIt is also worthwhile to note that India had abstained from voting in a United Nations resolution upholding Ukraine\u2019s territorial integrity following Russia\u2019s Crimean annexation in 2014.\n\nEven this time, India is maintaining a patient approach by hoping that the situation will be handled peacefully by skilful negotiators.\n\nWay forward\n\nThe Russia-Ukraine conflict is threatening the delicate balance the world is in right now and escalation can have manifold impacts on a global scale.\u00a0 There is a strong case for de-escalation, as a peaceful culmination of severed relations is for the good of everyone in the region and the world over.\n\nThe US can play a central role in the management of the Russia- Ukraine conflict with support from the other European allies like the UK, Germany, and France.\n\nNegotiations and strategic investments should be aimed at creating sustainable resolution of the conflict.\n\nIt will not be enough to just smooth over the difficulties, but major attention to be given to structure the military disengagement to minimize the chances of backsliding.\n\nAlso read:\u00a0Butterfly mines"

This led to the first Conference of Heads of State or Governments of Non-Aligned Countries. The term\u00a0non-aligned movement\u00a0first appeared in the fifth conference in 1976, where participating countries are denoted as \u201cmembers of the movement\u201d.\n\nNon-alignment was about retaining the independence of judgment and freedom of political action.\n\nThe purpose of the organization was enumerated in the Havana Declaration of 1979 to ensure \u201cthe national independence, sovereignty, territorial integrity and security of non-aligned countries\u201d in their struggle against imperialism, colonialism, neo-colonialism, racism, and all forms of foreign subjugation.\n\nAlso read: India-Mongolia Relations\n\nPhases of Non-Aligned Movement:\n\nPhase 1\n\nThe first phase of Indian foreign policy lasted from independence in 1947 to the end of the\u00a0Indo-Pak war\u00a0in 1965.\nIndia\u2019s first prime minister Jawaharlal Nehru was the key political figure of this period.\n\nPhase 2\n\nAfter Nehru died in 1964, Indira Gandhi leaned towards the Soviet Union as a key international partner and in doing so distanced India even further from the USA.\n\nPhase III: After the Cold War\n\nThe end of the Cold War and the collapse of the Soviet Union changed the environment of India\u2019s foreign policy drastically.\nIndia moved closer to Washington\u2019s side on the geopolitical aspect.\nNon-Aligned Movement and India\n\nThe Non-Aligned Movement had become an effective means of promoting India\u2019s diplomatic presence and the means of securing economic assistance internationally.\n\nBut the disintegration of the USSR led to a world order dominated by the US. India\u2019s New Economic Policy and inclination towards the US raised questions over India\u2019s seriousness over non-alignment.\n\nNAM continued losing relevance for India in an aligned world, especially after the founding members failed to support India during crises. During the 1965 and 1971 wars, Indonesia and Egypt took an anti-India stance and supported Pakistan.\n\nEventually, India and other NAM countries started associating themselves with developed powers within the liberal economic order and reaped benefited from it.\n\nIndia is a\u00a0member of the G20 has declared itself as a\u00a0nuclear weapons power\u00a0and has for all practical purposes abandoned the call for global nuclear disarmament.\n\nIndia has also joined the\u00a0Quadrilateral Security Dialogue (QUAD) a coalition seen by many as a counter to China\u2019s rise in the Indo-Pacific, along with membership of the Shanghai cooperation organization (SCO) led by China has shown India\u2019s balancing approach in the new world order.\n\nIndia is striving hard for balanced world order and asserting itself as one of the key players.\n\nIn 2019, India was represented at the 18th NAM summit by its vice president and external affairs minister.

This had created many alignments among the countries due to the lack of uniform structure.\nThe NAM has shown a tendency to ignore some of the human rights violations committed by member countries.\nNAM could not stop the arms race and bring an end to Nuclear Proliferation.\nIt could not prevent regional confrontations.\nThe lack of collective action and collective self-reliance, and the failure to establish an international economic order.\nNAM today competes with groups like the Commonwealth, which are more effective, as they deal with economic and trade issues.\nNAM does not participate in economic and trade aspects, nor does it take up any diplomatic initiative.\nIt has no position even on issues like human rights, child exploitation, and gender issue since most of the members of NAM are developing.\nThe changing global scenario\n\nThe world is again being divided into blocs, one led by the US and the other by\u00a0China-Russia.\n\nThe Syrian war is an example of this, where both US and Russia are asserting power.\nThe tension in the Indo-pacific region due to China\u2019s antics and the US trying to check the Chinese expansionist policy is another example.\n\nThe large-scale migrations to Europe from Asia and Africa, and within Asia due to the unstable regimes and ethnic conflict are also influencing the geopolitical stage.\n\nGlobal climate change\u00a0and frequent\u00a0catastrophic disasters have demanded the formation of global consensus to deal with it.\n\nThe changing US policies, protectionism, remerging terrorism, and nuclearisation of the middle east are other dimensions to keep watch on.\n\nThe Formation of multiple regional economic groupings like Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP) and Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership (RCEP) is decreasing the relevance of multilateral bodies like the World Trade Organisation (WTO) from the global arena.\n\nThese changes are pointing towards a situation under which NAM was initially created, hence making such an ideology still relevant on a global scale.\n\nCan NAM still be relevant?\n\nYes, the Non-Aligned Movement has the potential to never be irrelevant because in principle it provides a strong base to the foreign policy of its members.\n\nIt is the basis of \u201cStrategic Autonomy\u201d, which is the need of the hour of today\u2019s world. The principles of NAM still can guide the nations towards it.\n\nNAM is a platform where India can assert its soft power and provide active leadership by being a torchbearer for smaller countries at multilateral platforms.\n\nIt should be used as a platform to raise global issues like terrorism, climate change, trade protectionism, and others.\n\nNAM platform can be used to garner support from South-East Asian countries like Vietnam, Malaysia, Indonesia, and the Philippines against Chinese assertion in the South China Sea and related island and border disputes.\n\nNAM can provide a platform for Afro-Asian cooperation and a strong position for a poor African nation to have healthy negotiations with China and the US for economic development without compromising the sovereignty of their land.\n\nProbable GS Mains question:\n\nNAM lost its importance in the modern world.

Khan network.\n\nIran stated that its nuclear program was for peaceful purposes, but Western powers and their allies in the Middle East suspected that this was not the case.\n\nNegotiations between Iran and the western nations took place throughout the 2000s with little progress. Iran even created plants for heavy water and Uranium enrichment which led to economic sanctions from the United States and the\u00a0European Union.\n\nJoint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA):\n\nThe Iran nuclear agreement, formally known as the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA), is a landmark accord reached between Iran and several world powers, including the United States, in July 2015.\n\nUnder its terms, Iran agreed to dismantle much of its nuclear program and open its facilities to more extensive international inspections in exchange for billions of dollars worth of sanctions relief.\n\nThe JCPOA went into effect in January 2016. It imposes restrictions on Iran\u2019s civilian nuclear enrichment program. The negotiations with Iran were carried out by the five permanent members of the UN Security Council (China, France, Russia, the United Kingdom, and the United States) and Germany, collectively known as the P5+1. The European Union also took part.\n\nThe deal was proposed so that it would help prevent a revival of Iran\u2019s nuclear weapons program and thereby reduce the prospects for conflict between Iran and its regional rivals, including Israel and Saudi Arabia.\n\nHowever, the deal has been in trouble since President Donald Trump withdrew the United States from it in 2018. In retaliation for the U.S. departure and deadly attacks on prominent Iranians in 2020, including one by the United States, Iran has resumed some of its nuclear activities.\n\nGoals and agreements of the deal:\n\nThe P5+1 wanted to unwind Iran\u2019s nuclear program to the point that if Tehran decided to pursue a nuclear weapon, it would take at least one year, giving world powers time to respond.\n\nFor Iran, it sought the JCPOA for relief from international sanctions, which\u00a0starved its economy of more than $100 billion in revenues in 2012\u20132014 alone.\n\nNuclear restrictions: Iran agreed not to produce highly enriched uranium or plutonium, which are the key components of a nuclear weapon\nIt stated to ensure that the facilities at Fordow, Natanz, and Arak would only be used for power generation, medical, industrial research, or for any civilian work\nMonitoring and verification: Iran also agreed to implement a protocol that would allow inspectors from the\u00a0International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) access to its nuclear facilities and other undeclared sites.\nA body known as the Joint Commission, composed of representatives of the negotiating parties, monitors the implementation of the agreement and resolves any disputes that may arise.\n\nAgreements accepted by the P5+1 and others\n\nSanctions relief: The European Union, the UN, and the United States agreed to lift the sanction on Iran with some US sanctions dating back to 1979 remaining in effect.\nThese sanctions were placed due to Iran\u2019s support of terror groups, human rights abuses, and its ballistic missiles program.\nThe parties involved also agreed to lift sanctions on a Weapons embargo provided the\u00a0United Nations\u00a0confirms through the IAEA that Iran is only engaged in civilian nuclear activities.\nHow successful was the deal?\n\nThe agreement got off to a fairly smooth start. The IAEA certified in early 2016 that Iran had met its preliminary pledges; and the United States, EU, and United Nations responded by\u00a0repealing or suspending the sanctions.\n\nMost significantly, U.S. President Barack Obama\u2019s administration dropped secondary sanctions on the oil sector, which allowed Iran to ramp up its oil exports to nearly the level it was before sanctions. The United States and many European nations also unfroze about $100 billion worth of frozen Iranian assets.\n\nBut the Trump administration\u2019s withdrawal from the deal jeopardized everything after that.\n\nIran\u2019s present nuclear activity:\n\nIran started exceeding agreed-upon limits to its stockpile of low-enriched uranium in 2019 and began enriching uranium to higher concentrations (though still far short of the purity required for weapons).\n\nIt also began\u00a0developing new centrifuges\u00a0to accelerate uranium enrichment; resuming heavy water production at its Arak facility; and\u00a0enriching uranium at Fordow, which rendered the isotopes produced there unusable for medical purposes.\n\n2020: Iran took more steps away from its nuclear pledges, following a series of attacks on its interests.\n\nJanuary: After the U.S. targeted the killing of a top Iranian general, Qasem Soleimani, Iran announced that it would no longer limit its uranium enrichment.\nOctober: It began constructing a centrifuge production centre at Natanz to replace one that was destroyed months earlier in an attack it blamed on Israel.\nNovember: In response to the assassination of a prominent nuclear scientist, which is also attributed to Israel, Iran\u2019s parliament passed a law that led to a substantial boost in uranium enrichment at Fordow.\n\n2021: Iran announced new restrictions on the IAEA\u2019s ability to inspect its facilities, and soon after ended its monitoring agreement with the agency completely.\n\nWhat is the current status of the agreement?\n\nThe fate of the Iran nuclear deal remains uncertain. Biden has said the United States\u00a0will rejoin the agreement\u00a0if Iran returns to compliance, but has also said he wants to negotiate a broader agreement that addresses Iran\u2019s other activities, such as its missile program. Meanwhile, Raisi has said Washington has to return to the original deal.\n\nIn April 2021, JCPOA signatories began talks in Vienna to bring Washington and Tehran back into the deal, but the negotiations stalled after Raisi\u2019s election.\n\nChallenges to the restoration of the Iran nuclear deal:\nThe regional cold war between Saudi Arabia and Iran is a major hurdle to the restoration of this deal.\nThe US and Saudi Arabia have strengthened their relationship per US\u2019s Middle East policy and to counter Iran as well.\nThe traditional Shia vs Sunni conflict between these countries has made it difficult to negotiate peace in the region.\nIran is currently in violation of several of its important commitments, such as the limits on stockpiles of enriched uranium, and the farther it goes, the more challenging the deal becomes.\nIran is blaming US sanctions for its economic losses due to the Trump administration\u2019s pullout from the deal and imposing sanctions again.\nImpact on India of restoration of the deal:\nBoost to regional connectivity: Removing sanctions may revive India\u2019s interest in the Chabahar option, Bandar Abbas port, and other plans for regional connectivity. This would further help India to neutralize the Chinese presence in Gwadar port, Pakistan.\nThe International North-South Transit Corridor (INSTC), which runs through Iran, is important to India to improve connectivity with five Central Asian republics, may also get a boost.\nEnergy Security: Due to the pressure of the US\u2019 Countering America\u2019s Adversaries through Sanctions Act (CAATSA), India had to bring down oil imports to zero. Restoration of ties between the US and Iran will help India to procure cheap Iranian oil and aid in energy security."

            "[CONTENT]": "How has Chinese diplomacy changed recently? What is its historical Background? read further to know more.\n\nIt is interesting to study how China became a dominant player in international politics. Certainly, the way China handled its diplomacy has a great role in its quick assertion of power.\n\nAt a time when the US-China trade war is escalating, and when questions are raised over the China model related to COVID-19, let\u2019s analyze the origin and evolution of Chinese diplomacy.\n\nTable of Contents\n\nChina: The Origin of PRC and the concept of \u2018Tianxia\u2019\nIndia and China since independence\nChinese united front and Cold War\nThe 24-Character Diplomatic Strategy of China\nThe revenge for the humiliation\nThe American stakeholders in the Chinese global power quest\nThe de-coupling by Trump Administration and the future\nModel question for practice:\nChina: The Origin of PRC and the concept of \u2018Tianxia\u2019\n\nIn 1949, there was a revolution in China, and the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) was formed, establishing the People\u2019s Republic of China (PRC). The newly established PRC accepted the Leninist\u2013Stalinist style of state administration.\n\nThe Chinese, in general, do not believe in tracing their existence to a system based on sovereign equality but trace their origin to the divine & boundless reach with the central authority of a divine Chinese emperor, with a focus on establishing tianxia (which in Mandarin means \u201call under heaven\u201d), that is the Middle Kingdom which guided by heaven.\n\nIndia and China since independence\nThe early 1950s was a period of decolonization.\nAs new countries were born in the region, the question that emerged was what role would India and China play in this newly emerging post-colonial world order.\nIndia propounded its NAM for the decolonized world and used NAM to position itself as a third force in the era of bipolarity.\nHowever, India realized that the success or failure of its position in a new international order would depend upon the support or opposition to its efforts in China.\nNehru wanted to win the support of China and Nehru believed that an East led by India and China could guide the world morally at a time when the Western thought process was being guided by polarized ideological\nThus, Nehru\u2019s idea of China was based on cooperation than containment. This is the reason why Nehru even invited Zhou Enlai to the Bandung Conference.\nNehru wanted to build India\u2019s relationship with the Chinese on the enduring historical connections of the two as civilizational states.\nVallabhbhai Patel, in contrast, had been a keen advocate of a more cautious approach and Patel advocated for a military build-up for India and the creation of roads near the China border, along with other vital infrastructure.\nHe even favored US cooperation to balance China if needed but Nehru was not in favor of any US cooperation to contain China as he found it to be a Cold War tactic, which could weaken Non-Alignment.\nBut the death of Patel in 1950 gave Nehru the steering wheel of India\u2019s China policy and Nehru could not be challenged by anyone thereafter.\nChinese united front and Cold War\nThe Chinese adopted a unique foreign policy at the conference and thereafter. The Chinese tactic was called the \u201cunited front\u201d.\nUnder this tactic, the Chinese aimed to avoid their isolation by building solidarity with the non-aligned world and dividing the West.\nThe Chinese played a consummate game of isolating the main threat by building unity with all other forces against the West.\nThe Chinese diplomats kept the Chinese state steady in a churning sea that was full of storms. Whenever the storm tide rose in the sea, these diplomatic fishermen aptly gathered the fish and expanded the global presence of the Chinese, and gained rightful international acceptability.\nWhenever the ship ebbed, these diplomatic fishermen of China ensured that the Chinese ship (the state) remained firmly moored.\nThroughout the Cold War, the Chinese played their cards well and ensured that they don\u2019t upset either Henry Kissinger or Alexei Kosygin.\nIn 1972, when the Chinese decided to open up their economy, Zhou persuaded Nixon to abandon Taiwan (which he did in 1978), a staggering act of diplomacy, considering, the Chinese had not even exercised a single day of sovereignty over Taiwan.\nThe 24-Character Diplomatic Strategy of China\nThe high noon for Chinese diplomacy was the period of the 1980s and 1990s. The American people became fascinated with the Chinese when the Protestant Missionaries in the 1990s began to assert that God wanted to bring salvation to the Chinese.\nIn the 1980s, when Deng Xiaoping took over China, he decided to supplement the strategy of diplomacy adopted by Zhou till date with his own \u201c24-Character Strategy\u201d.\nThe basic premise of Deng Xiaoping was to observe calmly, secure the position of China, hide the capacities of China and bide time, maintain a low profile deliberately, and not claim leadership.\nThese thoughts eventually became the Chinese diplomatic paradigms and the Chinese diplomats measured their words, maintained their dignity, and projected their power but never blustered. The Chinese diplomats became masters of their briefs and were ingrained by Zhou that the core advantage in any negotiation is to know more than the other side knows.\nThis is why, a classical tactic of Chinese diplomats is that they flatter their acquaintances till today by calling them \u201cold friends\u201d and they deliberately built stronger relationships with interlocutors of less friendly states than friendly ones while behind the doors, they would skillfully put the blame of failure on their opponent.\nSo seductive was the Chinese diplomacy that the Americans ironically lifted their sanctions within four weeks after the Tiananmen incident of 1989. After the death of Deng Xiaoping in 1997, arrogance began to replace the humility hallmark of Chinese diplomacy.\nThe revenge for the humiliation\nThe new diplomats, trained in the English language and born with a careerist mindset quickly dropped persuasion and replaced it with a stick when a country took an action contrasting the Chinese wishes.\nChinese diplomacy in the South China Sea asserts that the dominant diplomatic tactic of China is to pursue unilateralism and not compromise. Now the new tactic of China is to seek revenge for the \u2018Century of Humiliation from 1839 to 1949\u2019 where China has developed an uncaring attitude towards the rest of the world as if the world has done nothing for China till today and rather, has shared a similar historical experience of humiliation only.\nIn the international community, if a statement of fact or some reasoned opinion is presented to the Chinese today, they perceive that as an insult or a humiliation, clearly reflecting that the veneer of humility has thinned down.\nThis is a clear indication of depleting goodwill and the ship being adrift at the sea. If the Chinese do not take corrective measures in a post-COVID-19 world, then the ship could be soon dragged from the shore by a receding tide.\nThe Chinese may do well to recall what Kissinger told the White House staff in July 1971 after his trip to China, something that they seem to have forgotten today: \u201cThe Chinese style is impressive. The Russians will fight you for every nickel and dime, elbow you at every level, and lose a million dollars of goodwill in the process. The Chinese have a sense of the longer trends and focus on that, not on ploy manship.\u201d\nThe American stakeholders in the Chinese global power quest\nAll American Presidents, from Nixon, who gave international recognition to the Chinese in 1978, to George HW Bush who washed the Chinese sins of Tiananmen Square in 1989, to Bill Clinton who ushered the Chinese entry into WTO, have been \u2018responsible stakeholders in the rise of China.\nIn contrast, the Chinese have always behaved as hard-nosed people who pursued engagements with the US on a selfish note, although couched in high principles always.\nThey have always disguised their real purpose of thwarting the American hegemony by speaking the words that Americans always wanted to hear; from anti-Soviet rhetoric that was music to the American ears in the Cold War to that of market economy in the age of post ideology.\nThis was because the Chinese since Mao to Xi Jinping have always feared that Americans by deception wish to change communist regimes and keep their capitalist order intact and this view was reinforced by the Chinese when the Soviet Union collapsed in 1991.\nThis strengthened the resolve of the Chinese to create a parallel universe of their own to resist capitalistic America and since then Chinese have been building an alternative trading system (the Belt and Road Initiative), an alternative banking system (the New Development Bank), their own GPS (Beidou), digital payment platforms (like Alipay and WeChat Pay) to that of cutting edge digital network of 5G, all under the nose of the Americans, despite voices of caution from eminent political scientists like John Mearsheimer, who rightly stated that Hu Jintao\u2019s \u2018peaceful rise\u2019 will not be \u2018peaceful\u2019.\nThe de-coupling by Trump Administration and the future\n\nIt is only now that Donald Trump has finally understood that the Chinese are not graven in the image they have created and along with Russia, both constitute a threat to American power.\n\n\ud83d\udc49 Which year are YOU targeting for success in the IAS/IPS/IFS Exam? \ud83d\ude80\n\n(1) \u21d2 UPSC 2025: Prelims cum Mains\n\n(2) \u21d2 UPSC 2026: Prelims cum Mains\n\n(3) \u21d2 UPSC 2027 Prelims cum Mains\n\nTip: Know more about ClearIAS Courses (Online/Offline)\n\nThis is why we see that the ongoing US-China trade war\u00a0and Trump\u2019s restrictions on Chinese immigration to the US from 2020 are nothing but steps of a serious de-coupling and re-adjustment starting up.\n\nWhile American diplomats like Steve Bannon may say that the US is already at a war with the Chinese, others like Richard Hass and Robert Zoellick might warn that starting a new cold war with the Chinese could be a grave mistake.\n\nThe recent literature emerging from China like an essay called \u201cThe Chinese Reassessment of Interdependence\u201d by Julian Gewirtz asserts that if Trump is determined to disentangle China from the global supply chains, then, Xi Jinping to is determined to break the US chokehold on technology.\n\nAs the de-coupling is inevitable now, India will suffer collateral damages. In the post-COVID world, Hong Kong will emerge as a new game changer between US and China because the rivalry, which till now was purely material between the two, is shifting now to the ideological realm, where the US has condemned the Chinese assaults on human freedoms.\n\nThe reason is that Hong Kong remains the bastion of capitalism of the West in the East because many in the US had looked at Hong Kong as a statue of liberty, holding a torch of freedom and democracy, for those who enter China, thus it is an assault on American beliefs.\n\nAs time will progress and the world will see more information suppressed and errors of omission by China related to COVID-19, there would be more questions raised on the future model of China in contrast to democracy.\n\nThis divergence could become the seed of a new Cold War of the 21st century.\n\nModel question for practice:\n\nQuestion: Examine the changing nature of Chinese diplomacy. Do you think the present events could lead to the second generation of the Cold War?

            "[CONTENT]": "The last decade saw two major oil price wars. What are the reasons for the oil crisis? Will there be another oil price war?\n\nOPEC and OPEC+ play a significant role in determining global oil prices.\n\nNot only the interests of Saudi Arabia and Russia (the leaders of the two blocks) but the profit margins of the Shale Oil industry of the US is also a major factor in the oil price war.\n\nTable of Contents\n\nContext\nOPEC\nOPEC-Russia and the Shale Revolution\nOPEC+\nCoronavirus outbreak and the aftermath\nConclusion\nContext\nRise of OPEC+ and its influence on global oil prices.\nRussia \u2013 Saudi Arabia oil price and how COVID-19 changed the equation.\nFalling oil prices leading to negative future contracts in 2020.\nOPEC\nThe Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) was founded in Baghdad in 1960 and headquartered in Vienna.\nOPEC has 14 member countries including the Islamic Republic of Iran, Iraq, Kuwait, Saudi Arabia, and Venezuela as its founder members.\nOPEC Members: Iran, Iraq, Kuwait, Saudi Arabia, Venezuela, Qatar, Indonesia, Libya, the United Arab Emirates, Algeria, Nigeria, Ecuador, Gabon, Angola, Equatorial Guinea and Congo.\nIn its biannual meetings, oil ministers agree on production quotas for each member. They can control production since most of the member countries have state-run oil firms.\nOPEC\u2019s stated objective is to co-ordinate and unify petroleum policies among member countries and ensure stable prices for petroleum producers.\nMost OPEC countries rely heavily on revenue from oil sales. High oil prices can hurt demand and low prices can affect the budget. Hence the organization tries to balance oil prices from getting too low or too high.\nOPEC-Russia and the Shale Revolution\nShale oil and gas is produced by horizontal drilling and hydraulic fracturing (fracking) of the porous rock holding oil and gas. The explosion in the production of shale gas turned U.S to a net LNG exporter by 2016.\nCompared to other oil-exporting countries, private companies are dominant in the U.S. oil industry and they have maintained a steadily increasing supply to ensure that prices pay for more exploration.\nFrom 2014 to 2016 the OPEC-Russia strategy was to reduce oil prices to unprofitable levels to counter the loss of market share due to US shale oil and gas production. Though U.S. output dropped, the industry survived via cost-cutting, innovating, and becoming more efficient.\nWhen their government deficits increased, OPEC pursued a new strategy of higher prices supported by production limits was adopted.\nThe OPEC\u2013Russia production cuts during 2017-18 and high prices facilitated the rise in U.S. shale production which managed to offset part of the cut. The U.S became the largest crude-oil producer driven by the rise in shale oil production.\nOPEC+\nOPEC+ refers to the group of 24 crude producers comprising 14 OPEC members and 10 non-OPEC members including Russia.\nThe OPEC members\u2019 bloc is led by Saudi Arabia while Russia is the biggest producer amongst the non-OPEC members.\nOPEC with 14 members controls 35% of global oil supplies and 82% of proven reserves. These figures increase to 55% and 90% respectively with the addition of 10 non-members to form the OPEC+ group. This enables the OPEC+ group to have substantial control of oil prices around the world economy.\nProduction quota:\nThe OPEC+ group was formed in 2017 to take coordinated actions to stabilize oil prices and have been undertaking corrections in supply in the oil markets since 2017.\nThe last production cuts that the OPEC+ group committed to, for cutting oil production by 1.2 million barrels a day (BPD) or around 3% of members\u2019 output, was scheduled to expire at the end of March 2020. The two top producers \u2014 Saudi Arabia and Russia \u2014 agreed to bear the brunt of the cuts.\nThe OPEC group hoped to extend production quota beyond March 2020 and come to an agreement to reduce oil production by an additional 1.5 million barrels per day (BPD).\nRussia refused to participate in further production cuts because:\nFrom Russia\u2019s point of view, all this strategy of production cuts was helping U.S. oil producers at the expense of everyone else.\nIt needs the money from its oil exports.\nRussia argued that it is dangerous to cut production during winter, as production sites could be damaged due to extreme temperatures in the Siberian oil fields which account for two-thirds of Russia\u2019s production.\nRussia also wants a relook into the OPEC\u2019s accounting rules for how gas contributes to the oil quotas. This could enable Russia to increase its oil production under the terms of the current agreement.\nCoronavirus outbreak and the aftermath\n\nA substantial decline in oil demand\nWorld oil demand in 2019 stood at around 99.67 million barrels a day.\nAfter the global outbreak of the coronavirus, the oil demand was set to contract in 2020 for the first time since 2009.\nAccording to the International Energy Agency, in the worst-case scenario i.e. if the coronavirus continues to spread globally and China\u2019s need for oil remains subdued, global oil demand could fall by as much as 730,000 barrels a day in 2020.\nIts base case is for a slump in demand of around 90,000 barrels a day, assuming that the situation in China improves in the second quarter.\nSaudi Arabia and Russia pledge to increase production\nWhen the deal for production cuts fell apart, Saudi Arabia and Russia pledged instead to ramp up production.\nSaudi Arabia announced that it would increase its production from 9.7 million barrels per day to 12.3 million, while Russia planned to increase oil production by 300,000 barrels per day.\nSaudi Arabia also announced price discounts in March 2020.\nThe oil market, in the face of a double crisis, collapsed.\nThe futures contract for West Texas Intermediate (WTI, the benchmark for U.S. crude prices), fell more than 300% to \u201cnegative\u201d prices.\nBecause of oversupply, it was becoming difficult to find space for the storage of oil.\nEach futures contract trades for a month. May contracts didn\u2019t want to take delivery of the oil and incur storage costs and ended up paying to take the oil off their hands.\nThis the lowest crude oil price ever recorded (the previous lowest was immediately after World War II).\nBrent crude, the benchmark for global oil prices, plummeted. Brent crude is less sensitive than WTI prices to supply-side shocks because it is priced in the middle of the North Sea where sufficient tanker storage is accessible, while WTI oil storage in the U.S. is limited as well as landlocked, making transportation relatively more difficult.\nNew deal\nSaudi Arabia and Russia, to stabilize the market, struck a deal with other major oil-producing nations of OPEC+ to slash production.\nThe members agreed to cut production by 9.7 million barrels a day in May and June. This is the deepest cut ever agreed to by the world\u2019s oil producers.\nAfter that, the group agreed to steadily increase production until the agreement expires in April 2022.\nConclusion\nThe oil price wars initiated by the OPEC+ group to counter the rise of the shale oil market in the U.S did not meet its intended objectives.\nThe flooding of oil by Saudi Arabia and Russia in a global oil market already facing a deep fall in demand after the onset of coronavirus nearly collapsed the oil market.\nThe latest deal is unlikely to solve the demand crisis as the agreed reduction in output amounts to only about 10% of the world\u2019s normal supply of oil. The estimates suggest that demand for oil has collapsed much further.\nThe oil industry is also facing an existential crisis in the form of electric vehicles (EVs) which continue to gain market share.\nAll these have made the future of the oil industry extremely unpredictable."

However, thinkers like Michel Foucault declared the Iranian revolution as the \u2018spirit of a world without spirit\u2019 and as the \u201cfirst great insurrection against global systems\u201c.\n\nThe Iranian Revolution lacked many of the customary causes of revolution (defeat at war, a\u00a0financial crisis,\u00a0peasant rebellion, or disgruntled military). It occurred in a nation that was experiencing relative prosperity.\n\nHowever, the revolution produced profound changes at great speed.\n\nIt replaced a\u00a0pro-Western\u00a0authoritarian monarchy\u00a0with an\u00a0anti-Western\u00a0totalitarian\u00a0theocracy\u00a0based on the concept of\u00a0Guardianship of the Islamic Jurists\u00a0(or\u00a0velayat-e faqih).\n\nAlso, the revolution\u00a0resulted in the exile of many Iranians.\n\nIranian Revolution \u2013 First Great Insurrection Against Global Systems\n\nThe revolution opened a new chapter for political Islam in the late 20th and early 21st centuries and had a deep impact on revolutionary movements across the globe, especially those that were using the Islamic frame of reference for political activism.\n\nIranian Revolution had led to fundamental geopolitical shifts in the Middle Eastern region. Examples \u2013 USSR invasion of Afghan, cold war between Saudi and Iran etc. Its repercussions are still felt throughout the region.\n\nAs the Revolution enters its 40th year in 2019, we will look at some of the significance and effects of it on Iran as well as on the regional and global politics. Even the ripples of this effect have and had been felt on India-Iran relations.\n\nHistory\n\nIran (also known as Persia) has a rich history. It was also\u00a0home to one of the world\u2019s oldest\u00a0civilizations. In this post, we shall, however, focus our study to the history of the Islamic revolution; in two heads \u2013 prelude and the actual revolution.\n\nPrelude to revolution\nThe 1979 Revolution had its roots in Iran\u2019s long history.\nHistorically the Shi\u2019a clergy (Ulema) had a significant influence on Iranian society. However, the society had\u00a0many different social groups including clergy, landowners,\u00a0intellectuals, and merchants.\nThese social groups earlier came together in 1905-11 Constitutional Revolution. But those efforts were stifled amid reemerging social tensions as well as foreign intervention from Russia, the United Kingdom, and, later, the United States.\nInsecurity and chaos created after the Constitutional Revolution led to the rise of General Reza Khan.\nThe United Kingdom helped Mohammad Reza Shah Pahlavi to establish a monarchy in 1921.\nAlong with Russia, the U.K. then pushed Reza Shah into exile in 1941, and his son Mohammad Reza Pahlavi took the throne.\nIn 1953, as Prime Minister Mohammad Mosaddeq\u00a0nationalized British-owned Anglo-Iranian Oil and his supporters ousted Mohammad Reza Shah, the U.S. and the U.K. orchestrated a coup against Mosaddeq\u2019s government and restored the Shah.\nMohammad Reza Shah dismissed the parliament and launched the \u201cWhite Revolution\u201d \u2014 modernization program that upended the wealth and influence of landowners and clerics, disrupted rural economies, led to rapid urbanization and Westernization, and prompted concerns over democracy and human rights.\nThe program was economically successful, but the benefits were not distributed evenly, though the transformative effects on social norms and institutions were widely felt.\nOpposition to the Shah\u2019s policies was accentuated in the 1970s when world monetary instability and fluctuations in Western oil consumption threatened the country\u2019s economy.\nIn addition to mounting economic difficulties, sociopolitical repression by the Shah\u2019s regime increased in the 1970s whereas outlets for political participation were minimal.\nThe cultural vacuum of modern urban Iran led people to turn to the ulama for guidance.\nAyatollah Ruhollah Khomeini, a former professor in Qom who had been in exile in 1964 after speaking out against the Shah\u2019s reform program, gained popular support.\nThe \u201creligious dimension\u201d of the Iranian Revolution, through its dependence on Islam, was well-established in the decades leading up to the uprisings of 1978. In the 1970s the notion was popularized that Iranians should return to their cultural roots by resisting the hegemonic influence of the West.\nSensing the support of Khomeini, secular intellectuals argued that, with the help of the ulama, the Shah could be overthrown.\nThe shah\u2019s dependence on the United States, his close ties with Israel and his regime\u2019s ill-considered economic policies fueled the protests.\nRevolution\nIn January 1978 thousands of youths, mostly unemployed, took to the streets to protest the regime\u2019s excesses. During his exile, Khomeini coordinated this upsurge of opposition.\nShah fled Iran and the armed forces declared their neutrality, effectively ousting the shah\u2019s regime.\nFollowing a national referendum, Khomeini declared Iran an Islamic republic.\nElements within the clergy excluded their former left-wing, nationalist, and intellectual allies from any positions of power in the new regime, and a return to conservative social values was enforced.\nThroughout most of 1979 the Revolutionary Guards, the then informal religious militia, repressed other political groups.\nThe militias and the clerics suppressed Western cultural influence and propounded anti-Imperialistic aim for the Revolution.\nThe new constitution created a religious government based on Khomeini\u2019s vision of vel\u0101yat-e faq\u012bh\u00a0(Persian for \u201cgovernance of the jurist\u201d) and gave sweeping powers to the\u00a0\u2018rahbar\u2018, or leader; the first \u2018rahbar\u2018 was Khomeini himself.\nIslamic political culture\nIt is said that there are attempts to incorporate modern political and social concepts into Islamic canon since 1950.\nThe attempt was a reaction to the secular political discourse like Marxism, liberalism, and nationalism.\nSome of the characteristics of this political culture were: the need for the clergy\u2019s independent financial organization, Islam as a way of life, advising and guiding youth and necessity of being a community.\nAyatollah Khomeini\n\nHe was the founder of the\u00a0Islamic Republic of Iran\u00a0and the leader of the 1979\u00a0Iranian Revolution.\nKhomeini has been described as the \u201cvirtual face of Shia Islam in Western popular culture\u201d.\nHe\u00a0considered the United States as the \u201cGreat Satan\u201d and\u00a0the Soviet Union\u00a0as the \u201cLesser Satan.\u201d\nKhomeini has been criticized for the human rights violations of Iranians. He ordered the execution of thousands of\u00a0political prisoners,\u00a0war criminals\u00a0and\u00a0prisoners\u00a0of the\u00a0Iran\u2013Iraq War.\nKhomeini was known for his support of the hostage takers during the\u00a0Iran hostage crisis.\nHe had issued a fatwa for the murder of\u00a0British Indian\u00a0novelist\u00a0Salman Rushdie.\nDid the revolution promised heaven, but created a hell on earth?\n\nThe events of 1979 are still being fought over four decades on.\n\nViews differ on the impact of the revolution. For some, it was the most significant, hopeful and profound event in the entirety of contemporary Islamic history, while others believe that the revolution promised heaven, but created a hell on earth.\n\nFor Washington, the ousting of Shah Mohammad Reza Pahlavi was a geopolitical wound that hasn\u2019t healed. Shah regime helped steer the oil-rich region away from Soviet influence. In its place emerged a hostile power that took U.S. citizens hostage, engaged in deadly attacks on U.S. forces in the region, and styled itself as an anti-imperial \u201cresister\u201d to a hegemonic America.\nFor the rest of the Middle East, the arrival of a theocratic regime in Iran was a political bombshell, giving life to religious movements long stifled or overshadowed by the region\u2019s secular, Pan-Arab authoritarians.\nThe Iranian revolution played a significant role in the birth and the growth of the jihadist movements in the Arab World, as it raised the awareness of the role of religion in political change in the region.\nThe Iranian revolution affected political thinking in the region in terms of introducing religion as a changing tool to fight oppression and corruption.\nCritics of Tehran blame it for all the ills of recent years \u2014 the deadly sectarianism inflaming the Middle East, the radicalism fueling its insurgencies etc. Thus Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman (MBS) said it was the 1979 Iranian revolution that strengthened religious orthodoxy and extremism in his own country. He argued that his program of changes, which includes a brutal crackdown on dissent, is necessary to unravel that Iranian legacy.\nHowever MBS\u2019s opponents contend that the kingdom has its own lengthy role in cultivating certain strains of political Islam and he is wrong to advance a new radicalism that, while seemingly more liberal and appealing to the West, is just as intolerant of dissent.\nInternational Impact of the Iranian Revolution\n\nInternationally, the initial impact of the revolution was immense.\n\nIn the non-Muslim world, it changed the image of Islam, generating much interest in Islam \u2013 both sympathetic and hostile \u2013 and speculation that the revolution might change \u2018the world\u2019s balance of power \u2018.\nThe Islamic Republic positioned itself as a revolutionary beacon under the slogan \u201cneither East nor West, only Islamic Republic (i.e. neither Soviet nor American/West European models), and called for the overthrow of capitalism, American influence, and social injustice in the Middle East and the rest of the world.\nRevolutionary leaders in Iran gave and sought support from non-Muslim causes like IRA in Ireland, anti-apartheid struggle in South Africa etc.\nAfter the US lost its most formidable ally in the region, it was wary of growing Soviet presence in Afghan. So the US, along with Pakistan, initiated a rebellion against the pro-Soviet government in Afghan. This led to USSR invasion in Afghan in 1979 and the ensuing instability of Afghan.\nThe Persian Gulf and the Iran\u2013Iraq War\nIn its region, Iranian Islamic revolutionaries called for the overthrow of monarchies and their replacement with Islamic republics, much to the alarm of its smaller Sunni-run Arab neighbours\u00a0Iraq, Saudi Arabia, Kuwait, and the other Persian Gulf States \u2013 most of whom were monarchies and all of whom had sizable Shia populations.\nIt led to the Iran\u2013Iraq War as Arab Nationalist and Sunni Muslim-dominated regime of Saddam Hussein of Iraq invaded Iran in an attempt to take advantage of revolutionary chaos and destroy the revolution in its infancy.\nThe war served as an opportunity for the Iranian government to strengthen revolutionary groups.\nIranian revolution led Persian Gulf states like Saudi, UAE to support Wahabhism in Afghan. Also, the revolution led to the closeness of the US and Saudi to counter Iran.\nAfter the Revolution, both Iran and Saudi competed for supremacy of the Muslim world. This led to a cold war between the two. This has also led to a tripartite struggle between Israel-Iran-Saudi, fueled by the Palestinian issue.\nWestern\u2013Iranian relations\n\nIran experienced difficult relations with some Western countries, especially the United States after the revolution. Iran was under constant US unilateral sanctions.\n\nThe American political scientist\u00a0Samuel P. Huntington (1992) argued that future wars would be fought not between countries, but between cultures (often based on religious identities). His hypothesis is called the \u201cThe Clash of Civilizations\u201c.\n\nIndia-Iran relations\nFollowing the 1979 revolution, Iran continued support for\u00a0Pakistan. India\u2019s close relations with Iraq during the Iran\u2013Iraq War\u00a0impeded further development of Indo\u2013Iranian ties.\nAs Iran was vying for the position of leadership of the Muslim world against Saudi, it supported Pakistan\u2019s claim on Jammu and Kashmir.\nIndia has always been wary of Iran\u2019s support for Pakistan in the Organisation of Islamic Cooperation (OIC) regarding Kashmir.\nIranian criticism of India\u2019s position on Kashmir has repeatedly sparked protests within the Indian government against Iranian interference.\nRecently Ayatollah Khomeini \u2013 the supreme leader of Iran- equated the Kashmir conflict with those in Yemen and Bahrain, much to the chagrin of India.\nIn Afghan, the strategic interests converge, as both are apprehensive of the Taliban.\nIn the 1990s, India and Iran supported the\u00a0Northern Alliance in Afghanistan against the Taliban regime.\nThey continued to collaborate in supporting the broad-based anti-Taliban government.\nHowever, whilst both nations continue to oppose the Taliban, India supports the presence of NATO forces in Afghanistan, unlike Iran.\nAs Iran is being isolated internationally after the Revolution, the relationship with India became important for Iran.\nIran and Other countries\nIn the Mideast and Muslim world, particularly in its early years, it triggered enormous enthusiasm and redoubled opposition to western intervention and influence.\nIslamist insurgents rose in Saudi Arabia (1979), Egypt (1981), Syria (1982), and Lebanon (1983).\nAlthough ultimately only the Lebanese Islamists succeeded, other activities have had a more long-term impact.\nHowever, some observer argues that despite great effort and expense, the only countries that the revolution had a lasting influence are Lebanon and Iraq.\nMoreover, Iran\u2019s pursuit of an ideological rather than a nationalist and pragmatic foreign policy has weakened its potential as a great regional power.\nIran \u2013 Current Scenario\n\nBeing an Islamic State, Iran has integrated religion into the state. However, there are many who wish to see religion and state as separate. This includes those who are true followers of Islam. They are advocating\u00a0secularization\u00a0of the state to preserve the purity of the Islamic faith.\n\nThe protests in 2018 in Iran were greatest since 2009 green movement. Many considered this as the manifestation of the anger and frustration felt by Iranian youth against the system.\n\nSince its inception, the Islamic Republic was dogged by tensions between two concepts of sovereignty \u2014 the divine and popular.\nThe concept of popular sovereignty in the Constitution mandates popular elections for the presidency and parliament.\nBut the concept of divine sovereignty, which is derived from God\u2019s will through the medium of the imam, is bestowed on the existing \u201cfaqih\u201d as the rightful ruler of the Shi\u2019ite community.\nHowever, in the past 40 years in Iran, the idea of the sovereignty of God on Earth has been about the theologization of politics.\nDespite the forceful post-revolutionary imposition of Islamic values and ways of living and the insertion of cultural politics into the everyday lives of young Iranians in the name of Islamic purity, the Iranian youth \u2014 especially young women \u2014 have not identified with the conservative values of the Islamic regime.\nMoreover, the Republican idea of popular sovereignty has found its place through social networks and is evident in the political activities of Iranian civil society like the women\u2019s rights movements, the students\u2019 movements etc.\nToday, more than 60 per cent of the Iranian population is under the age of 30. Lack of jobs and the absence of social freedoms and everyday opportunities are the principal reasons for their discontent and rebellion.\nIn the past 10 years, many protests in Iran \u2014 notably the Green Movement of 2009 \u2014 were products of the activities of the urban middle-class youth.\nBut more recently, the turmoil in Iranian cities has largely been driven by disaffected young people in rural areas and small towns.\nThey see it as a chance to express their frustration with the country\u2019s economic problems, which are a fallout of Iran\u2019s financial and military involvement in the conflicts in Syria and Yemen.\nThe ideology of the Iranian Revolution has burnt out. Iranian youngsters are disenchanted. The Islamic Reform Movement has failed to fulfil popular demands and spontaneous riots occur in major cities of Iran almost every year.\nIran as a Regional Power\nPost-Revolution, Iran has become a strong regional power having its influence over Iraq, Syria, Lebanon, and Yemen.\nIran\u2019s involvement in Syria and its alliance with Russia in Syria magnified its regional power status.\nIran\u2019s support for Iraq\u2019s war against IS has made Iraq politically, militarily, economically, culturally under Iran\u2019s influence.\nTo stabilize the region, the cooperation of Iran is needed. Because of this reason, the US under Obama tried to mend peace with Iran. Nuclear Deal was the result of this rapprochement between the US and Iran.\nHowever, the US under Trump sidelined Iran and sided with Saudi. Trump came out of Nuclear deal and imposed new sanctions on Iran because of its missile tests. The US also imposed immigration curbs on Iranian citizens and branded Iran as \u2018greatest sponsor of terrorists\u2019. Thus Trump tried to restore the bipolar balance between Saudi and Israel\u00a0in the region.\nMeanwhile, Iran stepped up its activities in other countries through Shia Corridor.\n\nReason for instability in the West Asian region is the cold war between Saudi-Iran, manifested in proxy wars in Syria, Yemen, Bahrain, which is a struggle for power in the garb of religion.\n\nShia Corridor\n\nShia crescent or Shia Corridor is a term that encompasses Shia areas of the Middle East.\nThe argument is that the common religion, that is Shia, gives a potential for cooperation between Iran, Iraq, Syria and the politically powerful Shia militia Hezbollah in Lebanon; and that they would be proxies for Iran in its regional power play.\nConclusion\n\nThe criticism that the Iranian revolution promised heaven, but created a hell on earth is not without grounds. Many hoped that Iran as a republic would emerge as a major regional power to counter-balance the global powers. However, in reality, the revolution bolstered Islamic orthodoxy and extremism. Islamic Jihadists and new Islamic States (like the\u00a0 the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant(ISIS) \u2013 even though its ideology is a puritanical form of\u00a0Sunni\u00a0Islam) draw inspiration from it.\n\nAt this 40th anniversary of the Islamic revolution, the regime is under serious global, regional and domestic pressure. Iran is under pressure with a weak economy and social tensions rising at a time when U.S. President Donald Trump is becoming increasingly hostile towards it. Iran definitely has converted challenges into opportunities and made substantial changes in certain sectors like education, health care etc.\u00a0But even as the Islamic Republic holds strong, discontent has risen.\n\nThe Western world interprets the Iranian Revolution as\u00a0backward and typically Islamic.\u00a0Many thinkers feel that the Iranian Revolution made a \u201cclash of civilizations\u201d \u2013 between raging Muslims and rational Westerners \u2013\u00a0 inevitable. The consequences of these are manifested today: catastrophically failed wars, and the implosion of large parts of the Middle East, North Africa, and South Asia.\n\nTehran will have to deal with the U.S.\u2019s unilateral and hostile policies with help from other countries. But it should also fix its system, tackle corruption, hold government departments accountable for the decisions they take and rethink its approach towards dissent and personal freedoms.\n\nAt the same time, the US has to understand the peculiar domestic situation of Iran while dealing with it. Moreover, as Fareed Zakaria argues, the US should also take into account Iran\u2019s influence in the region and its geopolitical and geostrategic importance in forging a solution to both Afghan and Syrian instability.\n\nArticle by \u2013\u00a0Sethu Krishnan M\n\nReferences: Washington Post, Wikipedia, Britannica, Bloomberg, Indian Express, The Hindu"

Stay updated with our latest content and enhance your exam readiness.\n\nThe EU is run by five main bodies: the European Parliament, the Council of the Union, the European Commission, the Court of Justice, and the Court of Auditors.\n\nHistory of the European Union \u2013\u00a0From economic to political union\n\nEurope was a united entity during the era of the Roman Empire. However, it disintegrated into smaller units later. The situation changed when the rise of nationalism led to the unification of countries in the 1870s (e.g.: the unification of Germany, the unification of Italy, etc.). Nonetheless, this was not without conflicts.\n\nConflicts and rivalry between European countries created many wars \u2013 including World War I (1914-18) and World War II (1939-45). Europe then recognized that too much nationalism is also dangerous.\n\nThe first step was to foster economic cooperation: the idea being that countries that trade with one another become economically interdependent and so more likely to avoid conflict.\n\nThe result was the European Economic Community (EEC) created in 1958. It increased the economic cooperation between six countries: Belgium, Germany, France, Italy, Luxembourg and the Netherlands.\n\nSince then, 22 other members joined to create a huge single market (also known as the \u2018internal\u2019 market). It continues to develop towards its full potential, under a new banner \u2013 European Union (since 1993).\n\nThe process acquired a political dimension with the creation of the European Parliament.\n\nWhat began as a purely economic union has evolved into an organization spanning policy areas, from climate, environment, and health to external relations and security, justice, and migration.\n\nWill the European Union be the next superpower?\n\nThe European Union (EU) has been called an emerging superpower by scholars and academics like T. R. Reid, Andrew Reding, Andrew Moravcsik, etc., and some politicians like Romano Prodi and Tony Blair.\n\nThe EU has an economic, political, diplomatic, and military influence.\n\nEconomic Power of EU:\n\nThe EU is the world\u2019s biggest economy with a GDP larger than that of the United States.\n\nIts currency, the euro, can pose a threat to the dominance of the US dollar.\n\nIts\u00a0share of world trade is three times larger than that of the United States allowing it to be more assertive in trade disputes with the US and China.\n\nIts economic power gives it influence over its closest neighbors as well as in Asia and Africa.\n\nIt also functions as an important bloc in international economic organizations such as the World Trade Organisation (WTO).\n\nPolitical and Diplomatic Powers of EU:\n\nTwo members of the EU, Britain and\u00a0France, hold permanent seats on the UN Security Council. The EU includes several non-permanent members of the UNSC. This has enabled the EU to influence some US policies such as the current US position on Iran\u2019s nuclear programme.\n\nIts use of diplomacy, economic investments, and negotiations rather than coercion and military force have been effective as in the case of its dialogue with China on human rights and environmental degradation.\n\nMilitary Powers of EU:\n\nMilitarily, the EU\u2019s combined armed forces are the second largest in the world.\n\nIts total spending on defense is second after the US.\n\nTwo EU member states, Britain and France, also have nuclear arsenals of approximately 550 nuclear warheads.\n\nIt is also the world\u2019s second most important source of space and communications technology.\n\nContrary Views \u2013 Why the European Union may not emerge as a superpower?\n\nSome do not believe that the EU will achieve superpower status. They cite the following reasons:\n\nNo Hard Power: The European Union does not have enough hard power (it lacks a strong European military). With just soft power, it is not easy to emerge as a superpower.\n\nLack of unified foreign policy: The EU also lacks a unified EU foreign policy. In many areas, its member states have their own foreign relations and defense policies that are often at odds with each other. For example, the UK was America\u2019s partner in the Iraq invasion,\u00a0 whereas Germany and France opposed American policy.\n\nNo common constitution: All members of the EU must pass the constitution for it to take effect. At a time when the idea of a common constitution was proposed,\u00a0 even though most of the countries voted for the constitution, France and the Netherlands voted against it.\n\nEuro Crisis: The EU and the European Central Bank (ECB) have struggled with high sovereign debt and collapsing growth in Portugal, Ireland, Greece, and Spain since the global financial market collapse of 2008.\n\nEuroskepticism: There is also a deep-seated \u2018Euroskepticism\u2019 in some parts\u00a0of Europe about the EU\u2019s\nintegrationist agenda. Not every country in the EU adopted the common European currency Euro. This limits the ability of the EU to act in matters of foreign relations and defense.\n\nBrexit: The UK, even earlier, preferred to be out of the European Market, but now She left the EU (Brexit).\n\nTimeline of the European Union \u2013 Download the Infographic"

The committee\u2019s inaugural meeting took place in Berlin in December 1999.\n\nIn a meeting of finance ministers and presidents of central banks of the G7, it was decided to expand the group and make it more representative in order to generate policies that have an impact In the economy.\n\nThey decided to invite a group of key emerging economies to a new forum of finance ministers and presidents of Central Banks, which would later become the G20.\n\nWith the start of the global financial crisis of 2008, the G20 became the main instrument to face the debacle. And for that it was essential to involve the highest ranking officials. Thereafter, presidents and heads of state joined the G20.\n\nWhat topics does the \u2018Group of 20\u2019 address?\n\nThe Group of 20 deals with a broad theme.\n\nWhile economic and financial issues tend to lead the agenda, other areas have gained momentum.\n\nTraditional topics include the global economy, financial markets, fiscal affairs, trade, agriculture, employment, energy and the fight against corruption.\n\nOther recent additions include participation of women in the labor market, sustainable development, global health, fight against terrorism and inclusive ventures, among others.\n\nHow does G20 work?\n\nThe G20 agenda is annual and includes more than 50 meetings, enhanced by working groups and discussions between permanent members and guests.\n\nThe cycle concludes with the Leaders Summit , where a final declaration is signed by which the leaders commit themselves to address and collaborate on the issues addressed. For example:\n\nAt the Hamburg Summit in 2017, the leaders agreed to limit protectionism, commit to a system of regulated international trade and favor policies that spread the benefits of globalization.\nAt the Hangzhou Summit in 2016, the leaders agreed to expand the role of the G20 to establish greater global cooperation in the fight against tax evasion and promote international collaboration to facilitate investments in green bonds.\nTwo working channels of G20 \u2013 Finance Channel and Sherpas Channel\n\nThe flow of these meetings is channeled through two channels: the Finance Channel, headed by the Ministry of Finance and the Central Bank, and the Sherpas Channel, coordinated by the Chief of Cabinet of Ministers and of which ministries from different areas participate. .\n\nThe Finance Channel covers meetings between finance ministers and central bank presidents, as well as meetings of their second lines and working groups on financial issues. In their meetings throughout the year, they focus on global collaboration in financial and monetary policies, which may include issues such as investment in infrastructure, fiscal policy, inclusion and financial regulation.\n\nThe Sherpas Channel, meanwhile, covers non-financial issues, such as political commitment, the fight against corruption, development, gender equality, trade and energy, among others. Each member country of the G20 is represented at the meetings by the Sherpa and the minister that corresponds to the subject. The Sherpa then advises his Head of State or Government on the issues discussed and brings the dialogue to the relevant working groups.\n\nTo increase the scope and impact of the G20, and to ensure that the approach is truly global, the main international organizations are invited to participate in the meetings and the Leaders\u2019 Summit.\n\nThe G20 Troika\n\nEvery year, when a new country assumes the presidency (Argentina in 2018), it works hand in hand with the previous presidency (Germany) and the next presidency (Japan) in what is known as the troika. This ensures continuity in the group\u2019s agenda.\n\nG20 Affinity Groups \u2013 Understand how Civil Society participate in the G20\n\nThe G20 seeks to enrich the content of its dialogues by encouraging the participation of civil society through affinity groups . Each of them focuses on an issue of global importance and meets independently throughout the year. From the dialogue in the various meetings, each group delivers a series of recommendations to the G20.\n\nCurrently, affinity groups are: Business 20 (B20), Civil 20 (C20), Labor 20 (L20), Science 20 (S20), Think 20 (T20), Women 20 (W20), Youth 20 (Y20).\n\nWhat impact does the G20 have?\n\nThe G20 is the most important forum for international cooperation. During the meetings, the main challenges of the world are discussed and the main policies are coordinated at the global level. In the face of an uncertain international context, international cooperation is key, and thus the G20 acquires even more relevance.\n\nThe main achievements of the G20 include:\n\nthe increased participation of emerging countries in global issues,\nthe reform of international financial institutions,\nthe monitoring of national financial institutions,\nthe improvement in the regulations of the economies whose problems led to the crisis and the creation of safety nets to prevent problems in the future.\n\nThe G20 also specifically helped to provide emergency funds during the 2008 crisis and plays an important role in financing for development.\n\nWhere is the G20 headquarters?\n\nThe G20 does not have permanent offices or employees.\n\nThe country that presides over the group (in an year) takes care of all the organization and the logistical coordination of the meetings.\n\nIn addition to the Group of 20 members, which other nations are participating in the meetings?\n\nSpain is a permanent guest and always participates in the G20 summits. Every year, the host country also chooses other guests. For the G20 2018, President Mauricio Macri invited Chile and the Netherlands.\n\nWhich Regional Organisations and International Organisations partner with G20?\n\nThe key regional organizations are usually invited to participate and are represented by the country that holds the presidency. The Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN), the African Union, the New Partnership for Africa\u2019s Development (NEPAD) are examples of organizations that are invited regularly. This year, President Mauricio Macri also invited the Caribbean Community (CARICOM), represented by Jamaica.\n\nInternational organizations also participate. The World Bank, the Financial Stability Board (FSB), the International Monetary Fund (IMF), the United Nations, the International Labor Organization (ILO), the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) and the World Organization of Commerce (OMC) are regular assistants of the G20. For the G20 2018, President Mauricio Macri also invited the Inter-American Development Bank (IDB) and the Development Bank of Latin America (CAF).\n\nWhat does presiding the G20 imply?\n\nEvery year, G20 members elect a country to preside over the group.\n\nThe country that assumes the presidency organizes the meetings, defines the agenda of priorities to be debated and decides which countries and organizations to invite. As the G20 does not have a central organization, the role of the country presiding over the group is critical to the effectiveness of the forum.\n\nHow is the country that exercises the presidency of the G20 appointed?\n\nThe president is chosen by a rotation system. For this, the 19 member states of the G20 (the 20th member, which is the European Union, is not part of a group of countries) are divided into five groups, consisting of a maximum of four states:\n\nGroup 1: Australia, Canada, United States, Saudi Arabia.\nGroup 2: India, Russia, South Africa, Turkey.\nGroup 3: Argentina, Brazil, Mexico.\nGroup 4: France, Germany, Italy, United Kingdom.\nGroup 5: China, Indonesia, Japan, South Korea.\n\nCounting the last edition of Germany, 11 of the 19 member countries of the forum presided over it.\n\nWhich countries and invited organizations participate in the G20 2018?\n\nThe invited countries are Spain (permanent guest), Chile and the Netherlands, and, on behalf of regional organizations, Singapore (ASEAN), Jamaica (CARICOM), Rwanda (African Union) and Senegal (NEPAD). The Argentine presidency also invited the Inter-American Development Bank and the Development Bank of Latin America (CAF).\n\nWhat is the objective of Argentina for its G20 presidency?\n\nArgentina seeks to build a consensus that allows all countries to commit to an equitable and sustainable development that generates opportunities for all.\n\nThis is in line with the region\u2019s concerns and aspirations: to take advantage of the great economic potential of Latin America and the Caribbean to advance towards the eradication of poverty.\n\nWhat will be the priorities of the G20 2018 agenda?\n\nThe G20 2018 will focus on the future of work,\n\nwhich implies thinking about an education that provides \u2013 equal opportunities, infrastructure for development, and a sustainable food future.\n\nWho will be the next G20 president after Argentina?\nJapan will chair the G20 in 2019.\nSaudi Arabia will chair the G20 in 2020.\nItaly will chair the G20 in 2021.\nIndia will chair the G20 in 2022."

Tariffs are used by governments to protect domestic industries from competition.\n\nIt adds to the cost of imported goods.\n\nTrump Tariffs\n\nThe Trump tariffs are a series of tariffs imposed during the presidency of Donald Trump. In January 2018, Trump imposed tariffs on solar panels and washing machines, and in March 2018, he imposed tariffs on steel and aluminium.\n\nThe case the White House is making is that the tariffs necessary to protect vulnerable American industries.\n\nPresident Donald Trump had said that the US which has nearly USD 800 billion deficit with other countries is ready for a trade war with them if they retaliated against his decision to impose 25 per cent import tariff on steel and 10 percent on aluminium.\n\nTrade War Escalation \u2013 between US and China\n\nOn March 7, US President Donald Trump announced 25% tariffs on imports of steel and aluminium from China.\n\nChina responded by saying it would impose duties on $3bn worth of US products, announcing tariffs of up to 25% on imports of food including frozen pork, wine and some fruits on April 1.\n\nWhat can World Trade Organisation (WTO) do?\n\nThe arbiter of international trade disputes \u2013 WTO \u2013 was born in 1995 out of a set of agreements struck by countries trying to reduce trade barriers.\n\nIf a government\u2019s complaint about another nation\u2019s trade barriers is seen as grounded, the WTO recommends acceptable retaliation.\n\nIn the case of steel, Trump is invoking a seldom-used clause of a 1962 U.S. law that gives him the authority to curb imports if they undermine national security.\n\nUnder WTO rules,\u00a0countries can take trade actions to protect \u201cessential security interests.\u201d\n\nOther nations could challenge the validity of the U.S. use of that clause. They also could copy the U.S. move by citing national security to block imports themselves.\n\nTrade War \u2013 Who will be the winner?\n\nStockmarkets across the world have\u00a0fallen anticipating a full-blown trade war between the United States and\u00a0China.\n\nThe tariffs measures were poorly received by the vast majority of economists; almost 80% of 104 economists surveyed by Reuters believed that imports on tariffs on steel and aluminum imports would be a net harm to the U.S. economy, with the rest believing that the tariffs would have little or no effect; none of the economists surveyed believed that the tariffs would benefit the U.S. economy.\n\nOn the other hand, the trade war can badly affect China too.\u00a0If China\u2019s exports suffer from President Trump\u2019s upcoming trade actions, and any copycat barriers elsewhere, domestic consumption hardly looks robust enough to carry growth.\n\nShould a trade war escalate between the US and China, consultancy Wood Mackenzie estimates that global economic growth could slow from 2.9% to 2.2% over the next four years.\n\nThe small, open economies in the eastern part of the European Union will suffer disproportionately if the global trade war currently brewing extends to Europe, analysts have warned.\n\n\u201cJonathan Butcher, Wood Mackenzie principal economist, in a March 28 note, says, \u201cThat risk of retaliation and escalation is itself a threat to the global economy. We are currently enjoying a period of robust global growth, but sentiment plays a big part in maintaining economic momentum. The threat of a trade war could dampen sentiment, slowing consumer spending and business investment. If a trade war does develop\u2026 There are no winners in such a situation.\u201d\n\nWhat happened in previous trade wars?\n\nOne of the most notorious examples is the\u00a0Smoot-Hawley Act\u00a0passed by Congress in 1930 and\u00a0often blamed for deepening the Great Depression. The act raised import tariffs on some 20,000 goods provoking retaliatory tariffs by major US trading partners, leading to a severe trade war, the contraction of world trade, and exacerbation of the Great Depression.\n\nWho wins in trade wars?\n\nNo one, if history is any guide.\u00a0When President George W. Bush raised steel tariffs in 2002, U.S. gross domestic product declined by $30.4 million,\u00a0according to\u00a0the U.S. International Trade Commission. The U.S. lost about\u00a0200,000 jobs, about 13,000 of which were in raw steel-making, by one estimate.\n\nSummary\n\nTrump\u2019s trade war will hurt everyone \u2014 the only question is how much.\u00a0Everybody, all economies, will be adversely affected.\n\nA trade war between the world\u2019s major economies would lead to a significant contraction of world trade. In turn, this could result in a deep recession in the world economy, which would, no doubt, exacerbate the \u00adalready tense geopolitical strains.\n\nReference:\nWikipedia\nInvestopedia\nBloomberg\nBusiness Insider\nEPW"

            "[CONTENT]": "Recently, US President Donald Trump\u2019s pledge to declare Jerusalem as the capital of Israel has caused controversy across the world. He also announced his plans to move the US Embassy to Jerusalem from Tel Aviv. Let\u2019s analyse the implications of US Embassy in Jerusalem.\n\nTable of Contents\n\nWhat is the capital of Israel?\nHistorical perspective of Jerusalem\nDevelopments\nWhy is Jerusalem in news now?\nImplications of recognizing Jerusalem as capital of Jerusalem\nWhat the US administration hopes to achieve:\nThe UN vote on Jerusalem issue\nIndian viewpoint on Jerusalem\nExamining India\u2019s vote\nWhat is the capital of Israel?\n\nIsrael claims that Jerusalem is its capital, but this is not internationally recognised. This is because the ancient city is also the proclaimed capital of the State of Palestine. And more than that, Jerusalem is one of the main contentions in Isreal-Palestine conflicts.\n\nSo the answer to the question \u2018what is the capital of Israel\u2019\u00a0depends on who you ask. For the Israeli government, it\u2019s simple: Jerusalem. But not all countries recognize this.\n\nHistorical perspective of Jerusalem\n\nJerusalem is a holy city for the 3 Abrahamic religions viz, Judaism, Christianity and Islam representing different periods of its history.\n\nBy 1917, it fell to the British and they had to protect the region under League of Nations mandate.\nUN had chalked up a partition plan for the region by 1947. It had designated Jerusalem as a special international zone.\nBut soon wars were to follow. In the Arab-Israeli war of 1948, Israel occupied the western part and Jordan the eastern part of Jerusalem. The East was to be later annexed by Israel in the Six Day War of 1967.\n\nExcept for three nations (US, Czech Republic and the island nation of Vanuatu), this annexation was not accepted by the international community and it still considers East Jerusalem as a part of Palestine territory. Thus, the demand for the boundary as existing prior to 1967 war is raised by nations for a Two-Nation Theory Agreement.\n\nIn deference to this, no country maintains its diplomatic missions in Jerusalem. Foreign embassies in Israel are located in Tel Aviv. The embassy of India for Israel is at Tel Aviv and has a Representative Office for Palestine at Ramallah in West Bank.\n\nIsraeli \u201cbasic law\u201d however cites whole of Jerusalem as its capital. This act has been censured by the UN Security Council (UNSC) in \u201cstrongest terms\u201d in 1980.\n\n\ud83d\udc49 Which year are YOU targeting for success in the IAS/IPS/IFS Exam? \ud83d\ude80\n\n(1) \u21d2 UPSC 2025: Prelims cum Mains\n\n(2) \u21d2 UPSC 2026: Prelims cum Mains\n\n(3) \u21d2 UPSC 2027 Prelims cum Mains\n\nTip: Know more about ClearIAS Courses (Online/Offline)\n\nDevelopments\n\nIsrael government has a greater control over all parts of Jerusalem than the Palestinian government except for its East. This is more than evident with the settlement of Israelites to occupied parts of East Jerusalem and even West Bank. This is alleged to be a ploy by Israel to supplement it claims on these lands.\n\nOn the other hand, Palestine is territorially and administratively divided.\n\nWest Bank (called so as it happens to be the western bank of River Jordan) is led by the Fatah-controlled Palestinian National Authority (PNA) with its president Mahmoud Abbas.\nThe Gaza strip is controlled by Hamas, which many countries consider as a militant organisation.\n\nRemember, The Palestinian National Authority was the arrangement for Palestine administration of its territories after an agreement in 1994 and consequence of Oslo Accords of 1993. Elections in 2006 led to Hamas winning the Gaza strip and Fatah reduced to West Bank giving rise to an administrative division. The news of shellings during conflict you hear are alleged to be from this Gaza strip and against the actions of illegal settlement and alleged atrocities by Israeli Defence Forces (IDF) against Palestinian people.\n\nThe contentious territorial claims on Jerusalem have made it a no man\u2019s land for embassies. Not willing to add to the conflict, nations choose not to have a permanent base of any form here until the Palestine problem is settled. In the two-state solution, i.e., the coexistence of Israel and Palestine as independent countries, Palestine considers East Jerusalem as their future capital. Importantly, in December 2016, UN had stated that Palestine territories in Jerusalem were under \u201chostile occupation\u201d, i.e., by Israel.\n\nWhy is Jerusalem in news now?\n\nThe US president Donald J Trump in his White House speech earlier this month had announced that \u201cit is time to officially recognize Jerusalem as the capital of\u00a0Israel\u201d. He added that it is a matter of time that US embassy is situated in Jerusalem.\n\nImplications of recognizing Jerusalem as capital of Jerusalem\nThe US is a major power and such a decision means it is willing to concede the contentious claims of Israel. Few former presidents have been so outrightly acquiescent to the Israeli demand.\nThe US has brokered for peace and acted as moderators, though not fully impartial, tried to settle the issue. This unilateral action, however, could hamper the peace process. Its immediate repercussions were seen in latest protests by Palestinian people.\nOpen defiance of a global understanding and concern for the Palestinian cause. Even US allies have vilified this move. It could cue other nations to take a stubborn and defiant position in global talks. Here, North Korea comes to mind.\nUnilateral violation of UNSC resolutions on the need for status quo in Jerusalem and seek for a peaceful resolution of this issue. The decision was challenged through a resolution in UNSC and UN General Assembly.\nTougher stand by the Muslim nations of the region. Some led by Turkey declared East Jerusalem as the capital of Palestine on December 13th, 2017.\nWhat the US administration hopes to achieve:\nWider acceptance to Jerusalem as Israeli capital and move it diplomatic mission there.\nA greater say in the happenings in the middle-east. US policy in this region today faces challenges from Russia and regional power Iran and its proxies.\nTo show the world it can take independent decisions that suit a global power.\nSatiate the pro-Israel lobbies and provide a pat on the back of Netanyahu Government of Israel.\nThe UN vote on Jerusalem issue\n\nHistorically, UN has time and again chided Israel for its unilateral actions. UNSC passed a Resolution 476 asking the \u201cOccupying Power\u201d Israel to refrain changing the character, demographics and status of the Holy City of Jerusalem. (Reference \u2013 Wikipedia)\n\nThe Israeli \u201cbasic law\u201d have no legal validity and constitute a flagrant violation of the Fourth Geneva Convention relative to the Protection of Civilian Persons in Time of War and also constitute a serious obstruction to achieving a comprehensive, just and lasting peace in the Middle East, the resolution had said.\n\nNoting that Israel did not comply with this resolution UNSC came out with a stronger worded Resolution 478 in 1980 that asked nations to not have diplomatic missions in The Holy City, Jerusalem.\n\nUNSC on December 18th voted on a resolution drafted by Egypt against the US decision to accept Jerusalem as the capital of Israel and shift its embassy there. It did not name the US in the resolution but asked nations respect previous UNSC resolutions on the matter. All other members had voted for the resolution seeking to stop the US in its tracks. But the US used its veto power to put paid to this effort. It was the first time in 6 years that the US had used it veto power.\n\nOn December 21, 2017, the UN General Assembly took up a resolution that was tabled by Turkey and Yemen on the same issue, as the UNSC had \u201cfailed to act\u201d. Again the resolution did not name any country but asked nations that its actions that go against UNSC resolutions will be null and void. The US was found wanting here as the resolution was accepted with over two-thirds majority. However, the GA resolution in its \u201cspecial emergency session\u201d, unlike the UNSC one, is non-binding.\n\nEarlier, US had threatened nations that if things go against the US it would cut back on this funding to UN and also have consequences to those nations. Also, Nikki Haley, US permanent representative to UN said that \u201cNo UN vote is going to make any difference\u201d to the US decision to shift embassy to Jerusalem.\n\nIndian viewpoint on Jerusalem\n\nIndia has always been sympathetic to the Palestine cause even as it had tried to play a fine balancing act vis-a-vis Israel-Palestine issue. It wants a lasting solution on the issue with the two nations existing independently side by side. India did not recognise Israel initially as it sought its UN membership in 1948. Diplomatic relations were established with that country officially only in 1992.\n\nOn the other hand, India had supported Palestine efforts to gain UN recognition. India was convinced that the Palestinian people were the victims here. It had faced its own partition in 1947 on ostensibly religious lines and knows that without a peaceful settlement things are only going to worsen. Israel had been repeatedly proven aggressor and used disproportionate force upon the Palestine people.\n\nIndia\u2019s stand on the issue had lately alternated. The stronger US embrace in Indian diplomacy is sighted as a reason for this. However, in the latest UNGA resolution, India voted for the resolution and thus against the US. This, after US, released a statement to members that the US President would take their vote \u201cpersonally\u201d.\n\nExamining India\u2019s vote\n\nIndia has taken a bold and right decision here. There is nothing good to be achieved by the unilateral decision by the USA. The world community including US\u2019s staunchest allies did not support the US decision. The problem is not that of the sovereign decision of US to choose where to locate its embassy, it is of the need to respect the UNSC resolutions that have been collectively accepted.\n\nThis vote may cause slight discomfort for India as The Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu is set to visit India next month, first by an Israeli Premier after 15 years. It could be hoped that diplomats could deliberate on this and impress upon Israel that there will be no winners if this US decision is put into action. India needs to reiterate the need for status quo until the peace process comes up with an agreement acceptable to both nations as well as the international community.\n\nArticle by: Imthiyaz K Shams"

It was a vassal of the Qing dynasty of China. It even led to a period where Korea was open to trade only with China. This explains the historical link between China and Korea.\nIn 1895, the Treaty of Shimonoseki was signed between Japan and China after the former defeated China in the\u00a0Sino-Japanese War (1894-95).\nAs a result of the treaty, Joseon was removed from China\u2019s vassalage.\nIn 1897, the Joseon was renamed as KOREAN EMPIRE.\nFrom 1897-1905 Korea witnessed a strong autocratic rule under Emperor Gojong. He embarked on a journey to strengthen the military and market structure of Korea. He was helped by Russia, which had much influence on Korea during the period.\nThe Russo-Japanese War (1905) ended Russia\u2019s influence and with the 1905 Protectorate Treaty, Korea became a Japanese protectorate.\n1905-1910 was a period of political turbulence in Korea. It ended with the 1910 annexation of Korea by Japan.\n1910- 1945, Korea was effectively under the rule of the Japanese. It was after the fall of Japan in World War II that the seeds of the Korean conflict were sown.\nThe Korean Conflict\n\nThe present-day Korean conflict is born primarily from the seeds sown during the Cold War \u2013 between the USSR and the USA. You may note here that after the defeat of Japan \u2013 which was the earlier controlling force of Korea \u2013 the superpowers were the USSR and the USA.\n\nThe Korean conflict can be divided into three main phases:\n\n\ud83d\udc49 Which year are YOU targeting for success in the IAS/IPS/IFS Exam? \ud83d\ude80\n\n(1) \u21d2 UPSC 2025: Prelims cum Mains\n\n(2) \u21d2 UPSC 2026: Prelims cum Mains\n\n(3) \u21d2 UPSC 2027 Prelims cum Mains\n\nTip: Know more about ClearIAS Courses (Online/Offline)\n\n1. Korean War (1950-1953):\n\nThe Korean War was a major armed conflict that began on June 25, 1950, when North Korean forces, supported by the Soviet Union and China, invaded South Korea. The conflict quickly escalated into a full-scale war.\nThe United Nations, with the United States taking a leading role, intervened to support South Korea. This marked one of the early instances of UN involvement in a military conflict.\nThe war resulted in significant loss of life and destruction, and it ended in an armistice agreement on July 27, 1953, but not a formal peace treaty. The Korean Peninsula remained divided along the 38th parallel, and the Korean Demilitarized Zone (DMZ) was established.\nThe Korean War had lasting consequences, as it solidified the division of Korea into North and South, each with its government and ideology. It also contributed to the Cold War tensions between the United States and the Soviet Union.\n\n2. Post-Korean War Tensions (1953-1980s):\n\nAfter the armistice, North and South Korea continued to exist as separate and ideologically opposed states.\nThe two Koreas remained in a state of hostilities, with sporadic border incidents and clashes.\nNorth Korea developed a socialist system under the leadership of the Kim dynasty, while South Korea transitioned to democracy and experienced significant economic growth.\n\n3. Contemporary Tensions (1990s-Present):\n\nTensions have persisted between North and South Korea, with occasional flare-ups and crises. Notable incidents include naval clashes, the bombing of South Korean facilities, and missile tests by North Korea.\nEfforts have been made to ease tensions and promote dialogue between the two Koreas and the international community. Inter-Korean summits have taken place in recent years, including meetings between North Korean leader Kim Jong-un and South Korean President Moon Jae-in.\nThe international community, including the United States, China, and Russia, has been involved in diplomatic efforts aimed at denuclearization and peace on the Korean Peninsula.\nSeeds of the Conflict: By USSR and USA\n\nThe Allied forces of the Second World War at the Yalta Conference (1945), agreed to establish a \u201cfour-power trusteeship over Korea\u201d.\nBefore a concrete plan could be formulated, the USSR invaded Korea and within a week Japan surrendered. This led to a condition where the north of Korea was under the USSR and the south under the rest of the allies, mainly the USA (the two regions are divided by the 38th parallel).\nIn December 1945 at the Moscow Conference, a joint Soviet-American commission was established to work on the Trusteeship issue of Korea.\nThe fear of the spread of communism and the mutual distrust between the USSR and the USA led to the failure of the trusteeship plan.\nThe advent of the cold-war the end to the hope of a united Korea.\nIn 1948 the United Nations proposed free elections across all of Korea. USSR rejected this plan. However, an election took place in the American protectorate resulting in the establishment of the Republic of Korea (South Korea).\nThe next month the northern part was declared as the Democratic People\u2019s Republic of Korea (North Korea).\nBoth halves tried to enhance their reach, territorially and ideologically, which gave birth to the Korean Conflict.\nEscalation of the conflict \u2013 The Korean Wars\nIn 1950, North Korea, supplied by the USSR, launched an attack on South Korea occupying most of the country.\nAs a response to the attack, in September (1950) the United Nations forces led by the US retaliated with brutal force and changed the dynamics of the war.\nThe 1950-51 period was the most turbulent one.\nThe US forces led by Douglas MacArthur wished to use the opportunity to capture the north and hence crossed the 38th parallel. However, their aggression led to the entry of China to support North Korea.\nSensing the escalation of the crisis, the US president removed Douglas MacArthur in 1951, and peace talks began in 1951.\nMid 1951 to 1953 saw a period of relative calm despite acts of hostilities from both sides.\n\nAfter the death of Stalin, in 1953, USSR brokered an armistice agreement. It led to:\n\nAn official ceasefire without a Peace treaty. So, in a sense, the war never ended.\nExchange of Prisoners of War (PoWs).\nEstablishment of Korean Demilitarized Zone (DMZ)\u00a0\u2013 2.5 miles wide and approximately 150-mile long areas with no military presence. Its surrounding makes the most fortified border in the world.\nThe Weapon Race by North Korea\nUnder Kim Jong Il (the second leader of North Korea and father of present leader Kim Jong-un) North Korea accelerated its nuclear program and supposedly developed nuclear capabilities (probably with the help of China).\nIt withdrew from the Non-Proliferation Treaty (NPT) in 2003. (North Korea is not a member of the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty (CTBT) either)\nThereafter it tested nuclear explosives in 2006, 2009, 2013, and 2016. Also, it has demonstrated Uranium enrichment capability and possesses weapon-grade Plutonium.\nFor denuclearizing the Korean Peninsula, the Six-Party Talks between North Korea, South Korea, Japan, China, Russia, and the United States began in 2003. However, these have in suspended since 2009.\nThere are suspicions that it possesses a large chemical weapon arsenal. (North Korea is not a member of the Chemical Weapon Convention (CWC))\nIn December 2015, Kim Jong Un also claimed to have thermonuclear capabilities (the veracity of the claim is, however, a matter of debate).\nKorean Conflict: Recent Troubles\n\nIn 2016 North Korea conducted two nuclear tests (its fourth and fifth tests). In addition, it successfully launched medium and long-range missiles.\nDespite global condemnation and warnings, it continued its ventures and in March 2017, launched four Ballistic Missiles.\nPortraying an offensive stance, the US started deploying THAAD (Terminal High Altitude Area Defence) in South Korea in March 2017. (Note: For information on India\u2019s Ballistic missile defense system click here)\nUnfazed by the threats, on 4th July 2017 (Independence Day of USA) North Korea claimed to have successfully launched an Inter-Continental Ballistic Missile (ICBM), capable of reaching even Alaska, USA.\n\u2018North Korea vs South Korea\u2019 now \u2018North Korea vs USA\u2019: What Makes Things Worse?\n\nMegalomaniac attitude of Kim Jong Un, who in the past has demonstrated acts of utter cruelty to satisfy his ego.\nThe USA under Donald Trump is fickle in foreign policy where there seems to be knee-jerk-based diplomacy rather than realpolitik.\u00a0 His action in Afghanistan (dropping of GBU-43) shows his willingness to go to great extents to satisfy his motives.\nChina which serves as a lifeline to North Korea hasn\u2019t shown concerted efforts to solve the issue. This resulted in a blame game started by the US president, which has further made getting China\u2019s support a tough task.\nDespite President of South Korea Moon Jae-in\u2019s call for talks, the North Korean leader hasn\u2019t shown much interest. The possibility of talks between the original parties is nearly over.\nThe conflict which involved territorial issues between North and South Korea has transformed into a tussle between the USA and North Korea. The launch of an ICBM by North Korea on 4th July 2017 proves the point. It reduces the possibility of a local solution and if not resolved in time, it could lead to a full-blown nuclear war.\nPossible Solution to the Korean Conflict\n\nWar is not a solution, it\u2019s a progenitor of conflicts. Only destruction of a party involved can bring peace after war, that too depends on the whims of the victorious. Therefore, we won\u2019t consider war as a possible solution. Thus the available options are:\n\nBreaking the Economic lifeline of North Korea with the support of China:\nIt is hard to achieve, especially when China considers North Korea as a strategic asset to engage the USA without confronting the US directly.\nAlso, if cornered, there is a possibility that Kim Jong Un may take the nuclear path as a desperate measure.\nA cyber-attack to paralyze the missile and nuclear weapon system of North Korea. Like Stuxnet did to Iran:\nCyber-attacks are best to measure to delay or disrupt but fail on a long-term basis.\nNorth Korea has maintained a closed network and it\u2019s very hard to judge how much damage cyber-attack can do. A mediocre success by cyber-attack would only make North Korea\u2019s preparedness more robust.\nConciliation based on the initiative of South Korea:\nThis seems the best option available. To start, we can resume the Six-party Meet that has remained in suspension since 2009. Also, the US needs to take a bigger step and remove THAAD so that such talks can begin again.\nConclusion: Don\u2019t neglect the China factor\n\n\u00a0\n\nIn his book \u201cArt of War\u201d, Sun Tzu calls for war where there should be a diversion of the enemy\u2019s strength without directly indulging with the opponent. North Korea is the point of diversion of strength, the US the opponent, and China the strategist. The continued support of North Korea by China, directly as well as clandestinely vindicates this policy.\n\nAny solution to the Korean Conflict would be either short-lived or highly destructive if China doesn\u2019t support it. The Korean crisis is the litmus test of realpolitik and the use of force only shows a lack of wits. In an ideal world, we could call for a concerted effort by all to bring peace. But pragmatism calls for the wait and watch, as for now, peace is not beneficial for the one capable of bringing peace.\n\nArticle by: Alok Singh"

            "[CONTENT]": "The \u201cOne Belt, One Road\u201d (OBOR) initiative, also known as the \u201cBelt and Road Initiative\u201d (BRI), is a large-scale infrastructure and economic development project initiated by the People\u2019s Republic of China. Read here to learn more about the initiative, developments, and India\u2019s stand on the same.\n\nChinese President Xi Jinping announced one of China\u2019s most ambitious foreign policy and economic initiatives at the end of 2013. He called for the building of a Silk Road Economic Belt and a 21st Century Maritime Silk Road, collectively referred to as One Belt One Road (OBOR).\n\nOne Belt One Road (OBOR) is arguably one of the largest development plans in modern history. But is this initiative merely an economic one or a geostrategic step by China? Will India benefit by joining this initiative or not? Let us discuss this initiative in detail.\n\nTable of Contents\n\nWhat is \u201cOne Belt, One Road\u201d or OBOR?\nObjectives of China behind the One Belt One Road\nWhich countries are involved?\nChina-Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC)\nGeostrategic Aspect in CPEC\nIndia\u2019s position regarding One Belt One Road\nShould India join One Belt One Road?\nAdvantages of joining OBOR\nDisadvantages of joining OBOR\nWhat should India do to counter One Belt One Road?\nConclusion\nWhat is \u201cOne Belt, One Road\u201d or OBOR?\n\nOne Belt, One Road (OBOR) is China\u2019s much-touted new foreign and economic policy. It is a development strategy to connect China with Central Asia, Europe, and Indo-Pacific littoral countries. This policy has two components:\n\nBelt\u2013 The \u201cOne Belt\u201d refers to the land-based \u201cSilk Road Economic Belt\u201d. Here Beijing aims to connect the country\u2019s underdeveloped hinterland to Europe through Central Asia.\nRoad \u2013 The \u201cOne Road\u201d references the ocean-going \u201cMaritime Silk Road\u201d. It is to connect the fast-growing Southeast Asian region to China\u2019s southern provinces through ports and railways.\n\nThe plan is to connect the Pacific Ocean and the Indian Ocean. This will connect the Chinese coastline with SE Asia, South Asia, the Gulf, and the East Coast of Africa. China will build hard and soft maritime infrastructure. It will include custom coordination, the formation of SEZ, new ports, e-commerce, trade liberalization, and policy coordination.\n\n\ud83d\udc49 Which year are YOU targeting for success in the IAS/IPS/IFS Exam? \ud83d\ude80\n\n(1) \u21d2 UPSC 2025: Prelims cum Mains\n\n(2) \u21d2 UPSC 2026: Prelims cum Mains\n\n(3) \u21d2 UPSC 2027 Prelims cum Mains\n\nTip: Know more about ClearIAS Courses (Online/Offline)\n\nOBOR covers countries throughout the Asian continent from China to the rest of Eurasia. The geographical stretch makes it comparable with the Silk Road or Silk Route, an ancient network of trade routes connecting the East and West around 120 BCE to 1450s CE that is famous for the profitable silk (and horses) trade. That is why it is also called as \u201cNew Silk Road\u201d initiative.\n\nAlso read: Asia-Africa Growth Corridor (AAGC) \u2013 A Game Changer?\n\nObjectives of China behind the One Belt One Road\n\nSubscribe to the ClearIAS YouTube Channel for more informative videos on UPSC preparation, tips, and strategies. Stay updated with our latest content and enhance your exam readiness.\n\nThe OBOR strategy is often reported as China\u2019s ambitious push to take a bigger role in global affairs and expand its friend circle.\nWhile China insists that the investment in OBOR is economically motivated and will bring economic benefits to host countries the project is multi-prolonged and is intended to serve diplomatic, economic, and strategic purposes.\nIt is also intended to address its domestic needs in economic transformation. The demand for industrial output will increase and thus will revitalize its economy.\nThis project will build China\u2019s soft power and some analysts call it a China Marshall Plan.\nThis initiative will make the Indo-Pacific region be Sino-centric economic and security region.\nIt is also an attempt to counter US propaganda that rising China is a threat to world peace. Thus it is to convince that rising China is not a threat but rather creates a win-win situation for all.\nMaritime Silk Road, and especially Chinese infrastructure investment is implicitly intended to facilitate more frequent People\u2019s Liberation Army Navy deployments in the Indian Ocean and beyond.\nWhich countries are involved?\n\nThe \u2018Belt\u2019 and \u2018Road\u2019 covers primarily Asia and Europe, encompassing around 60 countries.\n\nOn China\u2019s \u201cOne Belt, One Road\u201d official website, it also says the initiative is open to all countries as well as international and regional organizations for cooperation.\n\nChina-Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC)\n\nChina-Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC) is expected to connect Kashgar in Xinjiang in China\u2019s far west with the Port of Gwadar in the province of Baluchistan via a network of highways, railways, and pipelines.\n\nThis project would allow China to transport energy resources such as petroleum from Middle Eastern countries to China via a land route through Pakistan.\n\nChina signed 51 MoUs with Pakistan worth $46 billion as part of this project in April 2015. This corridor is an extension of China\u2019s Silk Road initiative. This project will provide economic growth to Pakistan and will help in boosting infrastructure development with the help of China.\n\nGeostrategic Aspect in CPEC\nEnergy security is a key concern for China and oil pipelines through Pakistan would cut about 16,000 kilometers from the distance traveled by goods traded between China and the Middle East. China plans to build oil storage facilities and a refinery at Gwadar Port, with oil transported to its Xinjiang Uighur Autonomous Region via road and pipeline. This will let it move energy and goods to inland China without going through the Strait of Malacca, which could be blocked by the US or India should hostilities break out in the region.\nThis project will lead to development in Western China where tensions are simmering from activities by radical separatists due to closeness with Pakistan and Afghanistan. Ideally, this project would promote growth in Pakistan, weaken the extremists, and encourage the Pakistan army to support peace efforts in Afghanistan.\n\nImplications for India:\n\nCPEC will provide China with strategic access to the Arabian Sea and enhance its presence in the region. It would enable China to wield much more powerful influence in the Indian Ocean.\nOnce completed, the CPEC project would mean that the Chinese presence in the entire Pakistan including Pakistan-Occupied Kashmir becomes pervasive and powerful.\nThe route of CPEC passes through POK and makes China an indirect stakeholder in the Kashmir conflict between India and Pakistan.\nIndia\u2019s position regarding One Belt One Road\n\nIndia is opposed to the Chinese One Belt One Road (OBOR) initiative since the China-Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC) passes through the Indian territory.\n\nIndian government stated that connectivity cannot undermine the sovereignty of other nations. India has also refused to attend the 1st Belt and Road Summit which is going to happen in China in May 2017.\n\nShould India join One Belt One Road?\n\nAdvantages of joining OBOR\nIndia will not be able to stop China from carrying on this initiative nor can it stop its neighbours from joining this initiative. So whether India joins this initiative or not, the project will take place, and not joining may harm India\u2019s interests.\nIndia may become isolated in this region since all of its neighbors (except Bhutan) have joined One Belt One Road. Leaving any regional platform may hamper India\u2019s credentials and may hasten the end of its regional hegemony.\nSome analysts say that this initiative will be a win-win situation for India since it will increase the connectivity of the region. There may emerge a mutually beneficial swap where India protects Chinese interests in the Indian Ocean and China secures India\u2019s essential undertakings in their part of the waters.\nRegional transport, energy security, and the blue economy are key to the OBOR initiative which will be helpful for India.\nChina has the financial capital, and technology to accelerate the development of other countries and India also needs resources and funds for its development.\nTrade: The OBOR project will open more links of trade between India and other countries. Further, India does not enjoy much leverage to guide ocean trade markets despite having proximity to the sea and a strong navy. Through the OBOR project, India will get access to more business in an environment that promotes friendly reforms.\nSome analysts feel that countries like Russia and others in SCO would want Indian participation in OBOR as a counterweight to Chinese influence.\nRegardless of economic interests, India cannot ignore the symbolic significance as it was along the Silk Route that Indian trade and philosophy (Buddhism) traveled to the rest of Asia. Thus China may gain cultural hegemony in the region which may prove counter-productive to India.\nDisadvantages of joining OBOR\nOBOR is a unilateral ideational of China and there is a lack of transparency in its work. The process is not participatory and collaborative.\nUnder the Maritime Silk Route (MSR) China is developing ports in Bangladesh, Sri Lanka, and Pakistan and is trying to enlarge its influence using its economic might in the Bay of Bengal and the Arabian Sea. Thus MSR is nothing but an economic disguise to the \u201cStrings of Pearls\u201d Theory. China is investing a huge amount of money in India\u2019s immediate neighborhood and these countries tend to use the China card against India.\nOBOR seems to be primarily driven by broad geostrategic and geopolitical aims. For Example, the China-Pakistan Economic Corridor gives de facto legitimization to Pakistan\u2019s rights in Pakistan Occupied Kashmir which is against India\u2019s interests. Since this port is closer to the Persian Gulf, it could be used as a transshipment point for China\u2019s energy supplies obviating the need to go through the Strait of Malacca in Southeast Asia. Apart from serving as a commercial port, Gwadar is also deep enough to accommodate submarines and aircraft carriers. Thus it may be used as a military port by the People\u2019s Liberation Army Navy in the future.\nThrough OBOR, China is countering the strategies of India in the North East region and is promoting its greater presence in North East India, part of which China claims as its territory. This may have a security impact on India.\nWhat should India do to counter One Belt One Road?\n\nIndia has already refused to join this initiative due to the geostrategic and geopolitical angle attached to this project. Instead, India has started initiatives for connectivity on its own. Following are some of the steps taken by India.\n\nProject Mausam: It is a soft power diplomacy by India. The project is under the Ministry of Culture and its purpose is to reconnect and re-establish communication links between countries of the Indian Ocean and enhance their cultural values.\nSagarMala: It is a port-led direct and indirect development with a focus on infrastructure and connectivity. The project is to enhance the capacity of major and non-major ports and also to start their modernization process.\nChabahar Port: Chabahar\u2019s location gives India access, besides Iran, to Afghanistan, Central Asia, and Europe, bypassing Pakistan altogether and cutting down significantly current travel distances and time. International North-South Transport Corridor initiated by India, Russia, and Iran is another connectivity solution for India in Central Asia.\nNaval Ports: India is developing naval ports in Indian Ocean regions like Madagascar, Seychelles, and Mauritius.\nIORARC: India is involved in the Indian Ocean Rim Association grouping whose first summit took place in Jakarta in 2017.\nAlliances: Alliance of India with like-minded countries like Japan. Japan has agreed to promote India\u2019s \u201cAct East\u201d policy by developing and strengthening reliable, sustainable, and resilient infra that augments connectivity within India and between India and other countries in the region aimed at advancing Asian industrial networks and regional value chains with open, fair and transparent business environment in the region. Japan and India can build rail and road connectivity across the Eurasian landmass running parallel to OBOR.\nConclusion\n\nTheoretically, if India\u2019s political and strategic concerns are met, the initiative could be seen as viable, particularly given that many of the projects envisaged under the BCIM (Bangladesh China India Myanmar) corridor and the Asian Highway project would dovetail into OBOR.\n\nAlready all of India\u2019s neighbors (except Bhutan) are a part of it, and India is keen to increase connectivity with them. However, tense bilateral relations with China, deep mistrust, and India\u2019s growing concerns over Chinese hegemonic intentions in South Asia and the Indo-Pacific region make it practically unlikely that India will ever consider joining this project.\n\nArticle by: Rahul Sharma, UPSC Topper 2016, With All India Rank 76"

It is connected through a vast and complex network of roads as well as other infrastructure projects such as dams, hydropower projects, railways, and pipelines.\n\nWhat is Pakistan\u2019s interest in CPEC?\n\nUnder the \u20181+4\u2019 cooperation framework of CPEC, \u20181\u2019 represents \u2018CPEC\u2019 and the 4 includes Energy, Gwadar Port, Transport Infrastructure and Industrial cooperation. The Chinese investments are supposed to boost Pakistan\u2019s 274 billion dollar GDP by over 15 percent.\n\nEnergy needs of Pakistan: The large scale energy production has been\u00a0termed as the biggest breakthrough of the project. Energy projects such as Karot Hydropower project, Karachi Nuclear power plant and World\u2019s largest solar power plant in Pakistan\u2019s Punjab Province etc are part of this initiative that can double Pakistan\u2019s energy capacity.\nInfrastructure development: Like any other developing country Pakistan is also suffering due to lack of basic infrastructure facilities. With CPEC, Pakistan expects infrastructural enhancement which includes construction of a 2,000 km\u00a0of road and rail network worth 10.63 billion dollars.\nEmployment Opportunities: This corridor promises huge employment opportunities to all sections of the society.\nAway from Western Influence: CPEC provides Pakistan with an opportunity to work closely with a more reliable friend China independent of Western influence especially the US.\nWhat is China\u2019s interest in CPEC?\n\nAccess to the Middle East and Europe: By materializing the CPEC project, China can save millions of dollars every year by shortening its route by about 12,000 km which is critical for energy imports.\nGwadar Port: A fully operational Gwadar port in Pakistan provides the following benefits.\nIt provides a link between Maritime Silk Road\u00a0and\u00a0the Arabian Sea.\nThe port at the mouth of the Persian Gulf provides China with the shortest route to the oil-rich Middle East, Africa, and most of the Western hemisphere. Gwadar will have the estimated capacity to handle 19 million tonnes of crude oil per year, which will be sent to China after being refined at\u00a0the port. At present, China transports 80% of its oil through the Strait of Malacca.\nApart from these lucrative commercial benefits, China also has huge strategic and geopolitical advantages in the Indian Ocean region.\nWhat are the major concerns for Pakistan?\n\nDespite the fact that CPEC provides Pakistan with huge economic potential, there are apprehensions regarding the success of this project.\n\nAlso read: India USA China Triangle\n\nThe presence of the Chinese army in Pakistan\n\nThe Pakistani Army had set up a special division to provide security for Chinese workers in Pakistan involved in CPEC-related projects. In addition to this, thousands of Chinese security personnel are deployed in Pakistan to provide security to Chinese workers in Pakistan.\u00a0 This can create a threat to the sovereignty of\u00a0Pakistan.\n\n\ud83d\udc49 Which year are YOU targeting for success in the IAS/IPS/IFS Exam? \ud83d\ude80\n\n(1) \u21d2 UPSC 2025: Prelims cum Mains\n\n(2) \u21d2 UPSC 2026: Prelims cum Mains\n\n(3) \u21d2 UPSC 2027 Prelims cum Mains\n\nTip: Know more about ClearIAS Courses (Online/Offline)\n\nInternal Conflicts\n\nThe insurgent groups in Baluchistan are opposing CPEC as it disturbs the ethnic distribution of the region. This poses a threat to CPEC as Gwadar port which is situated in Baluchistan holds the key to the success of the corridor. Any further unrest in the area could completely destabilize Pakistan and its geopolitical interests.\n\nTerrorism\n\nThe banned terrorist organizations in Pakistan pose a serious threat to the project. It may also hamper the relations with China in the long run.\n\nThe role of India\n\nPakistan believes that India is keen on sabotaging CPEC by funding and training insurgency elements in Baluchistan.\n\nHambantota Project Experience\n\nThe Sri Lankan Govt has taken billions of Dollars in loans from China for Hambantota projects which are also part of OBOR initiative. Now as we see, Sri Lanka is left at the mercy of IMF to pay back China\u2019s hefty loans. In the same way, a lack of transparency regarding the interest rates and other terms may leave Pakistan in the same situation.\n\nCPEC and its Significance to India\n\nFrom the time when it was initiated India opposed CPEC route and development of Gwadar port. The reasons are listed below:\n\nThe planned CPEC route passes through POK and Gilgit-Baltistan, which India claims to be its own integral and indispensable territory, illegally held by CPEC also somewhat legitimises Pakistan\u2019s ownership over disputed PoK and it may lead to the internationalisation of Kashmir Issue which India doesn\u2019t want. Apart from this India feels that the high economic stakes in the project will push China to ally with Pakistan on the Kashmir dispute.\nWith the complete realisation of CPEC, China will get a free corridor to move its armour and mechanised weapons which are a threat to India in the plains of Punjab and Rajasthan. In the guise of securing CPEC, China can permanently position troops on Pakistan soil not too far from the Indian\nDespite clarifications from China and Pakistan that the port at Gwadar will be used only for economic purposes, India fears that China may establish a naval base at Gwadar to ensure Chinese\u00a0maritime hegemony in the Indian Ocean. India considers Gwadar Port as part of China\u2019s String of Pearls\u201d bases, that extends from its eastern coast to the Arabian Sea.\nWhat can India do?\nIn order to counter Chinese dominance in Gwadar Port, India has invested in Iran\u2019s Chabahar port which is very near to Gwadar. Also, India, Iran, and\u00a0Afghanistan signed a trade corridor deal giving India the land access to Central Asia from Chabahar, bypassing Pakistan.\nIndia can work on improving the relationship with Pakistan as it can provide the shortest land route for us to access Central Asia. Therefore a good relationship with Pakistan can give a boost to our trade relations with central Asian countries.\nIndia should keep in mind that realisation of CPEC is important as a stable and economically strong Pakistan is necessary for the peace and prosperity in the region.\nConclusion\nChina-Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC) \u00a0can act as a catalyst for economic connectivity and integration in Central Asia, South Asia, and West Asia.\nHowever, it should not jeopardise the India\u2019s sovereignty through any channel. India should highlight its concerns via diplomatic initiatives to address it fears.\nIndia should be cautious while explicitly opposing the project as it would strain the relationship with China.\nLast but not the least a prosperous South Asia is possible only if India and Pakistan leave their political clout and work closely with each other to find an amicable solution to the bilateral Issues.\n\nAlso read Pakistan, Afghanistan, and China triangle and its impact on India.\n\nArticle by: Sreeresmi S."

In becoming an observer, India had to agree to the following criteria set by the Council:\n\nTo recognize the sovereign rights of Arctic states.\nTo recognize that the Law of the Sea and the U.N. Convention on the Law of the Sea, constitute the legal basis and the legal framework within which the Arctic will be managed.\nTo respect indigenous peoples, local cultures, and traditions.\nTo respect indigenous peoples, local cultures, and traditions.\nTo be able to contribute to the work of the Arctic Council.\n\nIndia has therefore officially recognized the territorial jurisdiction and sovereign rights of the Arctic states. India has also accepted the UNCLOS as the governing instrument for the Arctic implying that jurisdiction over both the continental shelf and maritime passage, and the resources of the ocean will primarily lay with the eight Arctic States.\n\nIndia has, therefore, no more room to argue that the region is treated in the same manner as Antarctica. China has lost no time in positioning itself through several asset acquisitions in several Arctic states, in particular, Russia and Canada.\n\nHowever, what is worrying is that ecological protection, the main reason behind establishing the council has now been trumped by economic factors. India and other developing nations must make the Arctic an important part of their agenda on climate change negotiations.\n\nRead: \u00a0India\u2019s Arctic Policy\n\nPoints to Remember\nThe Ottawa Declaration lists the members of the Arctic Council. Only those countries that are located in the Arctic region are eligible for membership.\nThe location of the Secretariat was rotated\u00a0biennially with the Chairmanship of the Arctic Council. Currently, the Arctic Council Secretariat became formally operational in 2013 in Tromso, Norway.\nThe Chairmanship of the Arctic Council is rotated every two years once. The first country to chair the Arctic Council was Canada (1996-1998). Finland will be the current chair of the Arctic Council (from 2017-2019).\nThe decisions, recommendations, or guidelines of the Arctic Council are non-enforceable and strictly the prerogative of the individual state.\nThe Arctic Council mandate explicitly excludes military security as per the Ottawa Declaration as per the explanation to clause 1(a).\nThe Arctic Council does not have a fund or a program. All contributions are made voluntarily by the respective member states.\nThe first Ministerial Meeting was held from 17th to 18th September 1998, in Iqaluit, Canada.\n\nArticle by:\u00a0Manasvini Mukund"

Let\u2019s try to understand India\u2019s relationship with both countries first. This would help you understand India\u2019s stand on the Israel-Palestine conflict.\n\nTable of Contents\n\nIndia-Palestinian relations\nIndia\u2019s cooperation with Palestine in other areas\nReasons behind India\u2019s pro-Palestine policy\nIndia-Israel Relations\nIndia-Israel Relations post 1992\nWhat is India\u2019s stand on the Israel-Palestine Conflict?\nWhat are the things India must keep in mind before endorsing Israel?\nWay ahead\nIndia-Palestinian relations\n\nIndia\u2019s solidarity with the Palestinian people and its attitude towards the Palestinian cause was taken shape during our freedom struggle against British colonialism. In 1938, on the proposal to create a homeland for Jews in Palestine, Mahatma Gandhi wrote, \u201cmy sympathy for the Jews does not blind me to the requirements of Justice. It is wrong and inhuman to impose the Jews on the Arabs\u2019.\nIn 1947, having been the victim of Partition and going through its horrific scenes, India voted against the partition of Palestine at the United Nations General Assembly. It should be noted that India was the only non-Arab and Non-Muslim country to do so.\nPost Independence also, empathy with Palestine became an essential part of our foreign policy.\nIndia has always played a proactive role in garnering support for the Palestinian cause at multilateral forums.\nAnd in 1974, India became the first non-Arab country to recognise the Palestine Liberation Organisation (PLO) as the sole representative of the Palestinian.\nIndia was one of the first countries to recognise the state of Palestine in 1988.\nWhen Palestine Authority (PA), a self Government body, was created as a result of the Oslo Peace accord, India opened her Representative Office for it in Gaza, which later was shifted to Ramallah in 2003.\nIndia voted in favour of UN Resolution against constructing the West Bank wall by Israel in 2003.\nIndia voted in favour for accepting Palestine as a full member of UNESCO in 2011.\nIndia voted in favour of upgrading the status of Palestine to a \u00a0\u2018non-member state \u2018 in the UN in 2012.\nIn 2014, India supported a UNHRC resolution to launch a probe into Isreal\u2019s offensive in Gaza.\nIndia\u2019s cooperation with Palestine in other areas\n\nAlong with Political support, India has been contributing material and technical assistance to the Palestinian people. India has offered budgetary assistance to a tune of US$ 30 million since 1995 till date for different development initiatives in Palestine. Construction of a library in Al-Azhar university, library \u2013 cum activity centre in Palestine technical college etc. to name a few.\nIn 2016 India pledged USD 1.25 million to the UN relief agency for Palestinian refugees as it voiced concern over the fragile situation and ongoing conflicts in the Middle East.\nIndia has always been a leading partner in educational support and cooperation to Palestine. It has been at the forefront of the capacity building process, extending hundreds of scholarships to Palestinian students under the ITEC (Indian Technical & Economic Cooperation)\nIndia-Palestine cultural connections draw strength from India\u2019s cultural and civilizational linkages with the Arab world. Due to the cultural similarities of both countries, Indian Arts and Culture is very popular in Palestine. Several cultural activities such as Kalarippayattu (Indian Martial Art), Kathak etc. were organised in Palestine in the recent past. Indian films, yoga, Indian cuisines etc are also popular in Palestine.\nReasons behind India\u2019s pro-Palestine policy\nIndia with a considerable Muslim Population has been always sympathetic to the Muslim population in Palestine. Indian politicians also followed a pro- Palestine approach without hurting the minority sentiments.\nIndia did not want to jeopardise the interest of its citizens (more than 7 million) working in Arab countries which are a good source of forex reserves.\nIndia is dependent on the Arab nations for its larger oil imports.\nIndia\u2019s co-operation with the Soviet Union during the cold war era and our desire to counter Pakistan with the support of Arab nations was another reason for our pro-Palestine policy.\nIndia-Israel Relations\n\nThough India voted against a UN resolution for the creation of Israel, once Israel is created, India officially recognised Israel (in 1950). But full diplomatic ties were established only in 1992.\n\n\ud83d\udc49 Which year are YOU targeting for success in the IAS/IPS/IFS Exam? \ud83d\ude80\n\n(1) \u21d2 UPSC 2025: Prelims cum Mains\n\n(2) \u21d2 UPSC 2026: Prelims cum Mains\n\n(3) \u21d2 UPSC 2027 Prelims cum Mains\n\nTip: Know more about ClearIAS Courses (Online/Offline)\n\nThe reasons for this tectonic shift in the foreign policy stand were:\n\nDuring these years, the popular perception of Israel was negative as it was a state formed on religion and analogous to Pakistan. However, the formation of an Organisation of Islamic Cooperation (OIC) in 1969 which neglected the sentiments of Indian Muslims by blocking of India\u2019s membership to this group by Pakistan is one of the primary triggers for the change in stance. (Even today India is not a member of OIC).\nIndia has received no backing from the Arab countries on Kashmir Issue. There have been no serious attempts by the Arab world to put pressure on Pakistan to reign in the cross-border insurgency in Kashmir.\nIsrael supported India during the Indo-Pak wars even before full diplomatic ties were established.\nWith the collapse of the Soviet Union and the rise of the US as a superpower, India started aligning itself with the US and this further added to our improved relations with Israel.\nAfter decades of Non-Alignment and Pro-Arab policy, in 1992 India changed its stance and established full diplomatic ties with Israel.\nIndia-Israel Relations post 1992\nBy 1992, the stage was ready for a new beginning in the history of the India-Israel relationship. As mentioned earlier, the first steps towards de-hyphenation were initiated in 1992 when the government established full diplomatic relations with the bilateral relationship between the two countries has blossomed at the economic, military, agricultural, space research and political levels.\nIsrael was one of the rare countries to directly help India during the Kargil War. The Kargil conflict revealed some important deficiencies in India\u2019s intelligence and military forces. In the efforts to rectify these problems, India turned towards Israeli assistance and technologies.\nSince then Israel became an important defence importer for India. When India was planning to undertake a military strike against Pakistan in June 2002 as part of Operation Parakram\u00a0(response to our Parliament attack), Israel supplied hardware through special planes.\nNow, India is the world\u2019s largest buyer of Israeli weaponry and in 2013 India was the third-largest trading partner of Israel in Asia.\nApart from defence cooperation, Israel has intensified its cooperation with Indian agriculture, helping farmers multiply their income by the adoption of modern agricultural technologies to increase productivity.\nRecent years have been witnessing a major boost in cooperation in other areas such as S&T, Space research, Commerce, and trade etc.\nIndian President Pranab Mukherjee\u2019s Israel visit in 2015 was another milestone in bilateral relations, as this was the first visit by an Indian president to Israel. Our PM is planning to visit Israel in 2017.\nWhat is India\u2019s stand on the Israel-Palestine Conflict?\n\nIndia traditionally believes in the 2-state solution and supports the establishment of a sovereign independent and the viable state of Palestine.\nIndia\u2019s support for Palestine has not deterred its growing relationship with Israel.\nHowever, over the years, the Indian government has diluted its reaction to Israel\u2019s treatment of the Palestinians.\nIn 2014 India favoured a UN resolution which established a Commission of Inquiry to investigate a violation of international humanitarian and human rights law in the \u2018Occupied Territories\u2019 during \u2018 Operation Protective Edge\u2019. (Please refer to article on Israel-Palestine Conflict). But our Government was reluctant to pass a resolution in Parliament condemning the Israeli action deviating from its earlier practice.\nIn 2015 India abstained at the UN Human Rights Commission (UNHRC) on a resolution welcoming the report of the same Commission of Inquiry. It\u00a0was the first time India refused to vote against Israel.\nLater on, our Government clarified that there was no change in India\u2019s traditional support to the Palestinian cause and it was the reference to the ICC (International criminal court) which made India abstain from voting. (India has not signed the Rome statute on ICC).\nHowever, with an increased focus on closer ties with Israel, there is little doubt that India has diluted its support to Palestine.\nWhat are the things India must keep in mind before endorsing Israel?\n\nThe important areas of concern by India before endorsing Israel are as follows:\n\nIndia\u2019s energy security still relied upon the Arab Nations.\nIndia should consider its relations with Saudi Arabia and Iran before going for closer ties with Israel. Saudi has not yet recognised Israel as a country and Iran supports the Palestinian cause. Any direct stake in Israel would affect our relationship with these countries.\nWay ahead\n\nIsrael wants India to end its pro-Palestine policy. Considering the defence and technological ties with Israel, India can\u2019t ignore Israel too. \u00a0However, while going beyond strategic relations with Israel, India cannot afford to ignore its crucial energy ties with Iran and the Gulf countries. Also, it should not be forgotten that India requires the firm endorsement of its candidature from the Arab countries that form a large group in the UN General Assembly.\n\nIt is to be noted that India has been very keen to preserve a pragmatic balancing act between regional players in the West Asian region like Saudi Arabia and Iran. On similar lines, India should be cautious enough while backing Israel and should adopt a more balanced and pragmatic approach while dealing with Israel and Palestine.\n\nAlso read: India-Greece Relations\n\nArticle by:\u00a0Sreeresmi\u00a0S"

Though it\u2019s not easy to cover every dimension within a limited space, in this post, we have tried our best to create a comprehensive article on the Israel-Palestine conflict.\n\nThe Israel-Palestine conflict \u2013 often referred to as the \u2018world\u2019s most intractable conflict\u2019 \u2013\u00a0is rooted in a dispute over land claimed by Jews as their biblical birthright and by the Palestinians, who seek self-determination. Despite repeated attempts to end the conflict between the two countries, there is no peace settlement in sight.\n\nTable of Contents\n\nThe History of Israel-Palestine Conflict\nArab\u2019s fight against the Israel (1948-49)\nIsrael\u2019s fight against the Arab countries (1967)\nUN Charter and return of the Sinai Peninsula\nHamas and Fatah\nIntifada (uprising) against Israel occupancy\nTensions between Hamas and Fatah\nIsrael-Palestine conflict and US\nWhat does Palestine want?\nWhat does Israel want?\nWhat is so special about Jerusalem?\nThe solution for the Israel-Palestine conflict\nThe History of Israel-Palestine Conflict\n\nJews have been persecuted throughout history due to their religious beliefs and foreign culture.\nIn 1897, Jews started a movement called a Zionist movement,\u00a0to escape persecution and establish their own state in their ancestral homeland, Israel. The World Zionist Organisation was created to advocate for the establishment of a Jewish homeland in Palestine.\nAs a result, a large number of Jews started flowing into Palestine and they bought land and started settling down there.\nBy 1916, Palestine came under British control after the Sykes-Picot Agreement (a secret agreement between Great Britain and France). This led to the division of the old\u00a0Ottoman Turkish Empire.\nLater through the Balfour Declaration, the British foreign secretary James Balfour agreed to the establishment of a Jewish homeland.\nAfter the Nazis gained power in Germany in the 1930s, the Jews influx to Palestine took a major turn with hundreds of thousands of them resettled from Europe to Palestine. Arabs saw this as a threat to their homeland and they fought bitterly with them. As the British Government remained as a mute spectator, violence reached its peak.\nIn 1947, the British Government referred the question of the future of Palestine to the United Nations. UN voted to split the land into two countries. Jewish people accepted the agreement and declared the independence of Israel.\nArab\u2019s fight against the Israel (1948-49)\nArabs saw the creation of Israel as a part of a conspiracy to move them out of their land. Consequently, in 1948, the Arab states of Egypt, Jordan, Iraq, and Syria declared war on Israel.\nNote: It\u2019s interesting to note here that India opposed the UN resolution and Gandhi called it as a crime against humanity. But India recognized Israel in 1950.\nAt the end of the war between Israel and Arab countries,\u00a0Israel emerged\u00a0victoriously. Moreover, it could increase its territory to a larger extent and it marked the beginning of the expansionist policy of Israel.\nAs a consequence of the war, a large number of Palestinians either flee or were forced to move out of Israel and settle in refugee camps near Israel\u2019s border. It was the beginning of Palestine refugee crisis which ultimately led to the creation of a terrorist organization PLO (Palestine Liberation Organization) in 1964.\nIsrael\u2019s fight against the Arab countries (1967)\n\nIn 1967,\u00a0Israel launched a preemptive strike against Egypt, Syria, and Jordan and at the end of this Six-Day War, Israel captured:\n\nGolan Heights from Syria.\nWest Bank and East Jerusalem from Jordan.\nSinai Peninsula and Gaza Strip from Egypt. (Refer to the map above)\nThe 1967 war is particularly important for today\u2019s conflict, as it left Israel in control of the West Bank and Gaza Strip, two territories home to a large number of Palestinians.\nGaza and Westbank are together known as \u2018Occupied Territories\u2019, after the 1967 war.\nUN Charter and return of the Sinai Peninsula\n\n\ud83d\udc49 Which year are YOU targeting for success in the IAS/IPS/IFS Exam? \ud83d\ude80\n\n(1) \u21d2 UPSC 2025: Prelims cum Mains\n\n(2) \u21d2 UPSC 2026: Prelims cum Mains\n\n(3) \u21d2 UPSC 2027 Prelims cum Mains\n\nTip: Know more about ClearIAS Courses (Online/Offline)\n\nUnder the UN Charter, there can lawfully be no territorial gains from war, even by a state acting in self-defense.\nTherefore, in response to the Six-Day War, the UN Security Council adopted a resolution for \u2018Land for peace\u2019 and it mandated that Israel should return the captured areas back to the defeated nations.\nIn light of Israel\u2019s reluctance to return the captured territories, another Arab-Israeli war erupted in 1973\u00a0(Yom Kippur War) in which Israel suffered some setbacks.\nIn 1979, Israel-Egypt signed a peace treaty, accordingly, Israel returned the Sinai Peninsula to Egypt (1982). Egypt became the first Arab nation to officially recognize Israel as a state.\n\nAlso read: Arab Nationalism\n\nHamas and Fatah\nIn 1987, Hamas (Islamic Militant group) for the liberation of Palestine through Jihad came into existence. It refused to recognize Israel as a country. It has received support from Iran and Syria.\nOn the other hand, Fatah, a faction of PLO under Yasser Arafat received support from Western nations.\nIntifada (uprising) against Israel occupancy\nFirst Intifada: The tension between Israel and Palestine escalated with Israel\u2019s increased settlement in the West Bank and Gaza Strip. Palestinians living in the West Bank and the Gaza Strip fomented the riots begun in 1987, known as the first intifada.\nOslo Peace Accord: With the mediation of US and Russia in 1993, Israel and PLO signed the Oslo Peace accord which was based on the concept of two-state solution. Palestine and Israel signed the Declaration of Principles \u2013 in which both nations seek recognition as autonomous governing bodies. PLO recognized Isreal. Isreal agreed to give independence to the \u2018occupied territories. However, territories remained under Israel possession.\nCamp David Summit (2000): It aimed to help the two sides finally agree on a settlement, but the talks eventually failed. The violence led to the Second Intifada.\nSecond Intifada (2000-05):\u00a0In 2000, a more violent Palestine Uprising started and a large number of civilians died on both sides. This is known as the second intifada. As a defensive measure, Israel constructed a West Bank Barrier along West Bank to separate Israel and Palestine settlements.\nGaza Expulsion plan: This is a unilateral disarmament plan by Israel by which Israel\u2019s defence forces leave the Gaza strip and four settlements in the northern West Bank (2005)\nTensions between Hamas and Fatah\n\nAfter the Oslo accord, a Palestinian Authority (PA) was created with a limited self-rule power in the occupied territories.\nBut this led to disputes between Hamas and Fatah for political power.\nHamas \u2013 do not accept the Oslo peace accord or 2 state peace resolution. They want the whole state. They control Gaza. Hamas is supported by Iran.\nFatah \u2013 accept the Oslo peace accord and negotiates for peace. They control West Bank.\nIn 2006, Hamas won the Palestine election and it intensified the tensions between Fatah and Hamas for power. After a long-armed struggle, in 2011 Palestinian Rivals Fatah and Hamas signed a Reconciliation Pact.\nCurrently, Gaza is controlled by Hamas and Palestine West bank region by Fatah with known presence of Israeli settlements.\nOperation Protective Edge: By Israel to punish Hamas for abducting and killing Israeli settlers.\nIsrael-Palestine conflict and US\nThe US has been playing a significant role as the mediator in the Israel-Palestine. However, its credibility as a mediator had long been questioned by Palestinians. The United States has been criticized by the OIC (Organization of Islamic cooperation) and other Arab organizations, for vetoing most Security Council decisions critical of Israel.\nNote: The USA has more Jews than Israel. Jews have significant control over US media and the economy.\nAlso, Israel\u00a0receives about $3 billion in direct\u00a0foreign assistance\u00a0each year, which is roughly one-fifth of America\u2019s entire\u00a0foreign aid\u00a0budget.\nOn the other side, United States has been vocal about its intention to veto any Palestinian bid for statehood. Due to which Palestine had to be satisfied with a \u2018non-member observer\u00a0status in UN.\nHowever, the second term of the Obama administration saw a degrading US-Israel relationship. Iran Nuclear deal of 2015 irritated Israel and it criticized the US for the deal.\nObama administration allowed the United Nations to pass a resolution that declared Israel\u2019s growing settlements in the occupied territories illegal. Until that vote, the Obama administration had blocked resolutions criticizing Israel by using its veto power in the UN Security Council.\nWith the presidency regime under Trump, who was more inclined to Israel, the illegal settlements by Israel in West Bank and Gaza saw a rise.\nWhat does Palestine want?\n\nThey want Israeli to withdraw from pre-1967 borders and establish an independent Palestine state in West Bank and Gaza.\nIsrael should stop all expansion of settlements before coming to peace talks.\nPalestine wants Palestine refugees who lost their homes in 1948 to be able to come back.\nPalestine wants East Jerusalem as the capital of the Independent Palestine state.\nWhat does Israel want?\nSovereignty over Jerusalem.\nRecognition of Israel as a Jewish State. Note: Israel is the only country in the world created for a religious community.\nThe right of return of Palestine refugees only to Palestine and not to Israel.\nWhat is so special about Jerusalem?\n\nJerusalem is a city that straddles the border between Israel and the West Bank. It\u2019s home to some of the holiest sites in both Judaism and Islam, and so both Israel and Palestine want to make it their cap the solution to the Israel-Palestine conflict.\n\nThe solution for the Israel-Palestine conflict\n\nThe best solution is a\u00a0\u201ctwo-state solution\u201d that would establish Palestine as an independent state in Gaza and most of the West Bank, leaving the rest of the land to Israel. Though the two-state plan is clear in theory, the two sides are still deeply divided over how to make it work in practice.\nOne state solution (only Palestine or only Israel) is not a viable option.\nRoad Map for Peace: The European Union, UN, US, and Russia had released a road map in 2003, which outlined a clear timetable towards a Palestinian state.\nThe democratization of the Palestinian society through which new credible leadership can emerge is necessary.\nThe need of the hour is to treat this conflict as an Israeli-Arab conflict rather Israel-Palestine. As we have seen, conflict is not only between Israel and Palestine but also with other Arab countries such as Egypt, Jordan, Iran, Syria etc. All of them should participate in the negotiations and the final agreement should be recognized formally by each one of them along with UN general assembly and security council.\nIt is time for the international community to find a just and lasting peaceful solution to the World\u2019s most intractable conflict soon.\n\nRead: Gaza humanitarian crisis;\u00a0Iran-Israel relations\n\n\u00a0Article by:\u00a0Sreeresmi\u00a0S"

That time Syria was ruled by Basher-Al-Assad, he announced several plans like salary revisions to appease the people of his country.\nThe largest religious group in Syria is the Sunni Muslims which constitutes almost 74% of the population. They were not happy with the administration of President Basher-Al-Assad who was more inclined to Shia Muslims.\nIn 2011, peaceful democratic protests started in The Government started a brutal crackdown on rebel groups with the support of Iran-backed Militia and it revealed the sectarian tensions in Syria.\nThe Sunni-dominated opposition has, meanwhile, attracted varying degrees of support from its international backers \u2013 Turkey, Saudi Arabia, Qatar, and Jordan, along with the US, UK, and France. A large number of Syrian Sunnis, US sponsored western fighters and Saudi-backed Sunni fighters etc joined the rebel group to topple the Assad regime.\nIn 2013, US claimed that Syrian Government has used Chemical weapons (Sarin Gas) against the rebel group and demanded UN investigation in Syria. Also, US stepped up its support for rebels and the Assad regime started receding.\nSyria agreed to a Russian( Russia backs Assad Regime) Proposal to give up Chemical weapons and later OPCW (Organisation of Prohibition of Chemical Weapons) announced that Syrian Government has destroyed all its declared chemical weapons mixing, filling and production facilities.\nHereafter, UN kick-started the peace talks with the aim of ending the Syrian Civil War. United Nations-backed international peace conference on the future of Syria known as Geneva II Conference was held in 2013, nevertheless, it remained inconclusive.\nThe US and its allies\u2019 supports to the rebels in Syria to topple the Assad regime, led to the rise of the terrorist outfit ISIS (Islamic State of Iraq and Syria) which established in Sunni Provinces of Iraq and eastern provinces of Syria. This radical Islamist group has gained control over vast territory and populations of Syria.\nISIS became a global threat and in response to this, the US-led coalition launched air strikes on Syria in an effort to \u201cdegrade and ultimately destroy\u201d IS. But the coalition has avoided attacks that might benefit Assad\u2019s forces. In short, it could not destroy the might of ISIS.\nThe balance of Power changed when Russia began an air campaign targeting \u201cterrorists\u201d in Syria in 2015. With the support of Russia, Assad regime regained many parts of the country including Aleppo City. But opposition activists said that its strikes have mostly killed Western-backed rebels and civilians.\nThe Geneva III peace talks are still on, but the peace still remains.\nImplication of civil war in Syria\n\nThe devastating civil war has set the country decades behind in terms of economic, social and human development.\n\nSyria\u2019s GDP today is less than half of what it was before the war started and it could take two decades or more for the country to return to its pre-conflict GDP levels. Most of the people in the region are living below poverty line.\nMore than 250,000 Syrians have lost their lives in five years of armed conflict, millions of innocent people have got injured in the conflict and 80% of the children are harmed by the civil war.\nLarge-scale human displacement from Syria has resulted in Global Refugee Crisis. Approximately 6.5 million people are internally displaced inside Syria, 1.2 million were driven from their homes in 2015 alone.\nWidespread damage to physical infrastructures such as roads, bridges, schools, power generation, and water supply. Reconstructing damaged physical infrastructure will be a monumental task.\nSyrian Crisis and India\n\nIndia has had good relations with Syria historically, but India has always taken a neutral stand to Assad\u2019s regime.\nIndia has a substantial interest in the field of trade and investment, Diaspora, remittances, and energy security in the region.\nDue to the Syrian Crisis, India had to abandon its oil investments in Syria. Though India has not much dependency on Syria for her energy needs, the political stability in the entire West Asian region is very important for India.\nMore than 7 million Indians are working in these countries and therefore the stability of the region should be India\u2019s priority.\nRecently India abstained from voting on a United Nations General Assembly resolution demanding an immediate ceasefire in Syria. By doing so India was trying to balance both US and Russia. However, as India work towards a permanent seat in UN Security Council, India should deviate from its path of non-alignment and should take a decisive stand on global affairs like Syrian Crisis.\nSyrian Crisis: The Way ahead\nThe outside powers that are involved in Syria\u2019s civil war through proxy means need to reconsider their decision. Their role in converting a peaceful democratic movement into full-fledged war should be condemned. They should stop financing the extremist groups to avoid further conflicts in the region.\nThe two major powers US and USSR, instead of reviving a cold war era, should engage in constructive negotiations with the Syrian government to find an amicable They should provide support to establish a democratically elected Government.\nThe Syrian government should be ready for a dialogue on Syria\u2019s future with the non-jihadist opposition groups.\nConsidering the large scale devastation which happened in Syria, rebuilding it\u2019s human and social capital will be an insurmountable task for the govt. Therefore the international community should come forward with a helping hand to bring the war-torn nation into normalcy. India can also play a constructive humanitarian role to establish peace and stability in the region.\n\nAlso read: Children and Armed Conflict\n\nReferences:\nCBBC Newsround\nWikipedia\nScroll.in\nThe Hindu\n\u00a0Wikipedia\nThe Atlantic\nThe Diplomat\n\nArticle by: Sree Resmi S"
