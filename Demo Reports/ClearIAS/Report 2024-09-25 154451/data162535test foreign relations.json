            "[CONTENT]": "Eliminating the hesitations of history, India and the United States have built a strong and strategic bilateral relationship and continues to contribute the stability and prosperity of the world. The first Prime Minister of India Jawaharlal Nehru likened American Imperialism to that of British.\n\nHe propounded and propagated the Non-Alignment Principle whereby India refused to join either the capitalistic US or the communist Soviet Union.\n\nIndia\u2019s socialistic economic principles and deep scepticism to the US hegemony resulted in its predilections towards USSR much to the ire of the West. As the ideological Cold War ended after a myriad of international convergences and divergences, India was forced to look West given the paradigm shift in the geopolitics of the world and in Francis Fukuyama\u2019s words \u201cEnd of History\u201d. Today both India and US are among the most vibrant foreign cohorts and strategic partners.\n\nTable of Contents\n\nIndia-USA: History of Relations\nWhy India Matters to the USA?\nWhy the United States matters to India?\nIndia-USA: Five Pillars of Strategic Partnership\nIndia-US Civil Nuclear Deal\nTerms of the deal:\nFive developments in the India-US relations since the deal:\nControversial issues with the deal:\nThe Civil Liability for Nuclear Damage Bill, 2010\nHow have U.S. concerns over the CLND Act then been resolved?\nIndia-US Trade Relations\nIndia-US Defence Cooperation\nIndia-US: Cooperation in Energy and Climate Change\nIndia-US: Cooperation in Education\nIndia-US: People to People Contacts\nIndia-USA: History of Relations\nThe birth of Indian Republic was accompanied by Pakistan\u2019s occupation of Kashmir. Nehru\u2019s efforts to garner support from the international community was fruitless.\nIndia declined the American offer to accept a seat at the United Nations Security Council and rather pushed for the membership of the People\u2019s Republic of China which it has immediately recognized as a sovereign nation. (Reference \u2013 TheHindu)\nIn the year 1950, India abstained from a US-sponsored resolution calling for UN\u2019s military involvement in the Korean War. India even voted against UN forces crossing the 38th Parallel and naming China as an aggressor.\n1955: Pakistan officially aligned with the United States via the South East Asian Treaty Organization (SEATO) and Central Treaty Organization (CEATO) also known as Baghdad Pact. Meanwhile, India, being the chief proponent of Non-Alignment Movement (NAM), held the first Afro-Asian Conference at Bandung, Indonesia.\nThe rogue state of Pakistan became an important ally to the US in the containment of the Soviet Union, giving rise to strategic complications with India.\nIn the Sino-Indian war of 1962, the US extended help to India against China\u2019s belligerence by sending an American carrier- The Enterprise- to the Bay of Bengal. China, however, had declared unilateral ceasefire the next day. Indian leaders and public welcomed American intervention.\n1966: In response to India\u2019s criticism of the US intervention in Vietnam, President Lyndon B. Johnson restricted the supply of grain shipments to India under Public Law 480 programme.\n1967: A predominantly Anti-American worldview led India to reject a founding membership\u00a0in the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN).\n1968: India rejected the Non-Proliferation Treaty (NPT) proposed by the world\u2019s leading nuclear powers.\n1971: The USA had maintained a studious silence on Pakistan\u2019s repressive policies in East Pakistan. The then Secretary of State Henry Kissinger visited Delhi to make India comply to not support liberation movements in East Pakistan. Indira Gandhi\u2019s intransigence was met with diplomatic muscle-flexing. Next month, India signed a Treaty of Friendship, Peace and Cooperation with the Soviet Union, seen as a blatant shift from India\u2019s Non-Alignment policies. US President Richard Nixon in a retaliatory move chose to explicitly tilt American policy in favour of Pakistan and suspended $87 million worth of economic aid to India. American naval fleet USS Enterprise traversed the Bay of Bengal, issuing mild threats. India won the Bangladesh Liberation War as the Pakistani Army embarrassingly surrendered more than 90,000 troops.\n1974: India conducted its first nuclear weapon test at Pokhran, and it came as a major jolt to the USA who made plans to upgrade its presence at Diego Garcia, a British-controlled island in the Indian ocean.\n1975: India faced considerable domestic turmoil and entered into a state of Emergency.\n1977: The Emergency ended and the US immediately eased restrictions it has placed on World Bank loans to India and approved direct economic assistance of $60 million.\n1978: US President Jimmy Carter and Indian Prime Minister Desai exchanged visits to each other\u2019s nations.\nThe 1980s: Large amounts of military aid was pumped into Pakistan by the USA in order to fight a proxy against the Soviet Union in Afghanistan. This created significant repercussions in the internal security of India as the Pakistani mujahedeen fighters infiltrated into Kashmir as militants.\n1988: Prime Minister Rajiv Gandhi made a historic visit to China which led to normalization of relations between India and China.\n1990: India hesitatingly provided a brief logistical support for American military operations in the Gulf War.\nPost-1991: The Soviet Union disintegrated into independent nations and the United States emerged as the single largest hegemon, making the world unipolar. It coincided with India opening doors to foreign private capital in its historic Liberalization, Privatization, and Globalization move.\nTrade between India and the US grew dramatically and is flourishing today.\nWhy India Matters to the USA?\nIndia is an indispensable partner for the United States. Geographically, it sits between the two most immediate problematic regions for U.S. national interests. The arc of instability that begins in North Africa goes through the Middle East, and proceeds to Pakistan and Afghanistan ends at India\u2019s western border.\nThe Indian landmass juts into the ocean that bears its name. With the rise of Asian economies, the Indian Ocean is home to critical global lines of communication, with perhaps 50 percent of world container products and up to 70 percent of ship-borne oil and petroleum traffic transiting through its waters.\nIndia\u2019s growing national capabilities give it ever greater tools to pursue its national interests to the benefit of the United States. India has the world\u2019s third-largest Army, fourth-largest Air Force, and fifth largest Navy. All three of these services are modernizing, and the Indian Air Force and Indian Navy have world-class technical resources, and its Army is seeking more of them.\nIndia is an important U.S. partner in international efforts to prevent the further spread of weapons of mass destruction.\nIndia\u2019s broad diplomatic ties globally (most importantly in the Middle East), its aspirations for United Nations (UN) Security Council permanent membership, and its role in international organizations such as the International Atomic Energy Agency makes New Delhi an especially effective voice in calls to halt proliferation.\nIndia\u2019s position against radicalism and terrorism corresponds with that of the United States.\nIndia\u2019s English-speaking and Western-oriented elite and middle classes comfortably partner with their counterparts in U.S. firms and institutions, including more than 2.8 million Indian Americans. The U.S. higher education system is an incubator of future collaboration, with more than 100,000 Indian students in American universities.\nAs India modernizes and grows it will spend trillions of dollars on infrastructure, transportation, energy production and distribution, and defence hardware. U.S. firms can benefit immensely by providing expertise and technology that India will need to carry out this sweeping transformation.\nIndia-USA cooperation is critical to global action against climate change.\nIndia is genuinely committed to a world order based on multilateral institutions and cooperation and the evolution of accepted international norms leading to accepted international law.\nIndian culture and diplomacy have generated goodwill in its extended neighbourhood. New Delhi has positive relations with critical states in the Middle East, in Central Asia, in Southeast Asia, and with important middle powers such as Brazil, South Africa, and Japan\u2014all of the strategic value to the United States. India\u2019s soft power is manifest in wide swaths of the world where its civil society has made a growing and positive impression.\nIndian democracy has prospered despite endemic poverty; extraordinary ethnic, religious, and linguistic diversity; and foreign and internal conflicts.\nWhy the United States matters to India?\n\nAmerica remains the critical stabilizing force in Asia through its military and diplomatic power projection and commitments to the region.\nThe twentieth century bore witness to a multigeneration U.S. efforts to prevent the emergence of any hostile hegemon on the Eurasian landmass, a function that the United States continues to fulfil today with the help of its Asian partners.\nChina has chosen episodically to ignore global nonproliferation norms, a pattern of behaviour that the United States has assiduously sought to curtail. Though no nation can a priori prevent future Chinese proliferation activities, only a U.S.-led international effort has any chance of success.\nIndia will be better able to protect its national interests in Pakistan and Afghanistan in coordination with the United States.\nThe United States will continue to be important for India\u2019s economic success. India\u2019s economy has been built around unleashing domestic consumption rather than relying on exports.\nThe United States has also remained one of the top sources of foreign direct investment in India, bringing important managerial expertise, capital, and technology with it to the dynamic Indian market.\nThe United States has a long-term commitment to maintain security and freedom of navigation on the high seas, something critical to India as a net energy importer.\nWashington retains unparalleled power and influence in global governance institutions.\nAs India seeks a larger role in the UN Security Council and international monetary institutions, U.S. support for India will be critical to reforms that benefit New Delhi\u2019s national interests.\nThe United States retains a sizable technological edge on many commercials, aerospace, and defence technologies, the access to which benefits Indian national interests as well as Indian firms and customers.\nIndia-USA: Five Pillars of Strategic Partnership\nStrategic Issues\nEnergy and Climate Change\nScience and Technology\nHealth and Innovation\nEducation and Development\nIndia-US Civil Nuclear Deal\n\nThe deal is seen as a watershed in India-USA relations and introduces a new aspect to international nonproliferation efforts. Since July 18, 2005, the deal lifts a three-decade U.S. moratorium on nuclear trade with India. It provides U.S. assistance to India\u2019s civilian nuclear energy program and expands India-USA cooperation in energy and satellite technology.\n\nTerms of the deal:\nIndia agrees to allow inspectors from the International Atomic Energy Association (IAEA), the United Nations\u2019 nuclear watchdog group, access to its civilian nuclear program. By March 2006, India promised to place\u00a0fourteen of its twenty-two power reactors\u00a0under IAEA safeguards permanently.\nIndia commits to signing an\u00a0Additional Protocol (PDF)-which allows more intrusive IAEA inspections of its civilian facilities.\nIndia agrees to continue its moratorium on nuclear weapons testing.\nIndia commits to strengthening the security of its nuclear arsenals.\nIndia works toward negotiating a\u00a0Fissile Material Cutoff Treaty (FMCT) with the United States banning the production of fissile material for weapons purposes. India agrees to prevent the spread of enrichment and reprocessing technologies to states that don\u2019t possess them and to support international nonproliferation efforts.\nUS companies will be allowed to build nuclear reactors in India and provide nuclear fuel for its civilian energy program.\n\nAn approval by the Nuclear Suppliers Group lifting the ban on India has also cleared the way for other countries to make nuclear fuel and technology sales to India. India would be eligible to buy U.S. dual-use nuclear technology, including materials and equipment that could be used to enrich uranium or reprocess plutonium, potentially creating the material for nuclear bombs. It would also receive imported fuel for its nuclear reactors.\n\nAshley Tellis\u00a0of the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace-who was intimately involved in negotiating the civil nuclear agreement with India as a senior adviser to the U.S. undersecretary of state for political affairs\u2013said in\u00a0congressional testimony in 2005 that the deal recognizes this growing relationship by engaging India, which has proven it is not a nuclear proliferation risk.

If Delhi was prevented by law from importing anything for its nuclear programme over the last few decades, it is boosting atomic power generation in India through imported uranium and is negotiating with multiple vendors for the purchase of new reactors.\nThe US has become India\u2019s largest trading partner in goods and services, and the two sides have set an ambitious goal of half a trillion dollars for future trade. The growing commercial engagement has been reinforced by an intensification of people-to-people contact and the presence of the 3 million strong Indian diasporas in America.\nCooperation on counter-terrorism and intelligence-sharing have expanded rapidly over the last decade. The US has become one of India\u2019s major suppliers of arms, and the two sides are discussing ideas that would once have been dismissed as inconceivable \u2014 for example, US support in the development of India\u2019s next-generation aircraft carrier.\nIn refusing to extend the civil nuclear initiative to Islamabad, Washington removed the hyphen in its relations with Delhi and Islamabad. Since 2005, America has also discarded the idea of mediating between India and Pakistan, especially on the Kashmir question.\nWhile traditional differences between Delhi and Washington on global issues have endured, the two sides are now avoiding confrontation in multilateral fora dealing with trade and climate change.\nControversial issues with the deal:\n\nIn March 2006, the U.S. Congress also took up the agreement and formally made it into legislation (Hyde Act) after the committee level deliberations and conciliations in terms of words by both the House and the Senate.\n\nOn 1 August 2007, U.S. and Indian negotiators concluded a separate technical agreement under section 123 of the U.S. Atomic Energy Act, which spells out the precise terms, conditions, responsibilities, obligations and promises that each party undertakes.\n\nAs the Hyde Act had imposed restrictions on how India could utilize U.S. nuclear supplies, the implementation of the agreement has received a setback because of the opposition by the Communist parties that supported India\u2019s UPA government from outside. Leaders of almost all the political parties of India had categorically expressed their dislike and apprehensions for provisions that provided for cutting off aid if India conducts any future nuclear tests and the return of the all nuclear material or equipment provided by U.S. suppliers.\n\nSection 17b in the Civil Liability for Nuclear Damage Bill, 2010 according to which the Operator cannot seek recourse in case of nuclear accidents because of patent or latent defects in the material, equipment and even in the services provided. The US defies it to be against international norms whereas India says that it is according to Convention on Supplementary Compensation.\n\nThe Civil Liability for Nuclear Damage Bill, 2010\nThe Civil Liability for Nuclear Damage (CLND) Bill, 2010 fixes liability for nuclear damage and specifies procedures for compensating victims.\nThe Bill fixes no-fault liability on operators and gives them a right of recourse against certain persons. It caps the liability of the operator at Rs 500 crore.\u00a0 For damage exceeding this amount, and up to 300 million SDR, the central government will be liable.\nAll operators (except the central government) need to take insurance or provide financial security to cover their liability.\nFor facilities owned by the government, the entire liability up to 300 million SDR will be borne by the government.\nThe Bill specifies who can claim compensation and the authorities who will assess and award compensation for nuclear damage.\nThose not complying with the provisions of the Bill can be penalized.\n\nAnalysis of the Bill and further issues:\n\nThe liability cap on the operator:\n\n(a) may be inadequate to compensate victims in the event of a major nuclear disaster;\n\n(b) may block India\u2019s access to an international pool of funds;\n\n(c) is low compared to some other countries.\n\nThe cap on the operator\u2019s liability is not required if all plants are owned by the government. It is not clear if the government intends to allow private operators to operate nuclear power plants.\nThe extent of environmental damage and consequent economic loss will be notified by the government. This might create a conflict of interest in cases where the government is also the party liable to pay compensation.\nThe right of recourse against the supplier provided in the Bill is not compliant with international agreements India may wish to sign.\nThe time-limit of ten years for claiming compensation may be inadequate for those suffering from nuclear damage.\nThough the Bill allows operators and suppliers to be liable under other laws, it is not clear which other laws will be applicable. Different interpretations by courts may constrict or unduly expand the scope of such a provision.\n\nThe understanding reached with the United States on January 25, 2015, during the visit of President Obama to India:\n\nIndia and the United States have reached an understanding on the issues related to civil nuclear liability and finalized the text of the Administrative Arrangement to implement the September 2008 bilateral 123 Agreement. This will allow us to move towards commercial negotiations on setting up reactors with international collaboration in India and realize the significant economic and clean energy potential of the civil nuclear understanding of 2005-2008.\n\nThere is no proposal to amend the Civil Liability for Nuclear Damage Act of 2010 Act or the Rules.\n\nHow have U.S. concerns over the CLND Act then been resolved?\n\nDuring the course of the discussions in the Contact Group, using case law and legislative history, the Indian side presented its position concerning the compatibility of the Civil Liability for Nuclear Damage (CLND) Act and the Convention on Supplementary Compensation for Nuclear Damage (CSC). The idea of the India Nuclear Insurance Pool as a part of the overall risk-management scheme for liability was also presented to the U.S. side. Based on the presentations by the Indian side, and the discussion thereon, there is a general understanding that India\u2019s CLND law is compatible with the CSC, which India has signed and intends to ratify.\n\nIndia-US Trade Relations\nThere are more than 50 bilateral dialogue mechanisms between the two governments.\nIndia-USA bilateral trade in goods and services increased from $104 billion in 2014 to $114 billion in 2016.\nBoth countries have made a commitment to facilitate actions necessary for increasing the bilateral trade to $500 billion.\nIn June 2016, Prime Minister Modi and President Obama pledged to explore new opportunities to break down barriers to the movement of goods and services, and support deeper integration into global supply chains, thereby creating jobs and generating prosperity in both economies.\nThe U.S. is the fifth largest source of foreign direct investments into India.\nAmong large Indian corporations having investments in the U.S. include Reliance Industries Limited, Tata Consultancy Services, Wipro, Essar America, Piramal, Mahindra, Lupin, Sun Pharma, etc.\nThere are several dialogue mechanisms to strengthen bilateral engagement on economic and trade issues, including a Ministerial Level Economic and Financial Partnership and a Ministerial Trade Policy Forum. For greater involvement of private sector in the discussions on issues involving trade and investment, there is a bilateral India-USA CEO\u2019s Forum.\nIndia and the US have set up a bilateral Investment Initiative in 2014, with a special focus on facilitating FDI, portfolio investment, capital market development and financing of infrastructure.\nUS firms will be lead partners in developing Allahabad, Ajmer and Vishakhapatnam as Smart Cities.\nIndia-US Defence Cooperation\n\nDefence relationship has emerged as a major pillar of India-USA strategic partnership with the signing of \u2018New Framework for India-U.S. Defense Relations\u2019 in 2005 and the resulting intensification in defence trade, joint exercises, personnel exchanges, collaboration and cooperation in maritime security and counter-piracy, and exchanges between each of the three services.\nIndia participated in Rim of the Pacific (RIMPAC) exercise in July-August 2016.\nThe agreements signed during the past one year include:\nLogistics Exchange Memorandum of Association (LEMOA)\nFuel Exchange Agreement\nTechnical Agreement (TA) on information sharing on White (merchant) Shipping\nInformation Exchange Annexe (IEA) on Aircraft Carrier Technologies\n\nPending agreements are:\n\nCommunication and Information Security Memorandum of Agreement (CISMOA)\nBasic Exchange and Cooperation Agreement (BECA)\nIndia-US: Cooperation in Energy and Climate Change\nThe India-USA Energy Dialogue was launched in May 2005 to promote trade and investment in the energy sector.\nThere are six working groups in oil and gas, coal, power and energy efficiency, new technologies and renewable energy, civil nuclear co-operation and sustainable development under the Energy Dialogue.\nAs a priority initiative under the PACE (Partnership to Advance Clean Energy), the U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) and the Government of India have established the Joint Clean Energy Research and Development Center (JCERDC) designed to promote clean energy innovations by teams of scientists from India and the United States, with a total joint committed funding from both Governments of US$ 50 million.\nIndia-US: Cooperation in Education\n\nIndia is learning from the U.S. experience in community colleges in order to meet our demands for skill-development. It has been agreed to collaborate with U.S. institutions in the area of Technology Enabled Learning and Massive Open Online Courses (MOOCs) to extend the reach of education in India. Under the Global Initiative of Academic Networks (GIAN) launched by India, up to 1000 American academics will be invited and hosted each year to teach in Indian universities at their convenience. The two sides are also collaborating to establish a new Indian Institute of Technology in Ahmedabad.\n\nIndia-US: People to People Contacts\n\nThe 3.5-million-plus strong Indian American community is an important ethnic group in the U.S., accounting for about 1% of the total population in the country. Indian American community includes a large number of professionals, business entrepreneurs and educationalists with increasing influence in the society. The two countries have been working together to facilitate travel of their respective citizens, and to this end, an MOU has been signed in June 2016 to facilitate India\u2019s joining of the Global Entry Programme for expedited immigration for eligible Indian citizens at U.S. airports.\n\nIt appears highly likely that in strategic, political, security, defence and economic terms, relations between India and the USA will continue their upward trajectory under President Trump. Impact of USA\u2019s relations with Pakistan over India is likely to be beneficial and positive. Geopolitical manoeuvres can have significant impact on India-USA relations, however, it would remain to be multi-faceted and an \u201cindispensable partnership\u201d.\n\nAlso read: How To Study Foreign Relations of India For UPSC Mains?\n\nArticle by: Mausam Bharati\u00a0"

This region which originally was a part of the state of Jammu and Kashmir is claimed by China as part of its autonomous Xinjiang region. After the 1962 war, it was administered by China. It is the second largest Indo-China border area covering over 38000 sq. km. However, it is an uninhabited land. While India claims the entire Aksai Chin territory as well as the Shaksgam valley (Indian territory gifted to China by Pakistan-See Note), China contests Indian control over Daulat Beg Oldi (a tehsil in Leh, south of Aksai China is believed to host the world\u2019s highest airstrip)\nCentral Sector \u2013 UNDISPUTED \u2013 Although China has recognized India\u2019s sovereignty over Sikkim and had initiated the trade at Nathu La pass, the Doklam fiasco could mean trouble at all ends.\nEastern Sector \u2013 DISPUTED \u2013 The Arunachal Pradesh border that China still claims to be its territory is the largest disputed area, covering around 90000 sq. km. It was formally called the North East Frontier Agency. During the 1962 war, the People\u2019s Liberation Army occupied it but they announced a unilateral ceasefire and withdrew respecting the international boundary (McMahon Line). However, it has continued to assert its claim over the territory. Nowadays, almost the whole of Arunachal is claimed by China. (Note: This is the reason why the visit of Dalai Lama to Tawang Monastery became such a contentious bilateral issue)\n\nNote: Sino-Pakistani Border Agreement: China and Pakistan have an agreement known as the Sino-Pakistani border agreement, which cedes a part of the Pakistani-administered Kashmir region, Shaksgam Valley, to China. India has raised concerns about this agreement, as it affects its claims in the region.\n\nJohnson Line vs McDonald Line\n\nThe two nations have held on to their stands even on the Johnson line and McDonald line which demarcates the territories of the two.\nJohnson Line \u2013 India\u2019s accepted demarcation \u2013 It marks Aksai Chin as an Indian territory\nMcDonald Line \u2013 China\u2019s stance \u2013 It marks Aksai Chin as a Chinese territory\nThe India-China War of 1962\nThe pretext of the war was a dispute over the sovereignty of the Aksai Chin and Arunachal Pradesh.\nBut, in reality, there were many reasons and the prominent one was China\u2019s perception of India as a threat to its rule of Tibet.\nThe war was preceded by various conflicts and military incidents between India and China throughout the summer of 1962.\nThen on October 20, 1962, the People\u2019s Liberation Army (PLA) of China invaded India in Ladakh and across the McMahon line in Arunachal Pradesh.\nUntil the start of the war, India was confident that a war would not happen and made little preparations.\nAfter a month-long War, China unilaterally declared a ceasefire on 19 November 1962. By then China had made significant advances on both fronts. \u00a0India suffered a huge setback and was badly defeated.\nChina achieved its objective of acquiring control in the Aksai Chin. \u00a0In the eastern sector, their troops went back to the north of the McMahon line.\n\nAlso read: Assam-Meghalaya Border Dispute: Recent Developments\n\nIndia-China border conflicts after the war\nThere have been several instances of Chinese troops entering the Indian side and Indian troops entering the Chinese side.\nStill, the Indo-China border has remained largely peaceful, except in 1967 when there were two incidents of armed conflict first at Nathu La and then at Cho La.\nThe 1975 Sikkim merger, when Sikkim became an Indian state, led to changes in the eastern sector.\nThe 1987 Sino-Indian skirmish in the Sumdorong Chu Valley in Arunachal Pradesh.\nThe 2017 Doklam standoff, was a military standoff involving India, China, and Bhutan in the Doklam plateau, near the tri-junction of the three countries.\nAgreements and initiatives to resolve the border disputes\n\nShimla Agreement of 1914:\u00a0To demarcate the boundary between Tibet and North East India, a convention was held at Shimla in 1914, representatives of all three i.e. Tibet, China, and British India. After the discussion, the agreement was signed by British India and Tibet but not by the Chinese officials. Presently India recognizes the McMahon line, as agreed by the Shimla convention, as the legal boundary between India and China. However, China rejected the Shimla agreement and the McMahon line, contending that Tibet was not a sovereign state and therefore did not have the power to conclude treaties.\nPanchsheel Agreement of 1954: The Panchsheel doctrine indicated the willingness to \u2018Respect each other\u2019s sovereignty and territorial integrity\u2019. Although we have come a long way since, from the 1962 war to the cold peace era of 1962-1989, to the revived tensions of the present, the intent of the doctrine was well directed. It must have acted as a safeguard against any such disputes arising in the first place.\n\u00a0In 1989, India formed a Joint Working Group for Confidence Building Measures (CBMs)\u00a0and agreed to mutually settle all border disputes.\nIndia-China Agreements regarding the Line of Actual Control (LAC): The LAC is the effective military border that separates Indian-controlled areas of Jammu and Kashmir from Aksai Chin. It is to be noted that this border is not a legally recognized international boundary, but rather it is a practical boundary. Conventionally, India considers the Johnson line of 1865, marked by a civil servant W.H. Johnson, which put Aksai Chin in Jammu and Kashmir. On the other hand, China recognizes the Macartney-Macdonald Line as the actual boundary which puts Aksai Chin in the Xinjiang region of China. In 1993, when the then Prime Minister Narasimha Rao visited China, \u2018The Agreement for Maintenance of Peace and Tranquillity along the LAC\u2018\u00a0was signed between India and China. In 1996 an agreement took place on confidence-building measures\u00a0in the military field along the LAC.\nIn 2003 India and China signed a Declaration on Principles for Relations and Comprehensive Cooperation and also mutually decided to appoint Special Representatives to explore the framework of a boundary settlement from the political perspective. The India-China relations received a major boost in 2003. China recognized India\u2019s sovereignty over Sikkim. This was also followed by a framework of Guiding principles and political parameters to improve bilateral ties. It proposed a three-step resolution to the border disputes:\na. A bilateral agreement on the laid down principles.\nb. This was to be followed by an exchange of maps between the two countries.\nc. Once satisfied with the markings, the final demarcation of borders was to take place.\nIn 2005 a protocol was agreed on Modalities for the implementation of Confidence Building Measures in the Military field along the LAC.\nIn 2012 India and China agreed on the establishment of a working mechanism for Consultation and Coordination on India China borders.\n\nThe policies have not sufficed in realizing a solution to the long-standing disputes. A status quo exists owing to the face-off between the differential aspirations of the two nations. While China\u2019s support for the resolution of border disputes stands subservient to the Tibet issue, India would continue to hold on to the Tibet card unless the border disputes are resolved.\n\nBesides, the changing global and regional picture \u2013 from China\u2019s move towards \u2018assertive regionalism\u2019, it is strengthening ties with Pakistan and its complete disregard for counter-opinions on contentious issues like the South-China Sea \u2013 has only worsened the chances of a quick resolution.\n\nWhat is the Doklam issue?\n\nThe offensive stand of China on Doko La (Doklam) and India\u2019s strong warning in return, is the latest addition to the worries that spoil Indo-China relations.\nIt started when India (Indian Army) objected to road construction by the People\u2019s Liberation Army (PLA) of China in the Doklam plateau which China claims to be a part of its Donglang region. However, India and Bhutan recognize it as Doklam, a Bhutan territory.\nLater, China accused Indian troops of entering its territory and India accused the Chinese of destroying its bunkers (People\u2019s Liberation Army bulldozed an old bunker of the Indian army stationed in Doklam).\nThereafter China stopped the passage of pilgrims heading toward Kailash-Mansarovar through the Nathu La pass, Sikkim. The route is a better alternative to the Lepu Lekh route via Uttarakhand and was opened for pilgrims in 2015.\nHereafter, both India and China increased the presence of their troops and since then there has been a war of words especially from the Chinese state media.\nAlthough a military standoff was averted, diplomatic negotiations have not yielded many results to cool off the passions across the border.\nWhy is Doklam so critical?\n\nDoklam (Zhoglam or Droklam or Donglang) is a narrow plateau lying in the tri-junction of India, China, and Bhutan.\nChina believes Doklam to be a disputed territory between Bhutan and China.\nIt, therefore, contests the presence of the Indian army in the region as a transgression.\nThe disputed region is very close to India\u2019s Siliguri Corridor which connects the seven northeastern states to the Indian mainland.\nWhy is India supporting Bhutan in the Doklam issue?\n\nBhutan and India have a very cordial relationship as Bhutan and China do not have formal relations.\n\nBhutan has a very strategic position considering India\u2019s geography.\nTo foster the relationship, India and Bhutan signed a \u2018Friendship Treaty\u2019 in 2007 that commits India to protect Bhutan\u2019s interests and the close coordination between the two militaries.\nAlso, India is worried that if the road is completed, it will give China greater access to India\u2019s strategically vulnerable \u201cchicken\u2019s neck\u201d (Siliguri Corridor) that links the seven northeastern states to the Indian mainland.\n\nAlso read:\u00a0India-Bhutan-China Relations\n\nIs the Indian border ready to face challenges?\nIndia is far ahead of what it was in 1962, both militarily as well as infra-structurally. However, to undermine China would be to relive the fallacies that led to the 1962 war.\nThe \u2018Theory of asymmetry\u2019 does not hold ground when dealing with China. Therefore, a rational policy of dialogue is essential. Along with that, seeking gains on the work that has already been done must be the target.\n\n(Note: Theory of Asymmetry is an approach of capitalizing on the huge asymmetry in resources by the major party, followed by a show of magnanimity and conciliation. While this approach is a possibility when dealing with Pakistan, it can\u2019t be the way forward in the case of China)\n\nDrawbacks\n\nContrasting the border readiness of the two, for instance, we see stark distinctions, more often, revealing a Chinese upper hand.\nAs of now, only 21 of the proposed 73 roads have been developed by India for the Indo-China border (Also the revised target is now 2020 instead of the original target, 2012).\nChina, on the other hand, developed and still developing its borders under the pretext of CPEC, OBOR, or even otherwise (as in the case of Doklam). This exposes how we are lagging in the connectivity of our border posts.\nThe \u2018Mountain Strike Corps\u2019 of India, specifically proposed to be raised to check the Chinese influence, has a strength that is much less than the proposed strength. Along with that, the force is not yet equipped with the advanced armories that were envisioned for them.\n\nAdvantages\n\nThe recent initiatives including the Dhola-Sadiya bridge (Bhupen Hazarika Setu-9.2km-Connects Assam with Arunachal Pradesh) are a welcome step as they help bring down the travel time and as such, a military response time as well.\nA Brahmos cruise missile regiment is being deployed in Arunachal Pradesh. This signals Indian intentions to China, which finds every opportunity to reiterate its sanction over the territory.\nMany abandoned airstrips in India are also being reactivated. Though thought-provoking, it is a step in the right direction.\nIndia-China: Other Bilateral Issues\n\nThe recent standoff is seen as a culmination of several disagreements between India and China and the relations between the two sides have soured in the last 2-3 years. A few of them are:\n\nIndia\u2019s entry into the UNSC and the NSG: China has been opposing India\u2019s entry into the United Nations Security Council (UNSC) and the Nuclear Supplier\u2019s Group (NSG).\nIndia\u2019s opposition to the OBOR: India has been opposing China\u2019s flagship \u2018One Belt One Road\u2019 (OBOR) initiative\u2018, as the \u2018China Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC)\u2018, a part of OBOR, passes through the Pakistan-Occupied Kashmir (POK) and acceding to OBOR would mean undermining India\u2019s sovereignty.\n\u00a0Strengthening of India-USA relations: China is critical of India-USA relations and it is not merely a coincidence that the escalation at the tri-junction coincided with the Indian Prime Minister\u2019s visit to the United States. India supports the US and other countries in reaffirming the freedom of navigation in international waters, which includes the South China Sea. Along with this, the \u2018MALABAR Naval exercise\u2019 between India, Japan, and the USA is also a matter of worry for China.\nIssue of Tibet and Dalai Lama: The fact that Tibet\u2019s spiritual leader Dalai Lama lives in India is a tension area in India-China relations. The recent visit of the Dalai Lama to Arunachal Pradesh has been a matter of conflict between the two sides.\nIssue of Masood Azhar: India\u2019s bid to get Jaish-e-Mohammad chief Masood Azhar to be declared as a UN-designated terrorist has been blocked by China again and again. China is the only country among the 15 members UNSC to have opposed the ban. China is of the view that India is trying to pursue political gains in the name of counter-terrorism.\n\nRead:\u00a0China-Tibet issue\n\nWay forward\n\nFrom the recent incidents, although the possibility of an India-China armed conflict cannot be ruled out, any kind of military conflict is not in the interest of any country. The need of the hour is realizing that our \u2018strategic partnership\u2019 could serve us both and help see Asia emerge as the core of the world economy. This dream of the \u2018India-China Millennium of Exceptional Synergies\u2019 that the Prime Minister envisions, however, needs magnanimity and willingness on the part of both nations.\n\nEfforts to resolve the India-China border disputes have been ongoing for decades through diplomatic negotiations. Various rounds of border talks and agreements have been held to manage tensions and prevent escalations. However, a final resolution of the border disputes remains elusive, and the situation along the Line of Actual Control can be tense and prone to periodic flare-ups.\n\nBoth India and China recognize the importance of maintaining peace and stability along their border, and diplomatic channels remain open to seek peaceful resolutions to the disputes.\n\nRelated Posts:\n\nSecurity Challenges and Their Management in Border Areas\nCross-Border Insolvency\nIndia\u2019s Connectivity Projects\nCarbon Border Adjustment Mechanism (CBAM)\nRedrawal of National Boundaries\n\nContributors: Deepak Kaushik and Shuja Shabir"

In this post, let\u2019s analyse the new developments in India-France relations.\n\nTable of Contents\n\nHistory of India-France Relations\nThe strategic partnership between India and France\nThe strategic interests: background\nIndia- France: Indo-Pacific region Interests\nIndia- France: Defence Cooperation\nMajor defence projects\nIndia- France: Space Cooperation\nIndia- France: Civil Nuclear Cooperation\nIndia- France: Other areas of cooperation\nTerrorism\nEnvironment\nUrbanisation\nCultural Cooperation\nEconomic relation\nMacron\u2019s visit\nChallenges in India-France Relations\nStrategic relations\nEnvironment\nNuclear cooperation\nDefence\nIndia-France Relations: The Future\u2026\nHistory of India-France Relations\nThe French came as traders to India in the 17th century. However, they had colonial aspirations, which resulted in the ruling of certain territories like Puducherry.\nThings have changed, and colonialism has ended. Now Puducherry is a popular tourist destination for French travellers to India.\nThe political, commercial and cultural contacts, then established, were maintained throughout the 19th century. Diplomatic relations between the two countries were established after the Independence of India.\u00a0 Since then, cooperation has developed in all the major areas.\nThough France was always sensitive to India\u2019s claim for its unique stature in the world due to its rich civilization, the Cold War impeded the deepening of the relationship. After the Cold War, the relationship progressed through many landmark agreements like the Strategic Partnership Agreement 1998 and the Civil Nuclear Agreement 2008.\nFormer French president Fran\u00e7ois Hollande was the chief guest in Republic Day celebrations in 2016 thus making France the only country to be invited a record-setting 5 times to Republic Day celebrations.\nCooperation in fields of nuclear, space, counter-terrorism, defence, urbanization, culture, etc. have grown in recent decades.\nPresident Emmanuel Macron\u2019s visit in 2018 cemented the regional dimension of the strategic partnership between the two countries.\nThe strategic partnership between India and France\n\nOn the basis of this old bond of trust, France and India decided to take a new step by establishing a strategic partnership in 1998. With the establishment of this partnership, there has been significant progress in all areas of bilateral cooperation through regular high-level exchanges at the Head of State/Head of Government levels. The growing cooperation and exchanges include strategic areas such as defence, counter-terrorism, nuclear energy and space.\n\nThe strategic interests: background\n\nDuring the Cold War time, France was weary of subordinating its foreign policy to that of the US. India was also pursuing NAM thus not succumbing to either super-powers.\n\nAfter the end of the Cold War, both India and France favoured a multipolar world order as they were sceptic of US hegemony.\n\nFrance termed the US as hyper-power\nFrance was the first P-5 country to support Indian membership in the UNSC\nThey signed a strategic partnership in 1998\nFrance supports India\u2019s membership of Multilateral Export Control regimes, viz. NSG and MTCR.\nFrance\u2019s support was vital in India\u2019s accession to MTCR in 2016.\nIndia- France: Indo-Pacific region Interests\n\nFrench islands \u00a0\u2013 R\u00e9union and Mayotte in the Indian Ocean and New Caledonia and French Polynesia in the South Pacific \u2013 make France a stakeholder in the region.\n\nBut the regional dimension to the strategic partnership remains dormant as India was reluctant to join hands with any other power, especially Western powers in the Indo-Pacific region due to its cold war legacy of NAM.\nThis equation changed with the rise of Chinese clout in the region and the simultaneous decline of American hegemony in the region.\nThis prompted India to look for like-minded countries to jointly spearhead the security architecture of the region.\nFrance, which has many littoral islands in the region, also looked for partnerships in the region to counter the volatile rise of China.\nBeing middle powers and their mutual wariness to hegemonic power projection, India and France began to see each other as natural allies in the Indo-Pacific region, especially the western Indian Ocean.\nPrime Minister Modi visited France in 2017 and met President Emmanuel Macron and reiterated a strong commitment to further strengthen the India-France strategic partnership. Prime Minister Modi declared India\u2019s unflinching commitment to the Paris Accord. This regional dimension of strategic relations was complemented by other initiatives like ISA. Amidst this background, Emmanuel Macron visited India in 2018.\nIndia- France: Defence Cooperation\n\nSince the 1980s defence cooperation increased as India has been looking to diversify its military procurement to reduce over-reliance on the USSR.\n\nMajor defence projects\n36 Rafale fighter jets through government-to-government deal\nP-75 Scorpene Project: The contract for six Scorpene submarines under technology transfer. The first two submarines Kalvari and Khanderi have been built.\nDassault Reliance Aerospace Limited (DRAL) manufacturing facility at Mihan in Maharashtra. It is a joint venture between French aerospace firm, Dassault Aviation, and India\u2019s Reliance Group and is the first private facility for the production of Rafale fighter jets and Falcon civilian aircraft.\nRegular defence exercises; viz. Exercise Shakti (Army), Exercise Varuna (Navy), Exercise Garuda(Air Force)\nIndia- France: Space Cooperation\nISRO and the French Space Agency (CNES) have been cooperating for many decades.\nFrench launch pads are used by ISRO for their GSLVs: GSAT-17 was launched from Kourou in 2017.\nFrance is a major supplier of components and equipment for the Indian space programme.\nIndia- France: Civil Nuclear Cooperation\nAfter the 1998 nuclear test by India, France was the major nuclear country that understood India\u2019s security compulsions for its nuclear test.\nFrance worked with the US to integrate India into the global nuclear order through an India-specific waiver in NSG.\nFrance was the first country with which India entered into a civil nuclear agreement following the NSG waiver.\nThe General Framework Agreement and the Early Works Agreement between NPCIL and AREVA for the implementation \u00a0Jaitapur Nuclear Power Project (JNPP) were signed in 2010.\nIndia- France: Other areas of cooperation\nTerrorism\nAfter the Paris bomb attacks, both countries increased cooperation on global terrorism.\nFrance supports India\u2019s proposal of a Comprehensive Convention on International Terrorism (CCIT) in the UN.\nDuring former President Hollande\u2019s visit in 2016, India and France issued a Joint Statement on Counter-Terrorism in which they resolved to step up bilateral cooperation in this field.\nEnvironment\nAt the Paris Summit of UNFCC, India and France launched the International Solar Alliance (ISA) which brings together countries between the Tropic of cancer and Tropic of Capricorn for cooperation on solar energy.\nDuring Macron\u2019s visit, both countries decided to form a joint working group to institutionalize cooperation in the conservation of the environment.\nUrbanisation\nIndia and France are cooperating on developing smart cities: Chandigarh, Nagpur, and Puducherry.\nCultural Cooperation\nIndian Council for Cultural Relations\u00a0regularly sends Indian cultural troupes to France.\nPresented the Namaste France cultural festival in France from 15 September to 30 November 2016.\nThe French cultural festival Bonjour India in India will be conducted from November 2017 to February 2018.\nEconomic relation\nIndia\u2019s trade relationship with the EU is mired in many roadblocks which are reflected in the stalled FTA negotiations with the EU. This inertia also affects trade relations with France.\nTrade is highly concentrated in certain niche areas like defence supplies.\nIn the backdrop of Brexit, France can act as an entry point for Indian businesses in Europe.\nMacron\u2019s visit\n\nIn the vision statement on India-France relations, a free Indo-Pacific was emphasized\n\n\ud83d\udc49 Which year are YOU targeting for success in the IAS/IPS/IFS Exam? \ud83d\ude80\n\n(1) \u21d2 UPSC 2025: Prelims cum Mains\n\n(2) \u21d2 UPSC 2026: Prelims cum Mains\n\n(3) \u21d2 UPSC 2027 Prelims cum Mains\n\nTip: Know more about ClearIAS Courses (Online/Offline)\n\nFrance has many littoral islands in the Indo-Pacific region which makes France a major player in the region especially in the west Indian Ocean.\nThe Indian navy has good relations with the US Pacific command which reaches up to the Bay of Bengal. But the US Central Command which is up to the Arabian Sea has good relations with Pakistan. Here India can partner with the French navy (according to Rakesh Sood).\nA Joint vision statement on\u00a0free Indo-Pacific is aimed at countering Chinese hegemony in the region.\nThis vision comes at a time when India is willing to cooperate with other like-minded countries in the Indo-Pacific region shedding its approach of viewing the region as its exclusive backyard.\nFrench military bases in Djibouti, Abu Dhabi, and Reunion Island can be a force multiplier for India, which itself is looking to build naval facilities in Seychelles, Mauritius, and Oman.\n\nEmphasis on ISA, re-commitment to the Jaitapur nuclear plant, and climatic change cooperation. Narendra Modi and Emmanuel Macron inaugurated a solar power plant at Dadar Kala village in Uttar Pradesh:\n\nReactions to the abdication of responsibility by the US on climate change regime.\nThe leadership role in ISA is conceived as providing an alternate leadership for developing countries by challenging the current geopolitical power structure around fossil fuel.\n\nReciprocal logistics support b/w the armed forces:\n\nMessage to US and Russia about restructuring strategic posture in consonance with an age-old commitment to multipolar world order.\n\nThis visit had rekindled the ambition of the two countries to chalk out a plan for a multi-polar rule-based world order.\n\nChallenges in India-France Relations\nStrategic relations\nFrance\u2019s commitment to BRI is in stark contrast to India\u2019s position on the same.\nPresently cooperation on Indo-Pacific is merely symbolic. Need deep coordination between both navies. Reciprocal logistics support is the right step in this direction.\nEnvironment\nThermal power is still feasible and economical than solar in India, so the International Solar Alliance (ISA) will not make much headway in the near future.\nNuclear cooperation\nThe delay in the Jaitapur project is affecting future cooperation on the nuclear front.\nDefence\nDelays and controversies around Rafael\u2019s deal are affecting mutual trust between both nations.\nIndia-France Relations: The Future\u2026\nThe India-France relationship is primarily driven by government-to-government level relations. It\u00a0needs people-to-people and business-to-business relations to deepen the ties.\nFrench infrastructure companies are looking for opportunities in Indian projects especially in smart cities and renewable energy. India should leverage this opportunity by improving the ease of doing business.\nModel Bilateral Investment Treaty of India has drawn sharp criticism from investors, The Government should revisit this by taking into account the concerns of all the stakeholders.\nIndia-France should build on\u00a0reciprocal logistics support agreement to deepen military ties\n14 agreements signed during Macron\u2019s visit covering the whole gamut of issues from space cooperation to sustainable urban development. Both countries should carry forward these commitments consistently to deepen the relationship.\n\nAlso read: India-Greece Relations\n\nArticle by: Sethu\u00a0Krishnan M"

            "[CONTENT]": "India and the UAE enjoy strong bonds of friendship based on civilizational links, age-old maritime trade, and vibrant people-to-people contacts. Close geographical proximity, historical links, cultural affinity, natural synergies, shared aspirations, and common challenges provide further impetus to this robust engagement. In this post let us see the important dimensions of India-UAE relations.\n\nIndia is the UAE\u2019s second-largest trading partner, with the bilateral trade rising to USD 85 billion in 2022-23. In this regard, the leaders of both nations have expressed optimism regarding elevating the bilateral trade to USD 100 billion well ahead of the target year 2030.\n\nIndia-UAE has shared trade links through the centuries which were dominated by traditional items such as dates, pearls, and fish, but underwent a sharp change after the discovery of oil in UAE (oil exports began from Abu Dhabi in 1962).\n\nWith the emergence of the UAE as a unified entity in 1971, exports from India started growing gradually over the years. The real impetus, however, started after Dubai positioned itself as a regional trading hub by the early 1990s and about the same time, the economic liberalization process started in India.\n\nTable of Contents\n\nIndia-UAE Bilateral Relations\nAgreement in international fora\nMiscellaneous areas\nIndia-UAE Commercial Relations\nEnergy Security\nSource of investment\nIndia-UAE Security co-operation\nCultural Relations\nIndia-UAE: Recent developments\nIndia-UAE Relations: Areas of Improvement\nSummary\nIndia-UAE Bilateral Relations\nThe relation, though occasionally marred by UAE support for Pakistan (on the Kashmir issue), has greatly flourished especially after the accession of H. H. Sheikh Zayed Bin Sultan Al Nahyan, as the ruler of Abu Dhabi in 1966, and subsequently with the creation of UAE federation in 1971.\nIt was after 24 years (Indira Gandhi in May 1981), that an Indian PM visited the country (President had visited in November 2010) last year in August 2015. This itself shows the renewed interest Indian foreign establishment is showing in the region; as part of the Link West Policy.\nThe bilateral relationship was in the news for the visit of Abu Dhabi crown prince Sheikh Mohammed Bin Zayed Al Nahyan. The relationship has been elevated to the level of a Comprehensive Strategic Partnership Agreement (CEPA), outlining a roadmap for deepening cooperation.\nAgreement in international fora\n\nThere is increased convergence of ideas based on needs and priorities in different issues of global commons. Collaboration between the two countries happens over issues discussed in the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change, the setting up of the International Solar Alliance, and support to the International Renewable Energy Agency, IRENA.\n\nMiscellaneous areas\n\nUAE and India agreed to further strengthen their cooperation in several key areas, including trade and investment, security, counter-terrorism, joint defense production, space cooperation, IT, and electronics. Active engagement between the UAE Space Agency and the Indian Space Research Organization (ISRO) is in effect, which has led to the signing of a Memorandum of Understanding and the establishment of a Joint Working Group for Space Cooperation.\n\n\ud83d\udc49 Which year are YOU targeting for success in the IAS/IPS/IFS Exam? \ud83d\ude80\n\n(1) \u21d2 UPSC 2025: Prelims cum Mains\n\n(2) \u21d2 UPSC 2026: Prelims cum Mains\n\n(3) \u21d2 UPSC 2027 Prelims cum Mains\n\nTip: Know more about ClearIAS Courses (Online/Offline)\n\nIndia-UAE Commercial Relations\n\nThe age-old maritime trade has evolved into a full-fledged economic and commercial partnership in recent times. Though the trade was valued at $180 million per annum in the 1970s, today around $60 billion worth of goods and services move across the borders, making UAE, India\u2019s third largest trading partner for the year 2014-15 after China and US. Moreover, UAE was the second largest export destination of India with an amount of over US$ 33 billion for the year 2014-15. For UAE, India was the largest trading partner for the year 2013 with an amount of over US$ 36 billion (non-oil trade).\n\nIndia\u2019s major exporting items are Petroleum products; precious metals, stones, gems, and jewelry; minerals; food items (cereals, sugar, fruits & vegetables, tea, meat, and seafood); textiles (garments, apparel, synthetic fiber, cotton, yarn); engineering & machinery products and chemicals.\nIndia\u2019s major importing items are Petroleum and petroleum products; precious metals, stones, gems & jewelry; minerals; chemicals; wood & wood products.\nEnergy Security\n\nConcerning oil trade, the UAE was the sixth-largest source of crude oil for India in 2015. There is an intention for the Abu Dhabi National Oil Company (ADNOC) and the Indian Strategic Petroleum Reserves Ltd. (ISPRL) to sign a Memorandum of Understanding on the Establishment of a Strategic Petroleum Reserve in India and has agreed to conclude negotiations shortly.\n\nSource of investment\n\nConcerning bilateral investments, total FDI from UAE to India is estimated to be US$ 3.01 billion (Jan. 2015) and ranked as the tenth biggest investor in India. Abu Dhabi Investment Authority (ADIA) announced its plans to invest US$ 2 billion in the Indian Infrastructure sector.\n\nDuring PM Modi\u2019s visit last year, the 2 sides agreed to establish a UAE-India Infrastructure Fund, setting an ambitious target of $75 billion to support investment in India\u2019s infrastructure.\nUAE has also appreciated the Indian govt. initiatives like Smart City, Skill India etc. and they are expected to invest in those areas, in addition to fields like oil, renewable energy etc.\nIndia-UAE Security co-operation\n\nA significant aspect of bilateral ties today is the closer convergence on security and counter-terrorism. Notwithstanding a security agreement in place since 2011, progress on counter-terror and maritime security has been slow.\n\nRecently, in a joint statement, two sides alluded to Pakistan in their joint statement after the prime minister\u2019s visit when calling upon \u201call states to reject and abandon the use of terrorism against other countries, dismantle terrorism infrastructures and bring perpetrators of terrorism to justice\u201d.\nFurther with the rise of the Islamic State, the need for cooperation in security areas and intelligence sharing has achieved higher moral ground.\nLast year, in September, UAE deported to India women suspected of having links to IS. Around 20 Indians have been intercepted while crossing over to the conflict zone.\nThe joint production of defense equipment under the Make in India program is another important area of focus.\nCultural Relations\n\nThe two nations share historical ties and have maintained regular cultural exchanges both at official and popular levels. India and UAE signed a Cultural Agreement in 1975. The ICCR opened a Culture Centre in Abu Dhabi in 2009.\n\nUAE is home to an Indian expatriate community, 2.6 million strong in numbers, the largest expatriate community in the UAE.\n\nProfessionally qualified personnel constitute about 15 & 20 percent of the community, followed by 20 percent white-collar non-professionals (clerical staff, shop assistants, salesmen, accountants, etc.) and the remainder 65% comprises blue-collar workers.\nThere is also a significant business community from India. The annual remittances made by the large Indian community in the UAE amount to over US$15 billion (2013).\nIndia-UAE: Recent developments\n\n2024:\n\nIndia and UAE signed a Bilateral Investment Treaty (BIT) during Prime Minister of India\u2019s visit BITs between two countries aim to promote and protect foreign private investments in each other\u2019s territories.\n\nUAE has become the only country with which India has signed both Comprehensive Economic Partnership Agreement\u00a0 (CEPA) and BIT.\nEarlier, India signed CEPA with Japan and South Korea also and BIT with Belarus.\nCEPA covers negotiation on trade in services and investment, and other areas of economic partnership like Intellectual property rights etc.\n\nOther Key Agreements between India and UAE:\n\nInter-governmental Framework Agreement concerning Cooperation for Empowerment and Operation of India-Middle East-Europe (IMEC) Economic Corridor.\u00a0IMEC calls for a sea-land connectivity project linking India with West Asia and Europe.\nMoU on Development of National Maritime Heritage Complex (NMHC) to build the Maritime Heritage Complex at Lothal, Gujarat.\nAgreement on interlinking of instant payment platforms \u2013 UPI (India) and AANI (UAE) and domestic debit/credit cards \u2013 RuPay (India) with JAYWAN (UAE). This will facilitate seamless cross-border transactions and enhance universal acceptance of RuPay across the UAE.\nCooperation Protocol between the National Library and Archives of UAE and National Archives of India for restoration and preservation of archival material.\nIndia-UAE Relations: Areas of Improvement\n\nGrievance Redressal for the migrant Indian workers in UAE:\n\nThere is a renewed vigor to set up such a mechanism on a bilateral level. The Ministry of External Affairs is working to evolve a new arrangement that would make the recruitment process more transparent.\nIndia and UAE signed a MoU in the field of Manpower Sourcing in December 2006 and a Protocol to streamline the admission of Indian contract workers by way of an electronic contract registration and validation system was signed.\nThe Embassy also has the Indian Community Welfare Fund (ICWF) for providing short-term economic assistance (food, shelter, passage expenses, etc.) to destitute workers/housemaids in distress.\n\nIndia can offer her expertise in sustaining a diverse nation, without much friction, to the West Asian countries, especially since the region is in great turmoil, largely rooted in Sunni-Shia strife.\n\nSince UAE\u2019s oil trade largely flows through the Indian Ocean, our Navy can play a more proactive role in guarding the waters. The recently released Maritime Doctrine of the Indian Navy rightly gives due importance to the Persian Gulf region.\n\nSummary\n\nUAE lights at the heart of the Gulf, a sub-continent hosting no less than 7 million citizens, sending in remittances of $40 billion annually. They also play a crucial role in our energy security. With dipping oil prices, the laws of the economy say the buyers have a better say in the oil trade. Hence, India is in a position to proactively engage, if not dictate, with the federation, to further our interests in the region.\n\nGrowing India-UAE economic and commercial relations contribute\u00a0to the stability and strength of a rapidly diversifying and deepening bilateral relationship between the two countries.\n\nArticle by: Jishnu J Raju"

            "[CONTENT]": "Sri Lanka is India\u2019s closest maritime neighbour and is just 30 nautical miles away from the territorial boundary. India has deep historical and cultural ties with this island nation. In this post, we analyze the areas of cooperation between India and Sri Lanka. You can also learn about the major issues between the two nations.\n\nIndia-Sri Lanka relations have been historically rich and complex, marked by cultural, economic, and political interactions stretching back over millennia.\n\nThe relationship between the two South Asian neighbours is deeply influenced by a shared history, geographical proximity, and cultural linkages, but it has also faced challenges and undergone significant transformations over the years.\n\nTable of Contents\n\nBackground of Sri Lanka and the History of the Civil War\nIndia\u2019s role in the Civil war and its implications\nIndia-Sri Lanka Relations: Areas of cooperation\nCultural Relations\nTrade Relations\nIndia-Sri Lanka: Issues and Conflicts\nStrategic Issues\nFisherman Problem\nKatchatheevu Island\nConclusion\nBackground of Sri Lanka and the History of the Civil War\nTamils and Sinhalese are the two major ethnic groups In Sri Lanka. Sinhalese eternal conflict with Tamils for power had been gathering strength since before independence.\nMany Tamils attended English language schools which were the passport to higher education and better employment in the colonial period. And the Tamil-dominated Northern Province had comparatively better facilities in terms of education and employment.\nPost-independence Sinhalese nationalism sought to curb the Tamil presence in education and civil administration. In 1949 Indian Tamil plantation workers were disenfranchised, the start of a wave of Sinhalese nationalism which alienated the Tamil people in the region.\nThe passing of the infamous \u201cSinhalese Only Bill\u201d in 1956 was another attempt along the same lines.\nThe constitutional provisions in the 1972 Constitution favoring the Sinhalese language and Buddhist religion, along with their educational policies convinced many Tamils that they had been perceived as a marginal community.\nAs a result of open discrimination, in 1976 Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam (LTTE) was formed to fight for Tamil rights and in 1983 Civil war started.\nIndia\u2019s role in the Civil war and its implications\n\nThe bilateral relations between India and Sri Lanka deteriorated in the 1980s with a rise of the Tamil militant separatism in Sri Lanka.\nIn 1987 to improve the ties, an Indo-Sri Lankan Accord was signed between India and Sri Lanka.\nIt proposed a political solution to Sri Lanka\u2019s conflict by establishing a provincial council system and devolution of power for nine provinces in Sri Lanka. (This is popularly known as The\u00a0Thirteenth Amendment (13A) to the Constitution of Sri Lanka)\nIndia also deployed the Indian Peace Keeping Force in Sri Lanka intended to perform peacekeeping (Known as Operation Pawan, which ultimately resulted in the assassination of PM Rajiv Gandhi).\nAfter two years of constant military engagement, the IPKF was withdrawn as it failed to defeat LTTE.\nFinally, in 2009, 25 years of violence ended when the Sri Lankan government seized the last area controlled by Tamil Tiger rebels. India at that point agreed to reconstruct the war-torn areas and started many rehabilitation programs.\nHowever, the pro-LTTE governments in Tamil Nadu influenced the decisions of the Central Government which posed a roadblock in humanitarian assistance in Sri Lanka.\nAlso, the relationship started deteriorating when India voted against Sri Lanka in 2009, 2012 and 2013 at the US-sponsored UNHRC resolution to investigate alleged human rights violations by the state against the Tamil rebels.\n\nAlso, read India\u2019s bilateral relations with SAARC countries.\n\nIndia-Sri Lanka Relations: Areas of cooperation\n\nThe cultural and trade ties between Sri Lanka are very strong.\n\nCultural Relations\n\n\ud83d\udc49 Which year are YOU targeting for success in the IAS/IPS/IFS Exam? \ud83d\ude80\n\n(1) \u21d2 UPSC 2025: Prelims cum Mains\n\n(2) \u21d2 UPSC 2026: Prelims cum Mains\n\n(3) \u21d2 UPSC 2027 Prelims cum Mains\n\nTip: Know more about ClearIAS Courses (Online/Offline)\n\nThe People of Indian Origin (PIOs) comprise Sindhis, Gujaratis, Memons, Parsis, Malayalis and Telugu-speaking persons who have settled down in Sri Lanka and are engaged in various business ventures.\nThough their numbers (10,000 approx.) are much lesser as compared to Indian Origin Tamils (IOTs), they are economically prosperous and are well settled. Each of these communities has its groups that organize festivals and cultural events.\nThe Cultural Cooperation Agreement has been signed between both countries.\nThe Indian Cultural Centre in Colombo actively promotes awareness of Indian culture by offering classes in Indian music, dance, Hindi, and Yoga. Every year, cultural troops from both countries exchange visits.\nBuddhism is a connecting link between India and Sri Lanka on religious lines.\nEducation is another important area of cooperation between India and Sri Lanka. India offers scholarship slots annually to deserving Sri Lankan students.\nTourism also forms an important link between India and Sri Lanka. India is the largest source of market for Sri Lankan tourism.\nTrade Relations\n\nSri Lanka is India\u2019s second-largest trading partner in SAARC.\nIndia and Sri Lanka signed the FTA in 1998, which facilitated increased trade relations between the two countries.\nSri Lanka has long been a priority destination for direct investment from India. India is among the top four investors in Sri Lanka with cumulative investments of over US$ 1 billion since 2003.\nEconomic and Technological Cooperation Agreement (ETCA): The proposed ETCA between India and Sri Lanka would facilitate trade in services, investments and technological cooperation. With ETCA signed, Indian investments will flow into Sri Lanka to make the island\u2019s production facilities part of the Indian and international value chain.\nIndia-Sri Lanka: Issues and Conflicts\n\nThere are a few areas over which there is minor contention between India and Sri Lanka.\n\nStrategic Issues\nIn the period of low-profile relationships between the two nations, SL started favouring China over India.\nOver the years Chinese funds started flowing, and it has started big buck infrastructure projects in the island nation. The presence of China in Sri Lanka increased significantly in recent years.\nAs part of the Maritime Silk Route (MSR) policy, China built two ports, one in Colombo and another in Hambantota.\nChina has also collaborated in satellite launching activities with Supreme SAT (Pvt.), Sri Lanka\u2019s only satellite operator.\n\n\u00a0India\u2019s efforts to counter China\n\nIn 2014 India abstained from voting on a UNHRC resolution calling for a probe into alleged war crimes by Sri Lanka. And it helped to revamp the century-old relationship with Sri Lanka. (While Pakistan and China voted against the resolution)\nIn a sign of a closer strategic partnership between Sri Lanka and India, they signed a civil nuclear cooperation agreement which is Sri Lanka\u2019s first nuclear partnership with any country.\nIn the wake of China\u2019s economic dominance on the island, India is also entering into Sri Lanka\u2019s mega project business in a big way by focusing on infrastructure development in the Northern and Eastern provinces.\nIndia is also planning to build the Trincomalee Port. The port is envisioned as an Indian counterweight to Chinese developments at Hambantota Port.\nFisherman Problem\n\nFishing disputes have been a constant area of concern between the two South Asian neighbours for a long time. Sri Lanka has long expressed concerns about illegal fishing by Indian fishermen within its territorial waters across the Palk Strait.\n\nThe country regularly arrests Indian fishermen for crossing the International Maritime Boundary Line (IMBL) that demarcates Indian and Sri Lankan waters. India also detains Sri Lankan fishermen for illegal fishing.\n\nKatchatheevu Island\nIt is an uninhabited island that India ceded to Sri Lanka in 1974 based on a conditional agreement called \u201cKatchateevu island pact\u201d.\nLater on, Sri Lanka declared Katchatheevu, a sacred land given the presence of a\u00a0Catholic shrine\nThe central government recognizes Sri Lanka\u2019s sovereignty over the island as per the 1974 accord. But Tamil Nadu claimed that Katchatheevu falls under the Indian territory and Tamil fishermen have traditionally believed that it belongs to them and therefore want to preserve the fish right there.\nConclusion\n\nIndia shares a common cultural and security space with the countries in the South Asian region especially Sri Lanka.\n\nAs a prominent Asian nation with critical national interests in South Asia, India has a special responsibility to ensure peace and stability in its closest neighbourhood. India should shed its big brother image and actively take part in rebuilding the war-torn country.\n\nIndia needs the support of Sri Lanka to emerge as a Blue water navy in the Indian Ocean and also to pursue permanent membership in the United Nations Security Council (UNSC).\n\nTherefore, the two countries should recognize the legitimacy of each other\u2019s concerns and operate in a mutually beneficial way.\n\nAlso read:\u00a0Sri Lankan Economic Crisis; Katchatheevu Island: What is the dispute about?\n\nReferences\n\nProblem of Fishermen in India-Sri Lanka Relations | Institute for Defence Studies and Analyses\nIndia to support Sri Lanka in UN \u2013 The Economic Times\nIndia\u2019s abstention in the vote against Sri Lanka at Geneva: Likely Implications | Institute for Defence Studies and Analyses\nN. body asks Sri Lanka to probe \u2018rights abuses\u2019 \u2013 The Hindu\nQ&A: Post-war Sri Lanka \u2013 BBC News\nPeace and Conflict Monitor, Poverty and Civil War in Sri Lanka\nWorld Report 2016: Sri Lanka | Human Rights Watch\nIndian Intervention in the Sri Lankan Civil War \u2013 Wikipedia\nSri Lanka: Conflict profile | Insight on Conflict\nComment article by Nehginpao Kipgen on Storm in the South China Sea \u2013 The Hindu\nThe\u00a0Thirteenth Amendment (13A) to the Constitution of Sri Lanka\n\nArticle contributed by: Sree Resmi S"

It is not a formal organization, and its guidelines are not binding. Decisions, including on membership, are made by consensus\n\nIndia is not a member of NSG. Why?\n\nIn answer in short \u2013 opposition from come countries like China as India has not signed Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty. But there is more to this. Let\u2019s analyze first the sequences of some events connected to nuclear supply/proliferation.\n\n\ud83d\udc49 Which year are YOU targeting for success in the IAS/IPS/IFS Exam? \ud83d\ude80\n\n(1) \u21d2 UPSC 2025: Prelims cum Mains\n\n(2) \u21d2 UPSC 2026: Prelims cum Mains\n\n(3) \u21d2 UPSC 2027 Prelims cum Mains\n\nTip: Know more about ClearIAS Courses (Online/Offline)\n\nNPT and NSG\nNPT (Nonproliferation Treaty) is\u00a0an international\u00a0treaty, which came into force in 1970. The main objective was to prevent the spread of\u00a0nuclear weapons and weapons technology.\nApart from India, Pakistan and Israel have also not signed NPT.\nIndia refused to sign NPTbecause (1) The NPT defines \u201cnuclear weapons states\u201d as those that tested devices before 1967, which means India cannot ever be one. (2) No fixed timelines have been mentioned for disarmament. (3) NPT is unfair treaty as nuclear weapon states have no obligation to give them up while non-nuclear states are not allowed to have them.\nIndia conducted its first Nuclear test -Pokhran-I (Smiling Buddha), in 1974.\nThe nuclear powers were convinced that the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty (NPT) alone would not halt the spread of nuclear weapons. Consequently, NSG was formed in 1974.\nThe current guidelines of NSG state that a non-NPT state cannot become a member of NSG which keeps India out of the group.\nIn 1998 India conducted the second nuclear Test (Operation Shakti).\nIndia is committed to voluntary, unilateral moratorium on nuclear testing. It has taken voluntary measures to ensure strong nuclear export control.\nHowever, new sanctions were imposed on India by Western Countries, especially US.\nIn the pre-2005 period, the NSG denied fuel for the Tarapur Atomic Power station, while the US used MTCR (Missile Technology Control Regime) provisions to prevent the transfer of cryogenic engine technology from Russia.\nIndia finally managed to have some relief when the US relented and agreed to a civil nuclear deal with India in 2008. This agreement has been done in view of the requirement for the US under Section 123 of its Atomic Energy Act 1954, hence also known as 123 Agreement. Under this, India signed a civil-military separation plan and India-IAEA safeguard agreement. In return, US diplomacy helped us to get NSG waiver.\nDuring a state visit to India in November 2010, U.S. President Barack Obama announced U.S. support for India\u2019s participation in the Nuclear Suppliers Group, the Wassenaar Arrangement, the Australia Group and the Missile Technology Control Regime, \u201cin a phased manner,\u201d and to encourage the evolution of regime participation criteria to that end, \u201cconsistent with maintaining the core principles of these regimes\u201d.\nIndia has taken a formal pledge stating that it would not share sensitive nuclear technology or material with others and would uphold its voluntary moratorium on testing nuclear weapons.\nDue to which the NSG participating governments agreed to grant India a \u201cclean waiver\u201d from its existing rules, which forbid nuclear trade with a country which has not signed the\u00a0Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty\u00a0(NPT). This made India eligible to receive advanced nuclear technologies that could be used to enrich uranium and reprocess plutonium. This has helped India a lot.\nHowever, being out of the elite NSG group has kept India still out of latest technologies as it is the NSG members that have the latest and the most efficient technology.\nIn 2016 India applied for NSG membership. Pakistan and Namibia followed the suite.\nChina\u2019s Opposition\n\nWhile a majority of the 48-member group backed India\u2019s membership, China along with New Zealand, Ireland, Turkey, South Africa and Austria were opposed to India\u2019s admission.\n\nChina insisted that India should sign NPT for NSG membership. It wants a non-discriminatory criterion for the admission of countries who have not signed NPT. It is an open secret that China\u2019s resistance is to facilitate the entry of Pakistan a close ally of China.\n\nBut\u00a0Pakistan\u2019s credentials for NSG membership are highly flawed and inadequate. On the other hand, over the years India has shown adherence to IAEA safeguards and has taken voluntary measures to abide by NPT and NSG guidelines while Pakistan has not taken any such initiatives.\n\nNSG membership \u2013 Is it important for India?\n\nMembership to the NSG will essentially increase India\u2019s access to state-of-the-art technology from the other members of the Group.\nAccess to technology and being allowed to produce nuclear equipment will give a boost to the Make in India program. That will, in turn, boost the economic growth of our country.\nAs per India\u2019s INDC under the Paris Climate agreement, we have committed to reducing dependence on fossil fuels and ensuring that 40% of its energy is sourced from renewable and clean sources. In order to achieve this target, we need to scale up nuclear power production. This can only happen if India gains access to the NSG.\nNamibia is the fourth-largest producer of uranium and it agreed to sell the nuclear fuel to India in 2009. However, that hasn\u2019t happened, as Namibia has signed Pelindaba Treaty, which essentially controls the supply of uranium from Africa to the rest of the world. If India joins the NSG, such reservations from Namibia are expected to melt away.\nFactors in favor of India\u2019s membership\nFrance got membership in the elite group without signing the NPT.\nCommitment to nonproliferation: India\u2019s commitment to bifurcate its civilian and military nuclear programs along with its nonproliferation record ensured indigenously developed technology is not shared with other countries.\nTransparency: India has also ratified an Additional Protocol with the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) which means that its civilian reactors are under IAEA safeguards and open for inspections.\nConclusion:\n\nThe recently framed draft proposal for accepting new members into the Nuclear Suppliers Group increases India\u2019s chances of entry into NSG. It\u2019s a welcome development for India as NSG membership would definitely boost the economic and strategic development in the future.\n\nTherefore, India should take up this opportunity to aggressively pursue the development of nuclear energy while providing the essential emphasis on safety and addressing concerns of the public. It will also pave the way for clean energy initiatives and continued focus to achieve our commitments to reduce the carbon footprint pledged during the climate summit.\n\nReferences:\n\nIDSA\nNSG\nPRSindia\nArmsControl, ArmsControl and ArmsControl\nTOI\nLiveMint\nTeriin\n\nArticle contributed by: Sree Resmi S"

MTCR was recently in the news as India got membership in the group (contrary to NSG where India was denied membership). In this post, let us see the details of Missile Technology Control Regime and it\u2019s importance to India.\n\nTable of Contents\n\nWhat is Missile Technology Control Regime (MTCR)?\nMissile Technology Control Regime: Important Facts\nMissile Technology Control Regime \u2013 Achievements\nMissile Technology Control Regime \u2013 Limitations\nMissile Technology Control Regime (MTCR): Benefits to India\nMTCR Membership \u2013\u00a0Obligations for India\nReferences\nWhat is Missile Technology Control Regime (MTCR)?\n\nIt is a multilateral, consensus \u2013 based grouping of 35 member countries who are voluntarily committed to the non-proliferation of missiles capable of carrying chemical, biological and nuclear weapons of mass destruction (WMDs).\nIt controls the export of the technologies and materials involved in ballistic missile systems and unmanned aerial vehicles particularly capable of carrying nuclear warheads of above 500kg payload for more than 300 km.\nThis is a non\u2013treaty association of member countries with certain guidelines about the information sharing, national control laws and export policies for missile systems and a rule-based regulation mechanism to limit the transfer of such critical technologies of these missile systems.\nMissile Technology Control Regime: Important Facts\n\nNote: Subscribe to the ClearIAS YouTube Channel to learn more.\n\nIt was established in April 1987 by G-7 countries \u2013 USA, UK, France, Germany, Canada, Italy, and Japan, to check the spread of unmanned delivery systems capable of carrying nuclear weapons of above 500kg for more than 300km. In 1992, it was extended for all types of weapons of mass destruction.\nNow, it has 35 full members including India and 4 \u201cnon-adherent members\u201d \u2013 Israel, Macedonia, Romania, Slovakia.\nChina is not a member of this regime but it had verbally pledged to adhere to its original guidelines but not to the subsequent additions.\nThese efforts of non-proliferation of ballistic missile systems had further been strengthened by \u201cThe International Code of Conduct against Ballistic Missile Proliferation\u201d, also known as the Hague Code of Conduct (HCOC), which was established on 25 November 2002 as an arrangement to prevent the proliferation of ballistic missiles with 136 UN member countries including India.\nMissile Technology Control Regime \u2013 Achievements\nIt has significantly contributed to curbing or slow down the nuclear programmes of some countries.\nArgentina dropped its joint ballistic missile programme\u201d Condor II\u201d with Egypt and Iraq.\nPoland and the Czech Republic vanished their ballistic missiles in an effort to join the regime.\nBrazil, South Africa, South Korea, and Taiwan also withdrew or curbed their missiles or space launch vehicle programs.\nRecently, it played a major role to hamper Libyan and Syrian missile efforts.\nMissile Technology Control Regime \u2013 Limitations\nIt is not a legally-binding treaty. Hence, no punitive measures could be taken against non-compliance to the guidelines of the regime.\nIt has only 35 member countries as full members. Whereas, countries like North Korea, Pakistan, Iran which have significant missile systems which could deliver WMDs, are not adherent to the regime.\nSome of such countries are exploring long \u2013 range intercontinental missiles and they are also sellers in the arms market.\nThere are incidences of violation of the rules by MTCR countries. In 2007, China secretly sold solid-fuel, medium-range ballistic missiles,\u201d DF 21\u201d, to Saudi Arabia. France sold the Storm Shadow/SCALP cruise missile to the UAE (Black Shaheen) in the 1990s.\nThe USA had bent some rules to give concessions to some Non -member countries aspiring to join the regime. Eg. Ukraine was allowed to retain its Scud missiles irrespective of the rule of destroying ballistic missiles (capable of carrying a 500kg payload for 300km) for the non-recognised nuclear state. Similarly, USA also allowed South Korea to develop ballistic missiles of the range of 800 kilometers with a 500-kilogram payload.\nWith a technological advancement, it is also possible to adapt and develop the existing missiles with a range shorter than 300km and carrying WMDs less than 500kgs to escape the regulations imposed by the regime.\nMissile Technology Control Regime (MTCR): Benefits to India\n\nIndia has joined MTCR as a full member and also agreed to join the Hague Code of conduct made it bolster its position as a responsible nuclear state and strengthen its case for the membership of other multilateral export control regimes like Nuclear Suppliers Group, Australia Group, and Wassenaar arrangement.\nIndia can buy high-end missile technology and run joint programmes for development of unmanned aerial vehicles with other countries. eg. Procurement of theater missile interceptor \u201cArrow II\u201d from Israel, military drones like \u201cAvenger\u201d from the USA etc.\nIndia can sell its missiles to other non-member countries with comparative ease.eg. Supersonic cruise missile, \u201cBrahMos\u201d, to Vietnam.\nISRO can access the forbidden cryogenic technology from Russia which is required for the space exploration operations.\nMTCR membership can be used as a bargaining chip against China which is not a full member of the regime and aspiring to be one as it has blocked India\u2019s way to NSG.\nMTCR Membership \u2013\u00a0Obligations for India\n\n\ud83d\udc49 Which year are YOU targeting for success in the IAS/IPS/IFS Exam? \ud83d\ude80\n\n(1) \u21d2 UPSC 2025: Prelims cum Mains\n\n(2) \u21d2 UPSC 2026: Prelims cum Mains\n\n(3) \u21d2 UPSC 2027 Prelims cum Mains\n\nTip: Know more about ClearIAS Courses (Online/Offline)\n\nMTCR membership does not guarantee any special technological entitlement from other members or adherent countries.\nIndia needs to align its national laws dealing with development, transfer, and procurement of the nuclear technologies and export policies as per the guidelines of the MTCR regime which could be stricter and stringent as compared to the existing ones and likely to have implications for the stakeholders.\nIt is unlikely to give an immediate boost to the export of the India missiles.\nIndia being a member of the regime will have some obligations like sharing critical information about its military and technological assets, consulting other member countries regarding the export of any MTCR items, especially those notified or denied by another partner.\n\nRead:\u00a0Missile Fuel Technology\n\nREFERENCES\nArms control.\nThe Economic Times.\nBusiness Standard.\nThe Indian Express.\nNuclear Threat Initiative.\nThe Hindu.\nThe Wire.\nFirstpost.\n\nArticle by: Manjiri Mulye"

I have no doubt India will develop her scientific researches and I hope Indian scientists will use the atomic force for constructive purposes. But if India is threatened, she will inevitably try to defend herself by all means at her disposal.\n\n1940s-1950s: Early Developments\n\nIndia\u2019s interest in nuclear technology began during the colonial era, and scientific research in nuclear physics gained momentum in the 1940s.\nIndia\u2019s nuclear program started in March 1944 and its three-stage indigenous efforts in technology were established by Dr. Homi Bhabha when he founded the nuclear research center, the Institute of Fundamental Research.\nThe establishment of the Tata Institute of Fundamental Research (TIFR) and the Atomic Energy Commission (AEC) marked significant steps in India\u2019s nuclear research.\n\n1960s-1970s: Peaceful Nuclear Explosions\n\nIndia\u2019s loss of territory to China in the war of 1962, provided the New Delhi government impetus for developing nuclear weapons as a means of deterring potential Chinese aggression.\nIndia conducted its first peaceful nuclear explosion (PNE) in 1974 at the Pokhran Test Range in Rajasthan. This test, codenamed \u201cSmiling Buddha,\u201d marked India\u2019s entry into the global nuclear stage.\nThe PNE was presented as a demonstration of India\u2019s nuclear capabilities for peaceful purposes, but it had military implications.\n\n1980s: Shift towards Weaponization\n\nIn the 1980s, India\u2019s nuclear program shifted from a focus on peaceful uses of nuclear technology to military applications.\nConcerns about regional security dynamics, including China\u2019s nuclear capabilities and the proliferation of nuclear weapons, contributed to this shift.\n\n1998: Pokhran-II Tests\n\nIn May 1998, India conducted a series of nuclear tests, known as \u201cPokhran-II,\u201d (code-named \u201cOperation Shakti\u201d) at the Pokhran Test Range. Five nuclear devices were detonated.\nThese tests included both fission and thermonuclear (fusion) devices, showcasing India\u2019s ability to develop a range of nuclear weapons.\nIndia\u2019s No-First-Use Policy and Doctrine of Credible Minimum Deterrence (CMD)\n\nIn August 1999, the Indian government released a draft of the doctrine which asserts that nuclear weapons are solely for deterrence and that India will pursue a policy of \u201cretaliation only\u201d.\n\nThe document also maintains that India \u201cwill not be the first to initiate a nuclear first strike, but will respond with punitive retaliation should deterrence fail\u201d and that decisions to authorize the use of nuclear weapons would be made by the Prime Minister or his \u2018designated successor(s).\n\n\u2018 The doctrine of \u201cNo first use\u201d means \u201cno first use against non-nuclear-weapon states\u201d, as clarified by our NSA. The doctrine of \u201cno first use against non-nuclear-weapon states\u201d reflected India\u2019s strategic culture, with its emphasis on minimal deterrence.\n\nIndia\u2019s nuclear doctrine emphasizes a retaliatory strike capability and NFU. The doctrine also stresses a massive retaliation policy against any nuclear aggression.\n\nAlso read: Indian Arms Import\n\nIndia\u2019s Nuclear Weapon Programme: Main Authorities\n\nNames to remember Nuclear Command Authority (NCA), Strategic Nuclear Command, Cabinet Committee on Security, National Security Advisory Board, etc.\n\nCabinet Committee on Security (CCS)\n\nThe civil leadership, in the form of the CCS (Cabinet Committee on Security), is the only body authorized to order a nuclear strike against another offending strike: In effect, it is the Prime Minister who has his finger \u201con the button.\u201d\n\nNuclear Command Authority (NCA)\n\nOn January 4, 2003, the\u00a0Cabinet Committee on Security (CCS) constituted the Nuclear Command Authority (NCA). NCA has two councils: the Executive Council and the Political Council.\n\nThe Executive Council is chaired by the\u00a0National Security Advisor (NSA) while the Political Council is chaired by the Prime Minister.\n\nThe National Security Advisor gives the inputs to the Political Council, which authorities a nuclear attack when deemed necessary. This mechanism of the Political Council is advised by the Executive Council and letting the \u201cnuclear button remain with PM\u201d was implemented to ensure that Indian nukes\u00a0remain firmly in\u00a0civilian control\u00a0and that there exists a sophisticated\u00a0Command and Control (C2) mechanism to prevent their accidental or unauthorized use.\n\nStrategic Nuclear Command or\u00a0Strategic Forces Command\n\nStrategic Nuclear Command, forms part of India\u2019s\u00a0Nuclear Command Authority\u00a0(NCA).\u00a0India\u2019s Strategic Nuclear Command was formally established in 2003.\n\nThe Joint Services SNC is the custodian of all of India\u2019s nuclear weapons, missiles, and assets. It is also responsible for executing all aspects of India\u2019s nuclear policy.\n\nThe directives of the NCA are to be operationalized by the Strategic Forces Command\u00a0under the control of a Commander-in-Chief of the rank of\u00a0Air Marshal\u00a0(or its equivalent) in charge of the management and administration of the tactical and strategic nuclear forces. (So as it is clear, Strategic Nuclear Command is the implementing agency of the nuclear decision.)\n\nNational Security Council\u00a0(NSC) of India\n\nThe\u00a0National Security Council (NSC) of India is the apex agency looking into the country\u2019s political, economic, energy, and strategic security concerns. (Please note that the NSC has roles beyond nuclear deterrence.\n\nThe chief executive is the\u00a0National Security Adviser. Before the formation of the NSC, these activities were overseen by the Principal Secretary to the Prime Minister).\u00a0\n\nThe three-tiered structure of the NSC comprises the Strategic Policy Group, the National Security Advisory Board, and a Secretariat represented by the Joint Intelligence Committee\u00a0(JIC).\n\nAlso read: India\u2019s Defence Exports\n\nHow does Nuclear Deterrence Work in India?\n\nThe executive council of the NSA advises the political council of the NSA in case of any security threat or nuclear action needed. The political council gives orders to Strategic Nuclear Command.\n\nStrategic Nuclear Command possesses all major nuclear arsenals, and it is the agency responsible for executing a nuclear retaliation. SNC requires approval from NCA for any nuclear action. Recent estimates suggest that India has between 90 and 110 nuclear weapons.\u00a0\n\nNuclear Triad\n\nNuclear Triad is a term used to denote a nation that has the capabilities of a nuclear strike from land, air, and water. India has tested its abilities on land, air, and sea.\n\nFrom Land: Ballistic missiles with a nuclear warhead in the Prithvi and Agni Series.\nFrom Air: Nuclear bombs from\u00a0Dassault Mirage 2000s\u00a0and\u00a0SEPECAT Jaguars. (Free-falling and un-guided method).\nFrom Sea: \u00a0Submarines: Sagarika K-15 missile in Arihant Submarine; Ship: Dhanush missile from ships like INS\u00a0Subhadra or\u00a0INS Rajput.\nIndia\u2019s Nuclear Weapon programme: Current status\n\nIndia has regularly engaged in diplomatic efforts to improve its nuclear standing on the global stage.\n\nThe Indo-US Civil Nuclear Agreement in 2008 allowed for international civilian nuclear trade with India despite its status as a non-signatory of the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty (NPT).\nDeveloping anti-satellite weapon (ASAT) capabilities; successfully carried out an ASAT missile test in March 2019\nPossesses several types of operational nuclear-capable land-based ballistic missiles, SLBMS, and\u00a0cruise missiles\nSuccessfully conducted 11 missile tests in late 2020, including the new naval version of the BrahMos cruise missile and hypersonic Shaurya missile\nOn October 14, 2022, India conducted a successful test launch of a submarine-launched ballistic missile (SLBM) from an Arihant-class SSBN.\nAs of January 2023, India was estimated to have a growing stockpile of 164 nuclear weapons, a small increase from the previous year\u2019s count of 160. These weapons are assigned to a nuclear triad of aircraft, land-based missiles, and nuclear-powered ballistic missile submarines.\nConclusion\n\nIndia\u2019s nuclear weapon program has been a subject of debate and discussion both within the country and internationally. While India maintains its nuclear weapons for deterrence purposes and emphasizes its commitment to responsible nuclear behavior, questions about non-proliferation, disarmament and regional security dynamics remain important aspects of the global nuclear landscape.\n\nRead: India\u2019s nuclear future;\u00a0Mission Divyastra"

It evolved over decades and reached its present model in 1992.\n\nThere are 51 countries in Europe, out of which 28 countries have signed a treaty to become a part of the European Union. So, clearly, there are countries in Europe which are not part of the European Union.\n\nThe EU treaty provided for a European Parliament and European Council which consisted of representatives of the member states.\n\nEU members account for 16 per cent of world imports and exports.\n\nIt is the largest trading bloc in the world surpassing the US.\n\nIn 2012, the EU was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize for advancing the causes of peace, reconciliation, democracy and human rights in Europe.\n\nWhat is the Euro Area?\nThe Euro Area (EA) is a subset of the EU, which is a monetary union of 19 of the 28 countries which use the common currency, Euro.\nNot all EU members use the Euro. Britain is an EU member, it is not part of the EA. It does not use the Euro and has retained its own currency, the Pound Sterling.\nWhy the \u2018Leave EU\u2019 campaign?\nThe Leave Campaign argues that Britain is losing out a big deal by staying in the EU.\nIt has to pay millions of pounds each week as a contribution to the European budget.\nThe extremely bureaucratic nature of the European parliament is hurting British exporters\nMigration from the European Union into Britain (mainly PIGS economies) is creating an imbalance in the welfare schemes of the UK government.\nBut, those who oppose the campaign say that Britain is a net gainer if She stays in the EU.\nAbout the referendum and the result\nA referendum denotes voting in which everyone (or nearly everyone) of voting age can take part, normally giving a \u2018Yes\u2019 or \u2018No\u2019 answer to a question. The side which gets more than half of all votes cast is declared a winner.\nPrime Minister David Cameron (Conservative Party) had promised to hold a referendum for Brexit if he won the 2015 general election. But, he led\u00a0the campaign for \u2018stay\u2019 vote.\nThere were\u00a0growing calls from many MPs of the Conservative Party\u00a0and the UK Independence Party (UKIP), for a new referendum. (In 1975, Britain had\u00a0voted to stay in the EU in a referendum).\nA referendum was held on\u00a0June 23, 2016, to decide whether Britain should exit or remain in the European Union.\nEligible voters: All British, Irish and Commonwealth citizens over 18 who are resident in the UK, along with UK nationals living abroad who have been on the electoral register in the UK in the past 15 years.\n51.9% of voters favoured exit of Britain from the EU.\u00a0It is the first time since the EU was founded in 1957 that a member country is leaving.\nIndia, the UK, and the European Union\n\nIndia is one of the top investors in the UK.\nThere are about 800 Indian-owned companies in the country employing roughly 110,000 people. (Eg:\u00a0Jaguar Land Rover is owned by the Tata group)\nMany of these firms made investments with the wider European market in mind.\nTogether, the UK and Europe account for over-a-quarter of the country\u2019s IT exports, worth around $30bn.\nThe UK is the third-largest source of foreign direct investment in India and India\u2019s largest G20 investor.\nIndia is the third-largest source of FDI to the UK in terms of numbers of projects. India invests more in the UK than in the rest of Europe combined, emerging as the UK\u2019s third-largest FDI investor.\nThe key sectors attracting Indian investment include healthcare, agritech,\u00a0food, and drink.\nIn November 2015, Prime Minister Modi has said, \u201dAs far as India is concerned, if there is an entry point for us to the EU, that is the UK.\u201d\nBut, the UK is only India\u2019s 12th largest trade partner, well behind other European countries such as Germany and Switzerland.\nInterestingly, the UK is also among just seven in 25 top countries with which India enjoys a trade surplus.\nNegative Impacts of the Brexit referendum on India\nIndia will have to adjust to changing world order.\nThere may be foreign fund outflow and dollar rise.\nRupee may depreciate because of the double effect of foreign fund outflow and dollar rise.\nThis may\u00a0increase petrol and diesel prices to an extent.\nThe government then may want to reduce additional excise duty imposed on fuel when it was on a downward\u00a0trajectory. This may\u00a0increase fiscal deficit unless revenue increased.\nPrices of gold, electronic goods, among others may also increase.\nSensex and Nifty may tumble in the short-run.\nThe falling value of the pound could render several existing contracts loss-making.\nThe vote is also bad news for Indian outsourcers.\nForeign funds are likely to move out if the world outside thinks that investment in India is risky.\nIndia\u2019s Forex (currently a record 363 billion dollars) may diminish, particular if the currency is stored in Euros or Pound (this comes around\u00a020% of total forex).\nBrexit will have a negative impact on the $108 billion Indian IT sector in the short term.\nMany Indian companies are listed on the London Stock Exchange and many have European headquarters in London. Brexit will take away this advantage.\nDue to fall in the value of Pound sterling, Indian\u00a0exports to the UK will suffer. Cheaper rupee will make Indian exports, including IT and ITeS, competitive. Indian import companies operating in the UK may also report a loss. Also, note that India is exporting more than what it is importing from Britain.\nPositive\u00a0Impacts of the Brexit referendum on India\nThere are many\u00a0who think a weakening British currency might be good news.\nIndia being more of an importing country than an exporting nation, the overall effect may turn out positive for India (if the dollar doesn\u2019t appreciate much against rupee).\nWith lower pound value, Indian companies may be able to acquire many hi-tech assets.\nAs investors look around the world for safe havens in these turbulent times, India stands out both in terms of stability and of growth.\nBrexit might give a boost to trade ties between India and the UK.\nBritain will now be free to discuss a bilateral trade pact with India.\nDue to the fall in the value of Pound sterling, those who import from the UK will gain. Indian export companies operating in the UK may also gain.\nMore Indian\u00a0tourists can afford to visit Britain in the coming days as the currency value has fallen.\nMore Indian\u00a0students can afford to study in Britain (for higher education) as the fees may seem cheaper.\nBritain will need a steady inflow of talented labour, and India fits the bill perfectly due to its English-speaking population.\nThe fall in the prices of commodities like crude, which will help India save a lot on its import bill (every $1 drop in crude prices leads to roughly $1 billion savings in India\u2019s oil import bill), reducing its trade and current account deficits (CAD).\nBrexit would weaken global growth and lead to a meaningful decline in commodity prices. This is only going to enhance both the relative and absolute appeal of India.\nLower commodity prices will help the macro fundamentals: be it fiscal deficit, current account deficit or inflation, which will give the government more levers to pump up the investment cycle.\nBrexit: What does it mean to Britain?\nAs per International Monetary Fund (IMF), a vote to exit the European Union in the referendum could leave Britain\u2019s economy more than 5 per cent smaller by 2019 than if it stays in the 28-nation club.\nBrexit could cause the country\u2019s economy to be between 3.8 and 7.5 per cent smaller by 2030.\nThe pound expected to fall by around 20 per cent. This would mean that exports to the UK will suffer and imports from the UK will gain. Export companies operating in the UK will gain, while import companies will lose.\nMore foreign tourists will visit Britain in the coming days as the currency value has fallen.\nMore foreign students may prefer Britain for higher education as the fees may seem cheaper.\nEU citizens in Britain and Brits living in other EU nations would have to update their immigration statuses.\nCompanies operating in both the UK and the EU would have to verify that they\u2019re compliant with two sets of laws.\nUS President Obama has warned that it could take 10 years for Britain to negotiate a new trade deal with the US.\nThe referendum results (52:48) is very close. This means a\u00a0major division of opinion in Britain which has social implications too. While the less educated and the old seems to favour the \u2018leave EU\u2019 campaign, the young and the employed are more in favour of Britain staying in the EU.\nBrexit could encourage England, Wales, Scotland, or Northern Ireland to appeal for quitting the United Kingdom.\nBrexit: What does it mean to the World?\nRemittance from the UK to countries outside in terms of Pound will fetch lesser returns compared to the past.\nExport dominated countries may be affected, whether exporting to the UK or not. If the UK is the major trading partner, the effect will be more.\nThe United States will bear the major brunt of a Brexit being the UK\u2019s biggest trading partner.\nA\u00a0direct impact on Asian economies from Brexit is unlikely in the long term because as a percentage of GDP, exports to the UK is less than 2% for most economies.\nBut businesses in some major Asian economies \u2013 like India and Japan- will be hit.\nCompanies which have set up operations in the UK to gain access to EU markets will be affected.\nBREXIT would likely allow any US Dollar strength to play out. This may cause other currencies to decline in value.\nIs India ready to handle the Brexit?\nThe finance ministry said that\u00a0the country has sufficient foreign exchange reserves to handle any impact.\nRBI Governor then, Raghuram Rajan, said the central bank will infuse whatever liquidity is needed into the Indian market to keep it \u201cwell behaved\u201d.\nSEBI and stock exchanges have beefed up their surveillance mechanism to deal with any excessive volatility.\nIf exports to the UK are costly and imports are cheaper, India can think of utilizing the import-advantage by reversing the present trade scenario.\nOnce the dust settles, India may\u00a0be seen to be a net gainer and inflows would continue to gravitate towards the Indian shores.\nLatest Updates on Brexit\n\nNegotiations with the EU officially started in June 2017, aiming to complete the withdrawal agreement by October 2018. However, that didn\u2019t happen. Having failed to get her agreement approved, May resigned as prime minister in July 2019 and was succeeded by Boris Johnson.\n\nBoris Johnson sought to replace parts of the agreement and vowed to leave the EU by the new deadline. An early general election was then held on 12 December. The Conservatives won a large majority in that election, with Johnson declaring that the UK would leave the EU in early 2020.\n\nThe Withdrawal Agreement was ratified by the UK Parliament on 23 January 2020, and by the European Parliament on 29 January, ensuring the UK leaves the EU on 31 January.\n\nUK left the EU at 11 p.m. GMT on 31 January 2020.\n\nHowever, the UK is still negotiating the future trade relationship with the EU. Britain is now going through a transition period where negotiations are open. The transition period will end on 31 December 2020.\n\nDuring the transition, the UK still remains subject to EU law and remains part of the EU customs union and single market, but is no longer part of the EU\u2019s political institutions."

For 56 years, both India and Pakistan are peacefully sharing the water of Indus and its tributaries, thanks to The Indus Water Treaty (IWT).\nBecause of the confrontations between India and Pakistan over other issues, the water treaty naturally comes into picture.\nAfter the Uri cross-border attack by Pakistan in 2016, Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi had said \u201cBlood and Water cannot flow simultaneously.\u201d\nThere are issues between India and Pakistan, but there has been no fight over water after the Treaty was ratified. Most disagreements and disputes have been settled via legal procedures, provided for within the framework of the treaty.\nCan India stop water flow to Pakistan?\n\n\ud83d\udc49 Which year are YOU targeting for success in the IAS/IPS/IFS Exam? \ud83d\ude80\n\n(1) \u21d2 UPSC 2025: Prelims cum Mains\n\n(2) \u21d2 UPSC 2026: Prelims cum Mains\n\n(3) \u21d2 UPSC 2027 Prelims cum Mains\n\nTip: Know more about ClearIAS Courses (Online/Offline)\n\nNo. Not as per the treaty.\nWhat India can do is to reduce the water flow to Pakistan by utilizing the provisions of the treaty.\nBut any project which may affect water flow will take time for implementation, considering the cost and objections involved. Pakistan has reportedly objected to five Indian hydro power projects, and the Wullar Barrage (Tulbul Navigation Project) which must be settled before India can resume work on them.\nCan India\u00a0walk out of the pact unilaterally?\n\nThe treaty has no provision for either country unilaterally walking out of the pact. Article XII of the treaty says \u201cThe provisions of this Treaty, or, the provisions of this Treaty as modified under the provisions of Paragraph (3), shall continue in force until terminated by a duly ratified treaty concluded for that purpose between the two governments.\u201d Still if India wants to go about abrogating it, the country should abide by the 1969 Vienna convention on the law of treaties.\n\nHad the Indian President signed the treaty?\n\nThe validity of the treaty is being challenged in court as it was signed by the Prime minister of India who is not head of the Indian republic.\u00a0The President of India is the official head of the state.\n\nTulbul Project: By India\nThe Tulbul project is a \u201cnavigation lock-cum-control structure\u201d at the mouth of the lake, located on the Jhelum river.\u00a0It is a key intra-state channel to ferry state\u2019s goods and\u00a0people.\nThe idea is to ensure year-round navigation along the 20-km stretch from Anantnag to Srinagar and Baramulla, and on the 22 km-stretch between Sopore and Baramulla that becomes non-navigable in winter with water depth of only 2.5 ft (to sustain navigation through the year a minimum depth of water in the lake is necessary).\nThe project envisages water release from lake to maintain minimum draught of 4.5 feet in Jhelum.\nIndia had started constructing a 439 feet long barrage at the lake\u2019s mouth.\nIndia unilaterally suspended the Tulbul project (Islamabad calls it Wullar Barrage) in 1987 after Pakistan objected.\nThe decision to review the suspension signalled the Modi government\u2019s intent to revive it irrespective of Pakistan\u2019s protests.\nImplication:\u00a0India gets to control Jhelum water, but that may impact Pakistan agriculture. The project can create problems for Pakistan\u2019s triple-canal project that connects Jhelum-Chenab with Upper Bari Doab Canal.\u00a0With a barrage, India controls release of water into Jhelum, which could trigger a flood or drought in POK and Pakistan.\nLeft Bank Outfall Drain (LBOD) Project: by Pakistan\nWithout taking consent from India, Pakistan has constructed Left Bank Outfall Drain (LBOD) project passing through the Great Rann of Kutch area (Gujarat, India) with the assistance from the world bank. The purpose of LBOD is to bypass the saline and polluted water which is not fit for agriculture use to reach sea via Rann of Kutch area without passing through its Indus delta.\nThe LBOD water is planned to join the sea via Sir Creek but LBOD water is entering Indian territory due to many breaches in its left bank caused by floods.\u00a0Water released by the LBOD is enhancing the flooding in India and contaminating the quality of water bodies which are source of water to salt farms spread over vast area.\nGujarat state of India being the lower most riparian part of Indus basin, Pakistan is bound to provide all the details of engineering works taken up by Pakistan to India as per the provisions of the treaty and shall not proceed with the project works till the disagreements are settled by arbitration process.\nIndus Water Treaty: Matters Beyond India and Pakistan\nIndus originates from Tibet in China. If China decides to stop or change the flow of the river, it will affect both India and Pakistan.\nClimate change is causing melting of ice in Tibetan plateau, which scientists believe will affect the river in future.\nShould India violate a bilateral treaty with Pakistan because of cross-border attacks?\nThe Indus Water Treaty (IWT) was meant to reduce hostilities between India and Pakistan. It should be kept in the same spirit.\nIndia has always dealt with security and water issues separately with Pakistan.\n80% of Pakistan\u2019s 21.5 million hectares of farmland is irrigated by river Indus and its tributaries.\u00a0Reducing the\u00a0water flow to Pakistan will unleash havoc there (especially in Punjab and Sindh province).\nBreaking the Indus Water Treaty doesn\u2019t make any sense as India at present does not have enough\u00a0infrastructure to use the additional\u00a0water available. It may create flood in the Kashmir valley as well.\nThe decision of not giving water to Pakistan may further enrage the terror elements in the country, making them intensifying their attacks on India.\nNot respecting the Indus Water Treaty, may invite global condemnation to India as the treaty is an international agreement.\nNeighbours like Nepal and Bangladesh with whom we have water treaties may turn\u00a0skeptical.\nThere are concerns that China may also block the water of Brahmaputra to Assam.\nThe Kashmir issue will get a whole new dimension if India withdraws from the treaty. Not only this, it would trigger the formal beginning of water wars\nIndia, aspiring for a seat in the UNSC, should safeguard rather than violate bilateral treaties.\nThe approach of government should be to utilize provisions available in Indus Water Treaty itself. But building infrastructure across Indus will take time.\nSummary\n\nIndia has\u00a0never used our rights on the western rivers. Under the Indus Water Treaty, we can make use of the waters of the western rivers for irrigation, storage, and even for producing electricity, in the manner specified. If we just do what we are entitled to under the Treaty, it would be enough to send jitters through Pakistan. It would be a strong signal without doing anything drastic.\n\nReference:\n\nHindustan Times.\nThe Hindu.\nTimes of India.\nFinancial Express"

Chinese Dams and Hydro-electric projects in Brahmaputra is becoming an increasing concern for India.\n\nTable of Contents\n\nLalho Project\nChina\u2019s Lalho Dam Project: Why in news now?\nChina\u2019s Lalho Dam Project: Should India worry?\nNot the first dam!\nNo water treaties between China and India!\nSummary\nLalho Project\n\nChina is constructing their \u201cmost expensive\u00a0 hydro project\u201d \u2013 Lalho project \u2013 in a tributary of river Brahmaputra (known in China as\u00a0Yarlung Zangbo).\u00a0The Brahmaputra, one of India\u2019s major rivers, originates in Tibet (China) and flows into India (Arunachal Pradesh and Assam) before going into Bangladesh.\n\nThe Construction of the Lalho hydroelectric project originally began in June 2014.\nThis Project involves an investment of 4.95 billion yuan (USD 740 million).\nThe Lalho project is planned at Xiabuqu river, a tributary of Brahmaputra, at\u00a0Xigaze (Tibet Autonomous Region) in China.\nXigaze also known as Shigatse is closely located to Sikkim. From Xigaze, the Brahmaputra flows into Arunachal Pradesh.\nLalho Project will serves multiple purposes, such as irrigation, flood control and power generation.\nThe Lalho project is likely to be finished by 2019.\nChina\u2019s Lalho Dam Project: Why in news now?\nChina\u00a0was blocking the Xiabuqu tributary\u00a0(195 km long).\nXiabuqu starts in Tibet and joins Brahmaputra at Xigaze.\nThe project can impact water flows in India.\nChina\u2019s Lalho Dam Project: Should India worry?\nIndia is commissioning a study to ascertain how much the Yarlung Zangbo, actually contributes to flows in India and how much comes from the catchment area in India itself.\nMany experts estimate that the Tibet contribution is not more than 40 percent.\nThe river\u2019s mean discharge is 25.8 cubic meters per second (cumecs), less than 0.15 per cent of the Brahmaputra\u2019s mean discharge when it enters in India.\nThe reservoir was designed to store upto 295 million cubic meters of water.\nIndia is concerned that if the waters are diverted, then projects on the\u00a0Brahmaputra, particularly the Upper Siang and Lower Suhansri projects in Arunachal Pradesh, may get affected.\nThe dam may impact the flow of silt as well, which is essential to build up North Eastern\u00a0Plains.\nChina has been maintaining that it has taken into consideration India\u2019s concerns and allays apprehensions of restricting the flow of water, saying its dams are run-of-the-river projects not designed to hold water.\nIndia and China have had several rounds of talks on the water issue since 2007 and Beijing has always attempted to play down New Delhi\u2019s fears that it could use strategically positioned dams to regulate water flows into India.\nIndia has been taking up the issue with\u00a0China\u00a0for the past few years. And based on the understanding reached in 2013, the Chinese side agreed\u00a0to provide more flood data of\u00a0Brahmaputra.\nSome experts say that, the Lalho project may not reduce water flow to India in the long run, but it may add up to desertification in Tibet and Xigaze region itself.\nThe Lalho project is well upstream of the \u201cgreat bend\u201d made by the Brahmaputra shortly before it enters India. Other tributaries joining the Brahmaputra in and around the great bend double its water flow before the Arunachal Pradesh border. Larger tributaries join the river in India, so that it carries eight times more water when it exits the country than when it enters.\nNot the first dam!\n\nThis is not the first time that China tried to alter the flow of rivers, flowing through India. They are listed as below:\n\nChina\u2019s first dam on the main upper reaches of the Brahmaputra was built at Zangmu in 2010.\nLater in 2011-2015, the approval for three more dams at Dagu, Jiacha, and Jeixu (small-scale projects) were given\u00a0on the river Brahmaputra, in Tibet Autonomous Region.\nIn 2015, China operationalized the largest hydel project in Tibet, Zam Hydropower Station, built on the river Brahmaputra.\n\nWhat is\u00a0 Zam Hydropower Station (Zangmu\u00a0Hydropower Station)?\n\n\ud83d\udc49 Which year are YOU targeting for success in the IAS/IPS/IFS Exam? \ud83d\ude80\n\n(1) \u21d2 UPSC 2025: Prelims cum Mains\n\n(2) \u21d2 UPSC 2026: Prelims cum Mains\n\n(3) \u21d2 UPSC 2027 Prelims cum Mains\n\nTip: Know more about ClearIAS Courses (Online/Offline)\n\nChina has operationalized $1.5 billion for the\u00a0 Zam Hydropower Station (2015) which has ignited concerns in India over the likelihood of disruption of water supplies.\n\u00a0The dam has also raised concerns in India over China\u2019s ability to release water in times of conflict, which could pose serious risk of flooding.\nThe Zam Hydropower Station, considered to be the world\u2019s highest-altitude hydropower station and the largest of its kind, will produce 2.5\u00a0billion\u00a0KW-hours of electricity a year.\nNo water treaties between China and India!\nThere is no water treaty between the countries, but the countries has devised an Expert Level\u00a0Mechanism\u00a0(ELM) on trans border rivers.\nDuring the visit of the President of China to India in November 2006, it was agreed to set up an Expert-Level Mechanism to discuss interaction and cooperation on provision of flood season hydrological data, emergency management, and other issues regarding trans-border rivers as agreed between them, under which Beijing provides data to India on the water flows.\nThe Expert Level Mechanism from Indian side is led by Commissioner, a Joint Secretary level officer.\nSummary\nRegarding the Lalho Project, if it is designed as a run-of-the-river project as stated by China it is unlikely to affect India\u2019s interests in the long run.\nBut India needs more clarity and data regarding Chinese Hydro-electric projects.\nExpert Level Mechanism has a greater role to play in water disputes.\nWater resources experts in India say that hydro power projects on Yarlung Zangbo have the potential to sweep away highland settlements and forests and bury the lowlands in silt.\nA case in point is the 2001 disaster after an artificial dam in Tibet gave away to kill 26 people and damaged property worth Rs 140 crore along river Siang in Arunachal Pradesh.\nA single dam\u00a0alone is unlikely to be dangerous, but release of excess water from all dams simultaneously will be devastating.\n\nReferences:\n\nHindustan Times.\nTimes of India.\nMinistry of Water Resources, Government of India.\nIndia Today.\nIndian Express.\nEconomic Times.\n\nArticle by: Priyanka Sunil"

The agreement provided for the equitable sharing of the river\u2019s waters.\n\nThe negotiations on how to share the water have been going on since 1972.\n\n1972: The Joint River Commission (JRC) was established by India and Bangladesh in the Indo-Bangla Treaty of Friendship.\n1983: Agreement on ad hoc sharing of Teesta water.

While no formal agreement was reached, there were indications of a renewed commitment to resolving the dispute.\n\nThe Federal Angle of the Teesta River Issue\n\nArticle 253 of the Indian Constitution gives power to the Union Government to enter any transboundary river water-related treaty with a riparian state.\nThe center cannot do it arbitrarily without taking into consideration the social, political, and eco-impact of such a treaty in the catchment area.\nIn 2011, the West Bengal government commissioned a study on the Teesta issue under the noted hydrologist Kalyan Rudra.\nThis is not acceptable to Bangladesh, where the water is required mainly during the December \u2013 April period which is considered to be the leanest.\nWest Bengal\u2019s Objection\n\nConnection to global warming: Many of the glaciers on the Teesta river basin have retreated, says a strategic foresight group, a Mumbai think tank.\nEstimates suggest that Teesta River has a mean average flow of approximately 60 billion cubic meters, of which a significant amount flows during June and September, and October to April is considered to be a lean season.\nAny treaty will dry out the northern region of West Bengal and will hurt farmers.\nIn 1998, Bangladesh\u2019s Teesta barrage began, and the farmers of Bangladesh enjoyed 3 cropping seasons per year and didn\u2019t deserve any more water.\nThe project in West Bengal aims at irrigating 9,22,000 hectares of land in North Bengal and provides 67.60 MW of hydropower. Any water sharing with Bangladesh will hamper the project.\nThe Alternative solutions proposed by West Bengal\nMamata Banerjee proposed sharing of rivers like the Torsa, which are closer to the border of Sikkim and Bangladesh.\nThe Torsa has connectivity with Bangladesh\u2019s Padma.\nShe proposed that the two countries set up a commission to ascertain the level of water flowing through the Torsa and the quantum of water that can be shared.\nBangladesh\u2019s Stand on the Teesta River Dispute\n\nIndia already enjoys a share of 55% of the river water.\nBangladesh claims 50% of the water between December and May every year because that\u2019s when the water flow to the country drops drastically.\nOver 1 lakh hectares of land in Rangpur \u2013 its rice bowl cannot be cultivated for winter crops due to excessive withdrawal of water by India.\nBangladesh demands a fair share of river waters during the dry season.\nPolitical Angle of Teesta River Dispute\nThe previous Bangladesh Nationalist Party (BNP) govt. headed by Begum Khaleda Zia was not very receptive to India\u2019s concern.\nThe BNP, during its tenure in power between 1991-1996 and again from 2001 to 2006, provided shelter to leaders and cadres from various North East-based terror outfits.\nBut Sheikh Hasina\u2019s Bangladesh Awami League(BAL) party followed India-friendly policies and also adopted a zero-tolerance policy against anti-Indian terror outfits and eventually ULFA was banned.\nThe cooperation between the two nations facilitated the finalization of the land boundary agreement.\nThe Teesta River water deal as anticipated will help Delhi get more political leverage which it thinks is necessary to check the rising influence of China in the Bay of Bengal region.\nConclusion\nBangladesh is a significant neighborhood for India with a shared history, culture, religion, and many more common elements.\nFor Bangladesh, this issue is still considered to be a prolonged suffering inflicted by India.\nThe cooperation of Bangladesh is important to India and without such liberal regimes in neighboring countries, India cannot become terror-free.\nBangladesh is an essential element for India to get connected with North East.\nConsidering the strategic importance of Bangladesh and as a responsible upper riparian state, India needs to take proactive steps for the early conclusion of the Teesta agreement.\n\nRead:\u00a0Transboundary rivers of India\n\nArticle by: P.

(Online/Offline)\n\nThis relationship is underscored by high-level political exchanges, extensive trade and economic cooperation, cultural and people-to-people links, and collaboration in areas of security and defense.\n\nHistorical and Cultural Ties\nThe foundation of India-Bangladesh relations is deeply rooted in their shared history and cultural heritage.\nThe liberation of Bangladesh in 1971, aided by India, remains a cornerstone of this relationship.\nThe cultural connections between the two countries predate their modern political boundaries, with shared traditions in music, literature, and festivals that underscore their profound kinship.\nPolitical and Strategic Partnerships\nIn the realm of politics and strategy, India and Bangladesh have consistently worked to enhance their diplomatic ties and address mutual concerns through dialogue and cooperation.\nThe Land Boundary Agreement (LBA) of 2015, which facilitated the exchange of enclaves and resolved longstanding border disputes, exemplifies the maturity and depth of their political engagement.\nBoth nations regularly conduct joint consultative commission meetings to discuss a wide range of bilateral and regional issues.\nEconomic Cooperation and Connectivity\nEconomic ties between India and Bangladesh have witnessed significant growth, with India being Bangladesh\u2019s largest trading partner in South Asia.\nThe two countries have made strides in enhancing connectivity through road, rail, water, and air links, facilitating not just trade but also people-to-people contact.\nInitiatives like the India-Bangladesh Protocol on Inland Water Transit and Trade (PIWTT) have been instrumental in this regard.\nMoreover, India has extended lines of credit to Bangladesh for various infrastructure and development projects, reinforcing economic linkages.\nDefense and Security Collaboration\nSecurity and defense cooperation are pivotal aspects of the India-Bangladesh partnership.\nBoth countries engage in joint military exercises, high-level defense dialogues, and training exchanges.\nThis collaboration extends to maritime security, counterterrorism, and intelligence sharing, reflecting their commitment to regional stability and security.\nCultural Exchanges and People-to-People Contacts\nThe vibrant cultural exchanges between India and Bangladesh are facilitated through festivals, literary meets, and artistic collaborations.\nThe shared linguistic heritage of Bengali, celebrated on both sides of the border, further cements cultural ties.\nPeople-to-people contact is enhanced by liberal visa regimes and cooperation in areas such as education, with numerous Bangladeshi students pursuing higher studies in India.\nChallenges and the Way Forward\nDespite the strength of their relationship, India and Bangladesh face challenges, including issues related to water sharing, border management, and trade imbalances.\nAddressing these concerns through sustained dialogue and mutual accommodation remains critical for the advancement of bilateral ties.\n\nLearn more:\u00a0India Bangladesh Relations\n\nIndia-Pakistan Relations\n\nThe relationship between India and Pakistan is one of the most complex and challenging in international diplomacy, marked by a series of highs and lows since their independence in 1947.\n\nThis bilateral relationship is influenced by historical, religious, and political factors, leading to a multifaceted and often tense dynamic.\n\nAt the heart of their dispute are issues of territorial sovereignty, particularly over the Kashmir region, alongside concerns related to security, terrorism, and regional influence.\n\nHistorical Context\nThe partition of British India in 1947, which led to the creation of India and Pakistan, sowed the seeds of conflict, particularly over the princely state of Jammu and Kashmir.\nThis contentious division has led to three major wars (1947, 1965, and 1971) and numerous smaller-scale conflicts and stand-offs.\nThe legacy of partition, characterized by mass migrations and communal violence, has left a lasting impact on the psyche and politics of both nations.\nKashmir Dispute\nThe dispute over Kashmir remains the central issue between India and Pakistan.\nBoth countries claim the region in full but control only parts of it.\nThe United Nations\u2019 attempts to mediate through resolutions and plebiscites have not led to a sustainable solution, making Kashmir a flashpoint for military and diplomatic confrontations.\nNuclear Dimension\nThe nuclearization of both countries in the late 20th century added a new dimension to the conflict, with the international community expressing concern over the possibility of a nuclear conflict in South Asia.\nThe nuclear tests conducted by both nations in 1998 escalated tensions but also led to a mutual understanding of the need for restraint, exemplified by the Lahore Declaration in 1999, which aimed to improve bilateral relations and avoid nuclear confrontation.\nTerrorism and Security Issues\nIndia has consistently accused Pakistan of supporting insurgent groups in Kashmir and engaging in cross-border terrorism, a claim that Pakistan denies, attributing the unrest in Kashmir to indigenous movements.\nThe 2008 Mumbai attacks, which India attributed to Pakistani militants, led to a significant downturn in relations, impacting dialogue and cooperation efforts.\nDiplomatic and Economic Ties\nDespite these challenges, there have been periods of constructive engagement and attempts at peace talks.\nInitiatives like the Composite Dialogue Process have sought to address a range of bilateral issues, including trade, people-to-people contacts, and cultural exchanges.\nTrade between the two countries remains far below potential due to political tensions and mutual trade barriers.\nHowever, there are occasional efforts to increase economic ties and connectivity, seen as avenues to improve bilateral relations.\nRecent Developments\nRelations between India and Pakistan have remained strained in recent years, particularly after the 2019 Pulwama attack in Indian-administered Kashmir and the subsequent Balakot airstrike by India inside Pakistan.\nThese incidents led to a further militarization of the Line of Control (LoC) and a downturn in diplomatic relations.\nHowever, there are sporadic calls for dialogue and peace, recognizing that sustained conflict is neither desirable nor beneficial for either country.\n\nLearn more:\u00a0India-Pakistan Relations; Terrorism, Kashmir, and Recent Issues\n\nIndia-China Relations\n\nIndia and China, as two of the world\u2019s oldest civilizations, share a long history of cultural, economic, and diplomatic interactions.\n\nHowever, their relationship in the contemporary era is characterized by a complex mix of competition and cooperation, influenced by border disputes, economic rivalry, and geopolitical maneuvering.\n\nThis relationship is pivotal not just for the Asian continent but for global geopolitics, given the stature of both nations as emerging superpowers.\n\nHistorical Background\nThe historical interactions between India and China have been predominantly peaceful, enriched by the Silk Road trade and the spread of Buddhism from India to China.\nThe 20th century, however, saw the relationship strained by territorial disputes, most notably the border war in 1962 over the Aksai Chin and Arunachal Pradesh regions.\nThis conflict left a legacy of mistrust and unresolved border issues that continue to impact bilateral relations.\nBorder Disputes and Military Standoffs\nThe Line of Actual Control (LAC) serves as the de facto border between India and China, spanning across the Himalayas.\nDespite numerous rounds of negotiations and the establishment of confidence-building measures, the border remains undefined in several areas, leading to periodic standoffs and clashes, the most recent and significant one occurring in the Galwan Valley in 2020.\nThese incidents underscore the volatility of India-China border relations and the potential for escalation.\nEconomic Ties and Rivalry\nEconomically, India and China are both significant players on the global stage, with trade between the two countries reaching impressive volumes.\nChina is one of India\u2019s largest trading partners, involved in various sectors, including technology, pharmaceuticals, and manufacturing.\nHowever, this economic relationship is also marked by a significant trade imbalance in China\u2019s favor, which India seeks to address.\nThe economic rivalry extends to competition for markets and influence in Asia and beyond, with both nations investing in infrastructure projects across the region.\nDiplomatic and Geopolitical Dynamics\nOn the diplomatic front, India and China are engaged in a complex dance of competition and cooperation.\nThey work together in multilateral forums like BRICS (Brazil, Russia, India, China, and South Africa) and the Shanghai Cooperation Organization, focusing on shared interests such as trade, climate change, and energy security.\nHowever, geopolitical rivalry is evident in their efforts to expand influence in Asia, with India concerned about China\u2019s Belt and Road Initiative (BRI) and its implications for Indian sovereignty and regional dominance.\nStrategic Partnerships and Regional Security\nThe broader Asia-Pacific region is a theater for the strategic competition between India and China, with both nations seeking to bolster their security and economic ties with other countries in the region.\nIndia\u2019s \u201cAct East\u201d policy and participation in the Quad (Quadrilateral Security Dialogue) with the United States, Japan, and Australia are seen as counterbalances to China\u2019s growing assertiveness in the Indo-Pacific region.\nConversely, China\u2019s close partnership with Pakistan and its forays into the Indian Ocean are viewed with suspicion in New Delhi.\nThe Path Forward\nDespite these challenges, both India and China recognize the importance of managing their rivalry to prevent conflicts and ensure regional stability.\nHigh-level diplomatic engagements and dialogues have continued, aimed at resolving contentious issues and exploring areas of mutual interest.\nThe relationship between India and China is a delicate balance of competition and cooperation, with both countries navigating their ascent on the global stage while attempting to address bilateral grievances and build a framework for peaceful coexistence.\n\nLearn more:\u00a0India-Bhutan-China Relations\n\nIndia-Nepal Relations\n\nThe relationship between India and Nepal is underpinned by a tapestry of cultural,

crucial role in Nepal\u2019s development narrative, contributing to its infrastructure, education, health, and hydropower sectors.\nSeveral bilateral projects and initiatives, supported by India in Nepal, aim to bolster economic development and connectivity.\nHowever, economic cooperation has not been without its challenges, including issues related to trade deficits and the implementation of projects.\nPolitical Dynamics and Challenges\nThe political landscape in Nepal, particularly its evolving democracy and the drafting of a new constitution, has introduced complexities in the bilateral relationship.\nIssues such as border disputes and Nepal\u2019s increasing engagement with China have led to periods of tension.\nThe blockade of 2015, which Nepal attributed to India and significantly affected the supply of goods to the landlocked country, marked a low point in relations, leading to a reevaluation of ties from both sides.\nSecurity and Defense Cooperation\nSecurity cooperation, aimed at curbing terrorism, trafficking, and unauthorized movement across the border, remains a critical area of collaboration.\nBoth countries conduct joint military exercises and share intelligence, reflecting their commitment to regional security and stability.\nThe defense ties are complemented by India\u2019s assistance in the training of Nepalese military personnel.\nThe Way

discussions have opened avenues for cooperation in sustainable development, water management, and conservation projects.\nChallenges and the Path Forward\nWhile the India-Bhutan relationship is largely positive, it is not without challenges.\nThe dynamics of regional politics and the evolving geopolitical landscape necessitate continuous dialogue and engagement to address any concerns and sustain the strength of the partnership.\nThe growth of Bhutan\u2019s interactions with other countries, including China, calls for a nuanced approach from India to ensure that its ties with Bhutan remain robust and mutually beneficial.\n\nLearn more:\u00a0India-Bhutan-China Relations\n\nIndia-Sri Lanka Relations\n\nIndia and Sri Lanka, two neighboring nations in the Indian Ocean, share a deep

for an expanded Comprehensive Economic Partnership Agreement (CEPA) have faced hurdles, reflecting the complexities of economic integration.\nAdditionally, India contributes to investment and development projects in Sri Lanka, spanning infrastructure, energy, and community development programs, especially in the post-civil war reconstruction phase.\nPolitical and Strategic Dimensions\nThe political relationship between India and Sri Lanka has seen its share of ups and downs, influenced by internal dynamics within Sri Lanka, including its civil war, and the geopolitical contest in the Indian Ocean region.\nIndia\u2019s involvement in Sri Lanka\u2019s ethnic conflict in the 1980s and the subsequent Indian Peace Keeping Force (IPKF) operation have left a lasting impact on bilateral perceptions.\nIn recent years, both nations have sought to rebuild trust and strengthen diplomatic and security ties, recognizing their shared interest in maintaining regional stability and security.\nSecurity and Defense Cooperation\nIndia and Sri Lanka have increasingly focused on enhancing security and defense cooperation to address shared challenges such as maritime security, counter-terrorism, and humanitarian assistance and disaster relief operations.\nJoint military exercises, high-level defense dialogues, and training exchanges are components of this growing security

Taiwan has also become a focal point between the US and China.\n\nEffect of policies and politics of the world on India\n\nGlobalization helps developing countries deal with the rest of the world and increase their economic growth, solving the poverty problems in their country. In the past, developing countries were not able to tap into the world economy due to trade barriers. They cannot share the same economic growth that developed countries have.\n\nHowever, with globalization, the World Bank and International Management encourage developing countries to go through market reforms and radical changes through large loans. Many developing nations began to take steps to open their markets by removing tariffs and freeing up their economies.\n\nThe developed countries were able to invest in the developing nations, creating job opportunities for the poor people. For example, rapid growth in India and China has caused world poverty to decrease.\n\nChina and India\u2019s development strategies\n\nChina and India have become global economic powers. Even at the market exchange rate, China overtook Japan in 2010 as the second-largest economy. China\u2019s trade and financial activities, India\u2019s emergence as a technology and innovation hub, and both countries\u2019 commerce and investment interactions with other developing nations have been covered extensively in all forms of media.\n\nThey are regarded as economic and political drivers of the international economy, particularly in the trade arena and global governance. Their economic engagement with developing countries and regions entails interactions in the areas of labor, human rights, international relations, security, and environmental sustainability.\n\nThe potential threats are mostly associated with trade and financial flows and with the social and political implications of China\u2019s financial outflows. Nevertheless, amid the recent global economic crises, China and India\u2019s demand for developing country goods proved to be a cushion to the declining flows of resources from advanced nations.\n\nChina and India influence global economic and political dynamics and can provide alternative sources of development assistance for developing countries. They can also provide several potential lessons for other developing countries, three of which are highlighted in this article: absorption of surplus labour, the raising of domestic and foreign investment, and support for R&D.\n\nIndia\u2019s stand on the Russia-Ukraine crisis\n\nIndia\u2019s response to the Ukraine crisis and the engaging geopolitical issues have unfolded a new chapter of foreign policy. Since the start of the Russia-Ukraine war on February 24, India has emphasized the need for diplomacy and dialogue while defending its independent stand, which prioritizes the country\u2019s energy and food security.\n\nRead:\u00a0India-Russia Relations\n\nIndia\u2019s foreign policy towards China and Pakistan\n\nIn the past decade, the world has also seen a change in India\u2019s stand against Pakistan and China. India is the only one in South Asia which is standing strong still against its Belt and Road Initiative since 2014.\n\nAlso, India has made its position very clear about the border-sharing area. In the Galwan clash in 2020, India had given a strong reply to China. India\u2019s revamped foreign policy has even given China a shockwave.\n\nIndia banned 59 Chinese mobile applications including the widely-used social media platforms such as TikTok, WeChat, and Helo keeping in view the threat to the nation\u2019s sovereignty and security. The majority of the apps banned in the June 29, 2020 order were red-flagged by intelligence agencies over concerns that they were collecting user data and possibly also sending them \u201coutside\u201d.\n\nThis action came after 20 Indian soldiers and an unspecified number of Chinese soldiers were killed during violent clashes in Galwan Valley in Eastern Ladakh amid border tensions with China. Standing like the \u201cGreat Wall of China\u201d India clears the clouds of doubts over its defence capabilities and also that New Delhi would stand idle.\n\nIndia is joining hands with various countries through QUAD, G20, BRICS, RIC, ASEAN, 12U2, SAARC plus, and many more to stand against China\u2019s ambitious goal of achieving its hegemony. It may seem like the old style of meandering but actually, India promotes its priorities in a much more direct manner.\n\nIndia growing closer to small island countries\n\nIndia\u2019s foreign policy is no longer paying attention to just developed nations like the US and Russia but also the small island countries.\n\nPrime Minister Narendra Modi launched the Initiative for the Resilient Island States (IRIS) for developing the infrastructure of small island nations, saying it gives new hope, new confidence, and satisfaction in doing something for the most vulnerable countries.\n\nRead:\u00a0India-Pacific Islands relations\n\nIndia and G-20 presidency\n\nIndia officially assumed the G20 presidency on December 1 with an agenda to achieve like here where the country\u2019s agenda will be cooperation for sustainable and equitable development for shared global peace and prosperity and capacity building to face emerging global challenges.\n\nAt the closing ceremony of the G20 Summit in Indonesia, PM Modi said that India\u2019s presidency will be \u201d inclusive, ambitious, decisive and action-oriented.\n\nEffect of policies and politics of developing nations on India\n\nThe South Asian region is also full of contradictions, disparities, and paradoxes. In the post-colonial period. South Asia has been a theatre of bloody inter-state as well as civil wars, it has witnessed liberation movements, nuclear rivalry, and military dictatorships and continues to suffer from insurgencies, religious fundamentalism, and terrorism, besides serious problems associated with drugs and human trafficking.\n\nThe region also has the dubious distinction of having over 540mn people who earn less than $ 1.25 a day and account for 44% of the developing world\u2019s poor. The region has produced several powerful female leaders and yet in the overall much remains to be done for the empowerment of women.\n\nOn the barometer of religious tolerance, the constituent countries range anywhere between flexible secular-minded, and rigidly fundamentalist.\n\nThe South Asian Association for Regional Cooperation (SAARC) has remained in existence for over 27 years; yet South Asia is considered the least integrated of the global regions; this is despite the stipulation in its Charter that \u201cbilateral and contentious issues shall be excluded\u201d from its deliberations, thus making it possible to put the contentious issues on the back burner and focus on areas of possible cooperation.\n\nOn the positive side, the region has been registering healthy growth (an average of 6% per annum) during the past several years. Also, democratic forms of governance (however flawed and feeble) are beginning to gain some ground in most parts of the region. Where does India stand in this rather volatile region? India\u2019s position is unique in more than one sense.\n\nAs a matter of an interesting geographic factor, India shares borders with all other South Asian nations whereas no other South Asian nation (except Afghanistan and Pakistan) shares borders with any other South Asian nation. Notwithstanding some shortcomings, democracy and the rule of law as instruments of political governance are well entrenched in India. The transfer of power has been more or less peaceful and transparent.\n\nIn relative terms, India can be arguably considered the most stable country in the region, moving ahead on the fast tracks of development, even though the growth has of late slowed down. Further in terms of its population, territory, GDP, image as an emerging world economy and a responsible de-facto nuclear State, and as a country that is destined to play a larger role in the international arena, and also for several other reasons, India stands apart amongst the bunch of other South Asian countries.\n\nIndia can be said to dwarf others in the South Asian region which in turn has created misperceptions about India and its intention. There are unjustified and erroneous perceptions about India floating around in the region: \u201cBig Brother bullying the smaller neighbor\u201d: \u201cIndia treats its neighbors as a neglected backyard\u201d etc. etc.\n\nThere is no justified explanation for the \u201ctrust deficit\u201d. On top of it, there are vested interests and lobbies for whom being anti-Indian is synonymous with being a patriot and nationalist. And then there are strong institutions within the framework of a more or less failed and rogue State in the neighbourhood (Pakistan) which would like to see relations with India in a state of perpetual suspension. India\u2019s motives are suspected even in cases of innocent proposals for economic cooperation which would lead to win-win situations.\n\nArticle written by Aseem Muhammed"

India was one of the first countries to recognize Myanmar\u2019s independence in 1948.\n\nThe national struggles of India and other colonial nations took place at the same time.\n\nJawaharlal Nehru, the first prime minister of India and minister of external affairs, had close ties with the founding elites of various Asian and African nations.\nUp until 1935, Burma was a component of the British Indian Empire. Nehru had a close relationship with Aung San, the man who founded modern Burma.\n\nIndia and Burma had strong ties in the first ten years following their respective independence, and in 1951 they signed a Treaty of Friendship pledging \u201ceverlasting peace and unalterable friendship\u201d between them. They both were members of the Non-Aligned Movement as well.\n\nThe 1962 military coup led by General U Ne Win that marked the end of constitutional democracy in the country also damaged ties with India.\n\nThe inward orientation of the junta, repression of minorities, and expulsion of foreigners, including ethnic Indians, created a rift between them.\n\nIndia supported Aung San\u2019s family, especially his daughter, Aung San Suu Kyi, in their fight for democracy, and granted political asylum to former Prime Minister U Nu when he was exiled by the Ne Win regime.\nIndia-Myanmar Economic relations\n\nIndia is Burma\u2019s 4th largest trading partner after Thailand, China, and Singapore, and second largest export market after Thailand, absorbing 25 percent of its total exports.\n\nMyanmar\u2019s major exports to India are agricultural products like beans, pulses, and maize and forest products such as teak and hardwoods.\nIts imports from India include chemical products, pharmaceuticals, electrical appliances, and transport equipment.\n\nIndia and Myanmar share a land border, and several border trade points are facilitating the exchange of goods.\n\nKaladan Multi-Modal Transit Transport Project: India has invested in infrastructure projects like the Kaladan project, aiming to improve connectivity between the northeastern states of India and the Bay of Bengal through Myanmar.\n\nRead:\u00a0India\u2019s connectivity projects\n\nIndia-Myanmar Regional/sub-regional cooperation\n\nASEAN: Myanmar became a member of ASEAN in July 1997.

Indian prestige and moral authority were high in the 1950s and facilitated the acquisition of developmental assistance from both East and West.\n\nAlthough the prestige stemmed from India\u2019s nonaligned stance, the nation could not prevent Cold War politics from becoming intertwined with interstate relations in South Asia.\n\nIn the 1960s and 1970s, India\u2019s international position among developed and developing countries faded in the course of wars with China and Pakistan, disputes with other countries in South Asia, and India\u2019s attempt to balance Pakistan\u2019s support from the United States and China by signing the Indo-Soviet Treaty of Friendship and Cooperation in August 1971.\n\nAlthough India obtained substantial Soviet military and economic aid, which helped to strengthen the nation, India\u2019s influence was undercut regionally and internationally by the perception that its friendship with the Soviet Union prevented a more forthright condemnation of the Soviet presence in Afghanistan.\n\nIn the late 1980s, India improved relations with the United States, other developed countries, and China while continuing close ties with the Soviet Union. Relations with its South Asian neighbors, especially Pakistan, Sri Lanka, and Nepal, occupied much of the energies of the Ministry of External Affairs,\n\nAfter the September 11 attacks in 2001, Indian intelligence agencies provided the US with significant information on Al-Qaeda and related groups\u2019 activities in Pakistan and Afghanistan.\n\nIndia\u2019s extensive contribution to the War on Terror, coupled with a surge in its economy, has helped India\u2019s diplomatic relations with several countries.\n\nOver the past three years, India has held numerous joint military exercises with US and European nations that have resulted in a strengthened US-India and EU-India bilateral relationship. India\u2019s bilateral trade with Europe and the United States has more than doubled in the last five years.\n\nBilateral Groupings and Agreements\n\nIndia-United States Strategic Partnership:\n\nThe U.S. and India have developed a strategic partnership covering defense, economic, and technological cooperation.\nThe U.S.-India Nuclear Deal (2008) marked a significant milestone in the bilateral relationship.\n\nIndia-Russia Strategic Partnership:\n\nIndia and Russia share a longstanding strategic partnership, with cooperation in defense, space, and energy sectors.\nDefense agreements, including arms deals and joint military exercises, strengthen the bilateral ties.\n\nIndia-China Relations:\n\nDespite border tensions, India and China engage in bilateral talks and participate in forums like BRICS and SCO.\nTrade agreements and border management discussions are essential components of the relationship.\n\nIndia-Israel Partnership:\n\nIndia and Israel collaborate in the defense, agriculture, and technology sectors.\nBilateral agreements focus on counter-terrorism, cybersecurity, and innovation.\n\nIndia-Japan Strategic Partnership:\n\nIndia and Japan have a strategic partnership with a focus on economic collaboration, infrastructure development, and defense ties.\nJoint initiatives include the Asia-Africa Growth Corridor (AAGC) and the Quadrilateral Security Dialogue (Quad).\nSome of the global groupings\n\nThe following are the global groupings.\n\nIndia and UN\nIndia was one of the founding members of the UN.\nIndia has contributed soldiers to peacekeeping missions in Korea, Egypt, Congo, Somalia, Lebanon, Rwanda, and South Sudan\nPart of G4 (Brazil, India, Japan, Germany- primary motive is to gain an UNCS permanent seat), G77 (a loose coalition of developing countries for better bargaining; now has 134 members, not 77)\nIndia was amongst the most outspoken critics of apartheid and racial discrimination in South Africa, being the first country to have raised the issue in the UN (in 1946)\nIn 1953, Vijaylakshmi Pandit was elected the first woman President of the GA UNITED NATIONS\nKashmir issue: In 1948, the United Kingdom, which was hoping to avoid being seen as unfriendly to a Muslim state after the creation of Israel, used pressure tactics on its allies France, Canada, and the US to support the Pakistani viewpoint that Kashmir\u2019s accession to India was disputable and had to be put to the test of a plebiscite. To this day, Indian strategic commentators and critics of Nehru bemoan his cardinal mistake of taking the Kashmir dispute to a UN that was packed with pro-Pakistani partisan powers. Nehru did not appreciate that the UN was an institution of power politics, not an impartial police force\nSecurity Council members of the US, United Kingdom, and France tried to prevent India from forcibly absorbing the Portuguese colony of Goa in 1961. But for the Soviet Union veto in favor of India, Goa would\u2019ve become a disputed territory like Kashmir.\nFollowing the 1962 conflict with China, India became involved in two wars with Pakistan and entered a period of political instability, economic stagnation, food shortages, and near-famine conditions. India\u2019s role diminished in the UN which came both as a result of its image and a deliberate decision by the post-Nehru political leadership to adopt a low profile at the UN and speak only on vital Indian interests\nDemand for a permanent seat on the SC (described in the SC section above)\nIndia and the IMF\nIndia hasn\u2019t taken any funding from the IMF since 1993, and all repayments for past loans were completed in the year 2000\nIndia has about 2.75% shareholdings and ranks 17th in voting rights amongst 24 voting constituencies (India, Bangladesh, and Sri Lanka form a single constituency)\nIndia and the World Bank\nIndia is a member of IBRD, IDA, IFC, and MIGA, but not of ICSID.\nMain assistance by IBRD has been provided for roads and highways, energy, urban infrastructure (including WATSAN), rural credit, disaster management, and financial services.\nThe major sectors of IDA assistance provided are health education, agriculture, and poverty reduction sectors.\nA key feature of the current strategy of the World Bank in India is its focus on supporting low-income and special-category states, where many of India\u2019s poor and disadvantaged live.\nThe new strategy proposes a lending program of $3 billion to $5 billion each year over 2013-17. 60% of the financing will go to state government-backed projects.

During this time, China also intervened in Tibet\u2019s affairs. The Bhutanese-Tibetan conflicts led to Bhutan\u2019s military expedition against the Tibetans.\nThe British, who controlled India, mediated in the Bhutanese-Tibetan conflicts and the Sino-Tibetan disputes. The Treaty of Sinchula (1865) between the British and Bhutan established new borders for Bhutan, but these agreements did not involve China directly.\nIn the 1950s, China invaded Tibet and asserted its authority over the region. This event had implications for Bhutan, as China began to claim Bhutanese territories in the border regions, particularly in the Chumbi Valley.\n\nBhutan\u2019s approach to its relationship with China has been cautious, given its geographical location and the influence of neighboring India. Bhutan\u2019s king, Jigme Singye Wangchuck, introduced a policy of \u201cOne Nation, Two Systems,\u201d similar to China\u2019s \u201cOne Country, Two Systems\u201d approach, to maintain its unique cultural and political identity while fostering relations with both India and China.\n\nBhutan-China relations\n\nThe boundary between Bhutan and China has been disputed for decades. The two countries have engaged in several rounds of talks to resolve their border issues, with no final resolution to date.\n\nThe main point of contention is the Doklam plateau, a strategically important region near the India-Bhutan-China trijunction.\n\nSino-Bhutan Border Talks: Bhutan and China engaged in border negotiations in the 1980s and 1990s to address their territorial disputes. These discussions included the boundary in the Chumbi Valley and the northern Bhutanese regions of Doklam and Jakarlung. However, no final resolution was reached.\nDoklam Standoff (2017): The Doklam Plateau, a region claimed by both Bhutan and China, became the center of international attention in 2017. A military standoff occurred between Indian and Chinese troops in the region, as India supported Bhutan\u2019s claim. The standoff eventually led to a diplomatic resolution, with both sides agreeing to withdraw their forces.\n\nBhutan-China have continued to engage in diplomacy and border discussions to resolve their disputes and improve bilateral relations.\n\nBhutan has historically pursued a policy of maintaining good relations with both China and India. India has played a significant role in Bhutan\u2019s security and foreign policy.\nWhile border disputes and territorial claims have been points of contention, Bhutan and China have also engaged in trade and diplomatic exchanges. China is one of Bhutan\u2019s major trading partners.\nBhutan has maintained a cautious and moral stance in its dealings with China to safeguard its territorial sovereignty. It has sought to maintain its independence and autonomy in the face of its much larger neighbor.\n\nBhutan\u2019s \u201cTwo Neighbors\u201d Policy:\n\nBhutan follows a \u201ctwo neighbors\u201d policy, emphasizing friendly relations with both India and China. While its ties with India are deep-rooted and multilayered, Bhutan also recognizes the importance of having a working relationship with China.\nBhutan has not recognized Tibet as part of China. This has been a sensitive issue in Sino-Bhutanese relations as China considers Tibet to be an integral part of its territory.\nCultural and people-to-people exchanges have taken place between Bhutan and China, particularly in the fields of art, culture, and Buddhism. Bhutan has hosted delegations from China and has encouraged dialogue on cultural exchanges.\nBhutan and China have explored the potential for cooperation in the field of hydropower. China has expressed interest in investing in Bhutan\u2019s hydropower sector, which is a significant source of revenue for the Bhutanese economy.\nIndia-Bhutan Relations\n\nIndia-Bhutan relations were diplomatically established in 1968 with the establishment of a special office of India in Thimphu. The basic framework of India-Bhutan bilateral relations is the Treaty of Friendship and Cooperation signed in 1949 between the two countries and revised in February 2007.\n\nIndia has been extending economic assistance to Bhutan\u2019s socio-economic development since the early 1960s when Bhutan launched its Five Year Plans.\n\nThe key areas of focus of India\u2019s assistance include agriculture and irrigation development, ICT, health, industrial development, road transport, energy, civil aviation, urban development, human resource development, capacity building, scholarship, education and culture.\nMutually beneficial hydro-power cooperation with Bhutan forms the core of bilateral economic cooperation. For Bhutan, hydro-power development continues to be a vital catalyst for socio-economic development.\nIndia is Bhutan\u2019s largest trading partner. Major exports from India to Bhutan are mineral products, machinery and mechanical appliances, electrical equipment, base metals, vehicles, vegetable products, plastics, and articles.\nThe major items of export from Bhutan to India are electricity, ferrosilicon, portland cement, dolomite, carbides of calcium carbides of silicon, cement clinkers, timber, and wood products, potatoes, cardamom, and fruit products.\nRecent developments\n\n2024: Bhutan plans for a regional economic hub at Gelephu, a town bordering Assam in India.\n\nThe plan, launched by Bhutan\u2019s King Jigme Khesar Namgyel Wangchuck in December 2023, is to build a \u201cGelephu Mindfulness City\u201d (GMC) with a unique Bhutanese architectural blueprint across 1,000 square kilometers, as a special administrative zone with separate, investor-friendly laws.\nAs a carbon-neutral city, Gelephu would include only non-polluting industries (mainly IT, education, hotel, and hospital sectors), and would be promoted as an investment destination and health and wellness hub in the middle of the region.\nIt would also lie at the crossroads of India\u2019s \u201cAct East\u201d plans for connectivity to Myanmar, and on to the Association of Southeast Asian Nations and the Indo-Pacific region as well as the new India-Japan connectivity plans between India\u2019s north-eastern States through Bangladesh to the Bay of Bengal and Indian Ocean.\nIndia-Bhutan-China: The trijunction\n\nBhutan\u2019s relationship with India is historically strong, and India plays a significant role in Bhutan\u2019s security and foreign policy. India and Bhutan have a close strategic partnership, and India has supported Bhutan in its border negotiations with China.\n\nBhutan and China have engaged in trade relations, particularly in the form of border trade. Bhutan exports products like cardamom, oranges, and other goods to China. However, trade is relatively limited compared to Bhutan\u2019s trade with India.\nBhutan practices cautious and pragmatic diplomacy with China. It has sought to avoid getting embroiled in broader geopolitical tensions, such as the India-China border dispute, by focusing on its specific border issues and maintaining a neutral stance.\n\nBhutan is uniquely dependent on India; thus, India has been supportive of Bhutan\u2019s attempts to normalize relations with China in exchange for India\u2019s red lines and security concerns.\n\nOne such red line will be keeping China away from the ridges in southern Doklam that overlook India\u2019s \u201cSiliguri corridor.\nBeijing and Thimphu are contemplating a swap between areas in the northern valleys, where Bhutan is facing significant Chinese pressure, and on the western Doklam plateau.\nMeanwhile, border negotiations will probably continue, with Thimphu taking its time normalizing relations and allowing China to have a permanent diplomatic representation.\n\nIndia now has to decide how best to safeguard its interests. India would be better serving its interests by coordinating with Bhutan.\n\nIndia\u2019s interests won\u2019t necessarily be jeopardized by a border agreement that preserves India\u2019s red lines in the west while attending to Bhutanese concerns in the north.\nIndia should approach the border discussions with a better knowledge of Bhutan\u2019s logic and confidence that its long-trusted neighbor will take into account both India\u2019s and its interests before reaching a final deal, instead of reacting in haste.\n\nIndia has strategic interests in Bhutan due to its location, and Bhutan has been a key ally for India in the region. A closer Bhutan-China relationship may lead to concerns about security and influence in the Himalayan region.\n\nBhutan\u2019s relationship with China could be seen as part of the broader geopolitical competition in Asia. India, China, and other major powers are vying for influence in the region, and Bhutan\u2019s alignment can be viewed in this context.\nHistorically, India has had a significant influence on Bhutan\u2019s foreign policy. A more independent Bhutan could reduce India\u2019s leverage in the region and limit its ability to shape Bhutan\u2019s strategic decisions.\nAs Bhutan develops economic ties with China, there may be concerns about the extent of economic dependence and potential strings attached to Chinese investments.

In addition, it must demonstrate several requirements. These are:\n\nCrude oil and/or product reserves equivalent to 90 days of the previous year\u2019s net imports, to which the government has immediate access (even if it does not own them directly) and could be used to address disruptions to global oil supply;\nA demand restraint program to reduce national oil consumption by up to 10%;\nLegislation and organization to operate the Co-ordinated Emergency Response Measures (CERM) on a national basis;\nLegislation and measures to ensure that all oil companies under its jurisdiction report information upon request;\nMeasures are in place to ensure the capability of contributing its share of an IEA collective action.\nIndia and IEA\n\nThe International Energy Agency (IEA) invited India, the world\u2019s third-largest energy consumer, to become its full-time member. India has been an Associate member since 2017.\n\nAccording to the recent IEA report, India is expected to overtake China by 2027, in terms of annual growth in demand for crude oil, aided by a growing industrial and economic base as well as rising urbanization and expanding middle class.\n\nIEA has been monitoring India\u2019s presence in the global energy scene and considers its membership a valuable addition.\n\nEnergy demand in India is growing rapidly with major implications for the global energy market.\nThe Government of India has made remarkable progress in providing access to electricity and clean cooking while implementing a range of energy market reforms and integrating a high share of renewable energy sources into the grid.\nIndia continues to develop the institutional framework needed to attract the investment required to satisfy this growing energy need.\nElectricity security has improved through the creation of one national power system and major investments in clean energy.\nIndia is now working on integrating higher shares of variable renewable energy into the energy mix.\nIndia has also been prioritizing access to electricity and clean cooking.\nThe Government of India is continuing to focus on providing secure, affordable, and sustainable energy while achieving its ambitious renewable energy targets and reducing local air pollution.\n\nIndia has been wary of joining the Agency even though it has been engaging with the agency since 1998.\n\nThe IEA\u2019s rationale for inviting non-OECD countries to join is evident, as the agency benefits from the growing association of emerging economies by gaining access to their data and by adding to the oil stockpiles in the event of supply disruptions.\nGiven the IEA\u2019s growing role in combating climate change, it allows the promotion of clean energy technologies in some of the world\u2019s largest carbon emitters.\nWay forward\n\nWhat additional benefits would India gain as a member of the IEA over and above what it has achieved as a non-member?\n\nThe answer is associated with the government\u2019s goal of electricity for all and meeting the Paris Agreement\u2019s\u00a0Climate change targets.\n\nIt will provide India with the geopolitical platform to take the lead in climate and energy issues.\nAs a major developing country, it can benefit from being the voice on the platform especially with its International Solar Alliance (ISA) initiative.\n\nThe ISA offers India a platform to establish itself as a pioneer in the global energy and environmental arenas.\n\nCollaboration with other multilateral organizations, such as the UN, IEA, IRENA (International Renewable Energy Agency), as well as corporations and industry, among others, is crucial because these will help in adapting the technologies needed by developing member countries to their unique conditions and economic realities.\nThis is important because the success of the initiative will largely depend on the number of countries that join.\nGiven that the IEA oversees more than 70% of worldwide energy use, India\u2019s participation in the organization will significantly raise its significance in terms of global energy governance.\nThe IEA may also push financial institutions to support India\u2019s energy policies, notably its solar energy initiative. This is the final and most crucial point.\n\n\u00ad-Article by Swathi Satish"

Most commodities are transported by road due to a lack of multimodal transportation infrastructure, which raises the cost of transportation.\n\nMyanmar\u2019s regional neighbours are ahead of it in terms of logistical performance.\nThe expense of conducting business is further increased by the lack of consistency and transparency in border processes.\nStakeholders also take issue with the numerous legal and informal toll gates that are situated along key thoroughfares, such as the road between Yangon and Hpa-An (which is a part of the East-West Economic Corridor), increasing expenses and delays.\nEnhancing Myanmar\u2019s physical connection can benefit the nation\u2019s physical and commercial corridors as well as its bilateral relations with India.\nIndia-ASEAN Connectivity projects\nMekong-India Economic Corridor (MIEC): Involves the integration of four Mekong countries \u2013 Vietnam, Myanmar, Thailand, and Cambodia \u2013 along with India, connecting Ho Chi Minh City, Dawei, Bangkok, and Phnom Penh with Chennai.\nIndia-Myanmar-Thailand Trilateral highway project: Will connect Moreh (Manipur, India) to Mae Sot (Thailand) via Myanmar.\n\nThe massive increase in road, rail, and bridge constructions in North East India is partly due to China\u2019s large-scale development initiatives in Tibet\u2019s fortification and the construction of a gateway to ASEAN and other adjacent nations.\n\nIndia-middle East and Central Asia connectivity projects\n\nDue to their landlocked status and lack of overland connectivity with India, the development of regional connectivity is crucial for boosting trade and commerce between India and the Central Asian nations.\n\nIndia plans deeper connectivity with the Middle East to counter China\u2019s footprint in Gulf.\n\nA new ambitious connectivity project aims to link the Middle East to India through roads, rails, and seaports\nChahbahar Port: Located in the Sistan-Balochistan province on the energy-rich Iran\u2019s southern coast, the Chabahar Port is being developed by India and Iran to boost connectivity and trade ties.\nInternational North-South Transport Corridor: A 7,200-km-long multi-mode transport project for moving freight among India, Iran, Afghanistan, Armenia, Azerbaijan, Russia, Central Asia, and Europe.\n\nA new ambitious project aims to link New Delhi to the Middle East, an idea that developed during the meetings of the I2U2 group.\n\nThe proposed initiative shows that India and the United States are ready to make joint efforts to counter China beyond the Indo-Pacific region and into the Middle East.\n\nRead: India-Middle East-Europe Economic Corridor (IMEC)\n\nDomestic connectivity projects\n\nGolden Quadrilateral Project: Golden Quadrilateral is a network of highways connecting India\u2019s four top metropolitan cities, namely Delhi, Mumbai, Chennai, and Kolkata, thereby, forming a quadrilateral. The largest highway project in India, the Golden Quadrilateral Project was launched in 2001 as part of the National Highways Development Project (NHDP).\nIndustrial and freight corridor projects: The government launched the National Infrastructure Pipeline (NIP) for FY 2019-25, under which projects have been identified to construct, refurbish, strengthen, and expand road networks, housing, urban development, railways, conventional power, renewable energy, and irrigation.

At the same time, lowering intraregional trade costs would provide trade access to the underprivileged.\n\nPrelims Question\n\nQ) With reference to India\u2019s projects on connectivity, consider the following statements:\n\nEast-West Corridor under the Golden Quadrilateral Project connects Dibrugarh and Surat.\nThe Trilateral Highway connects Moreh in Manipur and Chiang Mai in Thailand via Myanmar.\nBangladesh \u2013 China -India \u2013 Myanmar Economic Corridor connects Varanasi in Uttar Pradesh with Kunming in China.\n\nHow many of the above statements are correct?\n\nOnly one\nOnly two\nAll three\nNone\n\nRelated Posts:\n\nSecurity Challenges and Their Management in Border Areas\nCross-Border Insolvency\nCarbon Border Adjustment Mechanism (CBAM)\nIndia-China Border Disputes \u2013 What is the Doklam Issue?\nRedrawal of National Boundaries\nNeighbourhood first policy\nTAPI pipeline\n\n\u00ad-Article written by Swathi Satish"

English is also commonly spoken in these nations.\nSignificant Indian diaspora populations, particularly in Fiji, have contributed to the development of interpersonal relationships.\nA sizeable section of the population of Fiji is made up of the descendants of indentured servants who were transported to the islands by the British in the late 19th and early 20th centuries.\nPacific Islands\n\nThe Cook Islands, Fiji, Kiribati, Marshall Islands, Micronesia, Nauru, Niue, Palau, Papua New Guinea, Samoa, Solomon Islands, Tonga, Tuvalu, and Vanuatu are among the 14 countries that make up the Pacific Islands, often known as Pacific Island Countries (PICs).\n\nThe PICs are rich in culture and natural beauty despite facing particular difficulties including climate change and water constraints.\nThey are now a crucial region that is receiving more attention from major world powers, including China, the US, and India, who are all seeking influence through alliances in the areas of security, trade, and development.\n\nAlso read: India-Philippines Relations\n\nForum for India-Pacific Islands Cooperation (FIPIC)\n\nThe Forum for India\u2013Pacific Islands Cooperation (FIPIC) was launched in Fiji in 2014.\n\nFIPIC includes 14 island countries \u2013 Cook Islands, Fiji, Kiribati, Marshall Islands, Micronesia, Nauru, Niue, Palau, Papua New Guinea, Samoa, Solomon Islands, Tonga, Tuvalu, and Vanuatu.\n\nIndia\u2019s focus has largely been on the Indian Ocean where it has sought to play a major role and protect its strategic and commercial interests.\nThe FIPIC initiative marks a serious effort to expand India\u2019s engagement in the Pacific region.\n\nIndia had offered some major assistance projects through FIPIC:\n\nspecial USD one million funds for adapting to climate change and clean energy\nestablishing a trade office in India\nPan Pacific Islands e-network to improve digital connectivity\nextending visa on arrival at Indian airports for all the 14 Pacific Island countries\ncooperation in space technology applications for improving the quality of life of the islands\ntraining to diplomats from Pacific Island countries.\nIndia has increased the annual \u201cGrant-in-Aid\u201d to each of the 14 Pacific Countries for community projects of their choice and launched a new Visitors Programme for Pacific Island Countries.\n\nIndia unveiled a 12-point action plan during the third Forum for India-Pacific Islands Cooperation Summit:\n\nHealthcare infrastructure development: India pledged to boost healthcare infrastructure in the islands, with a particular focus on building a 100-bed regional super-specialty hospital in Fiji.\nRegional IT and cyber security training hub: To address the growing challenges in the digital realm, India plans to establish a regional IT and cybersecurity training hub in Papua New Guinea.\nJaipur foot camps: India promises to organize Jaipur Foot Camps in the region every year, helping provide prosthetic limbs to those in need.\nSolar projects: Acknowledging the potential of renewable energy, India intends to implement solar projects to assist these nations in their energy requirements.\nDesalination units: To combat water scarcity issues in these islands, India has committed to providing desalination units.\nSea ambulances: Aiming to improve emergency medical services, India plans to provide sea ambulances for all 14 Pacific Island countries.\nDialysis units: As part of healthcare infrastructure improvement, India plans to establish dialysis units to help address kidney-related health issues in the region.\nRound-the-clock helpline: To provide immediate assistance and support, India promises to establish a 24/7 helpline service.\nIndia involves a commitment to human-centric development\naddressing climate change\nenhancing trade relations\nfacilitating capacity building in these nations.\nImportance of India-Pacific Islands Relations\nThough the Pacific Island countries are relatively small in land area and distant from India, many have large exclusive economic zones (EEZs) and offer promising possibilities for fruitful cooperation.\nThe Act East Policy of India, the Indo-Pacific Vision, and the Forum for India-Pacific Islands Cooperation (FIPIC) all contribute to the strategic importance of this partnership.\nIndia\u2019s presence might function as a counterbalance to China\u2019s influence, which is also quite active in the area. Indian efforts to counter China\u2019s expanding influence can benefit from closer connections with the Pacific Islands.\nFor Indian firms, the Pacific Islands can provide considerable economic potential, notably in industries like healthcare, information technology, renewable energy, and infrastructure development.\nIndia\u2019s Indo-Pacific Oceans Initiatives (IPOI), launched in 2019, draws on the cooperation mechanisms to focus on seven pillars, which include maritime security, marine ecology, and marine resources. This aligns well with the Pacific Islanders\u2019 goal to create a sustainable blue economy in the region.\n\nFor the Island nations Indian partnership can be fruitful in numerous ways:\n\nIndia in multilateral fora like the UN and COP26 has been leading the conversation on climate change and its repercussions on low-income countries.\nIndia can become a key player in the Blue Pacific 2050 strategy along with its partners like Australia to boost sustainable growth in the region.\nWhile China\u2019s investments focus mainly on infrastructure and military aid, India can look at capacity-building as its key focus in the region.\nIndia has already made strides in building capacity in the South Pacific and has helped these countries become self-sufficient in fulfilling their energy requirements.\nConsidering its \u201ccommitment to advancing development priorities of the PICs\u201d, India can help strengthen disaster risk resilience capacities to guarantee long-term growth.\nIndia is set to carve new areas of cooperation with the PICs in areas such as digital economy and information technology.\nPacific Islands are the hub of natural and mineral resources. While New Delhi has diversified its investments and aid which was previously only limited to Papua New Guinea and Fiji, it is yet to identify the full potential of its trade relations with the other island countries.\nWay forward\n\nIndia has to make the most of its long-standing presence in the southern Pacific to fill a gap in the region\u2019s capacity-building needs.\n\nIndia can significantly contribute in two crucial areas: the development of renewable energy sources and the mitigation of climate change.\n\nTogether with the Blue Pacific Strategy, India\u2019s ambitious COP26 energy and climate change pledges have the potential to propel a significant, sustainably oriented economy in the Indo-Pacific.\n\nAdditionally, the Pacific nations\u2019 efforts to combat challenges like climate change and renewable energy may benefit from India\u2019s initiatives like the IPOI and its leadership in the International Solar Alliance (ISA). India can now play a stabilizing role for the benefit of the nations in the Southern Pacific.\n\n-Article written by Swathi Satish"

The country resisted Russian expansion and held vast territories in Eastern Europe.\n\nTipu Sultan of Mysore viewed the expansion of the British as a threat to the entire Islamic World and called the English \u201cthe enemies of the faith\u201d. He desired the Turkish Sultan to lead a crusade against the Europeans.\nFor this purpose, Tipu Sultan sent an ambassador to Constantinople in 1784.\n\nMore recent historical contacts between India and Turkey were reflected in the medical mission led by renowned Indian freedom fighter, Dr. M.A. Ansari, to Turkey in 1912 during the Balkan Wars and the Khilafat movement (1919- 1924).\n\nDuring World War I, The British were part of the allies\u2019 campaign against Ottoman Turkey in which numerous Indian soldiers also participated.

India is a popular travel destination because of its numerous World Heritage Sites and unparalleled cultural vibrancy.\nSince time immemorial, India has been regarded as the land of ancient history, legacy, and culture, which is the main reason for its current stratospheric ascent in the tourism sector.\nOver the years, India has had numerous kings, and each of them had an impact on Indian culture. Different cultures have left their mark on dance, music, celebrations, architecture, traditional customs, food, and languages.\nThe richness and diversity of India\u2019s heritage and culture can be attributed to the influence of all these different cultures. This cultural wealth helps to project India as the top destination for cultural tourism, boosting that industry in India.\nTo promote cultural tourism in India, the Indian government established the Ministry of Tourism and Culture. The ministry recently launched the \u201cIncredible India!\u201d campaign, which has contributed to the expansion of India\u2019s cultural tourism industry.\nVarious sites of cultural tourism centres in India\n\nIndia\u2019s diversity is a result of the country\u2019s mixture of religious and cultural traditions. The nation is home to a large number of world historic monuments that have an enticing influence and have long drawn visitors from around the world. We would be delighted to familiarise ourselves with the many customs and civilizations that make up India\u2019s cultural heritage.\n\nThe Pushkar fair (Rajasthan), Taj Mahotsav (Uttar Pradesh), and Suraj Kund mela are just a few of the fairs and festivals that travellers can attend in India (Haryana). sites include the Taj Mahal (Uttar Pradesh), the Hawa Mahal (Uttar Pradesh), Hampi (Karnataka), the Ajanta & Ellora caves (Maharashtra), and Mahabalipuram (Tamil Nadu) (Rajasthan).\n\nRajasthan is the most popular state in India for cultural tourism among the several states. Rajasthan is known for having a rich cultural legacy, which is the reason behind this. The state is well known for its numerous exquisite palaces and forts that highlight Rajasthan\u2019s rich cultural heritage. Rajasthan\u2019s rich cultural legacy is also reflected in the numerous folk songs and music. Rajasthan has many festivals and fairs, including the camel festival, the Marwar festival, and the Pushkar festival. All of these draw a lot of people to Rajasthan since they allow them to experience the state\u2019s vibrant culture.\n\nTamil Nadu is renowned for cultural tourism in India as well because it exhibits Dravidian customs and culture. Its numerous temples reflect India\u2019s rich cultural heritage. Numerous tourist attractions in Uttar Pradesh attest to the nation\u2019s rich cultural heritage. The Taj Mahal in Agra is the most well-known structure. Many tourists also go to Uttar Pradesh cities like Varanasi, Allahabad, Vrindavan, and Ayodhya because they capture exquisite scenes from India.\n\nIn India, Uttaranchal is renowned for its cultural tourism industry. The Himalayas, known as the \u201cabode of the Gods,\u201d are located in this state.

The HRIDAY programme seeks to preserve cultural assets while also promoting urban planning and historic cities\u2019 economic development.\nThe National Heritage City Development and Augmentation Yojana places a strong emphasis on the heritage cities\u2019 accessibility, security, safety, way of life, cleanliness, and quick service delivery.\nBuddhist Tourism Circuit\nThe Buddhist circuit is a route that follows in the footsteps of the Buddha from Lumbini in Nepal where he was born, through Bihar in India where he attained enlightenment, to Sarnath and Kushinagar in Uttar Pradesh in India, where he gave his first teachings and his final resting place.\nKushinagar is the centre of the Buddhist circuit, which consists of pilgrimage sites at Lumbini, Sarnath, and Gaya.\nPalace on Wheels\nA luxurious tourist train is called The Palace on Wheels. To promote tourism in Rajasthan, it was started by the Indian Railways in collaboration with the Rajasthan Tourism Development Corporation. The name has since changed to Heritage Palace on Wheels.\nIn August 2009, the train service underwent renovations and was reopened with new furnishings, itineraries, and menus.\nThe idea for the Palace on Wheels came from the historical royal significance of the coaches, which were designed to serve as the private trains for the former kings of Rajputana, Baroda, the Nizam of Hyderabad, and primarily the Viceroy of British India.\nEach saloon showcases the state\u2019s cultural character through the use of furnishings, handicrafts, paintings, and other decorations. The interior of the train was designed by Rashmi Gupta, an architect from Jaipur.\n\nWhat is being done to promote cultural tourism in India?\n\nThe tourist industry has been growing as a result of numerous causes. Let\u2019s look at them now:\n\nHospitality and food\nThe Indian hospitality industry is a major contributor to this expansion. The public and commercial hospitality sectors have developed adequate resorts and hotels that offer excellent conventional and delectable options to tourists to accommodate and feed them.\nAdditionally, eating has given visitors to India another reason to go. This nation provides a wide variety of culinary delicacies that are practically unmatched.\nActivities and events\nIndian Council for Cultural Relations (ICCR) and MCT (Ministry of Culture & Tourism) have worked together to promote Indian culture throughout the world. To accomplish this, several Indian Cultural Centers on both the national and international levels organise a variety of programmes and events, including yoga coaching, music, dance, and language classes in Hindi and Sanskrit.\nTo promote the culture and variety of the nation, there are various activities like festival celebrations and art exhibitions. Through a Global Engagement Scheme, the Ministry of Culture also promotes Indian culture abroad. In this programme, Indian festivals are promoted and various cultural organisations abroad receive financial and infrastructural assistance.\nCreation of world-class\u00a0tourism infrastructure\nThe Swadesh Darshan programme, which was introduced by the Indian Tourism Ministry, has been another step done by the Indian government. It aided in the creation of theme-based circuits that cater to both mainstream tourist and specialist markets.\nUnder this programme, world-class infrastructure has been built to promote Indian culture and history. 27 projects totalling 2261.50 crores have been approved for 21 states and Union Territories since 2015.\nGeneration of tourism markets abroad\nThrough a marketing strategy and integrated campaigns using international media, the Indian Tourism Ministry has been pushing India as a top travel destination.\nSince October 2021, the top 20 source markets abroad have seen all of these promotional activities carried out by the synergized combination of all the tourism offices abroad.\nFor instance, proposals for organising events with themes like Spirit of Gujarat in nations with a Gujarati Diaspora have been sent to the Indian government. Gujarat\u2019s culture and heritage will be the main focus of this event.\nAzadi Ka Amrit Mahotsav is another festival with a distinct subject that would be promoted on Independence Day and Republic Day of India. It would foster a sense of pride in one\u2019s country and emphasise how the people contributed significantly to India\u2019s independence.\nAnother instance of this project is the International Buddhist Conclave, which takes place every two years. This gathering celebrates Buddhist heritage.\nAdditional initiatives are taken by the Government of India\nIssuing the Tourist e-Visa to a chosen few nations is another effective government measure that would help India\u2019s tourism grow. Teams have been chosen by the Indian government to take part in significant travel shows and international tourism expos. Several roadshows have also been held to advertise India as a tourist destination.\nIn addition to all these activities, the government is also setting up training courses and workshops to attract qualified people to this profession. Here, providing a better experience is the goal.\nEasy setup of tourism businesses\nThe Indian Ministry of Tourism has made conducting business easier and assisted in establishing Web-based Delivery Systems for the general population.\nTo make the process of submitting business applications for government approval transparent, it recognises the Trade and Travel Service Providers and aids hotels and resorts in classifying under a single directory. With effect from January 2016, this was done online along with the integration of payment gateways.\nDevelopment of a mobile app\nThe Indian Tourism Ministry introduced the Swachh Paryatan mobile application in February 2016. This enables citizens to report any problems with sanitation and hygienic conditions at different national tourist attractions.\nScaling greater heights\nThe government\u2019s measures will be essential moving ahead to build a sustainable system that will attract new participants to the cultural tourism sector while bolstering the performance of the current ones.\nHowever, there is still much to learn about the enormous potential of India\u2019s cultural tourism sector. If properly developed, this industry can increase its GDP contribution to India and increase employment possibilities there. To do this, it is necessary to stimulate related industries including transportation, infrastructure, lodging, and hospitality.\nIn news\n\nThe Government of India under the Ministry of Culture has initiated the National Mission on Cultural Mapping (NMCM). The aims and Objectives of the Project are as under:\n\nTo create awareness about the strengths of cultural heritage and its interface with development and cultural identity.\nCultural Mapping of 6.5 Lakh villages along with their geographical, demographic profiles, and creative capitals.\nCreation of National Registers of Artists and Art Practices.\nDevelopment of a web portal and mobile app to function as a National Cultural Work Place \u00a0\u00a0(NCWP).\n\nThe project aims to cover all the inhabited villages of India which is marked as \u2018village\u2019, in the Census List, 2011 published by the Registrar General and Census Commissioner of India, including all the inhabited villages of Bihar.\u00a0 Therefore, all the villages of Bihar will be covered under Cultural Mapping.\n\nConclusion\n\nThe government is paying attention to India\u2019s expanding cultural tourism industry and taking the necessary steps to support it in maintaining this development. The industry, however, still has a lot of unrealized potentials. If appropriately utilised, this can increase the industry\u2019s contribution to India\u2019s GDP and provide job possibilities there.\n\nBy bringing revenue to historic sites, ruins and mausoleums, tourism has the potential to enhance and safeguard heritage and culture.\n\nRelated Posts\nRiverine-Based Religious Tourism Circuit\nBuddhist Tourism Circuit\nTourism Sector\nCultural Property Agreement\n\nArticle written by Aseem Muhammed"

It resulted in the formation of a Joint Task Force, operationalized in 2010, to reach a bilateral Comprehensive Economic Partnership Agreement (CEPA).\n\nThe then President Lee paid a landmark visit to India, as Chief Guest at India\u2019s Republic Day celebrations in 2010, when bilateral ties were raised to the level of Strategic Partnership.\n\nOther major agreements signed over the years were:\n\n2011: Civil Nuclear Energy Cooperation Agreement\n2012: Nuclear Security Summit, and Visa simplification agreement\n2014: Joint Statement for Expansion of Strategic Partnership\u2019 unveiled a blueprint for further expanding the political, security, defense, economic, scientific & technological, IT, cultural, and people-to-people relations.\n2016: South Korea participated in the Defence Expo India and Maritime India Summit.\n2017: MoU on cooperation in shipbuilding\n2018: Bilateral relationship upgraded to a special-strategic partnership.\nIndia-South Korea Trade and Economic relations\n\nIn 2022, trade between the two nations reached an all-time high at USD 27.8 bn.

Furthermore, a similar attempt to advance the NSP-AEP convergence may be launched.\n\nAlready the process has started with the\u00a0ninth round\u00a0of India-RoK Comprehensive Economic Partnership Agreement (CEPA) upgrade negotiations that were held in Seoul in November 2022.\n\nIndia and South Korea may use their combined might as strong middle powers to uphold a stable, rules-based regional order in line with the U.S. without sacrificing their interests or future possibilities.\n\n-Article written by Swathi Satish"

Some geographers contend that physiographically, Eurasia is one continent.\n\nAlthough Europe and Asia have been thought of as separate continents since antiquity, their borders are arbitrary and have historically been vulnerable to alteration.\n\nRecently, several nations, including Japan, South Korea, Australia, and others, have made efforts pointing to an increasing emphasis on improved relations between European and Asian nations.\n\nAlso read: India-Armenia Relations\n\nTable of Contents\n\nChanging geopolitics in Eurasia\nIndia-Eurasia relations\nSignificance of Eurasia for India\nChallenges in India-Eurasia Relations\nWay forward for India-Eurasia relations\nChanging geopolitics in Eurasia\n\nWith an average yearly per capita income growth rate of roughly 4-5% over the previous few years, Eurasia has been one of the world\u2019s most economically active areas.\n\n\ud83d\udc49 Which year are YOU targeting for success in the IAS/IPS/IFS Exam? \ud83d\ude80\n\n(1) \u21d2 UPSC 2025: Prelims cum Mains\n\n(2) \u21d2 UPSC 2026: Prelims cum Mains\n\n(3) \u21d2 UPSC 2027 Prelims cum Mains\n\nTip: Know more about ClearIAS Courses (Online/Offline)\n\nChina is working hard to establish a new economic system and security measures without the US as part of its effort to establish a China-centric Asian order.\n\nOn one side Beijing is using an aggressive stance on the lengthy and contentious border with Bhutan and India, and on the other hand, it is showing efforts to establish a security presence in Tajikistan, play a bigger role in Afghanistan, and influence more sub-Himalayan events.\nBeijing\u2019s significant leverage in Eurasia has increased as a result of the Belt and Road Initiative\u2019s progress across Central Asia, Russia, and the Atlantic Ocean as well as Europe\u2019s rising economic dependence on China.\n\nA tilt in Russia\u2019s foreign policy toward Asia has resulted from the Ukrainian crisis, which signified a substantial change in the global order.\n\nThere is a growing alliance between Russia and China that spans the heartland of Eurasia. Moscow\u2019s reliance on Beijing has grown as a result of Russia\u2019s unresolvable conflicts with Europe and America.\nChina and Russia have strengthened their connection as a result of the growing hostility between the US and China.\nThey are working more closely together on the Belt and Road Initiative (BRI), their partnership with the Eurasian Economic Union (EEU), trade, energy, and military matters like joint production and military drills.\n\nWashington is starting to evaluate its strategic ties to Eurasia as China\u2019s maritime concerns in the Indo-Pacific region grow.\n\nA long overdue redefinition of US global strategic interests began with the US exit from Afghanistan.\nEven Europe, where a sizable amount of US military assets has been stationed since the Second World War, is susceptible to the eventual reorganization of the US military\u2019s global deployment.\nA crucial discussion on how to rebalance the transatlantic duties for Europe\u2019s collective defense is currently taking place between Washington and Brussels.\nEurope must inevitably play a greater regional Eurasian security role, with its talks on strategic autonomy with Washington.\n\nIran, another US foe, is being drawn in by China and Russia more and more.\n\nWith a recent joint military exercise in the Gulf of Oman, the three countries have lately strengthened their connections. Iran is also an important part of the Chinese Belt and Road Initiative.\nThe strategic pentagonal being formed by China, Iran, Russia, Turkey, and Pakistan will have a significant impact on the geopolitics of West Asia and Eurasia, as well as the balance of power in the region.\n\nIt seems like along with the USA, middle powers like Japan and Australia are limiting their influence to the Indo-Pacific region. Australia has joined the US and UK in the AUKUS arrangement and is trying to bring Europe into the Indo-Pacific.\n\nIn response, China and Russia are forging a power bloc in Eurasia.\n\nIndia-Eurasia relations\n\nNumerous ancient civilizations, such as those in Mesopotamia, the Indus Valley, and China, which engaged in trade and cultural exchange, were based in Eurasia.\n\nDue to shared customs and shared Buddhist culture, the inhabitants of Siberia and the Indian Himalayas have strong historical and cultural parallels.\n\nThere are records of the long-standing relationship between India and Eurasia that resulted from the partnership of the Sangha and the Shreni (trade associations) during the Buddhist era.\n\nIndia\u2019s influence was expanded into Central Asia with the entrance of the British and the establishment of the English as a territorial power on the subcontinent.\nDue to British competition with Russia during the Great Game in the 19th and early 20th centuries, unequal India\u2019s security priorities were dominated by Eurasian geopolitics.\n\nIntensive Indian diplomacy in recent years has helped Delhi\u2019s Indo-Pacific policy gain political and institutional traction. It must now put the same amount of effort into creating a \u201cEurasian\u201d policy.\n\nThe recalibration of India\u2019s continental strategy is involved in Eurasia, while the Indo-Pacific is about Delhi\u2019s new marine geopolitics.\n\nSignificance of Eurasia for India\nNatural resources are abundant in the Eurasian region, about three-fourths of the world\u2019s known energy resources are found there. For India to protect its interests, economic cooperation with these nations is essential.\nIt is crucial for India\u2019s goal of becoming an economic hub because of Eurasia\u2019s strategic peninsular location linking several subregions of Asia and West Asia.\nWith its enormous population and proximity to India, Eurasia presents a sizable tourism opportunity for that country.\nAnother area with enormous potential for collaboration is the pharmaceutical and medical sectors.\nIndia is prepared to deepen its partnership with Eurasia by establishing civic hospitals there.\nIndia is aiming to create a Central Asian e-network that will connect all five Central Asian States and provide tele-education and telemedicine access.\n\nFollowing the Taliban\u2019s takeover of Afghanistan, it is crucial to engage with Eurasia to find regional cooperation in the fight against dangers including terrorism, drug trafficking, and radicalism.\n\nThe Eurasian region wants to become less reliant on both Moscow and Beijing. In light of this, they are ready to assist India in its efforts to improve its standing in the area and offer a viable alternative to the established actors Russia, China, the EU, and the US.\n\nIndia\u2019s extended neighborhood includes Central Asia, the center of the new Eurasia, and it is extremely important to India strategically.\n\nAchieving security in the region is in India\u2019s interest given the threat of terrorism, drug trafficking, and the smuggling of armaments, among other things.\n\nChallenges in India-Eurasia Relations\n\nThe subcontinental partition and India\u2019s physical separation from inner Asia cut off the country from Eurasian geopolitics.\n\nFor India to play a larger role in Eurasian geopolitics, it is essential to get through the geographical barrier that Pakistan represents.\n\nBeijing has established itself in a fairly powerful position over the entire Eurasia region thanks to ever-expanding commerce with the EU, massive infrastructure projects like the BRI, supremacy in the industrial supply chain, etc.\n\nMajor transportation projects like the INSTC, Ashgabat Agreement, Chabahar Port, and others are delayed for a variety of reasons, including a lack of money, confidence concerns, and western sanctions against Iran and Russia.\n\nThe security and stability of the entire region are being impacted by the current crises in Belarus, Ukraine, the Caucasus, and Kazakhstan.\n\nOver 11% of India\u2019s overall trade is conducted on a bilateral basis with the Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) and the Association of South East Asian Nations (ASEAN).\n\nWhile this is happening, trade with countries in Central Asia is more than 50 times lower. Consequently, there is still room for development.\nWay forward for India-Eurasia relations\n\nIndia can serve as a counterbalance despite the Indo-Pacific area receiving more attention, and it has a wonderful chance to further develop its position in Eurasia.\n\nIndia\u2019s Eurasian policy must unavoidably involve more interaction with NATO and the EU. A significant step in establishing a long-term security conversation with Europe will be the establishment of a dedicated military office within the Indian mission to Brussels, which is home to both the EU and NATO.\n\nIndia must strike a balance between its Act East Policy, Connect Eurasia Policy, and Indo-Pacific Strategy.\n\nEnhancing multi-vector projects in this region could have political and economic repercussions because more active participation will also lead to the creation of an alternative to Chinese economic expansion, which to some extent alarms the Central Asian leaders. The influence of China in the region is also a major hindrance to growth in India-Eurasia relations.\n\nTransport corridors between Chennai and Vladivostok and between North and South are now topics of increased significance in this scenario.\n\nIndia must make use of the BRICS, SCO, and RIC platforms as essential members to advance strategic cooperation with China, Russia, and Central Asia.\n\nIndia-Eurasia relations will greatly depend on India\u2019s strategic partnership with Arabic and Persian nations. These alliances will help India counter the Pakistan-Turkey partnership.\n\nLike the approach towards the Indo-Pacific, India needs to have an integrated approach towards Eurasia to find a comprehensive footing in the geopolitical stage.\n\n-Article written by Swathi Satish"

Thomas Cana is said to be the first Armenian to have landed on the Malabar coast in 780 CE.\n\nBefore the Dutch and the English appeared in India, a few Armenian traders had come to Agra during the Mughal Empire. Emperor Akbar, highly appreciative of the commercial talents and integrity of the Armenians, granted them numerous privileges and considerable religious freedom as also an opportunity to serve in his empire in various capacities.\n\nBy the Middle Ages, the Armenian towns of Artashat, Metsbin, and Dvin had become important centers for barter trade with India which exported precious stones, herbs, and textiles to Armenia and obtained hides and dyes in return.\n\nThe Armenian colony in India increased in size, wealth, and importance throughout the 17th century. They also entered Indian trade in varying relationships with the East India Company.\n\nThe Armenians made some contributions in the areas of artisanship including gun-making and printing.\n\nThe high level of education among the Calcutta Armenians enabled them to perform well in the legal profession as well.\n\nOne of Emperor Akbar\u2019s queens has been mentioned to be an Armenian, called Mariam Zamani Begum.\n\nIndian classical singer Gohar Jaan, the first to be recorded on the gramophone in 1902 was of Armenian origin.\nThe Armenian language journal \u201cAzdarar\u201d published in Madras (Chennai) in 1794 was the first ever Armenian journal published anywhere in the world.\nA special Armenian postage stamp was issued in 1994 to mark the 200th Anniversary of \u201cAzdarar\u201d.\nIn 1773, Shahamir Shahamirian, a leading Armenian nationalist in Madras published his vision of a future Armenian nation, which Armenians acknowledge as an attempt to draft the first-ever Constitution of an independent Armenia.\n\nAfter India\u2019s independence, many Armenians migrated to Australia, the USA, and other places. The vestigial Armenian community in India is now mainly settled in Calcutta with sprinkling in Mumbai, Delhi, Agra, and Chennai.\n\nThere are Armenian churches and cemeteries in these places. The Holy Church of Nazareth, erected in 1707, repaired and embellished in 1734 is the biggest and the oldest Armenian Church in Calcutta; the 250th anniversary of this Church was celebrated On November 25, 1957.\nThe Armenian College and Philanthropic Academy in Calcutta is a prestigious national institution of Armenians.\n\nDuring the Soviet era, President Dr. S Radhakrishnan (September 1964) and Prime Minister Indira Gandhi (June 1976) visited the Armenian Soviet Socialist Republic.\n\nAfter the breakup of the USSR, India recognized Armenia on December 26, 1991, three months after it declared independence.\n\nIndia-Armenia trade and economic relations\n\nIndia will benefit greatly from deeper economic collaboration with Armenia as it can provide a potential outpost for India in a contest for global supply chains in the Eurasian corridor from the Persian Gulf to Russia and Europe.\n\nThe level of bilateral trade and investments remains below potential though some growth has been registered in recent years.\n\nIndian exports consist of foodstuffs (meat), electrical equipment, cut and polished diamonds, optical equipment, plastics, pharmaceuticals, and other chemical goods and cars.\nArmenia\u2019s exports include non-ferrous metals, raw rubber, books, and textiles.\n\nArmenia can also prove to be a valuable development partner for India in industries like manufacturing, agriculture, medicines, and technology.\n\nThe partnership can serve as an excellent replacement for the Chinese Belt and Road Initiative model, which is fueled by debt.\n\nArmenia can also play an important role in the Indian-backed International North-South Transport Corridor (INSTC) and the Iranian-backed Black Sea-Persian Gulf Transport Corridor.\n\nBy joining the INSTC, Armenia will have easy access to Indian markets, and Indo-Armenian trade via Iran will create a huge boost in their bilateral trade.\nDefence relations\n\nYerevan\u2019s expanding procurement of Indian defence technology will give both the public and commercial defence manufacturing sectors in India a boost.\n\nIn 2020, Armenia signed a USD 40 million arms deal with India for the supply of four Swathi radars to detect the location of weapons.\n\nThe radar system is designed to track incoming artillery shells, mortars, and rockets and pinpoint the locations of enemy launchers and positions.\nThese radars have been successfully deployed along the Indian-Chinese and Indian-Pakistani borders.\n\nIn October 2022, India signed an agreement with Armenia to export missiles, rockets & ammunition.\n\nThe missiles will also include Indigenous Pinaka Multi-Barrel Rocket Launcher.\nIndia may also export its Man Portable Anti-Tank Guided Missile (MPATGM) to Armenia.\n\nThis recent arms deal between India-Armenia has many geopolitical implications in the South Caucasus region and beyond.\n\nThis defense deal would certainly change the security equations in South Caucasus, wherein Russia has always been the dominant player so far.\nRussia has been the main weapon supplier to Armenia, but being preoccupied due to the Russia-Ukraine conflict, Armenia is looking elsewhere to meet its defense requirements.\nArmenia also needs to purchase heavy arms to secure its borders, deter Azerbaijan\u2019s aggression and liberate the occupied Armenian lands that Azerbaijan captured during the May 2021 and September 2022 military incursions. India is one possible military partner for Armenia.\nImportance of India-Armenia relations\nCourtesy: Wikipedia\n\nFor Armenia, India is a potential partner in pushing the offensive by the Turkey-Azerbaijan-Pakistan alliance.\n\nWith recent military equipment deliveries to Armenia, New Delhi has made it clear that it supports Yerevan in the Nagorno-Karabakh conflict and has opted to oppose Azerbaijan and all of its allies, including Turkey and Pakistan, as well as Ankara\u2019s expansionist pan-Turkic ambitions.\n\nIndia\u2019s support to Armenia is an indirect way to counter Pakistan as well since Pakistan has been supplying military assistance to Azerbaijan against Armenia.\n\nGiven India\u2019s newly discovered willingness to take sides rather than adhering to the non-aligned strategy while pursuing its interests abroad, New Delhi\u2019s internal policy challenges, particularly Kashmir, provide a potent signal to Ankara to shift course.\n\nWay forward\n\nCooperation between India-Armenia has the potential to be a key component of Armenia\u2019s broader relationships with advanced democracies. To achieve these goals, excellent and deft diplomacy is essential.\n\nIndia can also help Armenia by offering the training of Armenian defense personnel in various formats even involving exchange training visits, conducting war games, etc.\n\nHence, relations between Armenia and India have constituted a strategic priority for both nations transcending through cooperation in the implementation of the modernization theory, institutionalization, and strengthening of national defense.\n\n-Article written by Swathi Satish"

Read here to know more.\n\nThe term\u00a0\u201cdiaspora\u201d originates from the Greek term diaspeirein, which translates as \u201cdispersion.\u201d\n\nIn India, diaspora is commonly understood to include Non-Resident Indians (NRIs), Persons of Indian Origin (PIOs) and Overseas Citizens of India (OCI), of which PIO and OCI card holders were merged under one category \u2014 OCI \u2014 in 2015.\n\nTable of Contents\n\nWho are included in the term \u2018Indian diaspora\u2019?\nSignificance of Indian diaspora\nIndia\u2019s policy towards the diaspora\nMajor Issues pertaining to Indian Diaspora\nMeasures taken by the Government\nWay Forward\nConclusion\nWho are included in the term \u2018Indian diaspora\u2019?\n\nThe Indian Diaspora is a broad term for people who have migrated from territories that are now part of the Republic of India. Additionally, it alludes to their progeny. The Diaspora is estimated to number over twenty million people, made up of \u201cNRIs\u201d (Indian citizens who do not reside in India) and \u201cPIOs\u201d (Persons of Indian Origin who have acquired citizenship of some other country).\n\nIndia has the world\u2019s second-largest Diaspora. Over 25 million Indians live abroad, and they are dispersed across all of the world\u2019s major continents.\n\nDiasporas are\u00a0symbols of a nation\u2019s pride and represent their country internationally. The diaspora\u2019s ability to\u00a0spread Indian soft power, lobby for India\u2019s national interests, and contribute economically to India\u2019s rise is now well-recognized.\n\nSignificance of Indian diaspora\nDiaspora diplomacy:\u00a0 Examples include their remittance inflow and lobbying for the US-India Civilian Nuclear Agreement Bill in 2008. In Houston recently, Prime Minister Modi continued his extraordinary political investment in reaching out to the Indian diaspora.\nRemittances:\u00a0 USA was the largest source, contributing more than 20% of the 87 billion dollars in remittances that India received in 2021. In fact, 13% of global remittances are made by Indians. About 3.2% of India\u2019s GDP is made up of remittances from Indians living abroad.\nFreedom struggle:\u00a0 Mahatma Gandhi\u2019s struggle to end the systemic prejudice against Indians in South Africa inspired legends about the diaspora that have endured in contemporary India. As the fight for independence gained traction at home, it started to have an impact on many Indian communities abroad.\nTechnological development and entrepreneurship:\u00a0 As thriving IT hubs, Bengaluru, Gurugram, and Hyderabad are home to numerous Indian start-ups in addition to MNCs.\nCultural extension:\u00a0Sikhs are one of the largest migrants from India to the UK, Canada and many other countries.\nEnhancing India\u2019s global say:\u00a0 In addition to political pressures and lobbying at the ministerial and diplomatic levels, India can use its diaspora to influence different states.\nAgents of change: enhancing and facilitating investment, hastening industrial growth, and enhancing both international trade and tourism.\nIndian diaspora\u2019s contribution to the world: Indian diaspora in the world can be divided into two major categories (apart from others who are in myriad occupations and almost in every country in the world):\nTechnological graduates: They are current engineering and management graduates who work in high-value positions primarily in western nations like the US and Europe but also elsewhere.\nManual Labour:\u00a0 These people make up the population that is comparatively less skilled and who has been hired for manual labour, primarily in Arab or West Asian nations.\nIndia\u2019s policy towards the diaspora\n\nIndia was initially concerned that supporting Indians living abroad might offend host nations, who ought to be solely responsible for their welfare and security. The diaspora could not expect India to defend their rights, according to Jawaharlal Nehru, so India\u2019s foreign policy in the 1950s was designed as a model of non-intervention.\n\n\ud83d\udc49 Which year are YOU targeting for success in the IAS/IPS/IFS Exam? \ud83d\ude80\n\n(1) \u21d2 UPSC 2025: Prelims cum Mains\n\n(2) \u21d2 UPSC 2026: Prelims cum Mains\n\n(3) \u21d2 UPSC 2027 Prelims cum Mains\n\nTip: Know more about ClearIAS Courses (Online/Offline)\n\nRajiv Gandhi, on the other hand, was the first prime minister to change the diaspora policy in the 1980s by urging Indians living abroad, regardless of their nationality, to participate in nation-building initiatives, similar to the overseas Chinese communities.\n\nA number of beneficial policies were implemented after 2000 under the Atal Bihari Vajpayee administration, including the Person of Indian Origin (PIO) Card, Pravasi Bharatiya Divas, Pravasi Bharatiya Samman Award, Overseas Citizen of India Card, NRI funds, and voting rights for Indian nationals living abroad.\n\nThe present regime has carried forward the work in a positive direction. Additionally, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs introduced the e-migrate system in 2015, which necessitates the database registration of all foreign employers.\n\nMajor Issues pertaining to Indian Diaspora\nCulture:\u00a0 The Indian Diaspora is very aware of its extensive cultural heritage. They are aware that they are the descendants of the oldest continuously existing civilization in the world. They are naturally eager to preserve their cultural identity because they are a part of such a rich legacy.\nConsular and other issues:\u00a0 Our customs and immigration officials\u2019 mistreatment, intimidation, and demands for illegal gratification at the points of entry are the Diaspora\u2019s most frequent complaints.\nDual Citizenship: The vast majority of Indians living abroad prefer to keep both their Indian and home country citizenship.\nThreat to their security:\u00a0 The security of foreign workers in the Middle East is now under new threat as a result of recent violent incidents in the region. For instance, the IS group recently abducted Indian workers.\nThreat to their employment (Nitaqat Law):\u00a0 It aims to replace a significant portion of foreign workers in Saudi Arabia with locals. This has an impact on international workers from Kerala, Tennessee, etc.\nMeasures taken by the Government\nSince 2003, the government has celebrated Pravasi Bhartiya Diwas to recognise the contribution of the Indian diaspora to the advancement of India.\nThe government established a specific Ministry of oversees Indian affairs in 2004 in order to give particular attention to the issues relating to the Indian diaspora. The diaspora receives comprehensive services from it.\nThe government has introduced a number of programmes for the welfare of Indians living abroad, including the Pravasi Bhartiya Bima Yojana from 2006 and others.\nThe Overseas Citizenship of India Scheme (OCI) was introduced by amending the Citizenship Act, 1955 in August 2005 in response to persistent calls for \u201cdual citizenship,\u201d particularly from the Diaspora in North America and other developed nations, and keeping in mind the Government\u2019s strong commitment to meeting the aspirations and expectations of Overseas Indians. In some areas, such as the economy and education, the Scheme offers benefits comparable to those of citizens. Although it grants lifetime, multiple, and multi-entry visas with some rights, it is not truly dual citizenship.\nThe Know India Program was established as a three-week orientation programme for youth from the diaspora in order to raise awareness of the various facets of Indian culture and the advancements the nation has made in various fields. KIP offers a special platform for students and young professionals of Indian descent to travel to India, share their opinions, hopes, and experiences, and forge closer ties with modern India.\nThe Swarnapravas Yojana- New Plan Scheme: Given the large supply of labour in India, this programme has been established to increase Indian workers\u2019 employability abroad by giving them the necessary training.\nThe Ministry of Overseas Indian Affairs is running a scheme known as \u201cTracing the Roots\u201d to facilitate PIOs in tracing their roots in India.\nIn addition to all of these, the government has made social security agreements with numerous foreign nations to safeguard the Indian community in those nations.\nWay Forward\n\nThough, the government has launched many reforms and policies towards the Indian diaspora. But still, there is a need for certain improvements. In this regard following may be recommended:\n\n\u00a0A friendlier reception at their point of entry is necessary to ensure that Diaspora members feel welcome upon arrival in India and also fondly recall their visits. Additionally, simpler procedures for immigration and customs clearances that are marked by courteous service are crucial.\nThe following should be put into action as soon as possible to address the issues facing our blue-collar workers abroad. These include:\na) Establishing a welfare fund for repatriated overseas workers in distress;\nb) Negotiating Standard Labour Export Agreements with the host countries;\nc) Monitoring and supervision of both the employment contracts and the conditions of our\nd) overseas workers by our Missions;\ne) Launching compulsory insurance schemes covering the risks faced by our overseas workers;\n\u00a0The Diaspora can significantly aid India\u2019s tourism industry is expanding. PIOs frequently travel back to their home country or to see family. Promoting tourism should receive more attention among PIOs of the second generation.\nThe Indian community living abroad requires further economic liberalisation.\nThe establishment of a parliamentary standing committee on the Indian diaspora is a possibility. Members who are interested in issues affecting the Diaspora should be included. This Committee might also serve as a hub for communication with lawmakers from other nations who are of Indian descent. Such discussions are crucial to fostering greater mutual understanding and amity between them.\nConclusion\n\nA myopic perspective would be to only see the Diaspora through the lens of remittances and other financial flows. Not all expatriates need to be investors, and measuring an expat\u2019s development impact solely in terms of monetary contributions to the country of origin misses the bigger picture.\n\nAn international community can and often does act as a crucial \u201cbridge\u201d for gaining access to information, skills, resources, and markets for the advancement of the country of origin. The ability of the Diaspora to develop and project a coherent, internally motivated, and progressive identity, as well as the capacity of the home country to create the conditions and institutions for long-term, mutually beneficial engagement, are frequently prerequisites for the success of this bridge.\n\nHome nations are now starting to acknowledge the necessity of pursuing and promoting the Diaspora and development dynamic. India cannot be a special case.\n\nArticle written by: Remya"

The Indo-Pacific is an area, according to nations like the US, that extends from the coastlines of the Indian subcontinent to the western shore of the Americas. In contrast, the notion is far more expansive in India and Japan, reaching the African continent\u2019s coasts.\n\nIndia, the United States, Australia, Japan, members of ASEAN, and other maritime nations that hold key positions in the Indian and Pacific Oceans, including small island nations, are major players in the Indo-Pacific.\n\nWhat forces are causing the world to turn to the Indo-Pacific?\n\nThe following are the forces that make Indo-Pacific a crucial idea.\n\nVast Natural Resources\n\nThe immense quantities of marine resources found in the Indian and Pacific Oceans together include offshore hydrocarbons, methane hydrates, sea bed minerals, rare earth metals, fisheries, etc.\n\nA competitive environment for the exploitation of these resources has been established by the extensive coastlines and Exclusive Economic Zones (EEZs) of littoral countries.\n\nChina as a factor\n\nA number of regional and extra-regional nations have expressed concern in recent years about China\u2019s assertive foreign policy, rapid economic growth, military development, and power projection. The following are the concerns of world nations regarding China\u2019s foreign policy.\n\nBelt and Road Initiative\u2013 A number of nations, including India, have serious concerns about the BRI\u2019s lack of openness and transparency as well as its involvement in irresponsible financing practices that place unsupportable financial burdens on people. This makes it possible to employ these initiatives as strategic military installations and coercive tactics.\nMilitarization of the Indian Ocean Region\u2013 In addition to its existing commercial ports, China has developed new ones throughout the Indo-Pacific, including the ports of Gwadar (Pakistan) and Hambantota (Sri Lanka). Due to their proximity to vital choke points, these ports are strategically significant, but there have also been rumors that they could be used for military reconnaissance and surveillance operations.\nNon- Traditional Threats\n\nDue to its size, the area faces a variety of risks that are challenging to identify and manage, including piracy, illegal fishing, human trafficking, terrorism, and environmental dangers.\n\nAll nations must work together and integrate their efforts to combat these challenges.\n\nTrade and Economical Factors\n\nThe Indo-Pacific Region makes up 65% of the global population, occupies 44% of the planet\u2019s surface area, generates 62% of global GDP, and supports 46% of global trade in goods.\n\nIn addition to being a wealthy market, the region also manages international supply networks.\n\nIndia and Indo-Pacific: Interests\n\nIndia considers Indo-pacific as the main artery to her development. Now let us look at some of those dimensions.\n\nPeace and Security in the Indian Ocean\n\n90% of India\u2019s trade and its energy supplies are transported via the Indian Ocean, while about 50% of India\u2019s trade is concentrated in the Indo-Pacific region.\n\nIndia seeks to guarantee freedom of navigation, protect choke points, end conflicts amicably, and confront unconventional security concerns in the Indian Ocean region (IOR).\n\nCountering China\n\nIndia aspires to reduce the role of China in the region with an inclusive approach with other nations so that Chinese aggressions will take a back stand.\n\nGeo-Political aspirations\n\nTo expand its own presence in the region, especially in Africa, the Middle East, and Southeast Asia and maintain its role as a net security provider.\n\nFostering sustainable development\n\nClimate change will have a negative impact on India in the future. India supports the region\u2019s sustainable development as a result of the growth of the blue economy.\n\nWhat is India\u2019s blueprint for Indo-Pacific?\n\nPrime Minister\u2019s Keynote Address at Shangri La Dialogue, 2018 highlighted the following elements:\n\nA free, open, inclusive region.\nSoutheast Asia is at the center of the Indo-Pacific.\nA common rules-based order for the region:\u00a0 This kind of order must adhere to values like equality of all nations, regardless of size and strength, faith in dialogue, sovereignty, and territorial integrity.\nEqual access to common spaces on sea and in the air, as a right under international law:\u00a0 It would necessitate open business, unrestricted travel, and the peaceful resolution of differences in conformity with international law.\nCircumventing power rivalries through partnerships:\u00a0 Nations must take care to prevent conflicts from arising from competitiveness and disputes from arising from differences. As one of the foundations of the new order, India supports regional architecture and groupings and anticipates partnerships based on similar values and interests.\nHow is India\u2019s Vision of the Indo-Pacific different from other countries?\n\nIt is important to realize that India does not view the Indo-Pacific region as an alliance or plan meant to subjugate or oppress any one nation. The same cannot be true for other nations, such as the US, whose Indo-Pacific strategy calls for an Indo-Pacific that is free and open but does not articulate inclusivity openly.\n\nIt suggests that the US could not be amenable to China\u2019s engagement and gives the idea of the Indo-Pacific a \u201ccontainment\u201d character.\n\nWhat is India\u2019s Policy towards Indo-Pacific?\n\nIndia\u2019s major region of focus is still the Indian Ocean, despite its desire to increase its diplomatic and political presence throughout the Indo-Pacific. Let\u2019s talk about the fundamental components of India\u2019s Indo-Pacific strategy.\n\nStrengthening traditional roles\n\nAs a Security Provider: India has been the primary security provider and strategic partner to most of its smaller\nneighbors like Maldives, Mauritius, Seychelles, and Sri Lanka.\n\nAs a first responder: Due to its strategic position, India\u2019s navy is among the first to reach nations requiring\nhumanitarian assistance or medical aid in times of crisis and disasters\n\nFor example,\n\nOperation Vanilla: Indian Navy provided humanitarian assistance and disaster relief to Madagascar.\nMission Sagar: Indian Navy provided Food Items, COVID-related Medicines, and Special Ayurvedic Medicines with Medical Assistance Teams to Maldives, Mauritius, Seychelles, Madagascar, and Comoros\nNaval Strategy\nMaritime Domain Awareness (MDA)\n\nWith the help of intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance, the Indian Navy hopes to acquire a solid and comprehensive strategic situational awareness of developments in the IOR. Among the organizations that support MDA initiatives are\n\nInformation Management and Analysis Centre (IMAC): It generates India\u2019s coastal MDA picture by fusing the information it receives from various sources.\nInformation Fusion Center for the India Ocean Region (IFC-IOR): By creating a shared, coherent image of the marine situation and serving as the region\u2019s maritime information hub, it seeks to give regional MDA.\n\n\nNon-military white shipping agreements and coastal surveillance radar chains on IOR islands are two further Indian measures aimed at enhancing regional MDA capabilities.\n\nExpansion of India\u2019s Naval Presence\n\nThe Indian Navy began its Mission Based Deployments (MBDs) in 2017 in an effort to increase its presence and visibility. For instance, lately, the MBD enabled the Indian Navy to respond quickly to a cyclone in Mozambique and flood-hit Madagascar.\nJoint exercises: They produce positive operational interactions and improve the capabilities of the naval forces in a variety of different domains. The Malabar Exercise (conducted by the United States, Japan, and Australia), as well as Varun (France).\nConclusion\n\nThe new strategic reality of the twenty-first century is represented by the creation of the Indo-Pacific as a new geographical region that joins the Pacific and Indian Oceans.\n\nAs a result, the Indo-Pacific region offers an excellent opportunity to raise India\u2019s visibility and global position.\n\nIndia has a dominant position in the region thanks to its geopolitical advantage, which has to be used more effectively to advance national objectives.\n\nTo add greater content and strength to regional and bilateral collaborations, new areas of cooperation must be found.\n\nThis will give India and the nations in the Indo-Pacific area as a whole traction for growth, prosperity, and security.\n\nArticle Written By: Jis John Sebastian"

The stories from the great epics of Ramayana and Mahabharata inspire Indonesian folk art and drama. The shared culture, colonial history, and post-independence goals of political sovereignty, economic self-sufficiency, and independent foreign policy all serve to unite the two countries.\n\nThe two countries have an active cultural exchange. The mission runs the Jawaharlal Nehru Indian Cultural Centre (JNICC), which offers regular classes in Indian classical music, Indian classical dances (Kathak and Bharatnatyam), Yoga, and Hindi and Tamil language instruction.\n\nSahabat India: Festival of India in Indonesia 2015: H.E. Ms Megawati Soekarnoputri, former President of Indonesia, inaugurated \u2018Sahabat India- The Festival of India in Indonesia\u2019 on January 26, 2015. The festival was held from January 26 to August 15, 2015. During the Festival of India, more than 35 different events were held in several prestigious locations in Jakarta, including folk dances, dance drama, puppet shows, musical shows, exhibitions, seminars, mall promotions, screenings of Bollywood cinema, documentaries, and the like.\n\nIndian Community in Indonesia\n\nAround 100,000 Indonesians of Indian origin live in Indonesia, mostly in Greater Jakarta, Medan, Surabaya, and Bandung. They primarily engage in the textile and sporting goods trade. Engineers, consultants, chartered accountants, bankers, and other professionals are among the 10,000 Indian nationals who live in Indonesia.\n\nThe Indian community in Indonesia is highly regarded, and prosperous. This includes individuals holding senior positions in both local and multinational corporations. In August 2012, the Embassy established the Indian Cultural Forum (ICF), an umbrella organisation of thirty-one Indian social organisations.\n\nSignificance of India \u2013 Indonesia Relations\n\nThe strategic location of Indonesia at the intersection of the Indian and Pacific Oceans is critical for securing the major sea lanes of communication, given that the South East Indian Ocean is a hotbed of piracy and smuggling of people, arms, drugs, and money; illegal, unreported, and unregulated fishing; and terrorist movement, among other things.\n\nRecently, Indonesia agreed to grant Indian investors access to the strategic island of Sabang, which is close to the Malacca Strait. This would assist India in becoming a provider of security in the Indian Ocean region. Both countries are G20, Non-Aligned Movement (NAM), East Asia Summit, and United Nations members.\n\nChina\u2019s growing assertiveness in the region has necessitated greater cooperation among the region\u2019s various players. Indonesia\u2019s support will strengthen its Act East Policy because it is the most populous and economically powerful country in Southeast Asia. In addition, India\u2019s SAGAR (Security and Growth for All in the Region) vision aligned with Indonesia\u2019s Global Maritime Fulcrum. Both countries are concerned about the rise of religious-based terrorism. As a result, both countries agreed to establish interfaith dialogues to address this issue.\n\nBilateral Exercises:\n\nExercise Samudra Shakti is a bilateral maritime exercise.\n\nGaruda Shakti is a joint military exercise between India and Indonesia.\n\nChallenges in India \u2013 Indonesia Relations\n\nEven after the Comprehensive Economic Partnership with India, Indonesia would be hesitant to go against China\u2019s interests due to its close relationship with China since the Cold War.\n\nAfter independence, India had good relations with Indonesia because both countries were founders of the Non-alignment movement; however, these relations deteriorated later as India leaned toward the USSR and Indonesia leaned toward the US. Indonesia backed Pakistan during India\u2019s war with Pakistan.\n\nThe demarcation of the two countries maritime borders in the Andaman Sea has not been completed. During the visit, however, both parties reiterated their intention to resolve the matter as soon as possible.\n\nArticle Written by: Remya"

Over 1% of the local population are ITEC alumni, having benefited from various training courses offered through the ITEC programme.\n\nIn April 2011, the IT Centre for Excellence, established in Victoria with GOI assistance, was inaugurated at Mont Fleuri, Mahe. Since the early 1980s, credit lines have been extended.\n\nAs part of the Pan African e-Network project between India and the African Union, India has been instrumental in establishing communication facilities throughout Seychelles.\n\nIndian Community\n\nIndia has a strong connection with Seychelles because Indian nationals were among the first to settle on the island, mostly from Tamil Nadu and later from Gujarat, as traders, labourers, construction workers, and, more recently, professionals.\n\nThe number of people of Indian origin exceeds 10,000, which is significant in a country with a total population of 96,000. (June 2017). Furthermore, there are 11,000 Indian citizens with Gainful Employment Permits, the majority of whom are construction workers, shop assistants, and a few professionals.\n\nDefence Cooperation\n\nIndia has always been there to assist the country in times of crisis. In 1986, the Indian navy conducted \u201cOperation Flower are Blooming\u201d to prevent a coup and assist the island in achieving political stability.\n\nThe Indian navy has sent maritime surveillance aircraft to Seychelles to monitor the island nation\u2019s Exclusive Economic Zone. Furthermore, Joint Military Exercise Lamitye has been held since 2001.\n\nIndia and Seychelles are collaborating to meet the island nation\u2019s need for maritime security in the Indian Ocean Region (IOR) and to make the IOR safe for development and trade. Apart from cooperation in counter-piracy and counter-terrorism on high seas, which is critical for India\u2019s extended maritime security.\n\nSince 2015, India and Seychelles have developed a cooperation agenda that includes joint anti-piracy efforts as well as enhanced EEZ surveillance and monitoring to prevent intrusions by potential economic offenders engaged in illegal fishing, poaching, human trafficking and drug. The operationalization of the Coastal Surveillance Radar System in 2016 exemplified India-Seychelles cooperation (CSRS).\n\nIndia \u2013 Seychelles: Challenges\n\nIndia is concerned about Seychelles\u2019 recent development of providing refuelling and docking facilities to Chinese ships departing from the Djibouti naval base. Furthermore, China has made significant investments in several infrastructure projects, overshadowing India\u2019s influence in the island nation.\n\nAssumption Island naval base\n\nThe Seychelles government leased Assumption island to the Indian Navy in 2015 with the intention of establishing an overseas base of operations there. In 2015, India proposed establishing a joint naval port on the remote Seychelles island of Assumption.\n\nHowever, India\u2019s proposal was met with strong opposition from Seychelles\u2019 political parties. Opponents argue that Seychelles should stay out of the brewing India-China conflict in the Indian Ocean.\n\nDuring a recent visit to India, President of Seychelles Danny Antoine Rollen Faure agreed to collaborate on a project to develop a naval base on Assumption Island based on mutual interests, just days after Seychelles cancelled a pact with India to jointly develop a naval base there.\n\nThe visit\u2019s highlight is positive agreement on \u2018Assumption Island.\u2019 Following a discussion, both countries agreed to be equally engaged and to continue working together while keeping each other\u2019s interests in mind.\n\nIndia must continue to work in areas of mutual interest such as counter-terrorism and piracy and must resolve contentious issues through dialogue. The priority for India should be to engage with the island nation and counter any economic advantage that China may offer.\n\nConclusion\n\nFor materialising India\u2019s superpower aspirations, better relations with Seychelles are the need of the hour. Proactive action by the government and various stakeholders involved can prove to be fruitful in this regard.\n\nArticle Written by: Remya"

The more recent association is attributed to Sir Stamford Raffles, who established a trading station in Singapore on the way of the Malacca Straits in 1819, which became a British Indian colony ruled from Calcutta (1830-1867). The colonial connection can be seen in the similarities of institutions and practises the use of English and the existence of a sizable Indian minority.\n\nIndia\u2019s 1990s economic reforms and Look East policy presented possibilities to develop a new framework for collaboration, which includes the 2005 Comprehensive Economic Cooperation Agreement (CECA).\n\nThis strong connection was raised to a Strategic Partnership during Prime Minister Modi\u2019s November 2015 visit, when he signed a Joint Declaration on a Strategic Partnership with Singapore Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong to commemorate the 50th anniversary of diplomatic relations.\n\n\ud83d\udc49 Which year are YOU targeting for success in the IAS/IPS/IFS Exam? \ud83d\ude80\n\n(1) \u21d2 UPSC 2025: Prelims cum Mains\n\n(2) \u21d2 UPSC 2026: Prelims cum Mains\n\n(3) \u21d2 UPSC 2027 Prelims cum Mains\n\nTip: Know more about ClearIAS Courses (Online/Offline)\n\nThe 5-S Plank\n\nEAM\u2019s (External Asset Managers) visit to Singapore in August 2014 resulted in adopting the \u201c5-S Plank,\u201d which designates five areas of collaboration to strengthen bilateral ties. The relationship is directed at the 5S Plank.\n\nScale up Trade & Investment.\nSpeed up Connectivity.\nSmart Cities and Urban Rejuvenation.\nSkill development.\nState focus.\nDefence Cooperation\n\nAn overall framework for bilateral defence cooperation is provided by the Defence Cooperation Agreement (DCA), which was signed in October 2003 and the improved DCA, which was signed during PM Modi\u2019s visit in November 2015.\n\nThe 25th SIMBEX \u201cSingapore-India Maritime Bilateral Exercise\u201d had taken place from the 10th to the 21st of November 2018 off the coasts of the Bay of Bengal and the Arabian Sea. SIMBEX is a series of naval exercises between the Indian Navy and the Navies of the Republic of Singapore. The acronym \u2018SIMBEX\u2019 stands for Singapore-India Maritime Bilateral Exercise. SIMBEX is celebrating its Silver Jubilee this year. To commemorate the momentous event, both navies are conducting exercises across a wide geographic area.\n\nBoth countries successfully completed the 27th edition of the Singapore-India Maritime Bilateral Exercise (SIMBEX) in November 2020, as well as the second edition of the Singapore-India-Thailand Maritime Exercise (SITMEX).\n\nThe Indian Navy and the RSN have a long history of professional ties. It comprises exchange programmes, staff presentations, and course cross-registration.\n\nThe bilateral agreement for naval cooperation between India-Singapore was recently signed during the second Defence Ministers\u2019 Dialogue in Delhi. This brings the two sides\u2019 accords in all military arms to a close; the Air Force Bilateral Agreement was signed in 2007, and the Army Bilateral Agreement was signed in 2008.\n\nThe arrangement allows Indian navy ships to receive logistical assistance, including refuelling, at Singapore\u2019s Changi naval base, which is located near the disputed South China Sea. It includes greater maritime security cooperation, joint exercises, temporary deployments in each other\u2019s naval facilities, and mutual logistics assistance.\n\nThe naval logistics pact is India\u2019s first pact of that kind with a country located east of Malacca, which is one of the world\u2019s most significant maritime lanes. Economically, it is regarded as a crucial choke point for global commerce, and China regards it as a danger to its energy security. This would allow India to have a stronger presence in the contentious waters of the South China Sea.\n\nIndia\u2019s presence in Chahabar port and the Changi Naval Base in Singapore may enable India to emerge as a net security provider in the Indian Ocean region, allowing the navy to conduct lengthy deployments in the area.\n\nSignificance of Singapore for India\nIndia-Singapore has a wide-ranging relationship that is as strategic as well as economic.\nSingapore is an important investment source as well as a destination for Indians. Singapore was the first country with which India signed a Comprehensive Economic Cooperation Agreement, which is currently being upgraded. Singapore has established strong ties with Indian states such as West Bengal, Rajasthan, Andhra Pradesh, and Telangana. As a result, economic cooperation is growing.\nBoth countries are seeking to explore other areas such as tourism and skill development.\nSingapore is also an essential partner in many areas of India\u2019s development priorities, including smart cities, urban solutions, the financial sector, skills development, ports, logistics, aviation, and industrial parks.\nSingapore\u2019s role in enhancing India\u2019s tie with ASEAN\n\nSingapore, being one of ASEAN\u2019s founding members, plays a critical role in sustaining regional peace and security, as well as supporting ASEAN\u2019s goal of creating and fostering development and prosperity. When Singapore joined ASEAN, it was an obligation since it needed to establish its credibility as an independent nation and produce additional trade, but Singapore later evolved to a particular level in comparison to the rest of the ASEAN countries. Slowly, it grew to the point that Singapore began giving trading posts and capital entrepreneurship. 88 Singapore backed the establishment of the ASEAN Free Trade Zone.\n\nSingapore has been influential in speaking her opinion in ASEAN, which has resulted in India getting the dialogue partnership in ASEAN in 1995 before India was only a sectoral conversation partner. Singapore was also instrumental in bringing India and the ASEAN countries together.\n\nIt is worth repeating that the signing of the CECA with Singapore was a significant step forward for both countries. Singapore supports India\u2019s ambition to become a major and prominent participant in the Southeast Asian region, and in order for India-ASEAN relations to be fruitful, Singapore is more than happy to act as a go-between.\n\nIn the international arena, India has a close working relationship with Singapore, and a number of regional mechanisms connect these two countries together, including ASEAN, the ASEAN Regional Forum (ARF), ASEAN plus three, the East Asia Summit, and the ASEAN Defence Ministers Meeting (ADMM) Plus. Singapore has vigorously backed India\u2019s expanded geostrategic influence in ASEAN, as well as India\u2019s permanent membership in the United Nations Security Council.\n\nArticle Written by: Remya"

What is undeniable, though, is that foreign policy plays a critical role in ensuring that India achieves her goals as a country both now and in the future.\n\nLet\u2019s examine the many stages of our foreign policy\u2019s development and the underlying elements that have influenced it.\n\nIndian Foreign Policy: Phases\n\nIndian Foreign Policy can divided into seven phases of evolution:\n\nThe Power of Ideas (1947-1962)\nThe Fractured Years (1962-1970)\nThe Idea of Power (1970-1989)\nThe Years of Reflection (1990-1998)\nThe Reality of Power (1998-2011)\nBack to the Future (2011-2014)\nEnlightened National Interest (2014)\n1. The Power of Ideas (1947-1962)\n\nJawaharlal Nehru, one of the most important leaders in the national movement. He served as the president of India at the time of independence. Along with serving as Prime Minister, he also served as Foreign Minister. He influenced Indian foreign policy for years to come as a steadfast idealist based on Gandhian and socialist ethos.\n\nThe concepts themselves were derived from the national movement and the prevalent progressive philosophies of the period. Non-Alignment served as the cornerstone of the country\u2019s foreign policy at the time. India ascended to the position of dominance among the nations of the third world through the Non-Alignment Movement (NAM).\n\nThe main concern was to stay out of the USSR and US government\u2019s Cold War block rivalry. The standard for judging issues was to be merit, not impartiality. Panchsheel, the five tenets of peaceful coexistence, served as the guiding ideals of this period.\n\nIndia strongly opposed apartheid and backed efforts to decolonize the country. We also emphasised the need for peacekeeping and disarmament. This was made abundantly evident by our involvement in the Korean War. And the fact that we sponsored the Partial Test Ban Treaty.\n\nThe emphasis was also on inclusive and equitable development, Afro-Asian unity at the Bandung Conference, and multilateralism through the UN, Commonwealth, and other organisations. India\u2019s idealistic outlook earned it respect among its neighbours and even among advanced western countries.\n\nIndia was viewed as the obvious leader among the newly independent emerging countries. However, idealism had its limits. Non-Alignment was deemed \u201cimmoral\u201d by the USA.\n\nWhen India brought the Kashmir dispute before the UN, the US and the UK interjected, making matters more complicated and serving as the main impediment to a resolution.\n\nThe Sino-Indian War of 1962, in which China, a nation we had supported fervently since 1949, essentially turned its back on us and attacked, was perhaps the cruellest blow.\n\n2. The Fractured Years (1962-1970)\n\nAfter the Sino-Indian War, we also lost Mr Nehru, our Prime Minister. Lal Bahadur Shastri\u2019s leadership was tough but not as effective as his predecessor\u2019s on a global scale. The Indian Foreign Policy was impacted by this.\n\nWe had to start a new war in 1965 after Pakistan attacked us. In addition to this, the US imposed food sanctions on us for questioning the US\u2019s role in Vietnam.\n\nWe also had a time of reflection during which we realised that realism, rather than idealism, was the foundation upon which the universe operated.\n\nSmt. Indira Gandhi became the prime minister in the latter half of the decade. The challenges we overcame also presented us with several internal opportunities. The much-needed modernization of the Indian military was brought about by the Sino-Indian War.\n\nThe US sanctions served as the impetus for the Green Revolution, which produced enough food. The 1965 Indo-Pak war also helped India in the future by sparking strategic thought. The fractious years served as the foundation for the change in Indian foreign policy for many years.\n\n3. The Idea of Power (1971-1989)\n\nIn India\u2019s political system, Smt. Indira Gandhi had established her dominance by 1971. Centralization, Authoritarianism, and Courage in the face of adversity were traits that defined her reign.\n\nIndian foreign policy acknowledged the value of power for the first time. So to speak, we returned to our Kautilyan origins.\n\nThe 1971 Indo-Pak War, which led to the establishment of Bangladesh, demonstrated the power of India\u2019s military prowess and diplomatic skills. We were able to resist pressure from the USA by signing a friendship treaty with the USSR.\n\nWe conducted our first nuclear weapons test in 1974 and then left the Non-Proliferation Treaty because it was unfair.\n\nAs India became closer to the Soviet Union during this time, non-alignment gradually eroded as well. Socialist policies, such as nationalising banks and enforcing stricter licencing requirements, were also consolidated. Through it all, the economy was neglected, and in 1991, it finally bit us.\n\n4. The Years of Reflection (1990-1998)\n\nIn the early 1990s, India did not do so well. The economy had been poorly managed, which had resulted in the current foreign exchange crisis. The North East, Punjab, and Jammu and Kashmir all saw mutinies during that time. The Soviet Union, our biggest \u201cfriend\u201d on the international stage, swiftly fell apart, leaving us \u201cfriendless.\u201d\n\nAdditionally, the crisis brought about certain logical changes in the economy and foreign policy. A new economic strategy focused on globalisation, privatisation, and liberalisation was established.\n\nWe made contact with the US and emphasised the need for closer ties. The next significant phase of Foreign Policy was put in motion by the robust performance of the Indian economy, which concealed domestic political weakness.\n\n5. The Reality of Power (1998-2011)\n\nIndia conducted its second nuclear test in Pokhran to usher in a new era of foreign policy (1998). The first test and the response to it were circumspect, but the second test made it plain that India was now a nuclear-weapon state.\n\nDespite the US\u2019s first response to sanctions, it soon became clear that democratic India, with its population and rapidly expanding economy, could be an ally in the future. This sparked the Talbott-Jaswant Singh negotiations, which greatly enhanced ties between the US and India.\n\nThe Indian economy was now expanding at a rate of around 8% annually. We saw the middle class grow and the IT revolution. On the strength of its reputation as a democracy and a strong economy, India also increased its soft power. A Look East Policy and better ties with China were added to the strong US connections.\n\nIn 2008, the US and India signed the Civil Nuclear Agreement, which was a significant victory for India. The prosperity of the Indian diaspora in the US contributed to the rapprochement of the two nations.\n\n6. Back to the Future (2011-2014)\n\nIn 2011, a group of thinkers published the NAM 2.0 paper. This emphasized the need for strategic autonomy to underpin Indian foreign policy.\n\nStrategic autonomy has continued to be an important factor in guiding India\u2019s foreign policy, despite criticism that it focused too heavily on the now-outdated Non-Alignment idea.\n\n7. Enlightened National Interest (2014)\n\nMr Narendra Modi, who is regarded as India\u2019s most powerful Prime Minister since Ms Gandhi, rose to prominence following the 2014 general elections. With this transition in government, there was a change in foreign policy that was consistent with India\u2019s influence on the global order.\n\nEnlightened National Interest, which essentially means \u201cNational Interest Plus,\u201d serves as the basis for the current foreign policy of India.\n\nIt is based on Aristotle\u2019s theory of Enlightened Self Interest, which holds that people who act in ways that advance the interests of others (or the interests of the organisation or groups to which they belong) ultimately advance their self-interest.\n\nAbove narrow national interest, enlightened national interest places emphasis on a shared future vision for all. It adheres to the Vasudaiva Kudumbakam idea that is prevalent in India.\n\nThe Gujral Doctrine of the 1990s is modified, with a focus on soft power and neighbourhood first. Instead of the cautious strategy used during Non-Alignment, there is now a confident \u201cmulti-alignment\u201d with major nations while yet protecting our strategic autonomy.\n\nAt first, there was a stronger readiness to interact with Pakistan, but the country\u2019s position toward sponsoring terrorism has resulted in a deadlock.\n\nRead Foreign relations notes here.\n\nIndian Foreign Policy: Future\n\nUncertainties caused by the emergence of populist regimes throughout the Western world have an impact on the current world order. No force can take the Western powers\u2019 position of dominance from them despite the Western powers\u2019 declining might.\n\nThe trade battle between the United States and China is still going strong.\n\nMaintaining a balance in relations between the US and China should be the main focus of future Indian foreign policy. Although Indo-US ties are at their highest point since independence, there hasn\u2019t been much progress in many sectors.\n\nSome experts worry that relations will stagnate. Strong action must be taken in this direction if India is to profit.\n\nCompetition on the one hand and cooperation on the other represent Indo-China relations. The US-China trade conflict has provided us with an opportunity to strengthen our ties with China. This is a chance that cannot be passed up.\n\nA major goal of foreign policy is a connected, integrated South Asia. The remaining nations must be the main focus if Pakistan is not receptive to the same. A step in this approach is the BBIN (Bangladesh Bhutan India Nepal) corridor.\n\nThe growth of India\u2019s north-eastern region can be aided by connections with South East Asian countries via the India-Myanmar-Thailand Trilateral Highway and the Kaladan Multi-Modal Transport Corridor.\n\nLack of diplomatic skills is a significant barrier to India\u2019s realising its potential in foreign policy. For a nation that aspires to be a global force, India lacks competent diplomats.\n\nIt is necessary to reform the Ministry of External Affairs and link it to the Ministries of Commerce and D\u00e9fense. To fully utilise the synergies between the private sector and civil society, Track 2 diplomacy must be fostered.\n\nOnly a creative foreign policy can currently achieve the noble goal of stability while fostering inclusive growth. India must also make sure that it participates in the \u201crule-making\u201d rather than the \u201crule-following\u201d aspects of the international order.\n\nTo achieve this goal, one must be a permanent member of the UN and a member of all significant international organisations.\n\nArticle Written by: Remya"

Behind most international money and security transfers is the Society for Worldwide Interbank Financial Telecommunications (SWIFT) system.

It facilitates standardised and reliable communication to facilitate the transaction.\n\nIt was founded in 1973 and is headquartered in La Hulpe, Belgium. SWIFT went live in 1977 with 518 institutions from 22 countries, its website states.\n\n\ud83d\udc49 Which year are YOU targeting for success in the IAS/IPS/IFS Exam? \ud83d\ude80\n\n(1) \u21d2 UPSC 2025: Prelims cum Mains\n\n(2) \u21d2 UPSC 2026: Prelims cum Mains\n\n(3) \u21d2 UPSC 2027 Prelims cum Mains\n\nTip: Know more about ClearIAS Courses (Online/Offline)\n\nThe Belgium-headquartered SWIFT connects more than 11,000 banking and securities organisation in over 200 countries and territories.\u00a0SWIFT itself had replaced the much slower and far less dynamic Telex.\n\nFunctions of SWIFT:\nSWIFT does not facilitate funds transfer: rather, it sends payment orders, which must be settled by correspondent accounts that the institutions have with each other.\nSWIFT is a secure financial message carrier in other words, it transports messages from one bank to its intended bank recipient.\nIts core role is to provide a secure transmission channel so that Bank A knows that its message to Bank B goes to Bank B and no one else. Bank B, in turn, knows that Bank A, and no one other than Bank A, sent, read or altered the message en route. Banks, of course, need to have checks in place before actually sending messages.\nMessages sent by SWIFT\u2019s customers are authenticated using its specialised security and identification technology.\nEncryption is added as the messages leave the customer environment and enter the SWIFT Environment.\nMessages remain in the protected SWIFT environment, subject to all its confidentiality and integrity commitments, throughout the transmission process while they are transmitted to the operating centres (OPCs) where they are processed until they are safely delivered to the receiver.\nOn receiving this message through SWIFT, banks abroad, mostly branches of domestic banks abroad provide funds to the company.\nHow does transaction occur in SWIFT?\n\nFinancial institutions connected to\u00a0SWIFT use its messaging system to establish relationships with other banks and make payments.\n\nThe secure messaging system allows banks to honour the payment instructions without question, subsequently helping banks process high volumes of transactions at speed. Each year, trillions of dollars are transferred using the system.\n\nEach participant on the platform is assigned a unique eight-digit SWIFT code or a bank identification code (BIC).\n\nIf a person, say, in New York with a Citibank account, wants to send money to someone with an HSBC account in London, the payee would have to submit to his bank the London-based beneficiary\u2019s account number along with the eight-digit SWIFT code of the latter\u2019s bank.\n\nCitibank would then send a SWIFT message to HSBC. Once that is received and approved, the money would be credited to the required account.\n\nHow is the organisation governed?\n\nSWIFT claims to be neutral. Its shareholders, consisting of 3,500 firms across the globe, elect the 25-member board, which is responsible for oversight and management of the company.\n\nIts lead overseer is the National Bank of Belgium.\n\nIt is regulated by G-10 central banks from Belgium, Canada, France, Germany, Italy, Japan, The Netherlands, the United Kingdom, the United States, Switzerland, and Sweden, alongside the European Central Bank.\n\nThe SWIFT oversight forum was established in 2012.\n\nThe G-10 participants were joined by the central banks of India, Australia, Russia, South Korea, Saudi Arabia, Singapore, South Africa, the Republic of Turkey, and the People\u2019s Republic of China.\n\nIn 2021, the SWIFT financial messaging platform recorded an average of 42 million FIN messages per day, as per the data on its website. The full-year figure was an 11.4% growth on a year-over-year basis.\n\nEurope, the Middle East, and Africa, combined, sent approximately 4.66 billion messages. The Americas and the United Kingdom stood second with 4.42 billion interactions, with the Asia Pacific on third with approximate 1.50 billion messages.\n\nAlternative Mechanism to SWIFT:\n1.\u00a0 System for Transfer of Financial Messages (SPFS)\nSPFS is a Russian equivalent of the SWIFT financial transfer system, developed by the Central Bank of Russia.\nIt was established by the Russian central bank which handles about a fifth of domestic payments.\nIt has only 400 users.\n2. Financial messaging system of the Bank of Russia (FMS)\nThe FMS forms an alternative electronic financial messaging channel which is often called a \u2018SWIFT analogue\u2019.\nThe FMS guarantees the uninterrupted transmission of financial messages within the country.\n3. Cross-Border Interbank Payment System (CIPS)\nChina also has an alternative to SWIFT called the Cross-Border Interbank Payment System (CIPS).\nBut CIPS is much smaller, with roughly 1,300 financial institutions participating, most of them indirectly.\n4. Platform based on inter-ledger protocol\nThere are financial technology companies like Ripple, which has been offering its platform based on inter-ledger protocol (the same technology behind cryptocurrencies) as an alternative.\nCryptocurrencies are another avenue for cross-border remittances. Russia has also been working on a \u2018digital\u2019 rouble, which is still not launched.\nAlternative Mechanism for India:\n\u00a0 1. Rupee-Rial Architecture:\nIndia can adopt a mechanism that can be modelled on the rupee-rial architecture that was used to clear payments to domestic firms when the US imposed sanctions on Iran.\nUnder the rupee-rial mechanism, Indian refiners used to import crude oil from Iran and make payments to the designated rupee-account at Uco Bank and IDBI Bank.\nThis money was, in turn, used to pay Indian exporters. This continued until crude oil was on the exempted list of US sanctions.\n\u00a0 2. Rupee-Rouble Trade Arrangement:\nFollowing the collapse of the Soviet Union in 1991, India entered into a rupee-rouble trade arrangement with Russia to ensure that defence and other imports could continue.\nIn 2018, a pilot project was run where Indian importers paid in roubles for diamond imports.\nThese payments were made to the Indian branch of Russia\u2019s Sberbank. SBI and Canara Bank have a joint venture (The Commercial Indo Bank), which might be able to help Indians there.\n\nArticle written by: Aseem Muhammed"

The Brazilian zebu variation known as \u201cNelore\u201d was created from the Andhra Pradesh strain known as \u201cOngole.\u201d\nBrazil continues to import live embryos from India to maintain the health of its cow herd.\n\nDiplomatic relations between India and Brazil were established in 1948.\n\nThe 1961 liberation of Goa from the Portuguese occupation became a source of tension between India and Brazil.\n\nBrazil backed Portugal\u2019s claim to Goa even while India pushed Portugal to leave the subcontinent.\nBrazil didn\u2019t adjust its strategy until 1961 when it became increasingly obvious that India would be able to seize Goa from a weaker Portugal.\nPortuguese were facing too many internal issues to be a serious military threat to India. India received harsh criticism from the Brazilian government for breaking international law.\nThe Indian government was extremely disappointed that Brazil, a democratic and former colony, would support a non-democratic Portugal against a democratic and recently independent India.\n\nEventually, both nations re-established cordial relations during the cold war. Both countries were against the idea of creating the non-proliferation treaty (NPT).\n\nIndia-Brazil Economic and trade relations\n\nIndia\u2019s top trading partner in the entire LAC (Latin America and the Caribbean) region is Brazil. Over the past two decades, India\u2019s bilateral trade with Brazil has significantly increased.\n\nThe main items of export from India to Brazil are diesel, organic chemicals, pharmaceutical products, man-made filaments, nuclear reactors, boilers, machinery and mechanical appliances, and textile products (synthetic filaments/fibers, cotton, apparel, accessories, etc.).\nThe main items of Brazilian exports to India were Petroleum products, mainly crude oil, cane sugar, copper ore, soya oil, and gold.\nBilateral agreements\nStrategic Partnership Action Plan\nBilateral Investment treaty\nMutual Legal Assistance Agreement (MLAT) on crime\nAgreements on double taxation avoidance, bio-energy or ethanol production, cybersecurity, health, mining, oil and gas exploration and investment, and animal husbandry.\nOperationalization of the Social Security Agreement (SSA) signed between Brazil and India in March 2017, will allow investments in each other\u2019s pension funds, to help business processes and encourage the flow of investment.\nIndia-Brazil Defence relations\n\nIn 2003, Brazil and India agreed to a bilateral \u201cDefence Cooperation Agreement\u201d for collaboration on defense-related issues, particularly in the areas of Research and Development, acquisition, and logistical assistance.\n\nA \u201cJoint Defence Committee (JDC)\u201d has been established within the parameters of the agreement, and it convenes regularly.\n\nCultural relations\n\nIndia\u2019s culture, religion, performing arts, and philosophy are extremely popular in Brazil.\n\nA large number of people practice yoga and Ayurveda in Brazil. The Brazilian Association of Ayurveda (ABRA) is a nonprofit organization having branches in nine different Brazilian states and members throughout the country.\n\nThe telecasting of a tele-novella called \u2018Caminho das Indias\u2019 (Paths to India) made a significant impact in enhancing the consciousness of India in the Brazilian public mind.\n\nPresident Bolsonaro attended the Republic Parade in New Delhi in 2020.\n\nIBSA Dialogue Forum\n\nIBSA Dialogue Forum (India, Brazil, South Africa) is an international tripartite organization for fostering international collaboration among these nations.\n\nIt symbolizes three crucial axes for promoting South-South collaboration and deeper understanding among three significant developing continents, namely Africa, Asia, and South America.\n\nThe meeting gives the three nations a stage to discuss working together in areas like agriculture, trade, culture, and defense, among others.\n\nThe first ever IBSA Summit was held in Bras\u00edlia in September 2006, followed by the Second IBSA Summit held in\u00a0Pretoria\u00a0in October 2007, with the third one held in\u00a0New Delhi\u00a0in October 2008.\n\nFor the regions of Latin America, Africa, and Asia, India and Brazil see this as a vehicle of transformational diplomacy to bring economic growth, sustainable development, poverty reduction, and regional prosperity.\n\nThe South-South Partnership Award was given to the IBSA Fund for Alleviation of Poverty and Hunger at the 2006 UN Day. It has already provided funding for capacity building in East Timor and the battle against HIV/AIDS in Burundi.\n\nIssues in India-Brazil relations\n\nAs mentioned earlier, the 1961 disagreement over the Portuguese occupation of Goa was the first sour point in the relations.\n\nBrazil has complained to the World Trade Organization about New Delhi\u2019s subsidies to farmers of sugarcane. Brazil is the largest sugar producer and exporter and claims that Indian subsidies are against the global trade rules.\n\nChina is the largest trading partner of Brazil; hence the competition is tough for India.\n\nWay forward\n\nIndia-Brazil relations have mostly been cordial and mutually understanding. In 2020, the Brazilian Ambassador agreed with the Indian government\u2019s position that the 2019 Citizenship (Amendment) Act\u2019s implementation and the revocation of Jammu and Kashmir\u2019s special status were domestic matters for India.\n\nIndia would benefit highly from the successful ethanol substitution programs of Brazil to implement green energy and reduce pollution.\n\nIndia and Brazil share the stage at various global forums which is a sign of healthy and advantageous relations that can be used to address challenges of climate change, education, poverty, and so forth.\n\nThe growing relations between India and Brazil share similar values regarding liberal strategies, global governance, and human rights which are crucial for the global balance of powers.\n\n-Article written by Swathi Satish"

It represents a sizable and dynamic market, with an annual projected GDP growth rate of over 8% according to the IMF, which would make it the fastest-growing emerging economy.\n\nThe EU is India\u2019s third-largest trading partner, accounting for \u20ac88 billion worth of trade in goods in 2021, or 10.8% of total Indian trade, after the USA (11.6%) and China (11.4%).\nThe EU is the second-largest destination for Indian exports (14.9% of the total) after the USA (18.1%), while China only ranks fourth (5.8%).\nIndia is the EU\u2019s 10th largest trading partner, accounting for 2.1% of EU total trade in goods in 2021, well behind China (16.2%), the USA (14.7%), and the UK (10%).\nTrade-in goods between the EU and India increased by about 30% in the last decade.\nTrade-in services between the EU and India reached \u20ac30.4 billion in 2020.\nThe EU\u2019s share in foreign investment stock in India reached \u20ac87.3 billion in 2020, up from \u20ac63.7 billion in 2017, making the EU a leading foreign investor in India. This is significant but way below EU foreign investment stocks in China or Brazil.\nSome 6,000 European companies are present in India, providing directly 1.7 million jobs and indirectly 5 million jobs in a broad range of sectors.\n\nOn 28th June 2007, India and the EU began negotiations on a broad-based Bilateral Trade and Investment Agreement (BTIA) in Brussels, Belgium.\n\nThese negotiations are under the commitment made by political leaders at the 7th India-EU Summit held in Helsinki on 13th October 2006 to move towards negotiations for a broad-based trade and investment agreement based on the report of the India-EU High-Level Technical Group.\nThe negotiations cover Trade in Goods, Trade in Services, Investment, Sanitary, and Phytosanitary Measures, Technical Barriers to Trade, Trade Remedies, Rules of Origin, Customs and Trade Facilitation, Competition, Trade Defence, Government Procurement, Dispute Settlement, Intellectual Property Rights & Geographical Indications, Sustainable Development.\nSignificance of India-European Union Trade agreement\nIndia\u2019s bilateral trade with the EU amounted to USD 116.36 billion in 2021-22.\nDespite the global disruptions, bilateral trade achieved impressive annual growth of 43.5% in 2021-22.\nCurrently, the EU is India\u2019s second-largest trading partner after the US and the second-largest destination for Indian exports.\nThe trade agreement with the EU would help India in further expanding and diversifying its exports of goods and services, including securing the value chains.\nBoth sides aim for the trade negotiations to be broad-based, balanced, and comprehensive, based on the principles of fairness and reciprocity.\nIndia and the EU expect to promote bilateral trade by removing barriers to trade in goods and services and investment across all sectors of the economy.\nBoth parties believe that a comprehensive and ambitious agreement that is consistent with WTO rules and principles would open new markets and would expand opportunities for Indian and EU businesses.\nChallenges to India-European Union FTA\n\nEU investment treaty practice illustrates its keenness to include the\u00a0Most Favored Nation (MFN)\u00a0provision in its investment treaties.\n\nIndia is averse to including the MFN provision\u00a0in investment treaties.\n\nEU\u2019s practice is to include in its investment treaties the\u00a0Fair and Equitable Treatment (FET) provision.\n\nFET is an important substantive protection feature that enables foreign investors to hold States accountable for arbitrary behavior.\nThe FET provision is missing in\u00a0India\u2019s Model Bilateral Investment Treaty\u00a0and the recent investment treaties that India has signed.\n\nEU has been batting for a Multilateral Investment Court (MIC) to reform the existing arbitration-based Investor-State Dispute Settlement (ISDS) system.\n\nYet, India\u2019s official position on MIC is unknown. India hasn\u2019t contributed to the ongoing negotiations towards establishing a MIC, which is perplexing for a country that champions a rules-based global order.\n\nThe presence of non-tariff barriers on Indian agricultural products in the form of sanitary and phytosanitary (SPS) measures are too stringent and enable the EU to bar many Indian agrarian products from entering its markets.\n\nThe non-tariff barriers in pharmaceuticals that the EU has imposed include requirements of World Trade Organisation- Good Manufacturing Practice certification, import bans, antidumping measures, and pre-shipment inspection among others.\nWay forward\n\nThe India-European Union Free Trade Agreement is critical for both the EU and India. On a global level both are major and dynamic markets and FTA between them will be highly impactful.\n\nThe three mega-initiatives will eventually dominate the global trade landscape: the Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership (TTIP), the Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP), and the Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership (RCEP).\n\nReaching an agreement that will bring mutual benefit to both the EU and India will be a long journey, but, despite several missed deadlines, it is not out of reach."

Iran supplied silver, gold, lead, zinc, and turquoise to ancient India. Ivory was imported from India.\nIran is an important nation in India\u2019s neighborhood and in fact, the two countries shared a border until India\u2019s partition and independence in 1947.\nThe \u201cTehran Declaration\u201d signed during former Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee\u2019s visit to Iran affirmed the shared vision of the two countries for an \u201cequitable, pluralistic and cooperative international order\u201d.\nBilateral relations\n\nThe two countries have in place several bilateral consultative mechanisms at various levels whose meetings take place regularly.\n\nIn addition, the Institute of Defence Studies and Analyses (IDSA) (now Manohar Parrikar Institute for Defence Studies and Analyses) of India and the Institute of Political and International Studies (IPIS) of Iran hold the regular round tables to exchange views and ideas on bilateral and multilateral issues.\nIran frequently objected to Pakistan\u2019s attempts to draft anti-India resolutions at international organizations such as the OIC (Organisation of Islamic Republic) and the Human Rights Commission. India welcomed Iran\u2019s inclusion as an observer state in the SAARC regional organization.\nIndia-Iran Economic relations\n\nIndia-Iran economic and commercial ties have traditionally been buoyed by the Indian import of Iranian crude oil.\n\nIndia\u2019s exports to Iran include petroleum products, rice, machinery & instruments, manufacturers of metals, primary and semi-finished iron & steel, drugs/pharmaceuticals & fine chemicals, processed minerals, manmade yarn & fabrics, tea, organic /inorganic /agrochemicals, rubber manufactured products, etc\n\nIndia and Iran have set up several projects such as:\n\nAfter engaging in negotiations for several years, the Indian Government finally joined the Turkmenistan, Afghanistan, Pakistan, and India (TAPI) gas pipeline over the Iran\u2013Pakistan\u2013India pipeline (IPI) and the Myanmar\u2013Bangladesh\u2013India pipeline (MBI).\nSouth Pars gas field and LNG project,\nChahbahar container terminal project and Chahbahar-Zaranj railway project, etc.\nBoth countries have set up joint ventures such as the Madras Fertilizer Company and the Chennai Refinery.

This was after the revocation of the Iran nuclear deal. The act hurt India\u2019s energy security.\n\nIndia\u2019s close relations with Israel and Iran\u2019s ties with China are also bones of contention in the bilateral relations.\nThe geopolitical stand of Iran in Yemen against Saudi Arabia and UAE, who are close partners of India, also tends to cause discomfort in the relations.\nIran\u2019s tough statement on the Indian government\u2019s abrogation of Article 370 of the Indian Constitution giving special status to Kashmir is another cause of tension. Iran\u2019s previous regime had on a couple of occasions made statements instigating the Muslims of Kashmir against the governance which was reprimanded by India severely.\nThe termination of Indian participation in the Chhabahar Railway Project and Farzad B gas field was another sour phase.\nRestructuring India-Iran relations\n\nAfghanistan is a common ground where the countries can forge a common and effective policy of engagement. Iran never withdrew its consulate from Kabul after the Taliban took the governance and now since India has opened up communication with the regime, the relations of Iran with the Taliban can be helpful for India as well.\n\nIndia has had good and cordial relations with the Gulf countries. The Gulf countries and Iran have a history of sour relations, but the recent diplomatic talks between Iran and a few Gulf countries like UAE and Qatar opened up the scene for India to have a deeper and wider reach in West Asia.\nThe\u00a0International North-South Transport Corridor (INSTC), an ambitious project launched at the start of this century, aims to connect India, Iran, Afghanistan, Russia, Central Asia, and Europe through multi-modal transport, reducing the transit time of goods drastically.\nAlthough some parts of it have been operationalized, again, due to sanctions on Iran, its full potential has not been realized. India and Iran could well play a major part in giving INSTC the required boost to reap the benefits of resultant trade.\nIn news\nRecently, the Foreign Minister of Iran visited India for the first time since the new government was formed in 2021.\nThe visit was in alignment with the \u201cAsia-oriented\u201d foreign policy of the new Iranian government.\nWay forward\n\nIndia-Iran relations have a lot to achieve in the energy sector and other areas of convergence should be explored to strengthen the bilateral ties.\n\nRead:\u00a0Iran-Israel relations\n\nPrevious year question\n\nQ.

The CSRS network enhances the country\u2019s Maritime Domain Awareness (MDA) in the Indian Ocean region.\n\nMauritius can adds to its capabilities by engaging with professionals from the Indian Navy and the Coast Guard and by procuring Indian defence equipment at attractive financial terms.\n\nInfrastructure development\n\nIn May 2016, India had extended a grant of USD 353 mn to Mauritius as\u00a0Special Economic Package (SEP)\u00a0to execute\u00a0five priority projects\u00a0identified by Mauritius, among others:\n\nMetro Express Project\nSupreme court building\nNew ENT Hospital\nSupply of Digital Tablets to Primary School Children\nSocial Housing Project.\n\nWith the inauguration of the Social Housing Project, all the high-profile projects under the SEP have been implemented.\n\nAnother project is the construction of a State-of-the-Art Civil Service College that will provide a fully equipped and functional facility for the civil servants of Mauritius to undertake various training and skill development programs.\n\nAn 8 MW Solar PV Farm will be constructed that involves the installation of 25,000 PV cells to generate approximately 14 GWh of green energy annually, to electrify approximately 10,000 Mauritian households.\n\nIt will help mitigate the climate challenges that Mauritius faces through the avoidance of 13,000 tons of CO2 emissions.\n\nThis is in line with the One sun One World One Grid (OSOWOG) initiative by India.\n\nImportance of India- Mauritius relations\nGeo-strategic:\n\nThe renewed contestation of the Indian Ocean region has increased the strategic importance of Indian Ocean Region islands for India.\n\nIndia\u2019s Indian ocean strategic vision is called SAGAR (Security and growth for all in the region). This vision called for deepening economic and security cooperation with India\u2019s maritime neighbours.\n\nIn 2015, India and Mauritius signed an agreement that allows India to develop infrastructure in terms of establishing military bases on the Mauritian islands.\n\nEconomic:\n\nIndia is Mauritius\u2019s largest trading partner and has been the largest exporter of goods and services to the Indian Ocean island nation since 2007.\n\nIndia could also contribute to the evolution of Mauritius as a regional centre for technological innovation.\nMauritius could also become a valuable place for regional and international maritime scientific research.\nFor countering Chinese expansive policy:\n\nIn recent years, several external powers, including China, have made increasing inroads in Africa and its Indian Ocean littorals. Mauritius has not been immune from this trend. In January 2021, China\u2019s Free Trade Agreement (FTA) with Mauritius came into effect.\n\nIn its string of pearls policy, China has built significant relations across the Indian Ocean, from Gwadar (Pakistan) to Hambantota (Sri Lanka) to Kyaukpyu (Myanmar).\n\nTherefore, India should help Indian Ocean littoral states like Mauritius, Maldives, Sri Lanka, and Seychelles as part of capacity and capability enhancement in strengthening their maritime domain awareness capabilities.\n\nWay forward:\n\nWhile India and Mauritius share cultural contiguity dating back to colonial times and a special partnership in recent years, India cannot take its influence in Mauritius for granted and should continue to enhance its engagement with this important island country.\n\nHence it is important to enhance the India-Mauritius ties further based on India\u2019s neighborhood first policy."

However, Afghanistan has refused to accept it as the border between Pakistan.\n\n\ud83d\udc49 Which year are YOU targeting for success in the IAS/IPS/IFS Exam? \ud83d\ude80\n\n(1) \u21d2 UPSC 2025: Prelims cum Mains\n\n(2) \u21d2 UPSC 2026: Prelims cum Mains\n\n(3) \u21d2 UPSC 2027 Prelims cum Mains\n\nTip: Know more about ClearIAS Courses (Online/Offline)\n\nOn 30th September 1947, Afghanistan even opposed the entry of Pakistan to the United Nations, due to the differences over the Durand Line.\n\nAfghanistan\u2019s revanchist designs against Pakistan\nIn 1947, Afghanistan wanted to undo the line but they also wanted Khyber Pakhtunkhwa (Pakhtunistan or KP region) and Baluchistan as part of Afghanistan, both of which were forcibly incorporated by Pakistan.\nThough Pakistan accepts the Durand Line as the border, it feels that Afghanistan can resort to a revanchist design to seek the territory back one day.\nFor a long time, Pakistan has aimed to make Durand Line the border and make Afghanistan accept the same, but Pakistan has met constant failure to do so, even with no success when the Taliban, which was created by Pakistan, remained in power from 1996 to 2001.\nStrategy of Pakistan\nSince 2001, Pakistan has followed a two-point strategy.\nFirstly, it favours a weak, client style government in Afghanistan. The Pakistani assumption is that such a weak government in Afghanistan can never resort to a revanchist design against Pakistan and seek KP or Baluchistan back for Afghanistan.\nSecondly, Pakistan does not favour a strong India-Afghanistan relation as it fears that a strong Afghanistan and India relationship will encourage Afghanistan to resort to a revanchist design again.\nThis is why Pakistan maintains a strategic depth against India in Afghanistan.\nWhile trying to achieve the two stated objectives, Pakistan has committed many blunders. For example, during the Cold War, they perceived Afghans as Soviet stooges.\nPakistani perception and strategic depth\nAs the state of Pakistan has never looked at Afghanistan as a land of ethnic Afghan people, it has generated tremendous hatred amongst the local Afghans against Pakistan.\nToday, Pakistan perceives Afghans as Indian stooges.\nPakistan still hopes to achieve a pro-Pakistan government in Afghanistan as such a government is a guarantee against the revanchist designs, keeps India away from Afghanistan (strategic depth) and also provides a fertile ground for Pakistan to channelize their Madrassa products to train them for Jihad.\nPakistan has followed a policy of arming and supporting dissidents in Afghanistan who are opposed to the West sponsored democratic government in Afghanistan since 2001.\nPakistan and Taliban\nAs Pakistan has understood, over a period of time, that they cannot forcibly bring Taliban (Pakistani trump card) into Afghanistan, they have adopted the tactic of bringing the Taliban as a political player in the future of Afghanistan.\nThe recent troop withdrawal by the US in Afghanistan announced by Trump and negotiations with the Taliban led by Zalmay Khalilzad are an attempt by Pakistan to politically accommodate the Taliban into Afghanistan after the US leaves Afghanistan.\nWhy is the Taliban a threat to Pakistan?\nPakistan fails to understand that even if the Taliban comes to power again in Afghanistan, it will be a threat to Pakistan itself, as it will try to impose its own version of Islam, which will threaten Pakistan, as Pakistan does not have a strong Islamic identity.\nAlso, the Taliban is bound to reassert the demand for Pakhtunistan, which will be the nemesis for Pakistan.\nIf the Taliban comes back, it will only lead to Talibanization of Pakistan, which will not only be detrimental for its own future but will also reverse the strategic depth policy Pakistan practices.\nPakistani conundrum\nThe entire situation is thus quite ironical. At one place Pakistan itself is a revanchist state that wants to alter the territorial boundaries in Kashmir.\nOn the other hand, it is itself a victim of a larger revanchist design by Afghanistan where it may lose a substantial territory.\nThis is a conundrum Pakistan will continue to face in its future. Pakistan is unable to learn from history that no one can subjugate the Afghans.\nThe British (after The Great Game), USSR (during the Cold War) and the US (in its Global War on Terror) realized that Afghans cannot be easily subjugated. For the US, Afghanistan was their 21st century Vietnam. However, Pakistan, still hopes that a pro-Pakistan government in Afghanistan will toe the line to Pakistan. This is nothing but a chimaera.\nChina-Pakistan\nThe China-Pakistan relations are often described as \u2018higher than Himalayas\u2019 and of being \u2018Iron brothers\u2018.\nIt is a unique friendship that exists between a god-fearing Pakistan and the godless state of China. Pakistan looks at China as a pole star with respect to its security and China looks at Pakistan as a hub with respect to its South Asia policy.\nThe beauty of the relationship is that it is sacrosanct irrespective of a civilian or a military regime in Pakistan.\nChinese interests in Pakistan\n\nChina has three interests in Pakistan.\n\nFirstly, there is a mutuality between Pakistan and China with respect to undercutting India.\nSecondly, the prevention of radical Islam from Afghanistan and Pakistan into the Xinjiang province of China to create a stir amongst the Uyghur Muslims.\nThirdly, Pakistan is a gateway for China to Afghanistan and the Middle East.\nPakistani concept of borrowed power with China and impact on India\n\nFor Pakistan, China fits into the concept of borrowed power, to undercut India.\n\nChina also serves the interests of Pakistan, be it regionally constraining India or globally vetoing decisions that are harmful to Pakistan that range from blocking India at the Nuclear Suppliers Group membership to preventing the rise of India as a regional power.\n\nChina has a very important relationship with Pakistan in the dimension of defence.\n\nIt has provided Pakistan with nuclear support, ballistic missiles and conventional weapons.\n\nThis support to Pakistan is perceived by China as a low-cost option, which delivers high results.\n\nFirstly, it keeps India bogged down with Pakistan to prevent its healing due to the Pakistani strategy of bleeding India by causing death by a thousand cuts.\n\nSecondly, it always puts pressure on India for the possibility of a two-front war in the future.\n\nIf military cooperation is at the heart of the China-Pakistan axis, then nuclear cooperation is at the heart of this military axis.\n\nConclusion\n\nWith the recent rise of a new game-changer called CPEC, it is a high possibility that Pakistan will soon end up being a new colony of China.\n\nWhatever it may be, China will always use Pakistan as a balancer against India to keep Indian ambitions in check."

Learn more through the explainer video.\n\nWhat is the reason behind the Kalapani Dispute?

The map showed Kalapani as part of Pithoragarh district (Uttarakhand, India).\n\nNepal protested immediately.\n\nOn May 8, 2020, India inaugurated the Darchula-Lipulekh pass link road, passing through the disputed Kalapani area. This route helps the Indian pilgrims to reach Kailash Mansarovar (Tibet, China) faster.\n\nNepal expressed its displeasure by summoning the Indian Ambassador to Nepal.\n\nNepal now is trying to give constitutional status to a revised official map incorporating the territory from the Limpiyadhura source of the Kali to Kalapani and Lipulekh pass in the northeast of the triangular region as its territory.\n\nIndian observers say this move makes any future solution on the Kalapani issue nearly impossible as a constitutional guarantee will make Kathmandu\u2019s position inflexible. (Source: The Hindu)\n\nThe present status is that both India and Nepal claim Kalapani as an integral part of their territory \u2014 India as part of Uttarakhand\u2019s Pithoragarh district and Nepal as part of Darchula district. (Source: The Print)\n\nRiver Kali as the boundary of Nepal: Treaty of Sugauli (1816)\n\nNepal considers the river Kali as its boundary. This view is based on the treaty of Sugauli.\n\nThe treaty was signed between the Gurkha rulers of Kathmandu and the East India Company after the Gurkha War/Anglo-Nepal War (1814-16).\n\nOrigin of River Kali: Two interpretations\n\nIn essence, the source of river Kali (Mahakali) is at the heart of the dispute between the countries.\n\nRiver Kali has several tributaries, all of which merge at Kalapani (according to India).\n\nIndia claims that the river begins in Kalapani as this is where all its tributaries merge. But Nepal claims that it begins from Lipu Lekh Pass, the origin of most of its tributaries.\n\nWhile Nepal\u2019s claim of the territory east of Kali is based on the Limpiyadhura origin, India says the river takes the name Kali near Kalapani.\n\nKalapani Dispute: India\u2019s stand\nThe new map of India accurately depicts the sovereign territory of India.\nThe new map has in no manner revised our boundary with Nepal.\nThe boundary delineation exercise with Nepal is ongoing under the existing mechanism.\n\nEfforts to resolve the Kalapani dispute continue, with diplomatic channels being the primary means of seeking a mutually acceptable resolution. The dispute underscores the complexity of border disputes, historical interpretations, and the strategic significance of territorial claims in the Himalayan region. It remains an issue of importance in South Asian geopolitics.\n\nRead:\u00a0India-Nepal Relations"

It evolved over decades and reached its present model in 1992.\n\nThere are 51 countries in Europe, out of which 28 countries have signed a treaty to become a part of the European Union. So, clearly, there are countries in Europe which are not part of the European Union.\n\nThe EU treaty provided for a European Parliament and European Council which consisted of representatives of the member states.\n\nEU members account for 16 per cent of world imports and exports.\n\nIt is the largest trading bloc in the world surpassing the US.\n\nIn 2012, the EU was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize for advancing the causes of peace, reconciliation, democracy and human rights in Europe.\n\nWhat is the Euro Area?\nThe Euro Area (EA) is a subset of the EU, which is a monetary union of 19 of the 28 countries which use the common currency, Euro.\nNot all EU members use the Euro.

It does not use the Euro and has retained its own currency, the Pound Sterling.\nWhy the \u2018Leave EU\u2019 campaign?\nThe Leave Campaign argues that Britain is losing out a big deal by staying in the EU.\nIt has to pay millions of pounds each week as a contribution to the European budget.\nThe extremely bureaucratic nature of the European parliament is hurting British exporters\nMigration from the European Union into Britain (mainly PIGS economies) is creating an imbalance in the welfare schemes of the UK government.\nBut, those who oppose the campaign say that Britain is a net gainer if She stays in the EU.\nAbout the referendum and the result\nA referendum denotes voting in which everyone (or nearly everyone) of voting age can take part, normally giving a \u2018Yes\u2019 or \u2018No\u2019 answer to a question. The side which gets more than half of all votes cast is declared a winner.\nPrime Minister David Cameron (Conservative Party) had promised to hold a referendum for Brexit if he won the 2015 general election. But, he led\u00a0the campaign for \u2018stay\u2019 vote.\nThere were\u00a0growing calls from many MPs of the Conservative Party\u00a0and the UK Independence Party (UKIP), for a new referendum. (In 1975, Britain had\u00a0voted to stay in the EU in a referendum).\nA referendum was held on\u00a0June 23, 2016, to decide whether Britain should exit or remain in the European Union.\nEligible voters: All British, Irish and Commonwealth citizens over 18 who are resident in the UK, along with UK nationals living abroad who have been on the electoral register in the UK in the past 15 years.\n51.9% of voters favoured exit of Britain from the EU.\u00a0It is the first time since the EU was founded in 1957 that a member country is leaving.\nIndia, the UK, and the European Union\n\nIndia is one of the top investors in the UK.\nThere are about 800 Indian-owned companies in the country employing roughly 110,000 people. (Eg:\u00a0Jaguar Land Rover is owned by the Tata group)\nMany of these firms made investments with the wider European market in mind.\nTogether, the UK and Europe account for over-a-quarter of the country\u2019s IT exports, worth around $30bn.\nThe UK is the third-largest source of foreign direct investment in India and India\u2019s largest G20 investor.\nIndia is the third-largest source of FDI to the UK in terms of numbers of projects. India invests more in the UK than in the rest of Europe combined, emerging as the UK\u2019s third-largest FDI investor.\nThe key sectors attracting Indian investment include healthcare, agritech,\u00a0food, and drink.\nIn November 2015, Prime Minister Modi has said, \u201dAs far as India is concerned, if there is an entry point for us to the EU, that is the UK.\u201d\nBut, the UK is only India\u2019s 12th largest trade partner, well behind other European countries such as Germany and Switzerland.\nInterestingly, the UK is also among just seven in 25 top countries with which India enjoys a trade surplus.\nNegative Impacts of the Brexit referendum on India\nIndia will have to adjust to changing world order.\nThere may be foreign fund outflow and dollar rise.\nRupee may depreciate because of the double effect of foreign fund outflow and dollar rise.\nThis may\u00a0increase petrol and diesel prices to an extent.\nThe government then may want to reduce additional excise duty imposed on fuel when it was on a downward\u00a0trajectory. This may\u00a0increase fiscal deficit unless revenue increased.\nPrices of gold, electronic goods, among others may also increase.\nSensex and Nifty may tumble in the short-run.\nThe falling value of the pound could render several existing contracts loss-making.\nThe vote is also bad news for Indian outsourcers.\nForeign funds are likely to move out if the world outside thinks that investment in India is risky.\nIndia\u2019s Forex (currently a record 363 billion dollars) may diminish, particular if the currency is stored in Euros or Pound (this comes around\u00a020% of total forex).\nBrexit will have a negative impact on the $108 billion Indian IT sector in the short term.\nMany Indian companies are listed on the London Stock Exchange and many have European headquarters in London. Brexit will take away this advantage.\nDue to fall in the value of Pound sterling, Indian\u00a0exports to the UK will suffer. Cheaper rupee will make Indian exports, including IT and ITeS, competitive. Indian import companies operating in the UK may also report a loss. Also, note that India is exporting more than what it is importing from Britain.\nPositive\u00a0Impacts of the Brexit referendum on India\nThere are many\u00a0who think a weakening British currency might be good news.\nIndia being more of an importing country than an exporting nation, the overall effect may turn out positive for India (if the dollar doesn\u2019t appreciate much against rupee).\nWith lower pound value, Indian companies may be able to acquire many hi-tech assets.\nAs investors look around the world for safe havens in these turbulent times, India stands out both in terms of stability and of growth.\nBrexit might give a boost to trade ties between India and the UK.\nBritain will now be free to discuss a bilateral trade pact with India.\nDue to the fall in the value of Pound sterling, those who import from the UK will gain. Indian export companies operating in the UK may also gain.\nMore Indian\u00a0tourists can afford to visit Britain in the coming days as the currency value has fallen.\nMore Indian\u00a0students can afford to study in Britain (for higher education) as the fees may seem cheaper.\nBritain will need a steady inflow of talented labour, and India fits the bill perfectly due to its English-speaking population.\nThe fall in the prices of commodities like crude, which will help India save a lot on its import bill (every $1 drop in crude prices leads to roughly $1 billion savings in India\u2019s oil import bill), reducing its trade and current account deficits (CAD).\nBrexit would weaken global growth and lead to a meaningful decline in commodity prices. This is only going to enhance both the relative and absolute appeal of India.\nLower commodity prices will help the macro fundamentals: be it fiscal deficit, current account deficit or inflation, which will give the government more levers to pump up the investment cycle.\nBrexit: What does it mean to Britain?\nAs per International Monetary Fund (IMF), a vote to exit the European Union in the referendum could leave Britain\u2019s economy more than 5 per cent smaller by 2019 than if it stays in the 28-nation club.\nBrexit could cause the country\u2019s economy to be between 3.8 and 7.5 per cent smaller by 2030.\nThe pound expected to fall by around 20 per cent. This would mean that exports to the UK will suffer and imports from the UK will gain. Export companies operating in the UK will gain, while import companies will lose.\nMore foreign tourists will visit Britain in the coming days as the currency value has fallen.\nMore foreign students may prefer Britain for higher education as the fees may seem cheaper.\nEU citizens in Britain and Brits living in other EU nations would have to update their immigration statuses.\nCompanies operating in both the UK and the EU would have to verify that they\u2019re compliant with two sets of laws.\nUS President Obama has warned that it could take 10 years for Britain to negotiate a new trade deal with the US.\nThe referendum results (52:48) is very close. This means a\u00a0major division of opinion in Britain which has social implications too. While the less educated and the old seems to favour the \u2018leave EU\u2019 campaign, the young and the employed are more in favour of Britain staying in the EU.\nBrexit could encourage England, Wales, Scotland, or Northern Ireland to appeal for quitting the United Kingdom.\nBrexit: What does it mean to the World?\nRemittance from the UK to countries outside in terms of Pound will fetch lesser returns compared to the past.\nExport dominated countries may be affected, whether exporting to the UK or not. If the UK is the major trading partner, the effect will be more.\nThe United States will bear the major brunt of a Brexit being the UK\u2019s biggest trading partner.\nA\u00a0direct impact on Asian economies from Brexit is unlikely in the long term because as a percentage of GDP, exports to the UK is less than 2% for most economies.\nBut businesses in some major Asian economies \u2013 like India and Japan- will be hit.\nCompanies which have set up operations in the UK to gain access to EU markets will be affected.\nBREXIT would likely allow any US Dollar strength to play out. This may cause other currencies to decline in value.\nIs India ready to handle the Brexit?\nThe finance ministry said that\u00a0the country has sufficient foreign exchange reserves to handle any impact.\nRBI Governor then, Raghuram Rajan, said the central bank will infuse whatever liquidity is needed into the Indian market to keep it \u201cwell behaved\u201d.\nSEBI and stock exchanges have beefed up their surveillance mechanism to deal with any excessive volatility.\nIf exports to the UK are costly and imports are cheaper, India can think of utilizing the import-advantage by reversing the present trade scenario.\nOnce the dust settles, India may\u00a0be seen to be a net gainer and inflows would continue to gravitate towards the Indian shores.\nLatest Updates on Brexit\n\nNegotiations with the EU officially started in June 2017, aiming to complete the withdrawal agreement by October 2018. However, that didn\u2019t happen. Having failed to get her agreement approved, May resigned as prime minister in July 2019 and was succeeded by Boris Johnson.\n\nBoris Johnson sought to replace parts of the agreement and vowed to leave the EU by the new deadline. An early general election was then held on 12 December. The Conservatives won a large majority in that election, with Johnson declaring that the UK would leave the EU in early 2020.\n\nThe Withdrawal Agreement was ratified by the UK Parliament on 23 January 2020, and by the European Parliament on 29 January, ensuring the UK leaves the EU on 31 January.\n\nUK left the EU at 11 p.m. GMT on 31 January 2020.\n\nHowever, the UK is still negotiating the future trade relationship with the EU. Britain is now going through a transition period where negotiations are open. The transition period will end on 31 December 2020.\n\nDuring the transition, the UK still remains subject to EU law and remains part of the EU customs union and single market, but is no longer part of the EU\u2019s political institutions."

The fall of Alexander (in Bactria), disintegration of USSR, and the decline of US hegemony were started in this region. There is an ever-growing perception that it is difficult to come out of Afghan quagmire.\n\nThe present US situation rings testimony to this quagmire.\n\nHistory of India-Afghan relations\n\nRelations between the people of Afghanistan and India can be traced back to the Indus Valley Civilisation. Following Alexander the Great\u2019s brief occupation, the successor state of the Seleucid Empire controlled the region known today as Afghanistan. In 305 BCE, they ceded much of it to the Indian Maurya Empire as part of an alliance treaty. The Mauryans brought Buddhism from India and controlled the area south of the Hindu Kush.\n\nFrom the 10th century to the mid 18th century, northern India has been invaded by a number of invaders based in what today is Afghanistan. Some of them were Ghaznavids, Khaljis, Mughals, Durranis etc. During these eras, many Afghans began immigrating to India due to political unrest in their regions.\n\nKhan Abdul Ghaffar Khan of Afghan was a prominent leader of the Indian independence movement and active supporter of the Indian National Congress.\n\nIndia-Afghanistan Relations \u2013 Strategic, Economic, and Security Interests\n\nIndia-Afghanistan: Strategic interests\nIf we go by Mandal Sidhanth, Afghan is India\u2019s natural ally.\nIndia is interested in retaining Afghanistan as a friendly state from which it has the capacity to monitor Pakistan and cultivate assets to influence activities in Pakistan.\nWhile India is keenly interested in cultivating a significant partnership with Afghanistan, Pakistan is trying to deny India these very opportunities.\nIndia\u2019s interest in Afghan is more than mere Pakistan-centrist and reflects its aspiration to be and to be seen as a regional power.\nIslamic fundamentalism in Pakistan and Afghan has deleterious effects in the domestic social fabric of India, as Hindu fundamentalism in India is triggered by these external developments.\nAfghan is also a center of \u2018great games\u2019.\nIn Medieval times it was between Persian and Mughal Empire.\nDuring colonial times it was between Russia and Britain.\nIndia-Afghanistan: Economic interests\nAfghanistan has a mineral wealth of about $1-3 trillion of Iron ore, Lithium, Chromium, Natural Gas, Petroleum etc.\nSafeguarding Indian investments and personnel in Afghan is utmost important to India as Indian investment in Afghan amounts to about $3bn.\nIndia-Afghanistan: Security interests\nIndia faced many security challenges from the Taliban in Afghan during the 1990s.\nPakistan has raised and supported several militant groups such as Lashkar-e-Taiba, Harkat-ul-Mujahideen/Harkat-ul-Ansar, and Harkat-ul-Jihad-al-Islami among others, which operate in India.\nAll of these groups have trained in Afghanistan, with varying proximity to the Taliban and by extension al-Qaeda.\nThus India is absolutely adamant that Afghanistan should not again become a terrorist safe haven.\nRadical ideologies and terrorism spreading in this region are a security threat for India.\nWith Pakistan increasing its strategic depth in Afghan, it can reverse the gain of India in Afghan brought through much cost. Pakistan can incubate and move around various anti-India groups in Afghan especially in Loya Paktia.\nThe golden crescent comprising of Iran, Afghan, and Pakistan is a worry for India, especially with respect to the issue of drug abuse in Punjab.\nIslamic State is using Afghan as an outpost in Asia as it comes under stress in Iraq and Syria.\nHistory of Indian engagement in Afghan post Independence\nNarendra Modi and the President of the Islamic Republic of Afghanistan, Mr. Mohammad Ashraf Ghani. (Source: PIB)\nIndia has sought to establish its presence in Afghanistan from the early days of its independence in 1947.\nIn 1950, Afghanistan and India signed a \u201cFriendship Treaty.\u201d\nIndia had robust ties with Afghan King Zahir Shah\u2019s regime.\nPrior to the Soviet invasion in 1979, New Delhi had formalized agreements and protocols with various pro-Soviet regimes in Kabul.\nWhile India\u2019s role in Afghanistan was constrained during the anti-Soviet jihad, between 1979 and 1989, India expanded its development activities in Afghanistan, focusing upon industrial, irrigation, and hydroelectric projects.\nAfter the Taliban consolidated their hold on Afghanistan in the mid-1990s, India struggled to maintain its presence and to support anti-Taliban forces.\nHowever, Indian objectives in Afghanistan remained modest given the constrained environment. India aimed to undermine the ability of the Taliban to consolidate its power over Afghanistan, principally by supporting the Northern Alliance in tandem with other regional actors.\nWorking with Iran, Russia, and Tajikistan, India provided important resources to the Northern Alliance, the only meaningful challenge to the Taliban in Afghanistan.\nSince 2001, India has relied upon development projects and other forms of humanitarian assistance.\nDebate on India\u2019s role in Afghan\n\nThere is a debate among major players in Afghan on the optimal role for India in Afghanistan\u2019s reconstruction in light of the enduring security competition between India and Pakistan.\n\nExpanding India\u2019s presence in Afghanistan through increased Indian training of Afghan civilian and military personnel, development projects, and expanded economic ties.\nCaution against India\u2019s involvement.\nIndian and Pakistani competition in Afghanistan is seen as a new \u201cGreat Game\u201d and argues that Afghanistan can be pacified only through a regional solution that resolves once and for all the intractable Indo-Pakistan dispute over Kashmir.\nAfghan History\nPhase I \u2013 until the end of the cold war\n\nMonarchy under King Zahir Shah lasted till 1973 and was overthrown by a coup led by Mohammed Daoud Khan.\u00a0 He declared Afghanistan as a republic. Against his repressive rule, protest became widespread leading to Communist Revolution or Saur Revolution in 1978 and the Democratic Republic of Afghanistan came into being. The event proved to be the catalyst for decades of unrest and bloodshed in Afghan. There were protests against the Democratic Republic of Afghanistan and to stabilize the communist regime, USSR intervened in 1979.\n\nThe Democratic Republic of Afghanistan, renamed in 1987 to the Republic of Afghanistan, commonly known as Afghanistan, existed from 1978 to 1992, during which time the socialist People\u2019s Democratic Party of Afghanistan (PDPA) ruled Afghanistan.\n\nIndia had an upper hand as the diplomatic and cultural ties were strong with the Afghan regime during these periods.\nIndia was the only South Asian nation to recognize the Soviet-backed Democratic Republic of Afghanistan and the Soviet Union\u2019s military presence in Afghan territories.\n\nMeanwhile, US-Pakistan interest coincided in Afghan. After the Iranian revolution, Iran came out of US influence in the Middle Eastern region. So the US was apprehensive of growing Soviet influence in Afghan. Thus CIA-ISI worked together to destabilize the communist government in Afghan, which led to USSR intervention in 1979. The intervention lasted from 1979 to 1989.\n\nMujahadeen succeeded in toppling communist regime in Afghan in 1989. Mujahadeen was Pakistani supported alliance by seven Afghan Mujahideen parties fighting against the Soviet-backed the Democratic Republic of Afghan forces in Soviet-Afghan war.\n\nIndia, however, recognized the Mujahadeen government. Following the withdrawal of the Soviet armed forces from Afghanistan in 1989, India continued to support Najibullah\u2019s government (Mujahadeen government) with humanitarian aid.\n\nTaliban to power\nEven though the Mujahadeen government came into power by the backing of US-Pakistan, the government comprised of different warlords. This lead to the power struggle between them and there was a law & order crisis.\nMoreover, the then president, Najibullah, become pro-India.\nThis lead to the promotion of Taliban by Pakistan.\nWHO ARE THE TALIBAN?\nTaliban means students.\nThey are refugees of Afghan civil war and are located in NWFP in Pakistan.\nThey were educated in Madrasas financed by Saudi Arabia and indoctrinated with Wahabism-Salafism.\nWahabism is a puritan movement in Islam who wants Shariat rule.\n\nAfter fall of Mujahadeen government, India together with the international community supported the coalition government that took control, but relations and contacts ended with the outbreak of another civil war, which brought to power the Taliban. The Taliban regime was recognized only by Pakistan, Saudi Arabia, and the United Arab Emirates (UAE). The destruction of the Bamiyan Buddha monuments by the Taliban led to outrage and angry protests by India. In 1999, the hijacked Indian Airlines Flight 814 landed and stayed in Kandahar in Afghanistan and the Taliban were suspected of supporting them. India became one of the key supporters of the anti-Taliban Northern Alliance.\n\nPhase II \u2013 since the end of the cold war\nIndia tried to repair the relations since the 1990s. But the emergence of the Taliban with Pakistan\u2019s support limited India\u2019s options. India continued to support anti-Taliban forces in Afghanistan.\nThe war in Afghan (2001-present)\nMeanwhile, post-cold war scenario changed the regional dynamics and US war on terror in 2001 lead to the defeat of the Taliban.\nUS war in Afghan was started in 2001. The war\u2019s public aims were to dismantle al-Qaeda and to deny it a safe base of operations in Afghanistan by removing the Taliban from power\nThe US demanded extradition of Osama-bin-Laden from Taliban post 9/11. Taliban didn\u2019t comply and the US launched the war on Afghan under the war on terror. Northern Alliance, which was fighting the Taliban since the 1990s, offered assistance to the US in this endeavour. Thus all the powers, including India, Russia, the US fought against the Taliban. Taliban was ousted and went underground in Pakistan.\nIndia offered assistance for the US in this endeavour. India sensed an opportunity to re-establish itself in Afghanistan in this different international and regional framework. India began assistance for reconstruction and nation-building in Afghan.\nZaranj\u2013Delaram road in 2009.\nSalma dam.\nConstruction of Afghan parliament.\nAfter the US invasion of Iraq in 2003, the concentration of US was shifted to Iraq. This lead to Taliban insurgency in 2005 and they regrouped from Pakistan hideouts.\nSince then the US is looking to come out of the war in Afghan but the war is being protracted without an end in sight.\nRecently US-Taliban talks were held in Doha and US announced that there has been an in-principle agreement on key issues: US troop will leave Afghan and in return, the Taliban promised that Afghan will not be used by terrorists.\n\nThus from 2001 to present, the Taliban has emerged as an important central player in the Afghan peace process. Now major players like US, Russia, China have accepted this centrality of the Taliban. Since only Pakistan has influence over the Taliban, this turn of events can be considered as a diplomatic victory of Pakistan whereas India is increasingly being sidelined in these proceedings.\n\nPakistan\u2019s policy\u00a0on Afganistan\nIndia\u2019s engagement is a cause of insecurity for Pakistan.\nPakistan is an unnatural nation that suffers from a crisis of nation-building. Since the beginning, it has been witnessing ethnic conflicts between Punjabis-Sindhis, between native inhabitants and Muhasir, Shia-Sunni, Baluch etc.\nIts biggest fear is the possibility of the creation of greater Pashtunistan. NWFP, south & central Pakistan is * *dominated by Pashtoons. They don\u2019t recognize the legitimacy of the Durand line and treat it as a colonial boundary. The Pashtoon government of Afghan is inspired by integration of the region in Afghan.\nPakistan wants a strategic depth in Afghan \u2013 it wants whosoever rules Afghan is completely controlled by Pakistan. Pakistan is not ready to tolerate even the minimum presence of India (diplomatic also).\nPakistan has tensions over India\u2019s presence in Afghanistan and the presence of India is seen as a provocation in Islamabad and as evidence of an Indian strategy of encirclement.\nIndian policy on Afghanistan\n\nAfghan is India\u2019s natural partner, not just to balance Pakistan but also for the fulfilment of energy-economic interest.\nIndian policy in Afghan can be described as the dichotomy between its aspiration for a larger role in its northwestern neighbourhood and the real constraints on it.\nIn 2011 India became the first country Afghanistan signed a strategic partnership agreement. Until then India was following US demand of India\u2019s limited cooperation with Afghan.\nIndia has repeatedly stressed that its relationship with Afghan is independent of Pakistan.\nIndia argues that the tripartite relationship between India, Pakistan, and Afghan are mutually independent:\nIn both the 1965 and 1971 wars, Afghanistan was non-committal and did not support India.\nOn the Kashmir issue, Afghanistan has not publicly supported India\nIndia has not entered the debate on the Durand Line.\nIn 2018, in a first major offensive military platform to Kabul, India gifted a Mi 25 attack helicopter.\nThe delivery marks the first time India has gifted offensive combat capability to Afghanistan, a sensitive topic in the past due to strong objections by Pakistan.\nUnder the agreement, India will also train Afghan defence personnel on operations.\nUS policy on Afghanistan\nUS policy on Afghan had not been consistent. On the one hand, the US thinks that it needs the assistance of Pakistan to solve the issue because of the geographic proximity of Pakistan to Afghan. On the other hand, the US is also wary of Pakistan\u2019s double game of supporting the US and Taliban at the same time.\nBecause of this inherent inconsistency of US policy regarding Afghan, US has not been able to decide what should be the extent of India\u2019s role in Afghan.\nIndia\u2019s reconstruction program in Afghan is inconvenient for the US for the fear of provocation of Pakistan.\nUnder the Obama government\nObama policy was of regional diplomacy along with providing additional troops in Afghan.\nThe aim was to draw down forces from 2011 and by 2014 Afghan will take over security.\nBut Taliban increased attacks thus exposing the weakness of Afghan capability to take over.\nUnder Trump government\nDonald Trump endorsed that the Afghan war should be ended at the earliest possible time.\nBut hasty withdrawal would create a vacuum as the ground situation had become more complicated with various terrorist outfits including ISIS and al-Qaeda gaining space in Afghan.\nFollowed Obama policy of a modest increase in troops.\nInitiated New Afghan policy.\nNew Afghan strategy of US\nMilitary commitment without a deadline.\nOpen acknowledgement of Pakistan\u2019s role in providing sanctuary to Afghan-based militant groups.\nAcknowledgement of India\u2019s\u2019 role in stabilizing Afghan.\nUS.\u2019s new Afghanistan-Pakistan-India policy builds India\u2019s economic assistance into its own strategy for Afghanistan.\n\nUnder the strategy, the US held back its aid to Pakistan until Islamabad demonstrates action against terrorist groups. However, China came in aid of Pakistan by arguing that Pakistan has also been affected by terrorism.\n\nAfter the US released this new Afghanistan strategy, Defense Minister Nirmala Sitharaman visited the US. India put forward its Afghan strategy:\n\nThere will be no Indian boots-on-ground in Afghan.\nIndia will provide economic assistance and capacity building.\nIndia will sign MoU with Afghan to train its police force.\nIndia will assist Afghan in its own way and not the way desired by the US, that is boots-on-ground.\nCountered the argument of Pakistan Prime Minister that India has zero political and zero military role in Afghan.\n\nHowever, President Donald Trump now appears reconciled to Pakistan\u2019s centrality to the endgame in the region. He unilaterally announced his plan of pulling US troops out of Afghan. A \u201cframework\u201d deal between the US and Afghan Taliban signed at Doha. Washington\u2019s hasty timetable of 18 months to disentangle itself from the Afghan quagmire has narrowed the US\u2019s options. Due to this India is trapped in a strategic blind-spot in Afghanistan.\n\nRegional Powers\nChina\nChina\u2019s role in Afghanistan is gradually evolving towards more engagement in various areas. China has evolved into a notable though not yet major player in Afghanistan in the areas of investment, economic and humanitarian assistance.\nThis increasing engagement reflects both China\u2019s concerns about the deterioration of security in Afghanistan and its interest in benefiting from a reconstructed Afghanistan.\nAfghan\u2019s geographic location at the crossroads of Central and South Asia, between India in the South and Russia in the North, is of great strategic value to China. In addition, Afghanistan\u2019s vast natural resources are also an attraction.\nChina\u2019s interest in ensuring stability in Afghan reflects its growing worries about an eruption of insecurity that could endanger its security of its border province Xinjiang, its investments in the Central Asian region and also its OBOR initiative.\nBeijing is concerned about possible links between its Muslim minorities in Xinjiang and the Taliban, as well as other Islamist groups in Afghanistan.\nBeijing remains reluctant to consider a security role in Afghanistan but has made major diplomatic efforts to promote the Afghan peace process.\nChina is holding talks in Islamabad since early 2016 along with Afghanistan, the US, and Pakistan (the Quadrilateral Coordination Group). China is also holding peace talks between the Afghan government and the Taliban.\nChina\u2019s role as a mediator and confidence-builder may be crucial, as its pressure has kept Pakistan peacefully engaged.\nWhat Afghanistan needs is long-term and sustainable support \u2013 and China would be in a position to provide it, be it in the frame of its OBOR scheme or other initiatives.\nThere may also be several areas of common interest for China to explore with other countries that are present in Afghanistan already.\nThis could include joint infrastructure projects and training and professionalization for Afghans.\nIndia and China have agreed for joint projects in Afghan in the Wuhan summit in 2018.\nIran\nLike India, Russia, China, and the U.S., Iran would want to see a steady hand at the helm in Afghanistan.\nIranian Revolution 1979 can be seen as a precursor to Afghan turmoil. Iranian Revolution led to two developments in the region:\nIran came out of US influence. The US thus intervened in Afghan to counter USSR influence in the region. This lead to USSR intervention in Afghan in 1979.\nIranian Revolution consolidated Shia sect in Iran. This threatened Saudi and UAE lead by Sunni sects. This, in turn, led them to finance Wahabism-Salafism and thus Taliban.\nSince Saudi was promoting Wahhabi Islam through the Taliban, Iran supported the overthrow of the Taliban in 2001.\nAfter deterioration of US-Iran ties, Iran began to support the Taliban in its borders to ward off US presence from their borders.\nAmidst the crippling sanctions on its economy, Iran can benefit from a stable trading partner in its neighbourhood. In 2017 it supplanted Pakistan as Afghanistan\u2019s largest trading partner.\nRussia\nRussia has increased its involvement in Afghanistan.\nRussia established ties with the Taliban in 2007 to discuss the issue of drug trafficking through the central Asian region.\nMoreover mutual fear of IS has brought the Taliban and Russians closer.\nAfter the Syrian crisis, Russia is trying to flex its muscle in this region to boost its global power status.\nPeace conferences and processes\n\nThere are many peace conferences and processes to solve the crisis. Bonn Agreement 2001 was the first international pact on Afghanistan for peace and reconciliation. Let us look at some of the important among them, their consequences and India\u2019s role or stand in them.\n\nThere are two major international peace efforts that are currently underway \u2013 the American push for peace led by Zalmay Khalilzad (Special Representative for Afghanistan Reconciliation, Khalilzad) and the Moscow-led consultations.\n\nZalmay Khalilzad has held talks with different stakeholders \u2013 Pakistan, Saudi Arabia, Qatar and the Taliban with the intention to deliver a deal in six months. Appointment of Khalizad indicates the US urge to get out of Afghan at the earliest possible time.\n\nMoscow consultations are called \u2018Moscow-format consultations on Afghanistan\u2019. Moscow consultation is one of the few peace processes which have managed to get the Taliban and Afghanistan at the same table of talks notwithstanding its inconclusiveness.\n\nHeart of Asia Conference, Kabul process etc. are some of the other peace conferences.\n\nIndia\u2019s stand in the Peace Conferences\nIn peace conferences, India\u2019s stand is that it should be Afghan-led, Afghan-owned and Afghan-controlled and with the participation of the government of Afghanistan. India is also wary of talks with the Taliban and the distinction of \u2018good Taliban-bad Taliban\u2019.\nRecent events\nMuch to India\u2019s chagrin, U.S. and Russia have accepted the idea that peace in Afghanistan is not possible without major concessions to the Taliban. Taliban has become the centre stage in all the peace conferences.\nThis is evident in the talks facilitated by Russia in Moscow in February 2019, with mainstream Afghan politicians sitting around the table with Taliban leaders and recent U.S.-Taliban talks in Qatar.\nThe U.S. and Russia have, in their respective peace processes, agreed to sidestep the Ashraf Ghani regime in Kabul, and accepted the Taliban\u2019s condition that it will not negotiate with the elected Afghan government at this stage.\nAnd both the Russian and U.S. processes are dependent on cooperation from Pakistan, which retains its influence over the Taliban leadership.\nCurrent talks with the Taliban are not Afghan-led, owned or controlled, and the Taliban has not abjured violence, or sworn allegiance to the Afghan constitution before joining talks.\nFor India, which has built on its centuries-old ties with Afghanistan with $3 billion in development assistance over the last 10 years, the spectre of a Pakistan proxy in power in Kabul is now looming large.\nHolding no trump cards in this game, India is now engaging with China and Iran, and with a range of Afghan actors including former President Hamid Karzai, who is said to be playing a key role in the US-Taliban process.\nIndia aims to secure its own strategic and economic interests in Afghanistan while backing the position taken by the government in Kabul on the talks.\nAccording to foreign policy experts, India may have to think of reaching out to the Taliban in near-future, at least sections of it that are independent minded.\nTrade and Connectivity between India-Afghan\nIndia wants to improve transport connectivity and economic collaboration with countries in Central and South Asia through Afghan.\nThere is a land route through Waga Atari route. But Pakistan doesn\u2019t allow India-Afghan trade through this route.\nIndia and Iran inked a transit agreement on transporting goods to landlocked Afghanistan.\nIndian investment in Chabahar port in southeastern Iran will serve as a hub for the transportation of transit goods.\nIndia builds Deleram- Zaranj highway in Afghan.\nIndia-Afghan established two air corridors to facilitate bilateral trade.\nIndia helped Afghans in the reconstruction of Salma Dam in the Herat province.\nIndia has also constructed a new Parliament complex for the Afghan government.\nThere is an India Afghan joint working group on trade, commerce, investment.\nIndia ratified UN TIR (Transports Internationaux Routiers or international road transport) Convention in 2017.\nTIR facilitates trade and international road transport by permitting customs sealed vehicles and containers to transmit nations without inspected at borders.\nAfghan Pakistan are contracting parties of TIR\nTIR may boost trade between India-Afghan through Pakistan.\nUnder Afghan-Pakistan Transit Trade Agreement, Afghan can use Pakistan territory for transit trade and vice versa.\nBut Pakistan did not allow the agreement to be used by India for transit.\nAfghan is in favour of India joining the agreement, but Pakistan rejected this proposition.\nConclusion\n\nDonald Trump is the third US President who is trying to end the Afghan war. However many experts opine that the announcement of drawdown before getting anything concrete from the Taliban is a strategic blunder for the US. It will lead to instability in Afghan that will not only affect India\u2019s interest but also regional stability.\n\nThe current US move has been a diplomatic victory for Pakistan. The US will require Pakistan\u2019s support to implement the interim deal as only Pakistan has influence over the Taliban.\n\nFully aware of the deadline, the Taliban are trying to secure maximum concessions from Zalmay Khalilzad without offering anything meaningful in return.\n\nWith the US withdrawing from Afghanistan, India must find ways to maintain its presence. Despite being an important stakeholder in Afghanistan, India finds itself increasingly marginalized in negotiations involving the key regional players. New Delhi is concerned about the vital role that all the powers are giving to Pakistan. Iran and Russia, two of India\u2019s closest allies during the Northern Alliance\u2019s battle against the Taliban regime in the 1990s, seem out of sync with New Delhi\u2019s interests.\n\nIndia\u2019s developmental approach has earned it immense goodwill among the Afghan people. However, the \u201csoft power\u201d strategy has limitations. The recent mocking of Donald Trump of New Delhi\u2019s role in war-torn Afghanistan is a manifestation of this limitation. However, there is a domestic consensus in India that boots-on-ground is not an option. Thus India is in the dilemma between continued soft-power or to aggressively push its hard power.\n\nTrump\u2019s recent strategy of engaging with the Taliban without the consideration of India has cast a shadow over the US\u2019s role as a strategic ally of India in the region.\n\nWhile India\u2019s principled position that it will not directly or publicly talk to the Taliban until it engages the Afghan government remains valid, it is necessary that India stays abreast of all negotiations and isn\u2019t cut out of the resolution process.\nIt is hoped that a robust channel is open between Indian intelligence agencies and all important groups in Afghanistan*, *including the Taliban, in order to ensure that Indian interests, development projects, and citizens are kept secure.\nNew Delhi should leverage the goodwill it enjoys among the Afghan people. India must intensify its dialogue with regional and global stakeholders, and impress upon them that any dialogue with the Taliban must not come at the cost of the hard-fought victories of the Afghan people in the past two decades: on establishing constitutional democracy and the rule of law, and securing the rights of women and minorities.\n\nIndia\u2019s army chief, General Bipin Rawat, recently asserted that India \u201ccannot be out of the bandwagon\u201d because if \u201cyou are not sitting on the high table you will not know what is happening\u201d. It is time for New Delhi to engage the Taliban to secure its interests. India also needs to reassess its policy choices in close coordination with Russia and Iran, constantly reminding them that complete surrender to the Taliban\u2019s demands will be detrimental to their own security.\n\nReferences: The Hindu, Indian Express, The Diplomat, The Wire, Foreign Policy, Wikipedia, Does The Elephant Dance\n\nArticle by \u2013\u00a0Sethu Krishnan M"

In this post, let\u2019s analyse the new developments in India-France relations.\n\nTable of Contents\n\nHistory of India-France Relations\nThe strategic partnership between India and France\nThe strategic interests: background\nIndia- France: Indo-Pacific region Interests\nIndia- France: Defence Cooperation\nMajor defence projects\nIndia- France: Space Cooperation\nIndia- France: Civil Nuclear Cooperation\nIndia- France: Other areas of cooperation\nTerrorism\nEnvironment\nUrbanisation\nCultural Cooperation\nEconomic relation\nMacron\u2019s visit\nChallenges in India-France Relations\nStrategic relations\nEnvironment\nNuclear cooperation\nDefence\nIndia-France Relations: The Future\u2026\nHistory of India-France Relations\nThe French came as traders to India in the 17th century. However, they had colonial aspirations, which resulted in the ruling of certain territories like Puducherry.\nThings have changed, and colonialism has ended. Now Puducherry is a popular tourist destination for French travellers to India.\nThe political, commercial and cultural contacts, then established, were maintained throughout the 19th century. Diplomatic relations between the two countries were established after the Independence of India.\u00a0 Since then, cooperation has developed in all the major areas.\nThough France was always sensitive to India\u2019s claim for its unique stature in the world due to its rich civilization, the Cold War impeded the deepening of the relationship. After the Cold War, the relationship progressed through many landmark agreements like the Strategic Partnership Agreement 1998 and the Civil Nuclear Agreement 2008.\nFormer French president Fran\u00e7ois Hollande was the chief guest in Republic Day celebrations in 2016 thus making France the only country to be invited a record-setting 5 times to Republic Day celebrations.\nCooperation in fields of nuclear, space, counter-terrorism, defence, urbanization, culture, etc. have grown in recent decades.\nPresident Emmanuel Macron\u2019s visit in 2018 cemented the regional dimension of the strategic partnership between the two countries.\nThe strategic partnership between India and France\n\nOn the basis of this old bond of trust, France and India decided to take a new step by establishing a strategic partnership in 1998. With the establishment of this partnership, there has been significant progress in all areas of bilateral cooperation through regular high-level exchanges at the Head of State/Head of Government levels. The growing cooperation and exchanges include strategic areas such as defence, counter-terrorism, nuclear energy and space.\n\nThe strategic interests: background\n\nDuring the Cold War time, France was weary of subordinating its foreign policy to that of the US. India was also pursuing NAM thus not succumbing to either super-powers.\n\nAfter the end of the Cold War, both India and France favoured a multipolar world order as they were sceptic of US hegemony.\n\nFrance termed the US as hyper-power\nFrance was the first P-5 country to support Indian membership in the UNSC\nThey signed a strategic partnership in 1998\nFrance supports India\u2019s membership of Multilateral Export Control regimes, viz. NSG and MTCR.\nFrance\u2019s support was vital in India\u2019s accession to MTCR in 2016.\nIndia- France: Indo-Pacific region Interests\n\nFrench islands \u00a0\u2013 R\u00e9union and Mayotte in the Indian Ocean and New Caledonia and French Polynesia in the South Pacific \u2013 make France a stakeholder in the region.\n\nBut the regional dimension to the strategic partnership remains dormant as India was reluctant to join hands with any other power, especially Western powers in the Indo-Pacific region due to its cold war legacy of NAM.\nThis equation changed with the rise of Chinese clout in the region and the simultaneous decline of American hegemony in the region.\nThis prompted India to look for like-minded countries to jointly spearhead the security architecture of the region.\nFrance, which has many littoral islands in the region, also looked for partnerships in the region to counter the volatile rise of China.\nBeing middle powers and their mutual wariness to hegemonic power projection, India and France began to see each other as natural allies in the Indo-Pacific region, especially the western Indian Ocean.\nPrime Minister Modi visited France in 2017 and met President Emmanuel Macron and reiterated a strong commitment to further strengthen the India-France strategic partnership. Prime Minister Modi declared India\u2019s unflinching commitment to the Paris Accord. This regional dimension of strategic relations was complemented by other initiatives like ISA. Amidst this background, Emmanuel Macron visited India in 2018.\nIndia- France: Defence Cooperation\n\nSince the 1980s defence cooperation increased as India has been looking to diversify its military procurement to reduce over-reliance on the USSR.\n\nMajor defence projects\n36 Rafale fighter jets through government-to-government deal\nP-75 Scorpene Project: The contract for six Scorpene submarines under technology transfer. The first two submarines Kalvari and Khanderi have been built.\nDassault Reliance Aerospace Limited (DRAL) manufacturing facility at Mihan in Maharashtra. It is a joint venture between French aerospace firm, Dassault Aviation, and India\u2019s Reliance Group and is the first private facility for the production of Rafale fighter jets and Falcon civilian aircraft.\nRegular defence exercises; viz. Exercise Shakti (Army), Exercise Varuna (Navy), Exercise Garuda(Air Force)\nIndia- France: Space Cooperation\nISRO and the French Space Agency (CNES) have been cooperating for many decades.\nFrench launch pads are used by ISRO for their GSLVs: GSAT-17 was launched from Kourou in 2017.\nFrance is a major supplier of components and equipment for the Indian space programme.\nIndia- France: Civil Nuclear Cooperation\nAfter the 1998 nuclear test by India, France was the major nuclear country that understood India\u2019s security compulsions for its nuclear test.\nFrance worked with the US to integrate India into the global nuclear order through an India-specific waiver in NSG.\nFrance was the first country with which India entered into a civil nuclear agreement following the NSG waiver.\nThe General Framework Agreement and the Early Works Agreement between NPCIL and AREVA for the implementation \u00a0Jaitapur Nuclear Power Project (JNPP) were signed in 2010.\nIndia- France: Other areas of cooperation\nTerrorism\nAfter the Paris bomb attacks, both countries increased cooperation on global terrorism.\nFrance supports India\u2019s proposal of a Comprehensive Convention on International Terrorism (CCIT) in the UN.\nDuring former President Hollande\u2019s visit in 2016, India and France issued a Joint Statement on Counter-Terrorism in which they resolved to step up bilateral cooperation in this field.\nEnvironment\nAt the Paris Summit of UNFCC, India and France launched the International Solar Alliance (ISA) which brings together countries between the Tropic of cancer and Tropic of Capricorn for cooperation on solar energy.\nDuring Macron\u2019s visit, both countries decided to form a joint working group to institutionalize cooperation in the conservation of the environment.\nUrbanisation\nIndia and France are cooperating on developing smart cities: Chandigarh, Nagpur, and Puducherry.\nCultural Cooperation\nIndian Council for Cultural Relations\u00a0regularly sends Indian cultural troupes to France.\nPresented the Namaste France cultural festival in France from 15 September to 30 November 2016.\nThe French cultural festival Bonjour India in India will be conducted from November 2017 to February 2018.\nEconomic relation\nIndia\u2019s trade relationship with the EU is mired in many roadblocks which are reflected in the stalled FTA negotiations with the EU. This inertia also affects trade relations with France.\nTrade is highly concentrated in certain niche areas like defence supplies.\nIn the backdrop of Brexit, France can act as an entry point for Indian businesses in Europe.\nMacron\u2019s visit\n\nIn the vision statement on India-France relations, a free Indo-Pacific was emphasized\n\n\ud83d\udc49 Which year are YOU targeting for success in the IAS/IPS/IFS Exam? \ud83d\ude80\n\n(1) \u21d2 UPSC 2025: Prelims cum Mains\n\n(2) \u21d2 UPSC 2026: Prelims cum Mains\n\n(3) \u21d2 UPSC 2027 Prelims cum Mains\n\nTip: Know more about ClearIAS Courses (Online/Offline)\n\nFrance has many littoral islands in the Indo-Pacific region which makes France a major player in the region especially in the west Indian Ocean.\nThe Indian navy has good relations with the US Pacific command which reaches up to the Bay of Bengal. But the US Central Command which is up to the Arabian Sea has good relations with Pakistan. Here India can partner with the French navy (according to Rakesh Sood).\nA Joint vision statement on\u00a0free Indo-Pacific is aimed at countering Chinese hegemony in the region.\nThis vision comes at a time when India is willing to cooperate with other like-minded countries in the Indo-Pacific region shedding its approach of viewing the region as its exclusive backyard.\nFrench military bases in Djibouti, Abu Dhabi, and Reunion Island can be a force multiplier for India, which itself is looking to build naval facilities in Seychelles, Mauritius, and Oman.\n\nEmphasis on ISA, re-commitment to the Jaitapur nuclear plant, and climatic change cooperation.

Reciprocal logistics support is the right step in this direction.\nEnvironment\nThermal power is still feasible and economical than solar in India, so the International Solar Alliance (ISA) will not make much headway in the near future.\nNuclear cooperation\nThe delay in the Jaitapur project is affecting future cooperation on the nuclear front.\nDefence\nDelays and controversies around Rafael\u2019s deal are affecting mutual trust between both nations.\nIndia-France Relations: The Future\u2026\nThe India-France relationship is primarily driven by government-to-government level relations. It\u00a0needs people-to-people and business-to-business relations to deepen the ties.\nFrench infrastructure companies are looking for opportunities in Indian projects especially in smart cities and renewable energy. India should leverage this opportunity by improving the ease of doing business.\nModel Bilateral Investment Treaty of India has drawn sharp criticism from investors, The Government should revisit this by taking into account the concerns of all the stakeholders.\nIndia-France should build on\u00a0reciprocal logistics support agreement to deepen military ties\n14 agreements signed during Macron\u2019s visit covering the whole gamut of issues from space cooperation to sustainable urban development.

            "[CONTENT]": "Recently, US President Donald Trump\u2019s pledge to declare Jerusalem as the capital of Israel has caused controversy across the world. He also announced his plans to move the US Embassy to Jerusalem from Tel Aviv. Let\u2019s analyse the implications of US Embassy in Jerusalem.\n\nTable of Contents\n\nWhat is the capital of Israel?\nHistorical perspective of Jerusalem\nDevelopments\nWhy is Jerusalem in news now?\nImplications of recognizing Jerusalem as capital of Jerusalem\nWhat the US administration hopes to achieve:\nThe UN vote on Jerusalem issue\nIndian viewpoint on Jerusalem\nExamining India\u2019s vote\nWhat is the capital of Israel?\n\nIsrael claims that Jerusalem is its capital, but this is not internationally recognised. This is because the ancient city is also the proclaimed capital of the State of Palestine. And more than that, Jerusalem is one of the main contentions in Isreal-Palestine conflicts.\n\nSo the answer to the question \u2018what is the capital of Israel\u2019\u00a0depends on who you ask. For the Israeli government, it\u2019s simple: Jerusalem. But not all countries recognize this.\n\nHistorical perspective of Jerusalem\n\nJerusalem is a holy city for the 3 Abrahamic religions viz, Judaism, Christianity and Islam representing different periods of its history.\n\nBy 1917, it fell to the British and they had to protect the region under League of Nations mandate.\nUN had chalked up a partition plan for the region by 1947. It had designated Jerusalem as a special international zone.\nBut soon wars were to follow. In the Arab-Israeli war of 1948, Israel occupied the western part and Jordan the eastern part of Jerusalem. The East was to be later annexed by Israel in the Six Day War of 1967.\n\nExcept for three nations (US, Czech Republic and the island nation of Vanuatu), this annexation was not accepted by the international community and it still considers East Jerusalem as a part of Palestine territory. Thus, the demand for the boundary as existing prior to 1967 war is raised by nations for a Two-Nation Theory Agreement.\n\nIn deference to this, no country maintains its diplomatic missions in Jerusalem. Foreign embassies in Israel are located in Tel Aviv. The embassy of India for Israel is at Tel Aviv and has a Representative Office for Palestine at Ramallah in West Bank.\n\nIsraeli \u201cbasic law\u201d however cites whole of Jerusalem as its capital. This act has been censured by the UN Security Council (UNSC) in \u201cstrongest terms\u201d in 1980.\n\n\ud83d\udc49 Which year are YOU targeting for success in the IAS/IPS/IFS Exam? \ud83d\ude80\n\n(1) \u21d2 UPSC 2025: Prelims cum Mains\n\n(2) \u21d2 UPSC 2026: Prelims cum Mains\n\n(3) \u21d2 UPSC 2027 Prelims cum Mains\n\nTip: Know more about ClearIAS Courses (Online/Offline)\n\nDevelopments\n\nIsrael government has a greater control over all parts of Jerusalem than the Palestinian government except for its East. This is more than evident with the settlement of Israelites to occupied parts of East Jerusalem and even West Bank. This is alleged to be a ploy by Israel to supplement it claims on these lands.\n\nOn the other hand, Palestine is territorially and administratively divided.\n\nWest Bank (called so as it happens to be the western bank of River Jordan) is led by the Fatah-controlled Palestinian National Authority (PNA) with its president Mahmoud Abbas.\nThe Gaza strip is controlled by Hamas, which many countries consider as a militant organisation.\n\nRemember, The Palestinian National Authority was the arrangement for Palestine administration of its territories after an agreement in 1994 and consequence of Oslo Accords of 1993. Elections in 2006 led to Hamas winning the Gaza strip and Fatah reduced to West Bank giving rise to an administrative division. The news of shellings during conflict you hear are alleged to be from this Gaza strip and against the actions of illegal settlement and alleged atrocities by Israeli Defence Forces (IDF) against Palestinian people.\n\nThe contentious territorial claims on Jerusalem have made it a no man\u2019s land for embassies. Not willing to add to the conflict, nations choose not to have a permanent base of any form here until the Palestine problem is settled. In the two-state solution, i.e., the coexistence of Israel and Palestine as independent countries, Palestine considers East Jerusalem as their future capital. Importantly, in December 2016, UN had stated that Palestine territories in Jerusalem were under \u201chostile occupation\u201d, i.e., by Israel.\n\nWhy is Jerusalem in news now?\n\nThe US president Donald J Trump in his White House speech earlier this month had announced that \u201cit is time to officially recognize Jerusalem as the capital of\u00a0Israel\u201d. He added that it is a matter of time that US embassy is situated in Jerusalem.\n\nImplications of recognizing Jerusalem as capital of Jerusalem\nThe US is a major power and such a decision means it is willing to concede the contentious claims of Israel. Few former presidents have been so outrightly acquiescent to the Israeli demand.\nThe US has brokered for peace and acted as moderators, though not fully impartial, tried to settle the issue. This unilateral action, however, could hamper the peace process. Its immediate repercussions were seen in latest protests by Palestinian people.\nOpen defiance of a global understanding and concern for the Palestinian cause. Even US allies have vilified this move. It could cue other nations to take a stubborn and defiant position in global talks. Here, North Korea comes to mind.\nUnilateral violation of UNSC resolutions on the need for status quo in Jerusalem and seek for a peaceful resolution of this issue. The decision was challenged through a resolution in UNSC and UN General Assembly.\nTougher stand by the Muslim nations of the region. Some led by Turkey declared East Jerusalem as the capital of Palestine on December 13th, 2017.\nWhat the US administration hopes to achieve:\nWider acceptance to Jerusalem as Israeli capital and move it diplomatic mission there.\nA greater say in the happenings in the middle-east. US policy in this region today faces challenges from Russia and regional power Iran and its proxies.\nTo show the world it can take independent decisions that suit a global power.\nSatiate the pro-Israel lobbies and provide a pat on the back of Netanyahu Government of Israel.\nThe UN vote on Jerusalem issue\n\nHistorically, UN has time and again chided Israel for its unilateral actions. UNSC passed a Resolution 476 asking the \u201cOccupying Power\u201d Israel to refrain changing the character, demographics and status of the Holy City of Jerusalem. (Reference \u2013 Wikipedia)\n\nThe Israeli \u201cbasic law\u201d have no legal validity and constitute a flagrant violation of the Fourth Geneva Convention relative to the Protection of Civilian Persons in Time of War and also constitute a serious obstruction to achieving a comprehensive, just and lasting peace in the Middle East, the resolution had said.\n\nNoting that Israel did not comply with this resolution UNSC came out with a stronger worded Resolution 478 in 1980 that asked nations to not have diplomatic missions in The Holy City, Jerusalem.\n\nUNSC on December 18th voted on a resolution drafted by Egypt against the US decision to accept Jerusalem as the capital of Israel and shift its embassy there. It did not name the US in the resolution but asked nations respect previous UNSC resolutions on the matter. All other members had voted for the resolution seeking to stop the US in its tracks. But the US used its veto power to put paid to this effort. It was the first time in 6 years that the US had used it veto power.\n\nOn December 21, 2017, the UN General Assembly took up a resolution that was tabled by Turkey and Yemen on the same issue, as the UNSC had \u201cfailed to act\u201d. Again the resolution did not name any country but asked nations that its actions that go against UNSC resolutions will be null and void. The US was found wanting here as the resolution was accepted with over two-thirds majority. However, the GA resolution in its \u201cspecial emergency session\u201d, unlike the UNSC one, is non-binding.\n\nEarlier, US had threatened nations that if things go against the US it would cut back on this funding to UN and also have consequences to those nations. Also, Nikki Haley, US permanent representative to UN said that \u201cNo UN vote is going to make any difference\u201d to the US decision to shift embassy to Jerusalem.\n\nIndian viewpoint on Jerusalem\n\nIndia has always been sympathetic to the Palestine cause even as it had tried to play a fine balancing act vis-a-vis Israel-Palestine issue. It wants a lasting solution on the issue with the two nations existing independently side by side. India did not recognise Israel initially as it sought its UN membership in 1948. Diplomatic relations were established with that country officially only in 1992.\n\nOn the other hand, India had supported Palestine efforts to gain UN recognition. India was convinced that the Palestinian people were the victims here. It had faced its own partition in 1947 on ostensibly religious lines and knows that without a peaceful settlement things are only going to worsen. Israel had been repeatedly proven aggressor and used disproportionate force upon the Palestine people.\n\nIndia\u2019s stand on the issue had lately alternated. The stronger US embrace in Indian diplomacy is sighted as a reason for this. However, in the latest UNGA resolution, India voted for the resolution and thus against the US. This, after US, released a statement to members that the US President would take their vote \u201cpersonally\u201d.\n\nExamining India\u2019s vote\n\nIndia has taken a bold and right decision here. There is nothing good to be achieved by the unilateral decision by the USA. The world community including US\u2019s staunchest allies did not support the US decision. The problem is not that of the sovereign decision of US to choose where to locate its embassy, it is of the need to respect the UNSC resolutions that have been collectively accepted.\n\nThis vote may cause slight discomfort for India as The Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu is set to visit India next month, first by an Israeli Premier after 15 years. It could be hoped that diplomats could deliberate on this and impress upon Israel that there will be no winners if this US decision is put into action. India needs to reiterate the need for status quo until the peace process comes up with an agreement acceptable to both nations as well as the international community.\n\nArticle by: Imthiyaz K Shams"

In 1948, a Treaty of Friendship was concluded between both the countries. Both believe in the spirit of democracy and pluralism. From 1971 to 1976, Switzerland represented the interests of India over the dispute in Bangladesh.\n\nTable of Contents\n\nIndia-Switzerland political and diplomatic relations\nRelations in education and research\nIndia-Switzerland Economic Cooperation\nCultural Ties between India and Switzerland\nDevelopment cooperation\nPeople to people contact\nWay Forward\nIndia-Switzerland political and diplomatic relations\nSince 2005, political dialogue has been conducted between both the nations.\nBilateral agreements in various fields including trade, education and vocational training, visas, taxation and cooperation in science and technology have done very well.\nIn 2018, Switzerland and India will celebrate the 70 years of the Indo-Swiss Bilateral Friendship Treaty of 1948.\nThere are VVIP visits along with foreign consular and special representatives.\nThe President of Switzerland announced his country\u2019s support for India\u2019s NSG membership.\nSwitzerland launched a programme \u201c70 Years of Swiss-Indian Friendship: Connecting Minds \u2014Inspiring the Future\u201d.\nRelations in education and research\nSwiss Government prioritizes India in giving Excellence Scholarships.\nIndia-Switzerland Joint Research Programme was conducted between the two countries.\nSwissnex India programme connects Switzerland and India in the fields of science, education, art and innovation.\nThe various Swiss initiatives to introduce the Swiss Dual Vocational Educational System at a mass level in India are contributing to India \u2018s development.\nThe Swiss Indian Chamber of Commerce has set up the Indo-Swiss Centre of Excellence in Pune which will focus on low energy buildings, sustainable water and waste solutions and renewable energy.\nIndia-Switzerland Economic Cooperation\n\nIndia is Switzerland\u2019s third largest trading partner in Asia.\nThe balance of trade has remained in favour of Switzerland.\nThe number of jobs created through Swiss direct investment in India has been laudable.\nIndian delegations have participated in the World Economic Forum.\nBoth countries signed a joint declaration on the automatic exchange of information in taxation matters.\nThe India-Switzerland Joint Economic Commission was set up in 1959.\nIndia-Switzerland Financial Dialogue was signed in 2011.\n14th Round of India-EFTA TEPA negotiations took place in 2016.\nCultural Ties between India and Switzerland\nLe Corbusier (architecture) and Alice Boner (painter and historian) and several other Swiss artists and researchers have contributed to India.\nPopular Bollywood movies are shooted in Switzerland.\nBoth countries promote cultural exchanges.\nTourism is also thriving here in both the countries.\nTo mark the International Day of Peace and Non-Violence a statue of Mahatma Gandhi was installed in Ariana Park, Geneva on 14 November 2007.\nThe 150th Birth Centenary celebrations of Swami Vivekananda was held in Saas Fe, the Alps on 30th August 2013.\nA Tagore Chair has been set up at University of Lausanne (UNIL) for Hindi in 2011, which has successfully completed many sessions.\nIn Swiss cities, mass yoga practices were also held under the aegis of different Yoga schools to celebrate The International Day of Yoga.\nDevelopment cooperation\nDevelopment and Cooperation activities focus on climate change and global warming-related issues.\nM.S.

            "[CONTENT]": "Eliminating the hesitations of history, India and the United States have built a strong and strategic bilateral relationship and continues to contribute the stability and prosperity of the world. The first Prime Minister of India Jawaharlal Nehru likened American Imperialism to that of British.\n\nHe propounded and propagated the Non-Alignment Principle whereby India refused to join either the capitalistic US or the communist Soviet Union.\n\nIndia\u2019s socialistic economic principles and deep scepticism to the US hegemony resulted in its predilections towards USSR much to the ire of the West. As the ideological Cold War ended after a myriad of international convergences and divergences, India was forced to look West given the paradigm shift in the geopolitics of the world and in Francis Fukuyama\u2019s words \u201cEnd of History\u201d. Today both India and US are among the most vibrant foreign cohorts and strategic partners.\n\nTable of Contents\n\nIndia-USA: History of Relations\nWhy India Matters to the USA?\nWhy the United States matters to India?\nIndia-USA: Five Pillars of Strategic Partnership\nIndia-US Civil Nuclear Deal\nTerms of the deal:\nFive developments in the India-US relations since the deal:\nControversial issues with the deal:\nThe Civil Liability for Nuclear Damage Bill, 2010\nHow have U.S. concerns over the CLND Act then been resolved?\nIndia-US Trade Relations\nIndia-US Defence Cooperation\nIndia-US: Cooperation in Energy and Climate Change\nIndia-US: Cooperation in Education\nIndia-US: People to People Contacts\nIndia-USA: History of Relations\nThe birth of Indian Republic was accompanied by Pakistan\u2019s occupation of Kashmir. Nehru\u2019s efforts to garner support from the international community was fruitless.\nIndia declined the American offer to accept a seat at the United Nations Security Council and rather pushed for the membership of the People\u2019s Republic of China which it has immediately recognized as a sovereign nation. (Reference \u2013 TheHindu)\nIn the year 1950, India abstained from a US-sponsored resolution calling for UN\u2019s military involvement in the Korean War. India even voted against UN forces crossing the 38th Parallel and naming China as an aggressor.\n1955: Pakistan officially aligned with the United States via the South East Asian Treaty Organization (SEATO) and Central Treaty Organization (CEATO) also known as Baghdad Pact. Meanwhile, India, being the chief proponent of Non-Alignment Movement (NAM), held the first Afro-Asian Conference at Bandung, Indonesia.\nThe rogue state of Pakistan became an important ally to the US in the containment of the Soviet Union, giving rise to strategic complications with India.\nIn the Sino-Indian war of 1962, the US extended help to India against China\u2019s belligerence by sending an American carrier- The Enterprise- to the Bay of Bengal. China, however, had declared unilateral ceasefire the next day. Indian leaders and public welcomed American intervention.\n1966: In response to India\u2019s criticism of the US intervention in Vietnam, President Lyndon B. Johnson restricted the supply of grain shipments to India under Public Law 480 programme.\n1967: A predominantly Anti-American worldview led India to reject a founding membership\u00a0in the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN).\n1968: India rejected the Non-Proliferation Treaty (NPT) proposed by the world\u2019s leading nuclear powers.\n1971: The USA had maintained a studious silence on Pakistan\u2019s repressive policies in East Pakistan. The then Secretary of State Henry Kissinger visited Delhi to make India comply to not support liberation movements in East Pakistan. Indira Gandhi\u2019s intransigence was met with diplomatic muscle-flexing. Next month, India signed a Treaty of Friendship, Peace and Cooperation with the Soviet Union, seen as a blatant shift from India\u2019s Non-Alignment policies. US President Richard Nixon in a retaliatory move chose to explicitly tilt American policy in favour of Pakistan and suspended $87 million worth of economic aid to India. American naval fleet USS Enterprise traversed the Bay of Bengal, issuing mild threats. India won the Bangladesh Liberation War as the Pakistani Army embarrassingly surrendered more than 90,000 troops.\n1974: India conducted its first nuclear weapon test at Pokhran, and it came as a major jolt to the USA who made plans to upgrade its presence at Diego Garcia, a British-controlled island in the Indian ocean.\n1975: India faced considerable domestic turmoil and entered into a state of Emergency.\n1977: The Emergency ended and the US immediately eased restrictions it has placed on World Bank loans to India and approved direct economic assistance of $60 million.\n1978: US President Jimmy Carter and Indian Prime Minister Desai exchanged visits to each other\u2019s nations.\nThe 1980s: Large amounts of military aid was pumped into Pakistan by the USA in order to fight a proxy against the Soviet Union in Afghanistan. This created significant repercussions in the internal security of India as the Pakistani mujahedeen fighters infiltrated into Kashmir as militants.\n1988: Prime Minister Rajiv Gandhi made a historic visit to China which led to normalization of relations between India and China.\n1990: India hesitatingly provided a brief logistical support for American military operations in the Gulf War.\nPost-1991: The Soviet Union disintegrated into independent nations and the United States emerged as the single largest hegemon, making the world unipolar. It coincided with India opening doors to foreign private capital in its historic Liberalization, Privatization, and Globalization move.\nTrade between India and the US grew dramatically and is flourishing today.\nWhy India Matters to the USA?\nIndia is an indispensable partner for the United States. Geographically, it sits between the two most immediate problematic regions for U.S. national interests. The arc of instability that begins in North Africa goes through the Middle East, and proceeds to Pakistan and Afghanistan ends at India\u2019s western border.\nThe Indian landmass juts into the ocean that bears its name. With the rise of Asian economies, the Indian Ocean is home to critical global lines of communication, with perhaps 50 percent of world container products and up to 70 percent of ship-borne oil and petroleum traffic transiting through its waters.\nIndia\u2019s growing national capabilities give it ever greater tools to pursue its national interests to the benefit of the United States. India has the world\u2019s third-largest Army, fourth-largest Air Force, and fifth largest Navy. All three of these services are modernizing, and the Indian Air Force and Indian Navy have world-class technical resources, and its Army is seeking more of them.\nIndia is an important U.S. partner in international efforts to prevent the further spread of weapons of mass destruction.\nIndia\u2019s broad diplomatic ties globally (most importantly in the Middle East), its aspirations for United Nations (UN) Security Council permanent membership, and its role in international organizations such as the International Atomic Energy Agency makes New Delhi an especially effective voice in calls to halt proliferation.\nIndia\u2019s position against radicalism and terrorism corresponds with that of the United States.\nIndia\u2019s English-speaking and Western-oriented elite and middle classes comfortably partner with their counterparts in U.S. firms and institutions, including more than 2.8 million Indian Americans. The U.S. higher education system is an incubator of future collaboration, with more than 100,000 Indian students in American universities.\nAs India modernizes and grows it will spend trillions of dollars on infrastructure, transportation, energy production and distribution, and defence hardware. U.S. firms can benefit immensely by providing expertise and technology that India will need to carry out this sweeping transformation.\nIndia-USA cooperation is critical to global action against climate change.\nIndia is genuinely committed to a world order based on multilateral institutions and cooperation and the evolution of accepted international norms leading to accepted international law.\nIndian culture and diplomacy have generated goodwill in its extended neighbourhood. New Delhi has positive relations with critical states in the Middle East, in Central Asia, in Southeast Asia, and with important middle powers such as Brazil, South Africa, and Japan\u2014all of the strategic value to the United States. India\u2019s soft power is manifest in wide swaths of the world where its civil society has made a growing and positive impression.\nIndian democracy has prospered despite endemic poverty; extraordinary ethnic, religious, and linguistic diversity; and foreign and internal conflicts.\nWhy the United States matters to India?\n\nAmerica remains the critical stabilizing force in Asia through its military and diplomatic power projection and commitments to the region.\nThe twentieth century bore witness to a multigeneration U.S. efforts to prevent the emergence of any hostile hegemon on the Eurasian landmass, a function that the United States continues to fulfil today with the help of its Asian partners.\nChina has chosen episodically to ignore global nonproliferation norms, a pattern of behaviour that the United States has assiduously sought to curtail. Though no nation can a priori prevent future Chinese proliferation activities, only a U.S.-led international effort has any chance of success.\nIndia will be better able to protect its national interests in Pakistan and Afghanistan in coordination with the United States.\nThe United States will continue to be important for India\u2019s economic success. India\u2019s economy has been built around unleashing domestic consumption rather than relying on exports.\nThe United States has also remained one of the top sources of foreign direct investment in India, bringing important managerial expertise, capital, and technology with it to the dynamic Indian market.\nThe United States has a long-term commitment to maintain security and freedom of navigation on the high seas, something critical to India as a net energy importer.\nWashington retains unparalleled power and influence in global governance institutions.\nAs India seeks a larger role in the UN Security Council and international monetary institutions, U.S. support for India will be critical to reforms that benefit New Delhi\u2019s national interests.\nThe United States retains a sizable technological edge on many commercials, aerospace, and defence technologies, the access to which benefits Indian national interests as well as Indian firms and customers.\nIndia-USA: Five Pillars of Strategic Partnership\nStrategic Issues\nEnergy and Climate Change\nScience and Technology\nHealth and Innovation\nEducation and Development\nIndia-US Civil Nuclear Deal\n\nThe deal is seen as a watershed in India-USA relations and introduces a new aspect to international nonproliferation efforts. Since July 18, 2005, the deal lifts a three-decade U.S. moratorium on nuclear trade with India. It provides U.S. assistance to India\u2019s civilian nuclear energy program and expands India-USA cooperation in energy and satellite technology.\n\nTerms of the deal:\nIndia agrees to allow inspectors from the International Atomic Energy Association (IAEA), the United Nations\u2019 nuclear watchdog group, access to its civilian nuclear program. By March 2006, India promised to place\u00a0fourteen of its twenty-two power reactors\u00a0under IAEA safeguards permanently.\nIndia commits to signing an\u00a0Additional Protocol (PDF)-which allows more intrusive IAEA inspections of its civilian facilities.\nIndia agrees to continue its moratorium on nuclear weapons testing.\nIndia commits to strengthening the security of its nuclear arsenals.\nIndia works toward negotiating a\u00a0Fissile Material Cutoff Treaty (FMCT) with the United States banning the production of fissile material for weapons purposes. India agrees to prevent the spread of enrichment and reprocessing technologies to states that don\u2019t possess them and to support international nonproliferation efforts.\nUS companies will be allowed to build nuclear reactors in India and provide nuclear fuel for its civilian energy program.\n\nAn approval by the Nuclear Suppliers Group lifting the ban on India has also cleared the way for other countries to make nuclear fuel and technology sales to India. India would be eligible to buy U.S. dual-use nuclear technology, including materials and equipment that could be used to enrich uranium or reprocess plutonium, potentially creating the material for nuclear bombs. It would also receive imported fuel for its nuclear reactors.\n\nAshley Tellis\u00a0of the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace-who was intimately involved in negotiating the civil nuclear agreement with India as a senior adviser to the U.S. undersecretary of state for political affairs\u2013said in\u00a0congressional testimony in 2005 that the deal recognizes this growing relationship by engaging India, which has proven it is not a nuclear proliferation risk.

If Delhi was prevented by law from importing anything for its nuclear programme over the last few decades, it is boosting atomic power generation in India through imported uranium and is negotiating with multiple vendors for the purchase of new reactors.\nThe US has become India\u2019s largest trading partner in goods and services, and the two sides have set an ambitious goal of half a trillion dollars for future trade. The growing commercial engagement has been reinforced by an intensification of people-to-people contact and the presence of the 3 million strong Indian diasporas in America.\nCooperation on counter-terrorism and intelligence-sharing have expanded rapidly over the last decade. The US has become one of India\u2019s major suppliers of arms, and the two sides are discussing ideas that would once have been dismissed as inconceivable \u2014 for example, US support in the development of India\u2019s next-generation aircraft carrier.\nIn refusing to extend the civil nuclear initiative to Islamabad, Washington removed the hyphen in its relations with Delhi and Islamabad. Since 2005, America has also discarded the idea of mediating between India and Pakistan, especially on the Kashmir question.\nWhile traditional differences between Delhi and Washington on global issues have endured, the two sides are now avoiding confrontation in multilateral fora dealing with trade and climate change.\nControversial issues with the deal:\n\nIn March 2006, the U.S. Congress also took up the agreement and formally made it into legislation (Hyde Act) after the committee level deliberations and conciliations in terms of words by both the House and the Senate.\n\nOn 1 August 2007, U.S. and Indian negotiators concluded a separate technical agreement under section 123 of the U.S. Atomic Energy Act, which spells out the precise terms, conditions, responsibilities, obligations and promises that each party undertakes.\n\nAs the Hyde Act had imposed restrictions on how India could utilize U.S. nuclear supplies, the implementation of the agreement has received a setback because of the opposition by the Communist parties that supported India\u2019s UPA government from outside. Leaders of almost all the political parties of India had categorically expressed their dislike and apprehensions for provisions that provided for cutting off aid if India conducts any future nuclear tests and the return of the all nuclear material or equipment provided by U.S. suppliers.\n\nSection 17b in the Civil Liability for Nuclear Damage Bill, 2010 according to which the Operator cannot seek recourse in case of nuclear accidents because of patent or latent defects in the material, equipment and even in the services provided. The US defies it to be against international norms whereas India says that it is according to Convention on Supplementary Compensation.\n\nThe Civil Liability for Nuclear Damage Bill, 2010\nThe Civil Liability for Nuclear Damage (CLND) Bill, 2010 fixes liability for nuclear damage and specifies procedures for compensating victims.\nThe Bill fixes no-fault liability on operators and gives them a right of recourse against certain persons. It caps the liability of the operator at Rs 500 crore.\u00a0 For damage exceeding this amount, and up to 300 million SDR, the central government will be liable.\nAll operators (except the central government) need to take insurance or provide financial security to cover their liability.\nFor facilities owned by the government, the entire liability up to 300 million SDR will be borne by the government.\nThe Bill specifies who can claim compensation and the authorities who will assess and award compensation for nuclear damage.\nThose not complying with the provisions of the Bill can be penalized.\n\nAnalysis of the Bill and further issues:\n\nThe liability cap on the operator:\n\n(a) may be inadequate to compensate victims in the event of a major nuclear disaster;\n\n(b) may block India\u2019s access to an international pool of funds;\n\n(c) is low compared to some other countries.\n\nThe cap on the operator\u2019s liability is not required if all plants are owned by the government. It is not clear if the government intends to allow private operators to operate nuclear power plants.\nThe extent of environmental damage and consequent economic loss will be notified by the government. This might create a conflict of interest in cases where the government is also the party liable to pay compensation.\nThe right of recourse against the supplier provided in the Bill is not compliant with international agreements India may wish to sign.\nThe time-limit of ten years for claiming compensation may be inadequate for those suffering from nuclear damage.\nThough the Bill allows operators and suppliers to be liable under other laws, it is not clear which other laws will be applicable. Different interpretations by courts may constrict or unduly expand the scope of such a provision.\n\nThe understanding reached with the United States on January 25, 2015, during the visit of President Obama to India:\n\nIndia and the United States have reached an understanding on the issues related to civil nuclear liability and finalized the text of the Administrative Arrangement to implement the September 2008 bilateral 123 Agreement. This will allow us to move towards commercial negotiations on setting up reactors with international collaboration in India and realize the significant economic and clean energy potential of the civil nuclear understanding of 2005-2008.\n\nThere is no proposal to amend the Civil Liability for Nuclear Damage Act of 2010 Act or the Rules.\n\nHow have U.S. concerns over the CLND Act then been resolved?\n\nDuring the course of the discussions in the Contact Group, using case law and legislative history, the Indian side presented its position concerning the compatibility of the Civil Liability for Nuclear Damage (CLND) Act and the Convention on Supplementary Compensation for Nuclear Damage (CSC). The idea of the India Nuclear Insurance Pool as a part of the overall risk-management scheme for liability was also presented to the U.S. side. Based on the presentations by the Indian side, and the discussion thereon, there is a general understanding that India\u2019s CLND law is compatible with the CSC, which India has signed and intends to ratify.\n\nIndia-US Trade Relations\nThere are more than 50 bilateral dialogue mechanisms between the two governments.\nIndia-USA bilateral trade in goods and services increased from $104 billion in 2014 to $114 billion in 2016.\nBoth countries have made a commitment to facilitate actions necessary for increasing the bilateral trade to $500 billion.\nIn June 2016, Prime Minister Modi and President Obama pledged to explore new opportunities to break down barriers to the movement of goods and services, and support deeper integration into global supply chains, thereby creating jobs and generating prosperity in both economies.\nThe U.S. is the fifth largest source of foreign direct investments into India.\nAmong large Indian corporations having investments in the U.S. include Reliance Industries Limited, Tata Consultancy Services, Wipro, Essar America, Piramal, Mahindra, Lupin, Sun Pharma, etc.\nThere are several dialogue mechanisms to strengthen bilateral engagement on economic and trade issues, including a Ministerial Level Economic and Financial Partnership and a Ministerial Trade Policy Forum. For greater involvement of private sector in the discussions on issues involving trade and investment, there is a bilateral India-USA CEO\u2019s Forum.\nIndia and the US have set up a bilateral Investment Initiative in 2014, with a special focus on facilitating FDI, portfolio investment, capital market development and financing of infrastructure.\nUS firms will be lead partners in developing Allahabad, Ajmer and Vishakhapatnam as Smart Cities.\nIndia-US Defence Cooperation\n\nDefence relationship has emerged as a major pillar of India-USA strategic partnership with the signing of \u2018New Framework for India-U.S. Defense Relations\u2019 in 2005 and the resulting intensification in defence trade, joint exercises, personnel exchanges, collaboration and cooperation in maritime security and counter-piracy, and exchanges between each of the three services.\nIndia participated in Rim of the Pacific (RIMPAC) exercise in July-August 2016.\nThe agreements signed during the past one year include:\nLogistics Exchange Memorandum of Association (LEMOA)\nFuel Exchange Agreement\nTechnical Agreement (TA) on information sharing on White (merchant) Shipping\nInformation Exchange Annexe (IEA) on Aircraft Carrier Technologies\n\nPending agreements are:\n\nCommunication and Information Security Memorandum of Agreement (CISMOA)\nBasic Exchange and Cooperation Agreement (BECA)\nIndia-US: Cooperation in Energy and Climate Change\nThe India-USA Energy Dialogue was launched in May 2005 to promote trade and investment in the energy sector.\nThere are six working groups in oil and gas, coal, power and energy efficiency, new technologies and renewable energy, civil nuclear co-operation and sustainable development under the Energy Dialogue.\nAs a priority initiative under the PACE (Partnership to Advance Clean Energy), the U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) and the Government of India have established the Joint Clean Energy Research and Development Center (JCERDC) designed to promote clean energy innovations by teams of scientists from India and the United States, with a total joint committed funding from both Governments of US$ 50 million.\nIndia-US: Cooperation in Education\n\nIndia is learning from the U.S. experience in community colleges in order to meet our demands for skill-development. It has been agreed to collaborate with U.S. institutions in the area of Technology Enabled Learning and Massive Open Online Courses (MOOCs) to extend the reach of education in India. Under the Global Initiative of Academic Networks (GIAN) launched by India, up to 1000 American academics will be invited and hosted each year to teach in Indian universities at their convenience. The two sides are also collaborating to establish a new Indian Institute of Technology in Ahmedabad.\n\nIndia-US: People to People Contacts\n\nThe 3.5-million-plus strong Indian American community is an important ethnic group in the U.S., accounting for about 1% of the total population in the country. Indian American community includes a large number of professionals, business entrepreneurs and educationalists with increasing influence in the society. The two countries have been working together to facilitate travel of their respective citizens, and to this end, an MOU has been signed in June 2016 to facilitate India\u2019s joining of the Global Entry Programme for expedited immigration for eligible Indian citizens at U.S. airports.\n\nIt appears highly likely that in strategic, political, security, defence and economic terms, relations between India and the USA will continue their upward trajectory under President Trump. Impact of USA\u2019s relations with Pakistan over India is likely to be beneficial and positive. Geopolitical manoeuvres can have significant impact on India-USA relations, however, it would remain to be multi-faceted and an \u201cindispensable partnership\u201d.\n\nAlso read: How To Study Foreign Relations of India For UPSC Mains?\n\nArticle by: Mausam Bharati\u00a0"

This project is responsive to the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) too.\n\nWhat is the current role of India and Japan in Africa?\nIndia\nIndia has always had contributed to Africa, huge human and financial resources. The recently held India Africa Growth Summit in New Delhi attended by heads of state of all 54 countries was a huge diplomatic success that rejuvenated and strengthened ties between both entities. There were crucial announcements of economy and trade, that included a $10 billion concessional credit line offer.\nIndia has a voracious appetite for natural resources and is seeking to expand its markets. It has made significant strides to counter China\u2019s juggernaut and reported \u2018neo-colonialism\u2018.\nAt the same time, India\u2019s contribution to the development of the social sector of Africa through the Pan Africa e-network has been indispensable in cementing such strong ties between the Indian subcontinent and the African continent.\n\nThere is a significant presence of Indian banks and companies in Africa. The EXIM Bank is the lead organization for carrying out the development credit tasks. India has a unique distinction in providing affordable, appropriate and adaptable technology.\nIt is also working on project execution and in building technical capacities in many developing countries in the region.\nJapan\nJapan\u2019s robust developmental assistance plays a major complementary role in this region.\nJapan has expertise in designing, planning and delivering hardware infrastructure.\nIt enjoys a leading edge in research and development areas. It also has the capacity to transfer capabilities for managing and strengthening supply chains in the manufacturing sector and infrastructure projects.\nJapan holds Tokyo International Conference on African Development (TICAD), which provides an open forum to generate innovative discussion among stakeholders participating in the African development programs. Since its inception in 1993, TICAD has contributed in improving social and economic conditions in Africa mainly through aid grants and technical assistance.\nWhat is the common interests of India and Japan in Africa?\n\nA Special Strategic and Global Partnership exist between India and Japan. Both nations have common interests in the region such as:\n\nFreedom of navigation in the sea lines of communication\nElimination of terrorism\nChinese rising belligerence and hegemony in the Asian region, and\nSustained economic growth\n\nHence, the Asia-Africa Growth Corridor\u00a0is set to be a fine-tuned vision and agenda of both governments, aligning with their own development priorities.\n\nWhat are the aspects on which the AAGC will deliberate?\n\nThe Asia-Africa Growth Corridor will deliberate\u00a0on the following\u00a0aspects:\n\nThe existing mechanisms for cooperation between Asia and Africa.\nThe broad-based agenda for the synchronized growth of Asia-Africa for sustainable and innovative development.\nEstablishment of optimum linkages and cooperation among the sub-regions of Asia and Africa.\nEstablishment of the industrial corridor and industrial network.\nImproved partnership for infrastructure development between the two continents, and their sub-regions to address the current demands of trade, investment, and services in a sustainable manner.\nComplementary ways through which infrastructure and connectivity complement the development of industrial corridor and industrial network.\nCoordination between institutional and infrastructure partnerships.\nThe role of people-to-people partnership to strengthen the growth corridor.\nWays to ensure better and freer institutional and people-to-people partnerships between Asia and Africa.\nIdentification of priority projects, which can be optimized and which are economically and financially feasible.\nMechanisms that can result in the exchange of best practices of growth, governance, and partnership between Asia and Africa, including their sub-regions.\nTechnical, economic, and institutional barriers.\nSpecific recommendations for AAGC, and for the larger global periphery around Asia and Africa for sustainable and innovative development.\nWhat is the mode of infrastructure development in AAGC?\n\nThe Asia-Africa Growth Corridor would provide guaranteed quality infrastructure, both physical as well as institutional, that would connect people, towns, regions, and countries. There are five remarkable paradigms associated with AAGC:\n\neffective mobilization of financial resources;\ntheir alignment with socio-economic development and development strategies of partner countries and regions;\napplication of high-quality standards in terms of compliance with international standards established to mitigate environmental and social impact;\nprovision of quality of infrastructure taking into account aspects of economic efficiency and durability, inclusiveness, safety and disaster-resilience, sustainability as well as convenience and amenities; and\ncontribution to the local society and economy.\nWhat are the unique features that push the need for AAGC?\n\nThe basic concept of the Asia-Africa Growth Corridor is that it aims for an open, inclusive, sustainable and innovative growth of the entire Asia-Africa region, in cooperation with the international community.\nTrade Facilitation is a major component of AAGC Framework. In a study conducted by the European Commission, it is found that the time taken for export and import activities is among the highest in Africa.\nThe Declaration of African Union Ministers of Trade has also underscored the importance of trade facilitation and stated their priorities on enhancing infrastructure, boosting productivity and trade capacities, reducing transaction costs, supporting reforms, and improvements to customs regulatory systems.\nAccording to OECD trade facilitation indicators, Asia and Sub-Saharan Africa are below the best practices.\nThere is a need for customs modernization plan with a focus on better organization and management, coupled with administrative, financial and technical autonomy as well as accountability.\nIndia has established the Directorate of Valuation, Special Valuation Branch, and National Import Database to improve custom valuation practices. Similar institutions can be established in other developing countries in Asia and Africa through technical assistance.\nWhat are the possible benefits of the Asia-Africa Growth Corridor?\nIndia has highly skilled software professionals who ensure high quality of service delivery meeting international standards. Frugal innovations and quick fix solutions have been harnessed with limited resources resulting in good quality and affordable products adding to the comparative advantage of countries in the region.\nIndia\u2019s success in the single-window custom clearance through SWIFT could be replicated in African countries.\nAAGC initiatives will also enable Afro-Asian countries to industrialize and increase exports. For this, the Indian Ocean Rim Association (IORA) countries would be on the forefront.\nAAGC initiatives will aim to integrate existing programmes of partner countries. This will spur activities/projects to augment production for exports. India has already made efforts through various initiatives to develop capabilities in other countries in Asia and Africa in the past.\nAAGC and the China factor\n\n\nThe Asia-Africa Growth Corridor has been portrayed as a response to China\u2019s Belt and Road Initiative (BRI). Maritime expert for Observer Researcher Foundation Abhijit Singh has made few observations:\n\nThere\u2019s high reason to suspect that China will expand its berthing rights at the Hambantota port in Sri Lanka to eventually account for its own military facilities.\nThrough investments in port projects and rail construction such as the East Coast Rail Link project in Malaysia, where ports and rail are developed and heavily financed by China, Beijing may eventually be able to bypass Singapore, cut off key Malaysian trade routes.\nIt can further weaken ASEAN unity by playing both neighbouring states off against each other.\n\nChina is paranoid with the \u201cMalacca Dilemma\u201d where it suspects that at the time of any crisis, the country\u2019s main access to energy can be cut off by an enemy power via the narrow straits of Malaysia and Sumatra. Evidently, it is concerned about security issues and is adamant to find alternative routes (China Pakistan Economic Corridor serves that purpose partly).\n\n76 years after attacking the US at Pearl Harbor following an oil and gas embargo, Japan also fears a sabre rattling neighbour controlling its access to trade and resources. For India, too, China\u2019s decision to build an economic corridor with Pakistan through disputed Kashmir is symptomatic of a far greater Chinese revisionism and a break with the current rules-based system.\n\nThe Asia-Africa Growth Corridor provides a benevolent alternative to Belt and Road Initiative. Japan enjoys a greater trust in that region. Investing in strategic infrastructure projects such as ports, rails, and telecommunications would find receptive customers in countries seeking to minimize their dependence on individual trading partners. Its past experiences would allay the local perceptions of foreign control.\n\nMatching Japan\u2019s high skills and capital, India\u2019s own size and experience with economic development has challenged it to pursue key technologies \u2013 be they in pharmacology or solar energy \u2013 on a mass scales. With close links in ASEAN, India is widely seen as a benevolent power and via its cultural and religious ties to diaspora populations, India has a strong advantage in promoting trade.\n\nWeakness in AAGC\nUnlike China, the third largest arms exporter globally, Japan and India face notable constraints. Where Article 9 of the Japanese constitution limits the size and engagement of the Japanese army, India, the greatest importer of weapons, remains far behind its main competitor.\nIndia doesn\u2019t have pockets deep enough to offer freebies to Africa. All it can do is make African nations stakeholders in development.\nStructural changes within India and Japan must take place before the two can promote sustainable people-to-people exchanges.\nWith protectionism and significant domestic hurdles to overcome, it is difficult to envision both leaders effectively promoting meaningful regional integration on the people-to-people level.\nConclusion\n\nThe Asia-Africa Growth Corridor Vision Study will use the Geographical Simulation Model (GSM) to bring out the economic gains for Africa through its integration with India, South Asia, South-East Asia, East Asia and Oceania. The AAGC is designed to be responsive to the needs of equitable and sustainable growth. Its development programmes and projects are based on equal partnership, mutual trust, and cooperation. AAGC aims for an open, inclusive, sustainable and innovative growth of the entire Asia Africa region, in cooperation with the international community.\n\nAlso read: ECOWAS (Economic Community of West African States)\n\nArticle by: Mausam Bharati"

The goal of greater economic integration with the countries of South East Asia and East Asia can be achieved through RCEP. India will have access to vast regional markets of these countries thereby helping its economy.\nRCEP will facilitate India\u2019s Integration into regional production networks harmonizing trade-related rules. India is not a party to two other important regional economic blocs namely Asia- Pacific Economic Cooperation and Trans-Pacific partnership and thus RCEP would play an important role in strengthening its trade ties with these countries.\nIndia enjoys a comparative advantage in areas such as ICT, IT-enabled services, healthcare, and education services. RCEP would help in attracting greater FDI into these areas.\nImportance of RCEP for China\n\nRegional Comprehensive Economic Partnership is the key point of accelerating the implementation of the FTA strategy in China.\n\nThe members of the RCEP are all important trade partners of China.\nThe establishment of the RCEP is in the strategic interest of China. It is the largest FTA China has ever negotiated on.\nChina is fighting hard for establishing a new set of economic and trade rules outside the influence of USA and RCEP will help in this endeavour.\nThis would help in the domestic economic development further strengthening China\u2019s position in the global arena.\nChina was excluded from the other important agreement TPP and thus RCEP provides an opportunity for better economic and peaceful relations with the neighbouring countries necessary for China\u2019s rise.\nNew Delhi\u2019s Challenges\n\nFor New Delhi, four challenges lie ahead.\n\nTariff barriers which have been a matter of discontent in bilateral FTAs, particularly in the case of ASEAN-India FTA will be central to the Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership negotiations.\nNon-trade issues such as environment and labour are likely to be a cause of concern. Some of the countries are stressing on stricter labour and environmental protection steps which India feels go far beyond the World Trade Organisation\u2019s Agreement on Trade-Related Aspects of Intellectual Property Rights (TRIPS)\nIndia must take steps to strengthen its medium small and micro enterprises (MSME) sector so as to make it withstand the free flow of trade. Higher investments in R&D and achieving international standards in terms of delivery are needed for this purpose.\nIndia must work tirelessly on capacity building of its domestic industries.\nAlso, the negotiation services are not moving on par with that of trade in goods. India wants liberalised service trade so as to leverage its pool of skilled workforce providing them easier movement across the borders.\n\nAlso read: CPTPP (Comprehensive and Progressive Agreement for Trans-Pacific Partnership)\n\nWhy is India worried about the Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership?\n\nAgreeing to eliminate tariffs altogether is a move that will mainly help China. India is also worried that China would dump its low-cost steel and other products thereby causing a serious harm to the domestic industries.\n\nSources say India could put forward a two-tier proposal on foods that will treat China differently from the remaining RCEP countries.\nThis proposal on China will include a larger negative list (goods that will be protected from tariff cuts) and longer time frame for reducing/eliminating tariffs on the remaining goods.\n\nHowever, India is under pressure to offer similar tariff cuts to all the member states and proposals are being opposed.\n\nContentions of Civil Society Organizations (CSOs)\nMedecins Sans Frontieres (MSF) along with other CSOs are pushing for the removal of harmful intellectual property provisions that could potentially increase drug costs by creating new monopolies and delaying the entry of affordable generics into the market.\nTwo of the most worrying proposals in the trade deal are the demand for Data exclusivity and patent term extensions, both Intellectual Property obligations that least developed countries oppose.\nIndia is considered the Pharmacy of the World due to its provision of generic drugs to countries all over and thus agreeing to such proposals in the Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership would severely undermine India\u2019s position among the least developed countries.\n\nAlso read: India\u2019s Free Trade Agreements \u2013 The \u2018present\u2019 and the \u2018future\u2019\n\nConclusion\n\nIndia needs to maintain a balance between the opening of its economy and protecting its domestic manufacturing industry. In the current scenario of growing protectionism, Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership provides an opportunity for the countries to prosper by increasing trade, creating jobs and other economic opportunities and India should make use of such an agreement.\n\nIndia, as it has done in the latest round of negotiations need to step its effort for negotiations on liberalizing services and should also convince the member states to take a humanitarian view regarding the provision of generic medicines. A win-win situation in which the interests of all the parties are taken into concern is what is required to make Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership successful.\n\nArticle by: Pullela Ujwala"

Trade without barriers \u2013 free trade \u2013 is promoted by institutions like the World Trade Organisation (WTO). In this background, \u00a0as an emerging superpower, India\u2019s Free Trade Agreements deserve special attention.\n\nIn this article, let us analyze some of the Free Trade Agreements (FTAs) signed by India and some of the new/proposed FTAs.\n\nTable of Contents\n\nWhat are Free Trade Agreements (FTA)?\nIndia- ASEAN Free Trade Agreement\nEconomic Perspective\nChallenges in India-ASEAN Free Trade Agreement\nIndia and RCEP\nAdvantages for India\nChallenges for India\nSouth Asia Free Trade Agreement (SAFTA)\nIndia-European Union Free Trade Agreement (Proposed)\nFuture of the Free Trade Agreements and India\u2019s stand on them\nWhat are Free Trade Agreements (FTA)?\n\nA Free Trade Agreement is an agreement between countries to reduce or eliminate trade barriers. Trade barriers include tariff barriers like taxes and nontariff barriers like regulatory laws.\n\nTrade barriers\u00a0include tariff barriers like taxes and nontariff barriers like regulatory laws.\n\nA Free Trade Agreement or FTA is an agreement between two or more countries where the countries agree on certain obligations that affect trade in goods and services, and protections for investors and intellectual property rights, among other topics.\n\nIndia- ASEAN Free Trade Agreement\nRecently, India and The Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) completed 25 years of cooperation and partnership.\nWith the initiation of economic reforms in India from 1991 onwards, the then government initiated the \u2018Look East Policy\u2019 which was particularly focused on Southeast Asia and East Asia.\nThe successive governments rigorously implemented the policy. With the regime change in 2014, there was an upgrade of the \u2018Look East Policy\u2019 to the \u2018Act East Policy\u2019.\nThe India-ASEAN relationship and ties go way back in history. Culturally, Southeast Asia has borrowed heavily from India and there were even Indian kings who went to Southeast Asian lands and established new dynasties there.\nWith the end of the colonization era, slowly the ties between India and ASEAN started to develop yet again.\nThere was increasing contact between people and this led to a rise in exchanges and even economically.\nLook East Policy was a game-changer and after that, there has been no looking back and only growth of relations between the two regions.\nEconomic Perspective\nThe Economic relation is a pillar on which the two region\u2019s partnership rests. In this context, with the enforcement of the \u2018Look East Policy\u2019 there were growing trade relations in goods and investments. After the India-ASEAN free trade agreement was created in 2003, trade relations boomed even further.\nIn 2009, the Free Trade Agreement in Goods was signed and enacted in 2010. The ASEAN-India Free Trade Area (AIFTA) has been completed with the entry into force of the ASEAN-India Agreements on Trade in Service and Investments on 1 July 2015. With this, India will stand to gain as it has always asked for an FTA that will be more comprehensive and include services which has been India\u2019s stronger sector.\nThe ASEAN nations and India together consist of one of the largest economic regions with a total population of about 1.8 billion. ASEAN is currently India\u2019s fourth largest trading partner, accounting for 10.2 per cent of India\u2019s total trade. India, on the other hand, is ASEAN\u2019s 7th\u00a0largest trading partner.\nIndia\u2019s service-oriented economy perfectly complements the manufacturing-based economies of the ASEAN countries. The annual trade between India and ASEAN stood at approximately US$ 76.53 billion in 2014-15. However, it dropped to US$ 65.04 billion in 2015-16 due to declining commodity prices against the backdrop of a sluggish global economy.\nInvestment flows are quite remarkable both ways, with ASEAN accounting for approximately 12.5 per cent of investment flows into India since 2000. Singapore is the primary hub for both inward and outward investments.\u00a0Foreign direct investment (FDI) inflows into India from ASEAN between April 2000 and May 2016 were about US$49.40 billion. FDI outflows from India to ASEAN countries, from April 2007 to March 2015, according to data from the Department of Economic Affairs (DEA), was about US$38.672 billion.\nTo enhance economic and strategic relations with the Southeast Asian countries, the Indian government has put in place a Project Development Fund to set up manufacturing hubs in Cambodia, Myanmar, Laos, and Vietnam(CMLV) countries through separate Special Purpose Vehicles (SPVs).\nChallenges in India-ASEAN Free Trade Agreement\n\nEven though the Trade Agreement with ASEAN has helped trade grow immensely with India, still, the issue remains that the agreement has benefitted the ASEAN region more than India.\n\n\ud83d\udc49 Which year are YOU targeting for success in the IAS/IPS/IFS Exam? \ud83d\ude80\n\n(1) \u21d2 UPSC 2025: Prelims cum Mains\n\n(2) \u21d2 UPSC 2026: Prelims cum Mains\n\n(3) \u21d2 UPSC 2027 Prelims cum Mains\n\nTip: Know more about ClearIAS Courses (Online/Offline)\n\nWith the agreement on goods signed, the domestic markets have faced stiff competition because they have to compete with the cheaper goods of the ASEAN region.\nFor example, the rubber imports from Malaysia, and palm oil imports from Indonesia have made it a tough ordeal for the local manufacturers of palm oil and rubber, especially the rubber plantations of Kerala who have complained about the cheaper imports ever since the agreement was about to be signed.\nThe other drawback of the agreement is that the agreement in services hasn\u2019t reaped many benefits for India. According to ASEAN rules, until all the nations have ratified the FTAs in their Legislatures, the FTA will not be enforced.\nThis has caused much trouble for India as the Philippines hasn\u2019t ratified the FTA in services there will be direct competition between India and the Philippines in direct competition in services which would be a disadvantage for the latter.\nOver the years, with the statistics and trade figures, it can be easily deciphered that the trade imbalance in favour of ASEAN and India has an expanding trade deficit with the region which dearly hurts its Current Account Deficit and thus, hurts India\u2019s overall financial.\nIndia and RCEP\n\nRegional Comprehensive Economic Partnership, also known as RCEP is a mega trade block that is being negotiated between the ten members of the ASEAN group and six other members namely South Korea, Australia, China, Japan, New Zealand, and India.\n\nIt is a Free Trade Agreement (FTA) that is being proposed amongst these nations which will include goods and services, investments, intellectual property rights, economic and technical cooperation, and dispute settlement.\nIf negotiated and enforced, it will be one of the largest trading blocs in the world. With a combined Gross Domestic Product of almost $17 trillion and covering more than 40 per cent of the world\u2019s trade. It also covers more than 3 billion people.\nThe bloc aims at tariff liberalization amongst the nations and so, there will be easier market access amongst all the nations amongst themselves.\n\nAlso read: Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership (RCEP) \u2013 Will it counter TPP?\n\nAdvantages for India\nFor India, which is not a part of the other major trade blocs of the world, such as Asia Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC), and the Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP), this free trade agreement would prove to be of advantage as earlier it was feared that with the presence of these trade blocs and the negotiation of their FTAs, India might lose out its market share, especially in case of textiles, pharmaceuticals and medicines etc. to other Southeast Asian nations like Vietnam.\nAlso, with India already having an FTA with ASEAN Japan, and South Korea, with the negotiation of the RCEP, it will complement India\u2019s pre-existing FTAs and will allow better access to consumer markets in other nations.\nWith the FTA being negotiated even in services, it will add to the advantage for India where they have a comparative advantage over other nations, especially in the context of Information Technology related services, healthcare services, and educational services.\nChallenges for India\nThe agricultural sector of India, which faces issues like lack of investment, low productivity, obsolete technology, and fragmented landholdings will suffer even more as with the negotiation of the RCEP agreement, now, the Indian market will be flooded with products from other nations which are comparatively cheaper and have a more efficient agricultural sector.\nThe already negotiated FTA with ASEAN has hurt the interests of some particular communities such as rubber plantations and palm oil production. Also, the allied sectors, such as the dairy sector in India, which still is not at a mature stage, will face stiff competition from countries like New Zealand which has a very strong dairy sector and their economy thrives on the same.\nAlso, the industrial sector of India is still in a nascent stage. In the context of goods, India has already given up on a three-tier tariff reduction proposal that would offer different coverage for ASEAN, Japan, and South Korea and a much lower level of tariff reduction coverage for Australia, China, and New Zealand.\nWith the agreement on the intellectual property rights to be negotiated, which is being pressurized by Japan, this will lead to the issue that India may lose its status as the pharmaceutical hub of the world. Agreeing to data exclusivity, extending patenting terms and unduly strong enforcement measures will weaken the generic pharmaceutical sector and will come in direct conflict with section 3(d) of the Indian Patents Act.\nThis will make medicines expensive and inaccessible not just for Indians but for the entire developing world. India has already resisted pressure not succumbing to dilute the provisions of the European Union and the FTA to be proposed with the same. Thus, diluting the measures in this context might again open a Pandora\u2019s box for India.\nAlso, in the case of the services sector, where India is assuming and pitching for gains, it remains to be seen whether it will duly gain or not. India is pitching for Mode 3 and Mode 4 type gains. With Mode 4 types of gains highly unlikely to be awarded, in the context of Mode 3, except in the case of Information Technology and Information Technology Enabled Services, it remains to be seen whether it will benefit India much or not.\nFinally, to conclude, the FTA will pose a big challenge to the \u2018Make in India\u2019 program which the current government is aggressively promoting. For example, the granting of tariff-free access to Chinese goods, which have already flooded the Indian markets and have decimated the Indian goods and markets will further aggravate the situation and add to increase the budget deficit with China.\nSouth Asia Free Trade Agreement (SAFTA)\n\nSouth Asian Association for Regional Cooperation or SAARC, as it is known, is a region comprising of all the South-Asian nations or the subcontinent i.e. India, Pakistan, Sri Lanka, Bangladesh, Nepal, Bhutan, and the other two countries namely Afghanistan and Maldives. It was conceived to improve the interrelationships between the nations and improve people-to-people contact as all the people are united culturally but divided by the borders.\nIn this context, the concept of the South-Asia Free Trade Agreement or SAFTA was conceived for the first time in 1993 as a Preferential Trade Agreement ( an agreement amongst the nations to trade selected goods without tariffs or with very low tariffs) and later, it was upgraded to a Free Trade Agreement in 2004 and came into force in 2006. This was done to improve trade and economic relations amongst the member nations of SAARC.\nWith the classification of nations as Least Developing Countries and Non-Least Developing Countries, there was a creation of an equal platform for all the players in the region so that the Free Trade Agreement would not lead to issues for the domestic markets.\nHowever, despite more than ten years after the enactment of the FTA, the trade growth amongst the member nations is meagre. This puts a question mark on the concept of the creation of an FTA in the region. Because of the geopolitical scenario of the subcontinent, there have always been contentious issues among the neighbours. For example, India and Pakistan have always had their differences and their relationship becomes the elephant in the room in case of any summit and negotiations to be done. Also, the proximity of Pakistan to China has added to the troubles.\nOther smaller nations have also played the China card again and again against India which has led to a void in the confidence among the nations. The trade amongst the nations is so poor that it comprises only five per cent of the total trade of the nations.\nThe clause of \u2018sensitive list\u2019 has also hurt trade prospects which each nation apprehensive of losing out on its domestic industry as compared to the other nations and thus, has included quite a many of the list of goods and services to be traded in the sensitive list. When included in the list, the products become immune from tariff concession.\nIndia-European Union Free Trade Agreement (Proposed)\nIndia-European Union (EU) FTA, officially known as the Broad-Based Trade and Investment Agreement has been negotiated for quite a while. However, in 2013, there was a breakdown in talks between the two sides and the talks have been stalled ever since. The European Union wants India to reduce the import duties on alcohol and automobiles and India wants the EU to declare India as a \u2018data secure\u2019 country.\nAlso, in 2016, India unilaterally terminated Bilateral Investment Treaties with many countries across the world, with many of them being European nations. This has added to the increased scepticism of the nations who have question marks over the future investments to be made in India.\nThe reason why the Bilateral treaties have been terminated is that India has put forward its condition of exhausting all the judicial and litigation measures available in the country first and then only going for international litigation or arbitration. The 2016 Model Indian Bilateral Investment Treaty requires the foreign investor to litigate for at least five years in the national courts before approaching the international tribunal.\nIn contrast, the EU and Canada had put forward the idea of an Investor-State Dispute Mechanism at the global level in which the foreign investors in a country can drag the government to the international arbitration centres without exhausting the local litigation means and claim huge losses citing losses they suffered due to various reasons, including policy changes. This has been summarily rejected by India, Argentina as well and Japan. Japan has been opposing it because international arbitration will involve huge costs whereas India wants the foreign investors to exhaust the national judicial remedies and then only go for international arbitration.\nFuture of the Free Trade Agreements and India\u2019s stand on them\n\nThe unilateral termination of the BITs with so many nations should be reviewed, especially when India is being projected as a bright spot in the global economy.\n\nThe move comes as a regressive step as it increases the confusion of the foreign investors who wish to invest in India. Also, the clause which says at least five years of national litigation is necessary after which the international tribunals can be approached looks like a step in the wrong direction.\n\nThis goes against the government\u2019s slogan of \u2018More Governance, Less Government\u2019 and against the concept of \u2018Ease of Doing Business\u2019 in the nation.\n\nRegarding the FTAs, India should be very careful in the clauses of negotiation. Despite having a strong services sector in a select few categories, ( IT, ITES, Healthcare and Education, etc.) the agricultural sector as well as the industrial sector, especially the Micro, Small, and Medium Scale Enterprises are still not as mature and strong as compared to the other countries with which India is negotiating FTAs.\n\nFor the sake of gaining an advantage in the services sector and access to foreign markets in services, which are also not completely accessible because of the nation\u2019s reservations, India ends up compromising on the primary and secondary sectors which affects too many livelihoods and the economy overall.\n\nThus, the negotiations at an international level should be done only after proper deliberation and understanding of the situation.\n\nAlso read: Foreign Trade of India: Concepts of International Trade\n\nArticle by: Aadarsh Clerk"

In this article, we discuss the Rohingya Refugee Crisis and the concerns of India.\n\nTable of Contents\n\nWho are Rohingyas?\nThrough the timeline of crisis\n2012\n2015\n2016-17\nThe legal status of Rohingyas\nWhat is being done to handle the refugee crisis?\nThe UN Response\nThe ASEAN Response\nBangladesh\nThe United States\nIndia\u2019s response towards Rohingya Refugees\nWhy does India try to keep away from the issue?\nHow the refugee crisis affects India\u2019s interests and values\nWho are Rohingyas?\n\nRohingyas are indigenous to Rakhine state (also known as Arakan) in Myanmar settled since the 15th century.\nCollectively they fall under the Muslim Indo-Aryans, a mixture of pre-colonial and colonial immigrations.\nHowever, according to Myanmar government, they are illegal immigrants migrated to Rakhine following Burmese independence and Bangladesh liberation war.\nThey are victims of an organized genocide and are one of the world\u2019s most persecuted minorities.\nThe population of Rohingyas was around 1.1 to 1.3 million before the 2015 crisis.\nThe crisis received international attention followed to Rakhine state riot in 2012, Rohingya crisis in 2015 and 2016-17 military crackdown.\nAt present 40000 Rohingyas have their second home in India.\nThrough the timeline of crisis\n2012\nThe crisis first started on June 10th of 2012 in northern Rakhine between ethnic Rakhine Buddhists and Rohingya Muslims.\nThis resulted in gang rape and murder of a Rakhine women by Rohingyas and killing of ten Burmese Muslims by Rakhines. In return, Rohingya burned a Rakhine\u2019s Buddhist and their houses.\nAs of August 22nd,\u00a02012 it is officially estimated as the total of 88 causalities including 57 Muslims and 31 Buddhists. Nearly 90000 peoples lost their home and around 2500 houses were burned in the crisis.\n2015\nThe government of Myanmar systematically isolates the ethnic minority.\nThis resulted in the migration of thousands of Rohingyas to Bangladesh, Malaysia, Indonesia and Thailand by rickety boats (hence called boat people).\nAccording to United Nations from January to March in 2015, approximately 25000 people have been taken by boats to different countries and many of them died.\n2016-17\nThe Myanmar Military started exploitation against Rohingyas in 2016.\nIn the initial attack, many of them died and many were arrested. This resulted in the migration of Rohingyas towards Bangladesh as refugees.\nIn November, approximately 1500 refugee houses in border villages of Myanmar was burned by special forces.\nThe scenarios after this were even worse. Many Rohingya women were gang raped, men and kids killed. The refugee boats in Naf river were under gun fire by Military.\nIn March 2017, 423 detainees were put arrested which includes women and children.\nThe crisis resulted in the displacement of nearly 92000 people from their home land. (Reference: TheDailyStar)\nThe legal status of Rohingyas\nThe Myanmar government never allowed a citizenship status to Rohingyas. Hence the majority of them do not have any legal documentations, making them stateless.\nUntil recently, they have been able to register as temporary residents with identification cards known as white cards which began issuing in the 1990s.\nThese cards gave some basic rights to Rohingyas such as the right to vote. But they were never recognized as a proof of citizenship.\nThese cards get cancelled in 2015 which effectively put an end to their right to vote.\nIn 2014, UN held a census, which was the first in Myanmar in 30 years. Initially, the Muslim minority were allowed to register as Rohingya. But after Buddhist threatened to boycott the census, the government issued a statement that Rohingyas can register only if they are identified as Bengalis.\nWhat is being done to handle the refugee crisis?\nIn November 2015, Myanmar\u2019s first civilian government led by National League for Democracy (NLD) party were reluctant to talk for Rohingyas because of their interest to gain support from Buddhist nationalities.\n\nThe UN Response\nIn August 2016 UN established a nine-person commission led by former UN Secretary \u2013 general Kofi Annan to discuss the options to propose a solution.\nThe committee submitted its final report to the Myanmar Government on\u00a0Augst 23, 2017.\nThe committee\u2019s final report included recommendations to reduce communal tension and support much-needed development efforts in the impoverished state.\nThe ASEAN Response\nThere has been no coordinated response to the Rohingya problem from the ASEAN. The nature of the response indicates a divided region.\nTill now, there remains a notable lack of pressure on Myanmar from the ASEAN.\nUnlike the 1989 Comprehensive Plan of Action on Indochinese Refugees, which oversaw cooperation between recipient countries of 275000 Vietnamese refugees, no agreement has been made among the four largest destination countries of refugees from Myanmar.\nAt first, Malaysia refused to provide any kind of refuge to the people reaching its shore but agreed to \u201cprovide provisions and send them away\u201d. Later, Malaysia and Indonesia agreed to provide temporary refuge to the Rohingya. Thailand said, it would provide humanitarian assistance and would not turn away boats that wish to enter its waters.\nBangladesh\nBangladeshi Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina called her own country\u2019s economic migrants \u201cmentally sick\u201d and said that they could have better lives in Bangladesh, and complained they were discrediting Bangladesh by leaving.\nShortly thereafter, the Bangladeshi Government announced plans to relocate the 32,000 registered Rohingya refugees who have spent years in camps near the Myanmar border.\nThe 200,000 unregistered other refugees were not officially part of the government\u2019s relocation plan.\nInitially, Thengar Char, an island 18 miles east of Hatiya Island was reportedly selected for the relocation. A subsequent report put the location as 200 hectares selected on Hatiya Island, a nine-hour, the land-and-sea journey from the camps.\nThe United States\nThe State Department of United States expressed its intent to take in Rohingya refugees as part of international efforts.\nSince 2002 the United States has allowed 13,000 Myanmar refugees. Chicago, home to \u2018RefugeeOne\u2019, has one of the largest populations of Rohingyas in the United States.\nIndia\u2019s response towards Rohingya Refugees\n\nNearly 40000 Rohingyas have their home in India now. India has been receiving Rohingya refugees and allowing them to settle in the different parts of the country over the years, especially after the communal violence in the state of Rakhine in 2012.\nIn 2012 December, India\u2019s external affairs Minister\u00a0visited Rakhine and donated 1 million dollars for relief.\nHowever, India considers the refugee crisis as an internal affair of Myanmar.\nOn August 9, 2017, Rajya Sabha MP Rajeev Gowda posed several questions to Union minister of state for home affairs Kiren Rijiju. The questions pertained to the condition of Rohingya refugees in the country and were framed as follows: (a) whether the (home) ministry has framed a policy with regard to Rohingya refugees in India; (b) if so, whether it involves other stakeholders, such as our neighboring countries; (c) whether reports stating that government plans to deport the 40,000 Rohingya refugees are true; and (d) if so, the reasons for such plans?\nThe minister\u2019s response was to outline a plan to deport around 40,000 Rohingya, or \u201cillegally staying foreign nationals\u201d, from India. He said that the central government had directed the state governments to set up district task forces to \u201cidentify and deport\u201d the foreign nationals.\nSince India is not a signatory to the United Nations Convention on Refugees, refugee status granted by the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) to the Rohingya was irrelevant to their deportation.\nAccording to the Government of India, there are no refugee camps established for either Bangladeshis or Rohingyas in India and there were only schemes of assistance for Tibetan and Sri Lankan refugees.\nWhy does India try to keep away from the issue?\nIndia considers the issue as an internal affair of Myanmar.\nIndian believes that ASEAN has an undeniable responsibility to resolve this crisis.\nIndia does not want a conflict of interests with the new regime in Myanmar-Myanmar has a key role in India\u2019s Look East Policy.\nIndia already has several issues like poverty, unemployment etc for her own people.\nHow the refugee crisis affects India\u2019s interests and values\nIndia holds a strong history of welcoming refugees from Srilanka, Tibet, Afghanistan, Pakistan, Bangladesh and still they enjoy the freedom and rights here. The Rohingyas are now the most genocided community in recent past in South Asia, they are stateless and no place got to go.\n16500 Rohingya refugees in India holds United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR)\u2019s identity card and India consider it as irrelevant, and as far as they are illegal immigrants to India, they will be subjected to deport.\nThe refugees have to face the same situations like in the past if India sends them back, which will question India\u2019s policies in the global front. It considered as will rather die in India than return to Myanmar for Rohingyans.\nAdding to this, recently an insurgent group \u2013 Haraquah Al-Yaqin formed in Saudi Arabia commanded by Rohingyas on the ground with tactical training and guerrilla operation skills. India had a history of Lankan refugee issue which eventually ended up in the Assassination of Rajiv Gandhi.\nAlong with security issue, it may lead to political, governance and economic problems in the country.\n\nArticle by: Amal Jose"

            "[CONTENT]": "The India-Pakistan relationship, since the creation of both the nations in 1947 has been rocky, where the nations have been involved in four wars.\n\nKashmir has been the bedrock issue between both the nations and has been an unresolved boundary dispute.\n\nTerrorism, particularly targeting India which is bred on Pakistani soil is yet another major issue which has mired the relationship.\n\nDespite many positive initiatives taken, the India-Pakistan relationship in recent times has reached an all-time low with some sore issues sticking out. Here we are analysing the core issues in the India-Pakistan relationship.\n\nTable of Contents\n\nPresent Context and the Issues in India-Pakistan Relationship\nChanging Political Scenario in Pakistan\nPakistan Politics and the Impact on India-Pakistan\u00a0relationship\nTerrorism and Kashmir \u2013 The never-ending issues\nThe Curious Case of Kulbushan Jadhav\nFuture of India-Pakistan relationship\nIndia-Pakistan Relations: Positive initiatives which were taken in the past\nBenefits, which can be accrued from a good India-Pakistan Relationship\nPresent Context and the Issues in India-Pakistan Relationship\nWith the regime change in India, there was a perception that a hard line and staunch policy towards Pakistan would be followed. However, the current Prime Minister (PM) of India put forward the idea of \u2018Neighborhood First\u2019, which was particularly aimed at improving relationships within the Indian Subcontinent.\nThere were initiatives taken by the government, for example, inviting the Prime Minister of Pakistan for the swearing-in ceremony of the new PM of India, an unscheduled visit to Lahore by the Indian PM to the residence of the PM of Pakistan, which showed some signs of positive development.\nHowever, with the attack on the Indian Air Force Base in 2016 (Pathankot) January, just a few days after Indian PM visited the Pakistani counterpart, events thereafter haven\u2019t been really encouraging. There has been a complete stoppage of talks at all levels in between the nations. Speculations, however, run that back-channel talks exist.\nWith rising discontent and a volatile situation once again in Kashmir from mid-2016, India has accused Pakistan of adding fuel to the unrest and glorifying terrorists by declaring them, martyrs.\nTerrorist attacks on security forces since have increased and the attack on the Uri Army base camp in September 2016, where 19 Indian soldiers were killed, was also carried by an organization, which has its roots in Pakistan. (Lashkar-e-Toiba, also responsible for 26/11 attacks)\nThe case of Kulbushan Jadhav, a retired Indian Naval officer arrested nears the Iran-Pakistan border in Baluchistan region by the Pakistani establishment and accused of espionage by Pakistan.\nOn 14 February 2019, a convoy of vehicles carrying security personnel on the Jammu Srinagar National Highway was attacked by a vehicle-borne suicide bomber in the Pulwama district of Jammu and Kashmir. The attack resulted in the deaths of 40 Central Reserve Police Force (CRPF) personnel and the attacker.\nChanging Political Scenario in Pakistan\nFor quite a while, the Panama Papers issue was being raked up in Pakistan and the then PM Nawaz Sharif of Pakistan was alleged to have received unaccounted money from abroad. The Supreme Court of Pakistan recently disqualified the PM from office, making him the second PM in the history of Pakistan to be disqualified from office.\nThis backdrop comes at a time when the already existing India-Pakistan relations are at a low and with the disqualified PM being perceived as someone who has always wanted to improve the relationship with India, it is not good news for India in a way.\nIn the ouster, surprisingly, the Pakistani Army has remained silent publicly on the issue. However, in the Joint Investigation Team created by the Supreme Court of Pakistan, there was the presence of a Military Intelligence Official and an Inter Services Intelligence (ISI) Official, which shows that the influence the military establishment still continues to have a stronghold in Pakistan.\nSome people perceive the judgment of the Supreme Court of Pakistan, as being politically motivated, with some saying there was a judicial overreach by the Court. Also, the court has directed the National Accountability Bureau to further investigate into cases related to Panama papers.\nHowever, there are also reports that the developments are a sort of deepening the roots of democracy in Pakistan because the due process of law was followed.\nPakistan Politics and the Impact on India-Pakistan\u00a0relationship\n\nThe disqualified PM was seen as someone who tried to pursue a better relationship with India. Thus, his ouster can have implications with the incoming new PM of Pakistan.\nThis can be a cause of concern because of the background scenario with the relationship between both countries already fraught and the Pakistan Army indirectly flexing its muscle in the process of the ouster of the PM. The future thus remains uncertain.\nTerrorism and Kashmir \u2013 The never-ending issues\n\nCross border terrorism has always been an issue. Some analysts go to the extent of saying that both nations are always in a perpetual state of war.\n\n\ud83d\udc49 Which year are YOU targeting for success in the IAS/IPS/IFS Exam? \ud83d\ude80\n\n(1) \u21d2 UPSC 2025: Prelims cum Mains\n\n(2) \u21d2 UPSC 2026: Prelims cum Mains\n\n(3) \u21d2 UPSC 2027 Prelims cum Mains\n\nTip: Know more about ClearIAS Courses (Online/Offline)\n\nDespite the fact the after the Kargil conflict, there was a Ceasefire Agreement signed in 2003, there have been regular cross border ceasefire violations from the Pakistan side of the border with the trend being as such that since 2009 onwards, there has been a rise in the violations (with the exception of 2014). It has killed and injured security forces as well as civilians on both sides.\nWith the regime change in India, there has been a different approach to the violations. With the hardline policy of the new government, there has been massive retaliation to the unprovoked firing.\nThus, out of desperation, there has been a rise in the number of infiltrations of terrorists from across the Line of Control (LOC), which has been routine for quite a while now.\nWith the void in between the Kashmiri people and the establishment increasing after the devastating floods of 2014, there was rising discontent again in the valley. The trigger to the events was the killing of the militant commander of the terrorist organization Hizb-ul-Mujahideen Burhan Wani, which led to widespread protests in the valley and the situation has been highly volatile ever since with almost daily scenes of protests and stone pelting in the valley.\nPakistan has taken advantage of the situation and has fuelled the protests by providing the elements fighting against the Indian establishment and Forces in the state with all sorts of possible support. The PM of Pakistan, in fact, went a step ahead and during the United Nations General Assembly meeting of 2016, declared Wani as a martyr and the struggle of the people of Kashmir as an Intifada.\nThis is in sync with the stand Pakistan holds on Kashmir i.e., to internationalize the issue of Kashmir and asking for holding a plebiscite in Kashmir under Indian administration to decide the fate of Kashmiri people. The stand has been rejected by India as it says it is in direct violation of the Shimla Agreement of 1972, which clearly mentions that peaceful resolution to all issues will be through bilateral approach.\nAfter the attack at the Pathankot base in 2016 January, there was again a thaw in the relationship, especially when seen in the context that the Indian PM paid an unscheduled visit to Pakistan to meet his Pakistani counterpart. With Kashmir already on the boil and Pakistan adding fuel to fire to the situation, the attack on Uri Army camp in September 2016 in which 19 Indian soldiers were killed made the Indian PM declare the statement that \u2018talks and terrorism\u2019 cannot go hand in hand.\nThis was followed by surgical strikes carried out by the Indian Army across the LOC targeting the terror infrastructure in Pakistan occupied Kashmir (PoK). They were carried out at the end of September.\nIn a first, India tinkered with the Indus Water Treaty, a Treaty which has stood the test of time and the bitter sour relationship for more than 55 years and was pondering with the fact to fully exploit the water potential of the West flowing rivers over which Pakistan has control.\nThus, the fact trickles down to the point that India has its stand that until Pakistan doesn\u2019t do enough to tackle the terrorism menace, there can be no talks held in between the nations.\nOn the other hand, Pakistan is ready for a dialogue with India but it wants the inclusion and discussion of the Kashmir issue which it keeps raking up every time.\nThe Curious Case of Kulbushan Jadhav\nThe case of Kulbushan Jadhav, a retired Naval officer arrested nears the Iran-Pakistan border in Baluchistan region by the Pakistani establishment.\nHe has been accused by Pakistan of espionage and spying and has been sentenced to death by a military court in Pakistan.\nIndia, on many previous occasions, demanded consular access of Jadhav, a demand consistently rejected by Pakistan citing national security issues.\nIndia says that Jadhav was a retired Naval officer who was a businessman working in Iran and has been falsely framed by the Pakistani establishment.\nAs there were repeated denials of the Consular Access, India approached the International Court of Justice (ICJ) at Hague where it put forward the argument that Vienna Convention was being violated as the Consular Access was denied.\nThe ICJ has asked Pakistan to stay the execution of Jadhav and the matter is sub judice.\nFuture of India-Pakistan relationship\nIndia and Pakistan are neighbours. Neighbours can\u2019t be changed. Thus, it is in the better of interest of both the nations that they bring all the issues on the drawing board and resolve them amicably.\nIndia wants Pakistan to act more strongly on the terrorism being sponsored from its soil.\nAlso, India wants Pakistan to conclude the trial of 26/11 sooner so that the victims are brought to justice and the conspirers meted out proper punishment.\nIndia has genuine concerns, as there are internationally declared terrorists roaming freely in Pakistan and preaching hate sermons as well as instigating terror attacks.\nWith the international community accusing Pakistan of breeding terrorism on its soil, Pakistan cannot remain in denial state and thus, needs to act tougher on terrorism-related issues.\nIn 2018, Imran Khan became the 22nd Prime Minister of Pakistan. PM Imran Khan received a lot of praise for releasing the IAF pilot Abhinandan who was captured in Pakistan during the counter-terrorism operations (after the Pulwama attack) in 2019.\nIndia-Pakistan Relations: Positive initiatives which were taken in the past\n\nComposite Dialogue Framework, which was started from 2004 onwards, excluded, some of the contentious issues between the two sides had resulted in good progress on a number of issues.\nDelhi-Lahore Bus service was successful in de-escalating tensions for some time.\nRecently, the \u2018Ufa \u2018Agreement\u2019 was made during the meeting of the National Security Advisors of both nations at Ufa, Russia.\n\nA couple of important points agreed upon in Ufa were:\n\nEarly meetings of DG BSF and DG Pakistan Rangers followed by the DGMOs.\nDiscussing ways and means to expedite the Mumbai case trial, including additional information needed to supplement the trial.\n\nUfa Agreement has now become a new starting point of any future India-Pakistan dialogue, which is a major gain for India.\n\nHowever, despite all the initiatives, there is always a breakdown in talks. Thus, more needs to be done for developing peaceful relations. With India and Pakistan both being two Nuclear States, any conflict can lead to a question mark on the existence of the subcontinent as well as the entire planet, especially with the border being \u2018live\u2019 almost all the time.\n\nBenefits, which can be accrued from a good India-Pakistan Relationship\nIf there is peace at the border and a solution of Kashmir is arrived upon, then the China-Pakistan Economic Corridor, which passes through Pakistan-Occupied Kashmir (PoK) can certainly benefit Kashmir, its people and the economy. Kashmir can act as a gateway to Central Asia.\nThe Turkmenistan-Afghanistan-Pakistan-India (TAPI) pipeline which originates in Turkmenistan and passes through Afghanistan, and Pakistan before reaching and terminating in India can also get huge benefits as it can help secure the National Energy needs of both Pakistan and India, which are potentially growing nations with increasing needs of energy.\nThe Iran-Pakistan-India pipeline is another project, which is currently stalled. If relations are cordial, then this pipeline can also supply the energy needs of both nations.\nA stable Afghanistan is in the best interest of both Pakistan as well as India. Terrorism is affecting both India as well as Pakistan and the porous boundary between Afghanistan and Pakistan provides a haven for terrorists. Also, a better relationship with Pakistan can give direct road access to Afghanistan. Currently, India has to go via Iran to Afghanistan to send any trade goods and vice versa.\nSouth Asian Association for Regional Cooperation (SAARC) and the initiatives taken by the association will start to hold more relevance as the same hasn\u2019t lived up to its expected potential and the elephant in the room during any summit is sour in the India-Pakistan relationship.\n\nArticle by: Aadarsh Clerk"

Let\u2019s try to understand India\u2019s relationship with both countries first. This would help you understand India\u2019s stand on the Israel-Palestine conflict.\n\nTable of Contents\n\nIndia-Palestinian relations\nIndia\u2019s cooperation with Palestine in other areas\nReasons behind India\u2019s pro-Palestine policy\nIndia-Israel Relations\nIndia-Israel Relations post 1992\nWhat is India\u2019s stand on the Israel-Palestine Conflict?\nWhat are the things India must keep in mind before endorsing Israel?\nWay ahead\nIndia-Palestinian relations\n\nIndia\u2019s solidarity with the Palestinian people and its attitude towards the Palestinian cause was taken shape during our freedom struggle against British colonialism. In 1938, on the proposal to create a homeland for Jews in Palestine, Mahatma Gandhi wrote, \u201cmy sympathy for the Jews does not blind me to the requirements of Justice. It is wrong and inhuman to impose the Jews on the Arabs\u2019.\nIn 1947, having been the victim of Partition and going through its horrific scenes, India voted against the partition of Palestine at the United Nations General Assembly. It should be noted that India was the only non-Arab and Non-Muslim country to do so.\nPost Independence also, empathy with Palestine became an essential part of our foreign policy.\nIndia has always played a proactive role in garnering support for the Palestinian cause at multilateral forums.\nAnd in 1974, India became the first non-Arab country to recognise the Palestine Liberation Organisation (PLO) as the sole representative of the Palestinian.\nIndia was one of the first countries to recognise the state of Palestine in 1988.\nWhen Palestine Authority (PA), a self Government body, was created as a result of the Oslo Peace accord, India opened her Representative Office for it in Gaza, which later was shifted to Ramallah in 2003.\nIndia voted in favour of UN Resolution against constructing the West Bank wall by Israel in 2003.\nIndia voted in favour for accepting Palestine as a full member of UNESCO in 2011.\nIndia voted in favour of upgrading the status of Palestine to a \u00a0\u2018non-member state \u2018 in the UN in 2012.\nIn 2014, India supported a UNHRC resolution to launch a probe into Isreal\u2019s offensive in Gaza.\nIndia\u2019s cooperation with Palestine in other areas\n\nAlong with Political support, India has been contributing material and technical assistance to the Palestinian people. India has offered budgetary assistance to a tune of US$ 30 million since 1995 till date for different development initiatives in Palestine. Construction of a library in Al-Azhar university, library \u2013 cum activity centre in Palestine technical college etc. to name a few.\nIn 2016 India pledged USD 1.25 million to the UN relief agency for Palestinian refugees as it voiced concern over the fragile situation and ongoing conflicts in the Middle East.\nIndia has always been a leading partner in educational support and cooperation to Palestine. It has been at the forefront of the capacity building process, extending hundreds of scholarships to Palestinian students under the ITEC (Indian Technical & Economic Cooperation)\nIndia-Palestine cultural connections draw strength from India\u2019s cultural and civilizational linkages with the Arab world. Due to the cultural similarities of both countries, Indian Arts and Culture is very popular in Palestine. Several cultural activities such as Kalarippayattu (Indian Martial Art), Kathak etc. were organised in Palestine in the recent past. Indian films, yoga, Indian cuisines etc are also popular in Palestine.\nReasons behind India\u2019s pro-Palestine policy\nIndia with a considerable Muslim Population has been always sympathetic to the Muslim population in Palestine. Indian politicians also followed a pro- Palestine approach without hurting the minority sentiments.\nIndia did not want to jeopardise the interest of its citizens (more than 7 million) working in Arab countries which are a good source of forex reserves.\nIndia is dependent on the Arab nations for its larger oil imports.\nIndia\u2019s co-operation with the Soviet Union during the cold war era and our desire to counter Pakistan with the support of Arab nations was another reason for our pro-Palestine policy.\nIndia-Israel Relations\n\nThough India voted against a UN resolution for the creation of Israel, once Israel is created, India officially recognised Israel (in 1950). But full diplomatic ties were established only in 1992.\n\n\ud83d\udc49 Which year are YOU targeting for success in the IAS/IPS/IFS Exam? \ud83d\ude80\n\n(1) \u21d2 UPSC 2025: Prelims cum Mains\n\n(2) \u21d2 UPSC 2026: Prelims cum Mains\n\n(3) \u21d2 UPSC 2027 Prelims cum Mains\n\nTip: Know more about ClearIAS Courses (Online/Offline)\n\nThe reasons for this tectonic shift in the foreign policy stand were:\n\nDuring these years, the popular perception of Israel was negative as it was a state formed on religion and analogous to Pakistan. However, the formation of an Organisation of Islamic Cooperation (OIC) in 1969 which neglected the sentiments of Indian Muslims by blocking of India\u2019s membership to this group by Pakistan is one of the primary triggers for the change in stance. (Even today India is not a member of OIC).\nIndia has received no backing from the Arab countries on Kashmir Issue. There have been no serious attempts by the Arab world to put pressure on Pakistan to reign in the cross-border insurgency in Kashmir.\nIsrael supported India during the Indo-Pak wars even before full diplomatic ties were established.\nWith the collapse of the Soviet Union and the rise of the US as a superpower, India started aligning itself with the US and this further added to our improved relations with Israel.\nAfter decades of Non-Alignment and Pro-Arab policy, in 1992 India changed its stance and established full diplomatic ties with Israel.\nIndia-Israel Relations post 1992\nBy 1992, the stage was ready for a new beginning in the history of the India-Israel relationship. As mentioned earlier, the first steps towards de-hyphenation were initiated in 1992 when the government established full diplomatic relations with the bilateral relationship between the two countries has blossomed at the economic, military, agricultural, space research and political levels.\nIsrael was one of the rare countries to directly help India during the Kargil War. The Kargil conflict revealed some important deficiencies in India\u2019s intelligence and military forces. In the efforts to rectify these problems, India turned towards Israeli assistance and technologies.\nSince then Israel became an important defence importer for India. When India was planning to undertake a military strike against Pakistan in June 2002 as part of Operation Parakram\u00a0(response to our Parliament attack), Israel supplied hardware through special planes.\nNow, India is the world\u2019s largest buyer of Israeli weaponry and in 2013 India was the third-largest trading partner of Israel in Asia.\nApart from defence cooperation, Israel has intensified its cooperation with Indian agriculture, helping farmers multiply their income by the adoption of modern agricultural technologies to increase productivity.\nRecent years have been witnessing a major boost in cooperation in other areas such as S&T, Space research, Commerce, and trade etc.\nIndian President Pranab Mukherjee\u2019s Israel visit in 2015 was another milestone in bilateral relations, as this was the first visit by an Indian president to Israel. Our PM is planning to visit Israel in 2017.\nWhat is India\u2019s stand on the Israel-Palestine Conflict?\n\nIndia traditionally believes in the 2-state solution and supports the establishment of a sovereign independent and the viable state of Palestine.\nIndia\u2019s support for Palestine has not deterred its growing relationship with Israel.\nHowever, over the years, the Indian government has diluted its reaction to Israel\u2019s treatment of the Palestinians.\nIn 2014 India favoured a UN resolution which established a Commission of Inquiry to investigate a violation of international humanitarian and human rights law in the \u2018Occupied Territories\u2019 during \u2018 Operation Protective Edge\u2019. (Please refer to article on Israel-Palestine Conflict). But our Government was reluctant to pass a resolution in Parliament condemning the Israeli action deviating from its earlier practice.\nIn 2015 India abstained at the UN Human Rights Commission (UNHRC) on a resolution welcoming the report of the same Commission of Inquiry. It\u00a0was the first time India refused to vote against Israel.\nLater on, our Government clarified that there was no change in India\u2019s traditional support to the Palestinian cause and it was the reference to the ICC (International criminal court) which made India abstain from voting. (India has not signed the Rome statute on ICC).\nHowever, with an increased focus on closer ties with Israel, there is little doubt that India has diluted its support to Palestine.\nWhat are the things India must keep in mind before endorsing Israel?\n\nThe important areas of concern by India before endorsing Israel are as follows:\n\nIndia\u2019s energy security still relied upon the Arab Nations.\nIndia should consider its relations with Saudi Arabia and Iran before going for closer ties with Israel. Saudi has not yet recognised Israel as a country and Iran supports the Palestinian cause. Any direct stake in Israel would affect our relationship with these countries.\nWay ahead\n\nIsrael wants India to end its pro-Palestine policy. Considering the defence and technological ties with Israel, India can\u2019t ignore Israel too. \u00a0However, while going beyond strategic relations with Israel, India cannot afford to ignore its crucial energy ties with Iran and the Gulf countries. Also, it should not be forgotten that India requires the firm endorsement of its candidature from the Arab countries that form a large group in the UN General Assembly.\n\nIt is to be noted that India has been very keen to preserve a pragmatic balancing act between regional players in the West Asian region like Saudi Arabia and Iran. On similar lines, India should be cautious enough while backing Israel and should adopt a more balanced and pragmatic approach while dealing with Israel and Palestine.\n\nAlso read: India-Greece Relations\n\nArticle by:\u00a0Sreeresmi\u00a0S"

Syria, Iraq, Israel etc. are some of the regions that are constantly in the news for many reasons. In this post, let\u2019s analyse the Syrian Crisis \u2013 its background, reasons and the way ahead.\n\nTable of Contents\n\nWhat is the Syrian Crisis?\nThe conflict between Shia Islam and Sunni Islam\nThe absence of an accountable government\nSyrian Crisis: Recent Political Developments\nImplication of civil war in Syria\nSyrian Crisis and India\nSyrian Crisis: The Way ahead\nReferences:\nWhat is the Syrian Crisis?\n\nSyria is a West Asian Country bordering Lebanon, Turkey, Iraq, Jordan, and Israel. The civil war in Syria is regarded as the most brutal conflict in the world which started off in 2011 and is still on. The primary reasons for the unrest in Syria can be summarized as below.\n\nAlso read: Social Justice\n\nThe conflict between Shia Islam and Sunni Islam\n\nThe root of this conflict can be traced to sectarian conflicts in the region that have existed for centuries. Shia Islam and Sunni Islam are the two major denominations of Islam Religion. With Saudi Arabia regarding itself as the leader of Sunni Muslims and Iran as the protector of Shia Muslims, the West Asian region is divided under these two leaders. Saudi and Iran started playing an important role in the geopolitical conflicts in the region.\n\nThe absence of an accountable government\n\nAlong with this, the absence of an accountable and democratic Government. In most of the West Asian Countries created discontent among the citizens. A democratic movement against the authoritarian Government started in Tunisia in 2011 popularly known as \u2018Arab Spring\u2019 or \u2018The Jasmine Revolution\u2019. This inspired other countries in the region to raise their voice against their Governments.\n\nSyrian Crisis: Recent Political Developments\n\n\ud83d\udc49 Which year are YOU targeting for success in the IAS/IPS/IFS Exam? \ud83d\ude80\n\n(1) \u21d2 UPSC 2025: Prelims cum Mains\n\n(2) \u21d2 UPSC 2026: Prelims cum Mains\n\n(3) \u21d2 UPSC 2027 Prelims cum Mains\n\nTip: Know more about ClearIAS Courses (Online/Offline)\n\nSyria has a very narrow belt of coastline along the Mediterranean Sea and rest of the country is subjected to extreme temperatures that cause frequent dust storms and periodic droughts. The devastating drought between 2006 to 2011, caused much resentment among the people due to poverty and unemployment. That time Syria was ruled by Basher-Al-Assad, he announced several plans like salary revisions to appease the people of his country.\nThe largest religious group in Syria is the Sunni Muslims which constitutes almost 74% of the population. They were not happy with the administration of President Basher-Al-Assad who was more inclined to Shia Muslims.\nIn 2011, peaceful democratic protests started in The Government started a brutal crackdown on rebel groups with the support of Iran-backed Militia and it revealed the sectarian tensions in Syria.\nThe Sunni-dominated opposition has, meanwhile, attracted varying degrees of support from its international backers \u2013 Turkey, Saudi Arabia, Qatar, and Jordan, along with the US, UK, and France. A large number of Syrian Sunnis, US sponsored western fighters and Saudi-backed Sunni fighters etc joined the rebel group to topple the Assad regime.\nIn 2013, US claimed that Syrian Government has used Chemical weapons (Sarin Gas) against the rebel group and demanded UN investigation in Syria. Also, US stepped up its support for rebels and the Assad regime started receding.\nSyria agreed to a Russian( Russia backs Assad Regime) Proposal to give up Chemical weapons and later OPCW (Organisation of Prohibition of Chemical Weapons) announced that Syrian Government has destroyed all its declared chemical weapons mixing, filling and production facilities.\nHereafter, UN kick-started the peace talks with the aim of ending the Syrian Civil War. United Nations-backed international peace conference on the future of Syria known as Geneva II Conference was held in 2013, nevertheless, it remained inconclusive.\nThe US and its allies\u2019 supports to the rebels in Syria to topple the Assad regime, led to the rise of the terrorist outfit ISIS (Islamic State of Iraq and Syria) which established in Sunni Provinces of Iraq and eastern provinces of Syria. This radical Islamist group has gained control over vast territory and populations of Syria.\nISIS became a global threat and in response to this, the US-led coalition launched air strikes on Syria in an effort to \u201cdegrade and ultimately destroy\u201d IS. But the coalition has avoided attacks that might benefit Assad\u2019s forces. In short, it could not destroy the might of ISIS.\nThe balance of Power changed when Russia began an air campaign targeting \u201cterrorists\u201d in Syria in 2015. With the support of Russia, Assad regime regained many parts of the country including Aleppo City. But opposition activists said that its strikes have mostly killed Western-backed rebels and civilians.\nThe Geneva III peace talks are still on, but the peace still remains.\nImplication of civil war in Syria\n\nThe devastating civil war has set the country decades behind in terms of economic, social and human development.\n\nSyria\u2019s GDP today is less than half of what it was before the war started and it could take two decades or more for the country to return to its pre-conflict GDP levels. Most of the people in the region are living below poverty line.\nMore than 250,000 Syrians have lost their lives in five years of armed conflict, millions of innocent people have got injured in the conflict and 80% of the children are harmed by the civil war.\nLarge-scale human displacement from Syria has resulted in Global Refugee Crisis. Approximately 6.5 million people are internally displaced inside Syria, 1.2 million were driven from their homes in 2015 alone.\nWidespread damage to physical infrastructures such as roads, bridges, schools, power generation, and water supply. Reconstructing damaged physical infrastructure will be a monumental task.\nSyrian Crisis and India\n\nIndia has had good relations with Syria historically, but India has always taken a neutral stand to Assad\u2019s regime.\nIndia has a substantial interest in the field of trade and investment, Diaspora, remittances, and energy security in the region.\nDue to the Syrian Crisis, India had to abandon its oil investments in Syria. Though India has not much dependency on Syria for her energy needs, the political stability in the entire West Asian region is very important for India.\nMore than 7 million Indians are working in these countries and therefore the stability of the region should be India\u2019s priority.\nRecently India abstained from voting on a United Nations General Assembly resolution demanding an immediate ceasefire in Syria. By doing so India was trying to balance both US and Russia. However, as India work towards a permanent seat in UN Security Council, India should deviate from its path of non-alignment and should take a decisive stand on global affairs like Syrian Crisis.\nSyrian Crisis: The Way ahead\nThe outside powers that are involved in Syria\u2019s civil war through proxy means need to reconsider their decision. Their role in converting a peaceful democratic movement into full-fledged war should be condemned. They should stop financing the extremist groups to avoid further conflicts in the region.\nThe two major powers US and USSR, instead of reviving a cold war era, should engage in constructive negotiations with the Syrian government to find an amicable They should provide support to establish a democratically elected Government.\nThe Syrian government should be ready for a dialogue on Syria\u2019s future with the non-jihadist opposition groups.\nConsidering the large scale devastation which happened in Syria, rebuilding it\u2019s human and social capital will be an insurmountable task for the govt. Therefore the international community should come forward with a helping hand to bring the war-torn nation into normalcy. India can also play a constructive humanitarian role to establish peace and stability in the region.\n\nAlso read: Children and Armed Conflict\n\nReferences:\nCBBC Newsround\nWikipedia\nScroll.in\nThe Hindu\n\u00a0Wikipedia\nThe Atlantic\nThe Diplomat\n\nArticle by: Sree Resmi S"
