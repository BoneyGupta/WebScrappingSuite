The nucleus contains protons and neutrons. Electrons revolve around the nucleus in different orbits.\n\nSubatomic particles\n\nThe constituent particles of an atom are called subatomic particles. They mainly include protons, electrons and neutrons.\u00a0The electron is the least massive of these particles at\u00a09.11\u00d710\u221231\u00a0kg with a negative\u00a0charge. Protons have a positive charge and Neutrons have no electrical charge.\n\nDiscoveries:\n\n\u00a0 \u00a0 Proton by Ernest Rutherford\u00a0in 1918.\n\u00a0 \u00a0 Electron by J.J. Thomson in 1897.\n\u00a0 \u00a0 Neutron by James Chadwick in 1932.\nNucleus\n\nThe central part of an atom is called nucleus. Particles present inside the nucleus are called nucleons and they include mainly protons and neutrons. Due to the presence of protons nucleus has a positive charge.\n\n\ud83d\udc49 Which year are YOU targeting for success in the IAS/IPS/IFS Exam? \ud83d\ude80\n\n(1) \u21d2 UPSC 2025: Prelims cum Mains\n\n(2) \u21d2 UPSC 2026: Prelims cum Mains\n\n(3) \u21d2 UPSC 2027 Prelims cum Mains\n\nTip: Know more about ClearIAS Courses (Online/Offline)\n\nMolecules\n\nMolecules are made of atoms of one or more elements. Some molecules are made only by one type of atoms (two oxygen atoms bond together to form O2 molecule) while molecules like protein are made up of atoms from different elements.\n\nElements\n\nA chemical element is a pure chemical substance consisting of one type of atom distinguished by its atomic number. Carbon, Oxygen, Silicon, Arsenic, Aluminum, Iron, Copper, Gold, Mercury etc. are all examples of elements.\n\nNote :\n\nHydrogen and Helium are the most abundant elements in the universe.\nIron is the most abundant element (by mass) in the earth.\nOxygen is the most common element in the earth\u2019s crust.\nThe 8 most abundant elements in Earth\u2019s crust (by mass) are the following :\n\u00a0 46.6% Oxygen (O)\n\u00a0 27.7% Silicon (Si)\n\u00a0 8.1% Aluminum (Al)\n\u00a0 5.0% Iron (Fe)\n\u00a0 3.6% Calcium (Ca)\n\u00a0 2.8% Sodium (Na)\n\u00a0 2.6% Potassium (K)\n\u00a0 2.1% Magnesium (Mg)\nPeriodic Table\n\nDmitri Ivanovich Mendeleev is the father of periodic table.\u00a0The first detailed form of the periodic table was developed by Mendeleev (based on mass number) but later Henry Gwyn Jeffrey\u2019s Moseley made a new periodic table based on atomic number. Mosley is called the father of modern periodic table.\n\n\nNatural elements\n\nThe elements which occur in naturally on earth are called natural elements.\n\nEg: Oxygen, Nitrogen, Carbon etc.\n\nSynthetic or man-made elements\n\nA synthetic element\u00a0is a chemical element\u00a0that does not occur naturally on\u00a0the earth.\u00a0These are prepared by\u00a0artificially\u00a0and\u00a0are unstable. The first synthetic element made was Technetium.\n\nCompounds\n\nCompounds contain more than one kind of atoms (more on atoms, later). It cannot be separated into constituent atoms by simple methods.\n\nEg: common salt (NaCl),\u00a0Sodium carbonate (Na2CO3).\n\nMixtures\n\nMixtures are a combination of two or more substances, which when combined, each substance retains its own chemical identity.\u00a0Examples of Mixtures include :\n\nsand and water.\nsalt and water.\nsugar and salt.\n\nAlso read about: Nuclear Chemistry\n\nArticle Contributed by Deepesh S Rajan",

These smaller nuclei are called fission products. Particles (e.g., neutrons, photons, alpha particles) may also be released along fission.\n\nExample:\n\n23592U +\u00a010n \u2192\u00a09038Sr +\u00a014354Xe + 310n.\n\nNuclear Fusion\n\nNuclear fusion is a process in which atomic nuclei are fused together to form heavier nuclei. Large amounts of energy are released when fusion occurs.The reactions which take place inside the sun is an example of nuclear fusion.\n\nExamples:\n\n11H +\u00a021H \u2192\u00a032He.\n\n32He +\u00a032He \u2192\u00a042He + 211H.\n\n11H +\u00a011H \u2192\u00a021H +\u00a00+1\u03b2.\n\nArticle contributed by Deepesh S Rajan.",

    "[CONTENT] #9": "Big Bang Theory is about the origin of the Universe. It suggests that about 1370 crore (13.7 billion) years ago, all matter and energy in the universe was concentrated in an area smaller than an atom.\n\nAt this instant, matter, energy, space, and time were not existent. Then suddenly with a bang, the Universe began to expand at an incredible rate, and matter, energy, space, and time came into being.\n\nAs the Universe expanded, matter began to coalesce into gas clouds and the stars and planets. Some scientists believe that this expansion is finite and will one day cease. After this point in time, the Universe will begin to collapse until a Big Crunch occurs.\n\nTable of Contents\n\nJust before the Big Bang\nThe first few minutes to the next thousand years\nEarlier Opaque Universe vs Later Transparent Universe\nThe rate of Expansion of the Universe is not decreasing, but increasing due to Dark Energy!\nQuestion of Equilibrium: Answer in Inflationary model\nProofs of Big Bang\nMissions to study Big Bang\nThe Big Bang Theory in Laymen Language\nJust before the Big Bang\n\nNo one knows what the universe was like at this time. The best current theory, the \u201cinflationary universe\u201d model assumes that all of space is filled with an extremely concentrated, unstable form of energy that will be transformed into particles of matter at the instant of the Big Bang. But no one knows how space and time came into existence in the first place.\n\nThe first few minutes to the next thousand years\nBig Bang Theory Time Line\n\nAfter the initial expansion, the universe cooled sufficiently to allow the formation of subatomic particles, including photons, electrons, protons, and neutrons.\n\nThough simple atomic nuclei formed within the first three minutes after the Big Bang, thousands of years passed before the first electrically neutral atoms formed. The majority of atoms that were produced by the Big Bang are hydrogen, along with helium and traces of lithium.\n\n\ud83d\udc49 Which year are YOU targeting for success in the IAS/IPS/IFS Exam? \ud83d\ude80\n\n(1) \u21d2 UPSC 2025: Prelims cum Mains\n\n(2) \u21d2 UPSC 2026: Prelims cum Mains\n\n(3) \u21d2 UPSC 2027 Prelims cum Mains\n\nTip: Know more about ClearIAS Courses (Online/Offline)\n\nPS:\u00a0 If the universe had remained this hot and dense for much longer, the hydrogen would all have been cooked into other chemical elements. Without hydrogen, there would be no water, and therefore no life as we know it!\n\nRead:\u00a0Fermions and Bosons\n\nEarlier Opaque Universe vs Later Transparent Universe\n\nPhotons (light) being elementary particles would have been formed soon after the Big Bang. But these photons would have been\u00a0scattered by the early electrons.\u00a0As the Universe continued to cool, it would have eventually reached the temperature where electrons combined with nuclei to form neutral atoms (recombination). Before this \u201crecombination\u201d occurred, the Universe would have been opaque because the free electrons would have caused light (photons) to scatter the way sunlight scatters from the water droplets in clouds. But when the free electrons were absorbed to form neutral atoms, the Universe suddenly became transparent. Those same photons \u2013 the afterglow of the Big Bang known as Cosmic Background Radiation \u2013 can be observed today.\n\nPS: The Opacity of the early Universe before recombination is, in effect, a curtain drawn over those interesting very early events. Fortunately, there is a way to observe the Universe that does not involve photons at all. Gravitational waves, the only known form of information that can reach us undistorted from the instant of the Big Bang, can carry information that we can get no other way. Two missions that are being considered by NASA, LISA and the Big Bang Observer, will look for the gravitational waves from the epoch of inflation.\n\nThe rate of Expansion of the Universe is not decreasing, but increasing due to Dark Energy!\n\nIt had always been assumed that the matter of the Universe would slow its rate of expansion. Mass creates gravity, gravity creates pull, and the pulling must slow the expansion. But supernovae observations showed that the expansion of the Universe, rather than slowing, is accelerating. Something, not like matter and not like ordinary energy, is pushing the galaxies apart. This \u201cstuff\u201d has been dubbed dark energy, but to give it a name is not to understand it. Whether dark energy is a type of dynamical fluid, heretofore unknown to physics, or whether it is a property of the vacuum of space, or whether it is some modification to general relativity is not yet known.\n\nAlso read: GRAPES-3 Experiment\n\nQuestion of Equilibrium: Answer in Inflationary model\n\nOur investigation shows that the early Universe was too homogeneous. How could pieces of the Universe that had never been in contact with each other have come to equilibrium at the very same temperature? This and other cosmological problems could be solved, however, if there had been a very short period immediately after the Big Bang where the Universe experienced an incredible burst of expansion called \u201cinflation.\u201d For this inflation to have taken place, the Universe at the time of the Big Bang must have been filled with an unstable form of energy whose nature is not yet known. Whatever its nature, the inflationary model predicts that this primordial energy would have been unevenly distributed in space due to a kind of quantum noise that arose when the Universe was extremely small. This pattern would have been transferred to the matter of the Universe and would show up in the photons that began streaming away freely at the moment of recombination.\n\nAlso read: LIGO-India\n\nProofs of Big Bang\nExpanding galaxies:\u00a0Hubble in 1929, noted that galaxies outside our own Milky Way were all moving away from us, each at a speed proportional to its distance from us. He quickly realized what this meant that there must have been an instant in time (now known to be about 14 billion years ago) when the entire Universe was contained in a single point in space. The Universe must have been born in this single violent event which came to be known as the \u201cBig Bang.\u201d\nCosmic Background radiation: Those early photons \u2013 the afterglow of the Big Bang known as cosmic background radiation \u2013 can be observed today.\nMissions to study Big Bang\nCosmic Background Explorer (COBE): NASA has launched two missions to study the cosmic background radiation, taking \u201cbaby pictures\u201d of the Universe only 400,000 years after it was born. The first of these was the Cosmic Background Explorer (COBE).\nWilkinson Microware Anisotropy Probe (WMAP):\u00a0The second mission to examine the cosmic background radiation was the Wilkinson Microware Anisotropy Probe (WMAP). With greatly improved resolution compared to COBE, WMAP surveyed the entire sky, measuring temperature differences of the microwave radiation that is nearly uniformly distributed across the Universe. The picture shows a map of the sky, with hot regions in red and cooler regions in blue. By combining this evidence with theoretical models of the Universe, scientists have concluded that the Universe is \u201cflat,\u201d meaning that, on cosmological scales, the geometry of space satisfies the rules of Euclidean geometry (e.g., parallel lines never meet, the ratio of circle circumference to diameter is pi, etc).\nPlanck: A third mission, Planck, led by the European Space Agency with significant participation from NASA, was launched in 2009. \u00a0Planck is making the most accurate maps of the microwave background radiation yet. With instruments sensitive to temperature variations of a few millionths of a degree, and mapping the full sky over 9 wavelength bands, it measures the fluctuations of the temperature of the CMB with an accuracy set by fundamental astrophysical limits.\n\nTelescopes: Today NASA spacecraft such as the Hubble Space Telescope and the Spitzer Space Telescope continue Edwin Hubble\u2019s work of measuring the expansion of the Universe.\n\nAlso read: Nobel Prize\n\nThe Big Bang Theory in Laymen Language\nThe universe is flat!\n\nIn the beginning, there was only energy. This energy is converted to small particles (like photons). As there were earlier free electrons too, these earlier photons got scattered by the first electrons. The result: a dark universe! But later, when electrons combined with protons and neutrons (atomic nuclei), atoms were formed. As then there were no free electrons to scatter photons then the Universe became transparent!\n\nSome unknown energy kept particles pushing apart. Meanwhile, the universe started to cool too. Atoms like Hydrogen were formed. Atoms form molecules, molecules combine to form compounds, and so on.\n\nThe final result: all the big objects like what we see today planets, stars, galaxies, and so on! But now when we analyze the universe, the shape of the universe is flat, ie as if an explosion took place on a 2 -dimensional table!\n\nThe two theories that formed the basis of the Big Bang theory are (1) Einstein\u2019s General Theory of Relativity and (2) The Cosmological Principles, which state that the universe is homogeneous throughout. Hope at least the basics of the \u2018not-so-easy-to-understand\u2019 Big Bang theory of energy to mass conversion is clear! If not, have a look at 2-3 reference documents.\n\nTimeline of the Big Bang.\nShape of the universe.\nBeyond Big Bang Cosmology.",

    "[CONTENT] #12": "In this universe there are huge objects like planets and stars. There are also sub-atomic particles like protons and neutrons. You may note that at sub-atomic sizes, the wave nature of particles cannot be neglected and that the particles move at very high speeds. Which theory of Physics explains satisfactorily the behavior of both? Classical theory propounded by Issac Newton? Or General theory of relativity given by Einstein? This post is an introductory article before our in-depth analysis of Standard Particle Model of Quantum Mechanics.\n\nAlso read: National Supercomputing Mission\n\nTable of Contents\n\nClassical Mechanics for Macroscopic Objects\nQuantum Mechanics for Micro\u00a0(and macro) scopic Objects\nStandard Particle Model of Quantum Mechanics\nBeyond\u00a0Standard Particle Model\nQuantum Field Theory (QFT)\nNon Quantum Relativistic Mechanics vs Relativistic Quantum Mechanics vs Quantum Gravity\nClassical Mechanics for Macroscopic Objects\n\nClassical mechanics describes the motion of macroscopic objects such as spacecraft, planets, stars, and galaxies. The classical mechanics (as known as Newtonian mechanics) provides extremely accurate results as long as the domain of study is restricted to large objects and the speeds involved do not approach the speed of light. The classical theories are simple, but this branch of mechanics cannot be applied to\u00a0extremely small particles moving at very high speed, as the results may turn inaccurate.\n\nQuantum Mechanics for Micro\u00a0(and macro) scopic Objects\n\nQuantum Mechanics has much more complicated theories than classical mechanics (thanks to Einstein), but provides accurate results for particles of even very small sizes. Quantum Mechanics handles the wave-particle duality of atoms and molecules. Special theory of relativity by Einstein (1905) deals with particles of extremely small sizes while General theory of relativity by Einstein\u00a0(1916) can be used to study all particles in general, ie. even particles of macroscopic sizes. Thus it can be said that General theory of relativity is a super set of Special theory of relativity. But still Classical Mechanics is preferred to General theory of relativity for particles of macroscopic sizes, just because of its simplicity.\n\nStandard Particle Model of Quantum Mechanics\n\nOne of the surprises of modern science is that atoms and sub-atomic particles do not behave like anything we see in the everyday world. They have wave properties, which is not observable in macroscopic objects. To describe this particular behavior, characteristics and interactions, scientists have developed a mathematical model known as Standard Particle Model. This model proposed two major groups of elementary particles of matter, ie. Quarks and Leptons. The model also proposed elementary force carriers known as Gauge Bosons and one Higgs Boson. Standard Particle Model links the matter-energy conversions, with the help of Quarks, Leptons, Gauge Bosons and Higgs Boson.\n\nBeyond\u00a0Standard Particle Model\n\nThe standard Particle model of Quantum mechanics is firmly set in the arena of special relativity, where the space-time background is flat. Defining particles in a fixed curved background space-time is not yet well-understood (except in some special cases).\n\n\ud83d\udc49 Which year are YOU targeting for success in the IAS/IPS/IFS Exam? \ud83d\ude80\n\n(1) \u21d2 UPSC 2025: Prelims cum Mains\n\n(2) \u21d2 UPSC 2026: Prelims cum Mains\n\n(3) \u21d2 UPSC 2027 Prelims cum Mains\n\nTip: Know more about ClearIAS Courses (Online/Offline)\n\nAlso, the proposed but not yet discovered particle Gravition, responsible for Gravitational force, does not come under the scope of Standard Particle Model.\n\nQuantum Field Theory (QFT)\n\nStatistical Mechanics at quantum level with many degrees of freedom:\u00a0When both quantum mechanics and classical mechanics cannot apply, such as at the quantum level with many degrees of freedom, Quantum Field Theory (QFT) becomes applicable. QFT deals with small distances and large speeds with many degrees of freedom as well as the possibility of any change in the number of particles throughout the interaction. The scheme of Quantum Field Theory is that fermions interact by exchanging bosons. We will see more about Fermions and Bosons later.\n\nTo deal with large degrees of freedom at the macroscopic level, statistical mechanics becomes valid. Statistical mechanics explores the large number of particles and their interactions as a whole in everyday life. Statistical mechanics is mainly used in thermodynamics.\n\nAlso read: Supercomputers: Everything you need to know about\n\nNon Quantum Relativistic Mechanics vs Relativistic Quantum Mechanics vs Quantum Gravity\n\nIn physics, relativistic mechanics refers to mechanics compatible with special relativity (SR) and general relativity (GR). It provides a non-quantum mechanical description of a system of particles, or of a fluid, in cases where the velocities of moving objects are comparable to the speed of light c. As a result, classical mechanics is extended correctly to particles traveling at high velocities and energies, and provides a consistent inclusion of electromagnetism with the mechanics of particles. This was not possible in Galilean relativity, where it would be permitted for particles and light to travel at any speed, including faster than light. The foundations of relativistic mechanics are the postulates of special relativity and general relativity. The unification of SR with quantum mechanics is relativistic quantum mechanics, while attempts for that of GR is quantum gravity, an unsolved problem in physics.",

These distinctions play a fundamental role in understanding the behavior of particles in the quantum world.\n\nFermions: Characteristics and Examples\n\nAll fermions have half-integer multiple spins (ie 1/2, 3/2, 5/2\u2026).\n\n\ud83d\udc49 Which year are YOU targeting for success in the IAS/IPS/IFS Exam? \ud83d\ude80\n\n(1) \u21d2 UPSC 2025: Prelims cum Mains\n\n(2) \u21d2 UPSC 2026: Prelims cum Mains\n\n(3) \u21d2 UPSC 2027 Prelims cum Mains\n\nTip: Know more about ClearIAS Courses (Online/Offline)\n\nFermions are subject to the Pauli Exclusion Principle which states that no particle can exist in the same state in the same place at the same time. Thus Fermions are solitary. Only one Fermion may occupy any quantum state \u2013 the Fermionic solitariness of electrons is responsible for the structure of molecular matter (in fact for all \u2018structure\u2019 in the universe).\n\nThe degeneracy pressure that stabilizes white dwarf and neutron stars is a result of fermions resisting further compression towards each other. Fermions obey Fermi\u2013Dirac statistics. Fermions are usually associated with matter while Bosons are the force carriers.\n\nExamples of Fermions: Leptons (Electrons, Neutrinos, etc), Quarks (Up, Down, etc.), Baryons (Protons, Netrons, etc.)\n\nNB: The difference between quarks and leptons is that quarks have a color charge (and therefore interact with the strong force) and leptons do not. This means that gluons will react with quarks but not with leptons.\nNB: Quarks are always accompanied by gluons, and are always in sets where their total color charge equals zero. Quarks are what make up composite particles like hadrons (heavy) and mesons (medium).\nBosons: Characteristics and Examples\n\nAll bosons have either zero spin or an even integer spin.\u00a0\u00a0Bosons are gregarious. Bosons may occupy the same quantum state as other bosons, for example in the case of laser light which is formed of coherent, overlapping photons.\n\nThe more bosons there are in a state the more likely that another boson will join that state (Bose condensation). Fermions are usually associated with matter while Bosons are the force carriers.\n\nExamples of bosons include fundamental particles such as photons, gluons, and W and Z bosons (the four force-carrying gauge bosons of the Standard Model), the Higgs boson, and the still-theoretical graviton of quantum gravity; composite particles (e.g. mesons and stable nuclei of even mass number such as deuterium (with one proton and one neutron, mass number = 2), helium-4, or lead-208); and some quasiparticles (e.g. Cooper pairs, plasmons, and phonons).\n\nNB: The name boson was coined by Paul Dirac to commemorate the contribution of the Indian physicist Satyendra Nath Bose in developing, with Einstein, Bose\u2013Einstein statistics\u2014which theorizes the characteristics of elementary particles.\nNB: The graviton (G) is a hypothetical elementary particle not incorporated in the Standard Model. If it exists, a graviton must be a boson, and could conceivably be a gauge boson. (Elementary Boson). Update \u2013 scientists recently discovered Gravitational waves.\nNB: Composite bosons are important in superfluidity and other applications of Bose\u2013Einstein condensates.\nSteen Ingemann on Fermions and Bosons\n\nThe electrons belong to the class of elementary particles called leptons. The leptons and quarks together constitute the class called fermions. According to the Standard Model all mass consists of fermions. Whether the fermions combine to form a table, a star, a human body, a flower or do not combine at all depend on the elementary forces \u2013 the electromagnetic, the gravitational, the weak and the strong forces. According to the Standard Model all force is mediated by exchange of (gauge) bosons. The electromagnetic force is mediated by exchange of photons, the strong force by exchange of gluons while the weak force is mediated by exchange of W and Z bosons.\n\n\u2013 Steen Ingemann\n\nComposite Particles\n\nMesons are intermediate mass particles that are made up of a quark-antiquark pair. They are bosons. Three quark combinations are called baryons. Baryons are fermions, ie they have spins like 1/2, 3/2 ,etc.\n\nComposite particles like Mesons and Baryons come under a large umbrella called Hardrons. Hadrons are particles that interact by strong interaction. This general classification includes mesons and baryons but specifically excludes leptons, which do not interact by strong force.

The weak force causes Beta-decay ie. the conversion of a neutron into a proton, an electron, and an antineutrino.\n\nElectromagnetic Force\n\nThe electromagnetic force causes electric and magnetic effects such as the repulsion between electrical charges or the interaction of bar magnets. It is long-ranged but much weaker than the strong force. It can be attractive or repulsive and acts only between pieces of matter carrying an electrical charge.

It is responsible for holding the nuclei of atoms together. It is basically attractive but can be effectively repulsive in some circumstances. The strong force is \u2018carried\u2019 by particles called gluons; that is, when two particles interact through the strong force, they do so by exchanging gluons. Thus, the quarks inside of the protons and neutrons are bound together by the exchange of the strong nuclear force.\n\nNote:\u00a0 While they are close together the quarks experience little force, but as they separate the force between them grows rapidly, pulling them back together. To separate two quarks completely would require far more energy than any possible particle accelerator could provide.\n\nElectroweak Theory and Grand Unification Theories (GUT)\n\nThere is speculation, that In the very early Universe when temperatures were very high (the Planck Scale) all four forces were unified into a single force. Then, as the temperature dropped, gravitation separated first and then the other 3 forces separated. Even then, the weak, electromagnetic, and strong forces were unified into a single force. When the temperature dropped these forces got separated from each other, with the strong force separating first and then at a still lower temperature the electromagnetic and weak forces separating to leave us with the 4 distinct forces that we see in our present Universe. The process of the forces separating from each other is called spontaneous symmetry breaking.\n\nThe weak and electromagnetic interactions have been unified under the Standard Electroweak Theory, or sometimes just the Standard Model. (Glashow, Weinberg, and Salaam were awarded the Nobel Prize for this in 1979).

It cannot be observed directly through telescopes.\nIts existence is inferred from its gravitational effects on visible matter and its impact on the large-scale structure of the universe, such as galaxies and galaxy clusters.\nDark Matter is thought to make up about 27% of the universe\u2019s total mass-energy content. It is considered to be responsible for the observed rotational velocities of galaxies and other phenomena that cannot be explained by visible matter alone.\n\nDark Energy:\u00a0Supernovae observations showed that the expansion of the Universe, rather than slowing, is accelerating.\n\nSomething, not like matter and not like ordinary energy, is pushing the galaxies apart. This \u201cstuff\u201d has been dubbed dark energy, but to give it a name is not to understand it.\nWhether dark energy is a type of dynamical fluid, heretofore unknown to physics, or whether it is a property of the vacuum of space, or whether it is some modification to general relativity is not yet known.\nWhy do scientists think there is dark matter or energy?\n\nBecause scientists\u00a0see its gravitational influence on the rest of the Universe.\u00a0As one simple example of the evidence for dark matter, the velocity of rotation for spiral galaxies depends on the amount of mass contained in them.\n\nThe outer parts of our spiral galaxy, the Milky Way, are rotating much too fast to be consistent with the amount of matter that we can detect; in fact, the data indicates that there must be about 10 times as much matter as we can see distributed in some diffuse halo of our galaxy to account for its rotation.\n\nDark matter reacts only to gravity and weak atomic force!\n\nDark matter only interacts by way of gravity and the weak atomic force. \u00a0Dark matter does not interact via either the strong atomic force or electromagnetism hence dark matter cannot be seen and is hard to detect.\n\nAntimatter and anti-energy\n\n\u2018Anti\u2019 means opposite. So antimatter has some properties opposite to the usual matter. For example, the electron has as its antiparticle the antielectron. The electron and the antielectron have the same masses, but they have exactly opposite electrical charges.\n\nAntimatter consists of particles that are similar to ordinary matter particles but have opposite charges. For example, the antiparticle of an electron is a positron, which has a positive charge.\nWhen a particle and its corresponding antiparticle collide, they annihilate each other, releasing energy in the form of gamma rays. This annihilation process is used in positron emission tomography (PET) scans in medical imaging.\nWhile antimatter is produced in particle accelerators and observed in high-energy cosmic events, it is rare in the universe compared to ordinary matter.\n\nPS: When an electron meets an antielectron, the two annihilate and produce a burst of light having the energy corresponding to the masses of the two particles.\n\nAnti-matter behaves like normal matter under gravity but is the opposite concerning the other three forces!\n\nScientists assume that antimatter behaves as normal matter under gravity, though the truth is that they have never seen a large enough mass of it to know for certain it behaves the same. But anti-matter reacts just opposite to the other three forces than the reaction produced by normal matter.\n\nNegative Matter and Negative Energy\n\nNegative matter is a hypothetical type of matter that if it exists will have negative mass and negative energy. \u00a0It will in essence have a negative gravitational charge and repel normal matter. \u00a0Yet it will interact just like any other matter in every other way.\n\nNegative Matter, often referred to as Exotic Matter, is a theoretical concept that goes beyond our current understanding of matter and energy.\nIt is often associated with negative mass, where the gravitational attraction of negative matter would be repulsive rather than attractive. This leads to speculation about the possibility of \u201cexotic\u201d phenomena like warp drives for faster-than-light travel, although such ideas remain highly speculative and face significant theoretical and practical challenges.\nNegative Matter has not been observed or produced, and its existence is not supported by current scientific evidence.\n\nPS: Hope you remember that matter and anti-matter will attract each other resulting in annihilation. But matter and negative matter will repel each other under gravity. The action of negative matter under the other three forces is not hypothesized yet.\n\nBarynoic Matter vs Non Baryonic Matter\n\nOrdinary matter and anti-matter are known as baryonic matter. Dark matter is known as non-baryonic matter.\n\nOrdinary Matter is just 4.9% of the universe\n\nAccording to the Planck mission team, and based on the standard model of cosmology, the total mass\u2013energy of the known universe contains 4.9% ordinary matter, 26.8% dark matter, and 68.3% dark energy.\n\nThus, dark matter is estimated to constitute 84.5% of the total matter in the universe, while dark energy plus dark matter constitutes 95.1% of the total content of the universe. In short, we are unsure about what\u2019s there in 95% of the universe!\n\nPS:\u00a0\u00a0If the statistics are true, then the matter that we are made of (baryonic matter) is but a small impurity compared to the dominant matter in the universe (non-baryonic matter). As someone has put it, \u201cNot only are we not the center of the Universe, we aren\u2019t even made of the right stuff!\u201d\n\nWhy Dark Matter is not Antimatter?\n\nIf the dark matter out there was antimatter, we would expect it to annihilate with matter whenever it meets up with it, releasing bursts of energy primarily in the form of light. We see no evidence in careful observations for that, which leads most scientists to believe that whatever the dark matter is, it is not antimatter.\n\nDark Matter is a form of matter that does not emit light and is inferred from its gravitational effects, Antimatter consists of particles with opposite charges to ordinary matter particles, and Negative Matter is a theoretical concept that goes beyond our current understanding of matter and energy.\n\nEach concept plays a distinct role in our exploration of the universe, from understanding the behavior of galaxies to advancing theoretical ideas about exotic phenomena.\n\nReferences:\n\nAnti Matter.\nPhysics beyond the Standard Model.\nScience20.\nParticle Adventure.",

And because it does, many elementary particles have mass. Remember that the electric field has zero average value. Discovery of Higgs field\u00a0would explain why some fundamental particles have mass when the symmetries controlling their interactions should require them to be massless.

These are mostly too small to be detected, so we need to look for waves that begin with massive events like the Big Bang, the collapse of stars and the collision of black holes.\n\nDiscovery of Gravitational Waves\n\nResearchers working with the recently upgraded Laser Interferometer Gravitational-Wave Observatory (LIGO) \u2014 a set of two identical observatories located in Washington and Louisiana \u2014 revealed that they have directly seen the ripples in space-time, which are known as gravitational waves, created by two black holes that collided 1.3 billion years ago.\n\nWhat does that mean? Two black holes collides some 1300,000,000 years ago creating gravitational waves. Our scientists just discovered the waves of the past event. The scope? Massive. Gravitational waves can tell a lot about the history of our universe.\n\nThis discovery came 100 years after Einstein first theorized gravitational waves. The waves were detected on Sept. 14, 2015, scientists said. Since then, scientists have been evaluating their findings to make sure they are accurate.

The fibres are pulled through a heated steel die to mould it into the required shape after being saturated with resin and drawn through.\nFilament winding: This method is mostly used to make parts for tanks and pipes. To create the appropriate shape, long filaments of fibre that have been wet with resin are twisted around a mould.\nHand Lamination: Hand lamination is a low-cost technology used to create complex forms like the hull of a boat and an airplane\u2019s fuselage. Over a mould, the fibres are arranged in a fabric, which is then wet with resin.\nVacuum Infusion: Vacuum infusion is used to create FRP components that are incredibly light. To increase resin penetration into the fibre cloth, FRP components with resin and fibre are placed within vacuum bags.\nProperties of FRP Composites\n\nThe fibre component of a FRP composite typically contributes the majority of the material\u2019s strength. The matrix\u2019s job is to contain the fibres and distribute forces among them. For instance, glass fibre, which often comes in the form of woven cloth or fibre mats, is stronger than steel for its weight.

However, their extraction is very difficult.\n\nAlso read: Superconductivity\n\nWhy are they called rare earth minerals?\nThey are so-called \u2018rare earth\u2019 because they were originally isolated in the 18th and 19th centuries as oxides from \u2018rare minerals\u2019. Further, technologically it was difficult to extract them from their oxide forms until the 20th century. Therefore, the name they got in the 18th century is still stuck with them.\nThey occur in many minerals but typically in concentrations too low to be refined economically.\nWhat is the significance of REE?\nThey have distinctive electrical, metallurgical, catalytic, nuclear, magnetic, and luminescent properties.\nThey are strategically very important due to their use of emerging and diverse technologies that cater to the needs of current society.\nIts usage ranges from daily use (e.g., lighter flints, glass polishing mediums, car alternators) to high-end technology (lasers, magnets, batteries, fiber-optic telecommunication cables).\nEven futuristic technologies need these REMs (For example high-temperature superconductivity, safe storage and transport of hydrogen for a post-hydrocarbon economy, environmental global warming, and energy efficiency issues).\nThe global demand for REMs has increased significantly in line with their expansion into high-end technology, environment, and economic areas.\nThey are extremely important for many modern technologies, including consumer electronics, computers, and networks, communications, clean energy, advanced transportation, health care, environmental mitigation, national defense, etc.\nDue to their unique magnetic, luminescent, and electrochemical properties, they help technologies perform with reduced weight, reduced emissions, and energy consumption; therefore giving them greater efficiency, performance, miniaturization, speed, durability, and thermal stability.\n\nAlso read: Steel Industry in India\n\n\ud83d\udc49 Which year are YOU targeting for success in the IAS/IPS/IFS Exam? \ud83d\ude80\n\n(1) \u21d2 UPSC 2025: Prelims cum Mains\n\n(2) \u21d2 UPSC 2026: Prelims cum Mains\n\n(3) \u21d2 UPSC 2027 Prelims cum Mains\n\nTip: Know more about ClearIAS Courses (Online/Offline)\n\nWhat are the uses of Rare Earth Metals (REMs) in Defense?\n\nUsage of Rare Earth Elements (REE) in Emerging technologies\n\nThey are being used in anything and everything that comes out as an innovative product nowadays for example from I-phones to I-TV and many other devices that people use every day such as computer memory, DVDs, rechargeable batteries, cell phones, catalytic converters, magnets, fluorescent lighting and much more.\nThese are used for air pollution control, illuminated screens on electronic devices, and the polishing of optical-quality glass.\nWhat is a rare earth dilemma?\n\nThe extraction of REMs is one of the most environmentally negative and toxic generating of all mining practices.\n\nDisproportionate rare earth mining has resulted in landslides, clogged rivers, environmental pollution emergencies, and even major accidents and disasters, causing great damage to people\u2019s safety and health and the ecological environment.\nChina produces tens of millions of tons of wastewater every year while extracting rare earth minerals.\n\nTherefore, it\u2019s a dilemma that is we really having a better lifestyle using these materials in emerging technologies or are we polluting our environment in the process too much?\n\nGlobal Uses and Production of Rare Earth Elements (REE)\n\n\n\n\nAnalysis of supply-demand of REE\nCurrently, China has control over 94% of producing and mining REMs and further china has very high natural reserves for these. As per some recent reports, China is even buying these reserves in other countries and regions to have a monopoly over production for a very long time. Due to these very reasons, it has become a very critical metal for India since India does not have enough resources and it further suffers technological constraints in mining its reserves of REEs.\nA study, conducted by the think-tank Council on Energy Environment and Water, identifies 12 minerals out of 49 that were evaluated as \u2018most critical\u2019 for India\u2019s manufacturing sector by 2030. These are beryllium, chromium, germanium, limestone, niobium, graphite, rare earth, rhenium, strontium, tantalum, and zirconium. Other minerals like limestone and graphite, while currently abundantly available in India, are deemed \u2018critical\u2019 because extractable resources could be scarce in the future.\nFor others, the report says, India is 100 percent import-dependent for seven out of 12 identified critical minerals and does not have any declared resources for them, except light rare earth (found along with monazite sands) and beryllium.\nWhat is the future use of Rare Earth Metals?\nThe global demand for automobiles, consumer electronics, energy-efficient lighting, and catalysts is expected to rise rapidly over the next decade. REMs are critical raw materials for the future of these technologies/industries.\nRare earth magnet demand is expected to increase due to the rise in demand for rechargeable batteries.\nNew developments in medical technology are expected to increase the use of surgical lasers, magnetic resonance imaging, and positron emission tomography scintillation detectors.\nFuture military and navy arsenals may utilize REMs for better efficiency and handling.\n\nRead: Critical Minerals for India\n\nProbable UPSC Questions\n\nMains:\n\nWhat are Rare earth metals?

They cannot reproduce and carry on metabolic processes without a host cell.\nIt is an acellular organism that is 10 to 100 times smaller than bacteria, about 20-300 nm in size.\nThey can infect a variety of living organisms, including bacteria, plants, and animals.\nThe infective, extracellular (outside the cell) form of a virus is called the\u00a0virion.\nIt is a small collection of genetic code (either DNA or RNA) surrounded by a protein coat.\nThey lack metabolic machinery of their own to generate energy or synthesize proteins. They can reproduce only within a living cell \u2013 hence they are obligate intracellular parasites. They take over the functions of the host cell hence causing infection.\nThey are inactive outside the host (crystallized form) and active inside.

This is often done using techniques such as recombinant DNA technology and gene editing (e.g., CRISPR-Cas9).\n\nTypes of Traits in GM Crops:\n\nPest Resistance: Some GM crops are engineered to produce proteins that are toxic to specific insect pests. For example, Bt cotton produces a protein from the bacterium Bacillus thuringiensis that kills certain insects.\nHerbicide Tolerance: Certain GM crops can withstand the application of specific herbicides, allowing for more effective weed control while reducing the need for other, potentially more harmful herbicides.\nDisease Resistance: Genetic modification can confer resistance to plant diseases, reducing crop losses.\nImproved Nutritional Content: Some GM crops have been developed to have higher nutritional value, such as \u201cGolden Rice,\u201d which contains higher levels of beta-carotene (a precursor of vitamin A).\nBenefits of GM Crops\nIncreased Crop Yields: GM crops can be engineered for improved pest resistance and higher yields, which can help address food security concerns.\nReduced Use of Pesticides: Pest-resistant GM crops can reduce the need for chemical pesticides, leading to lower environmental impact and potential health benefits for farmers.\nEnhanced Nutritional Content: GM crops can be designed to provide better nutrition, potentially addressing nutrient deficiencies in certain populations.\nExtended Shelf Life: Some GM crops have been modified to resist spoilage, resulting in longer shelf life for products like tomatoes.\nConcerns regarding Genetically Modified Crops\n\nMany believe\u00a0that food on the market derived from GM crops poses no greater risk to human health than conventional food. However, opponents have objected to GM crops on several grounds, including environmental concerns, the safety of GM foods, the business interests behind GM crops, intellectual property laws, etc.\n\nArguments in favor of GM Crops\n\nThe proponents argue that GM technologies have been around for about 15 years and they have been in use across the world including in countries such as Brazil and China.\n\nDuring a visit to India in March 2005, Norman Borlaug \u2013 widely regarded as the father of the Green Revolution \u2013 supported producing genetically modified (GM) food to eradicate hunger from the world. \u201cIt is better to die eating GM food instead of dying of hunger,\u201d said the Nobel laureate, who passed away in 2009.\n\nFormer prime minister, Manmohan Singh, saw biotechnology as key to food security and warned against succumbing to \u201cunscientific prejudices\u201d.\n\u201cThe concerns over their (GM crops) perceived risks should be addressed by following internationally accepted procedures for assessing safety parameters. ICAR, which is involved in developing useful products and technologies in this field, must contribute to the public discourse and provide clarity on this sensitive issue,\u201d \u2013 President Pranab Mukherjee.\nIndian intelligence agency names anti-GM groups such as Greenpeace India and Gene Campaign as one of the many \u201canti-national\u201d foreign-funded NGOs hampering India\u2019s economic progress.\nAgriculture scientists from research institutions including IARI, ICAR, and various Universities demanding \u201cfield trials\u201d for GM crops, arguing that \u201cconfined field trials are essential for the evaluation of productivity performance as well as food and environmental safety assessment\u201d.\nA group of prominent scientists had met under the \u2018father of green revolution\u2018 MS Swaminathan at the National Academy of Agricultural Sciences ( NASA) and issued a 15-point resolution in favor of GM crops.\n\u201cA brinjal crop normally requires up to 30 sprays of insecticides. This goes into human consumption indirectly. If we grow and consume Bt brinjal, we will consume some of the genes that have been built into the seeds to make the crop pest- and herbicide-resistant. Ultimately, we have to see which of the two is less harmful for consumption\u201d \u2013 S.S. Gosal, Director of Research, Punjab Agriculture University.\nArguments against Genetically Modified Crops\n\nOrganizations such as Greenpeace argue that GM crops don\u2019t yield better results, but push the farmers into debt.\n\nThey lose their sovereign right over seeds as they are forced to buy GM seeds and technologies from multinational corporations.\n\nThe increasing incidence of suicide by farmers cultivating Bt cotton is cited as an example of the perils of GM crops in a country such as India.\n\nBesides the suspect merits of GM crops, what the opponents also say is that once they are released into the environment, it\u2019s irreversible.\n\nEnvironmental Impact: Critics argue that GM crops may have unintended ecological consequences, such as harm to non-target organisms, development of resistant pests, or disruption of local ecosystems.\nHuman Health: There are concerns about the safety of consuming GM foods, although the scientific consensus is that approved GM crops are safe for human consumption.\nEconomic and Socio-cultural Concerns: Some worry about the economic control of GM crop technologies by a few large corporations and the potential displacement of traditional agricultural practices.\nRegulatory Mechanisms in India\n\nThe top biotech regulator in India is the Genetic Engineering Appraisal Committee (GEAC). The committee functions as a statutory body under the Environment Protection Act 1986 of the Ministry of Environment & Forests (MoEF).\n\nIt was earlier known as the Genetic Engineering Approval Committee. Under the EPA 1986 \u201cRules for Manufacture, Use, Import, Export, and Storage of Hazardous Microorganisms/Genetically Engineered Organisms or Cells 1989\u201d, GEAC is responsible for granting permits to conduct experimental and large-scale open field trials and also approving commercial release of biotech crops.\nThe Rules of 1989 also define five competent authorities i.e. the Institutional Biosafety Committees (IBSC), Review Committee of Genetic Manipulation (RCGM), Genetic Engineering Approval Committee (GEAC), State Biotechnology Coordination Committee (SBCC), and District Level Committee (DLC) for handling of various aspects of the rules.\n\nPS: A Biotechnology Regulatory Authority was proposed, but the bill lapsed due to the dissolution of 15th Loksabha.\n\nGenetic Engineering Appraisal Committee (GEAC)\nThe Committee shall function as a Statutory Body under the Ministry of Environment & Forests for approval of activities involving large-scale use of hazardous living microorganisms and recombinants in research and industrial production from the environmental angle as per the provisions of rules 1989.\nThe Committee shall also be responsible for approval of proposals relating to the release of genetically engineered organisms and products into the environment including experimental field trials as per the provisions of Rules, 1989.\nThe Committee shall be responsible for approval of proposals involving the use of living-modified organisms falling in the risk category Ill and above in the manufacture/import of recombinant Pharma products or where the end product of the recombinant Pharma products per se is a living modified organism.\nThe Committee may co-opt other members/experts to the GEAC by the provisions of Section 4, para 3 of the Rules, 1989 as necessary.\nThe Committee may also appoint subgroups/sub-committees/expert committees to undertake specific activities related to compliance with biosafety.\nOne-third of the members of the GEAC will constitute the quorum for convening the meeting.\nThe members of the GEAC will be required to sign a \u2018Statement of Declaration of Independence\u2019 and \u2018Statement of Confidentiality\u2019 (as per the enclosed proforma).\nThe Committee shall function for three years from the date of issue of this notification.\nWith the approval of the Chairman GEAC, if required, representatives of other Ministries and other experts may be invited as \u2018Special Invitees\u2019 to participate in the meeting of the GEAC depending on the issues to be discussed.\n\nMajor companies interested in Genetically Modified crops in India include Monsanto India, Mahyco, and BASF. The industry body \u2014 Association of Biotech Led Enterprises- Agriculture Group (ABLE-AG) wants a progressive push to the march of GM technology in India.\n\nAlso read:\u00a0Biosafety in India\n\nGenetically Modified Crops in India\n\nThe country has yet to approve commercial cultivation of a GM food crop. The only genetically modified cash crop under commercial cultivation in India is cotton.\n\nBt Cotton\n\nFor the time being, the only genetically modified crop that is under cultivation in India is Bt cotton which is grown over 10.8 million hectares. Bt cotton was first used in India in 2002.\n\nBt Brinjal\n\nThe GEAC \u00a0in 2007, recommended the commercial release of Bt Brinjal, which was developed by Mahyco (Maharashtra Hybrid Seeds Company) in collaboration with the Dharward University of Agricultural Sciences and the Tamil Nadu Agricultural University. However, the initiative was blocked in 2010.\n\nGM-mustard\n\nDhara Mustard Hybrid-11 or DMH-11 is a genetically modified variety of mustard developed by the Delhi University\u2019s Centre for Genetic Manipulation of Crop Plants. The researchers at Delhi University have created a hybridized mustard DMH-11 using \u201cbarnase/barnstar\u201d technology for genetic modification. It is a Herbicide Tolerant (HT) crop. If approved by the Centre, this will be the second GM crop, after Bt Cotton and the first transgenic food crop to be allowed for cultivation in the country.\n\nControversies and Moratoriums associated with GM Crops in India \u2013 Timeline\n2002 \u2013 Bt cotton was introduced in India.\n2006 \u2013 Activists filed a PIL against GM crops in the Supreme Court.\n2010 \u2013 The then environmental minister Jairam Ramesh blocked the release of Bt Brinjal until further notice\u00a0owing to a lack of consensus among scientists and opposition from brinjal-growing states. No objection certificates from states were made mandatory for field trials.\n2012 \u2013 The Parliamentary Standing Committee on Agriculture, in its 37th report, asked for an end to all GM field trials in the country.\n2013 July \u2013 New crop trials have been effectively on hold since late 2012 after a Supreme Court-appointed expert panel recommended suspension for 10 years until regulatory and monitoring systems could be strengthened. Though the SC panel suggested a moratorium on GM trails, there was no official verdict from the Supreme Court on this issue.\n2013 July \u2013 Environment minister Jayanthi Natarajan put on hold all trials following SC panel suggestions.\n2014 \u2013 Her successor, Veerappa Moili cleared the way for trials. (NB: Two of Manmohan Singh\u2019s environment ministers had stalled GM trials earlier, but Veerappa Moily took an opposite stand and the process of approving the one-acre field trials restarted.)\n2014 March \u2013 GEAC (UPA government) approved field trials for 11 crops, including maize, rice, sorghum, wheat, groundnut, and cotton.\n2014 July \u2013 21 New varieties of genetically modified (GM) crops such as rice, wheat, maize, and cotton have been approved for field trials by the NDA government in July 2014. The Genetic Engineering Appraisal Committee (GEAC) \u2014 consisting mostly of biotechnology supporters \u2014 rejected just one out of the 28 proposals up for consideration. Six proposals were rejected for want of more information.\n2016: GEAC gave a green signal to GM Mustard for a field trial, but SC stayed the order and sought public opinion on the same.\n\nThere is an array of crops \u2014 brinjal, tomato, maize, chickpea \u2014 in various stages of trials that employ transgenic technology. However, cotton remains the only transgenic crop that is being commercially cultivated in India.\n\nAlso read:\u00a0Biofortification;\u00a0Genetically Modified Mosquitoes",

    "[CONTENT] #45": "Ebola virus disease (EVD), formerly known as Ebola haemorrhagic fever, is a severe, often fatal illness in humans.\n\nThe Ebola virus is transmitted to people from wild animals and spreads in the human population through human-to-human transmission. The Ebola virus causes an acute, serious illness which is often fatal if untreated. There are currently no licensed Ebola vaccines but 2 potential candidates are undergoing evaluation.\n\nHistory of Ebola: Ebola virus disease (EVD) first appeared in 1976 in 2 simultaneous outbreaks, one in Nzara, Sudan, and the other in Yambuku, Democratic Republic of Congo. The Yambuku outbreak occurred in a village near the Ebola River, from which the disease takes its name. The current outbreak in West Africa is the largest and most complex Ebola outbreak since the Ebola virus was first discovered in 1976. The first cases were notified in March 2014. The most severely affected countries, Guinea, Sierra Leone and Liberia have very weak health systems, lacking human and infrastructural resources, having only recently emerged from long periods of conflict and instability.\n\nTable of Contents\n\nEbola Virus Strains\nTransmission of Ebola\nSymptoms of Ebola Virus Disease\nEbola Virus Disease \u2013 A Challenge to India\nMeasures\nEbola Virus Strains\n\nThere are 5 species of Ebola Virus (belonging to the virus family Filoviridae) that have been identified: Zaire, Bundibugyo, Sudan, Reston and Ta\u00ef Forest. The first 3, Bundibugyo ebolavirus, Zaire ebolavirus, and Sudan ebolavirus have been associated with large outbreaks in Africa. The virus causing the 2014 West African outbreak belongs to the Zaire species.\n\nThe Ebola virus is a member of the RNA virus known as \u2018Filoviriade\u2019.\nThe Ebola virus is the world\u2019s third deadliest infectious disease after HIV.\nThe new strain of Ebola is called Ebola Tai(WHO).\nTransmission of Ebola\n\nIt is thought that fruit bats of the Pteropodidae family are natural Ebola virus hosts. Ebola is introduced into the human population through close contact with the blood, secretions, organs or other bodily fluids of infected animals such as chimpanzees, gorillas, fruit bats, monkeys, forest antelope and porcupines found ill or dead or in the rainforest.\n\nEbola then spreads through human-to-human transmission via direct contact (through broken skin or mucous membranes) with the blood, secretions, organs or other bodily fluids of infected people, and with surfaces and materials (e.g. bedding, clothing) contaminated with these fluids.\n\nSymptoms of Ebola Virus Disease\n\n\ud83d\udc49 Which year are YOU targeting for success in the IAS/IPS/IFS Exam? \ud83d\ude80\n\n(1) \u21d2 UPSC 2025: Prelims cum Mains\n\n(2) \u21d2 UPSC 2026: Prelims cum Mains\n\n(3) \u21d2 UPSC 2027 Prelims cum Mains\n\nTip: Know more about ClearIAS Courses (Online/Offline)\n\nThe Ebola virus causes hemorrhagic fever which begins it\u2019s effect in 4 to 10 days after the infection. Symptoms are such as fever, chills, loss of appetite, headache etc. As the disease advances more symptoms such as vomiting, sore throat, diarrhea, chest pain and bleeding may occur. Incubation period for this virus is from two to twenty one days. People may be exposed to the Ebola virus from direct contact with the blood and secretions of infected person. It attacks every part of the human body and disrupts immune system which finally may lead to death.\n\nEbola Virus Disease \u2013 A Challenge to India\n\nEbola which is native of African continent is spreading to many other countries through the people who are affected by this virus. When affected people from countries like Guinea, Liberia, Sierra Leone moved to other countries, the virus spread. There was strict ban from the side of many countries on natives from West African nations. But the disease has already spread to non-Africans and the scrutiny became tough. All the countries near by Africa are scrutinizing in their respective airports. Medical checkup is done to the passengers from Africa. But unfortunately they may not be recognized as infected because the virus takes almost 21 days to incubate. So even if the person is affected he is not able to be identified.\n\nIndia is also taking measures so\u00a0that the virus should not be spread to the country. But there are thousands of Indians who are working in Ebola infected areas in Africa. If they return to their homeland \u2013 India \u2013 then chances of spreading of the virus is there. It\u2019s really a big challenge to India to tackle the virus. Although the government is making efforts to screen the people at international airports, the potential threat is still there. Dense population and poor sanitation are the main problems to tackle Ebola in India. Health care services in India are abysmal.\n\nMeasures\nReducing the risk of wildlife-to-human transmission.\nReducing the risk of human-to-human transmission.\nOutbreak containment measures.\n\nCurrently there is no licensed vaccine to treat the disease. Healthcare workers are among the biggest segment of affected people. People who are affected by Ebola are not revealing because of the fear of isolation. Suggested measures to tackle Ebola include hospitals with\u00a0isolation wards and improved surveillance. Health care workers must be trained to handle Ebola patients. Strict screening must be done at airports not only to the people who come from African countries but also to everyone as the virus has already spread to other countries. People who are identified with the symptoms of Ebola virus disease must be immediately treated by the medical personnel and should be strictly monitored from time to time. Government should provide awareness to the people about the virus so that people can be cautious and can go for medical checkup if symptoms appear.\n\nName of the author: K.B.D SRIDEVI.

It is also known as antibiotic resistance.\n\nThe WHO defines antimicrobial resistance as a microorganism\u2019s resistance to an antimicrobial drug that was once able to treat an infection by that microorganism.\n\nThe resistance to antimicrobials is a natural biological phenomenon.\n\n\ud83d\udc49 Which year are YOU targeting for success in the IAS/IPS/IFS Exam? \ud83d\ude80\n\n(1) \u21d2 UPSC 2025: Prelims cum Mains\n\n(2) \u21d2 UPSC 2026: Prelims cum Mains\n\n(3) \u21d2 UPSC 2027 Prelims cum Mains\n\nTip: Know more about ClearIAS Courses (Online/Offline)\n\nIt should be noted that it is the microbe that will become resistant to antibiotics and not the person (patient).\n\nA person cannot become resistant to antibiotics because the resistance is a property of the microbe, and not by a person or other organism infected by a microbe.\n\nReasons for Anti-Microbial Resistance\n\nThe main reasons for the antimicrobial resistance are as follows:\n\nThe natural resistance in certain types of bacteria.\nThe genetic mutation.\nBy one species acquiring resistance from another.\nResistance can appear spontaneously because of random mutations, or by more commonly following gradual buildup over time, and because of misuse of antibiotics or antimicrobials.\nThe resistance is generally slow to reverse or is irreversible. This urges that the interventions to stop the development of resistance should be implemented early before resistance becomes a problem.\nThe Facts and Figures related to Anti-Microbial Resistance (AMR)\nNearly 2 lakh people die every year from multi-drug and extremely drug-resistant TB.\nIn India, 60,000 newborns die each year of Antibiotic-Resistant Neonatal Infections.\nIn the US, over 2 million infections are caused by bacteria resistant to at least first-line antibiotic treatments, costing the US health system $20 billion each year.\nAround 70 percentage of diarrhoeal illnesses are caused by viral infections, against which antibiotics are ineffective. But for diarrhoea treatment antibiotics are used frequently.\nNearly 500 million antibiotic courses are used each year to treat diarrhoea in India, Indonesia, Nigeria and Brazil. Universal access to improved water and sanitation could reduce this by 60 percentage.\nMyths and Reality regarding Anti-Microbial Resistance\nMyth #1: Antibiotic resistance happens when the human body becomes resistant to antibiotics.\nReality:\u00a0In fact bacteria\u2014not humans or animals\u2014become resistant to antibiotics and their spread causes hard-to-treat infections.\nMyth #2: Individuals are not at risk of a drug-resistant infection if they personally take their antibiotics as prescribed or do not take antibiotics at all.\nReality: Anyone, of any age, in any country, can get an antibiotic-resistant infection \u2013 irrespective of their intake of antibiotics. This is because not humans but bacteria are becoming resistant.\nWhat are the reasons for the recent increase in the use of antibiotics in India?\n\nThe reasons for the sharp increase in antibiotic use are as follows:\n\nThe high disease burden.\nThe rising income.\nThe easy and cheap availability of these medicines to the public.\nThe uncontrolled sales of antibiotics.\nPoor public health infrastructure.\nLack of awareness regarding the misuse of antibiotics.\nInternational Conference on Antimicrobial Resistance\n\nIndia presided over the 68th session of the World Health assembly proceedings in Geneva (May 18-26, 2015) which adopted a Global Action Plan on AMR to prepare a blueprint with specific actions and timelines for WHO as well as member states to address the growing threat of Antimicrobial Resistance (AMR).\n\nWhat are the main aims of this International Conference on Antimicrobial Resistance?\n\nThe main aims of this conference are:\n\nTo work towards combating Antimicrobial Resistance (AMR) globally.\nTo create an awareness of the rational use of drugs and antibiotics among the patients, pharmacists, and doctors.\n\nBeing one of the world\u2019s largest consumers of antibiotics, the Indian Ministry of Health and Family Welfare, in association with the World Health Organization (WHO) Regional Office for South Asia, had conducted an International Conference on Antimicrobial Resistance.\u00a0JP Nadda (Union Health Minister) launched the logo \u201cUse with Care\u201d for antibiotics at this International Conference.\n\nThe Indian health minister also used the platform to launch the media campaign of \u2018Medicine strips with Red Line\u2019\u00a0which may help to create mass awareness against the misuse of antibiotics.\n\nWhat is a Red Line campaign?\n\nThe Union health ministry\u2019s Anti-Microbial Resistance awareness campaign urges people not to use medicines marked with a red vertical line, including antibiotics, without a doctor\u2019s prescription.\nThese medicines are called the \u2018Medicines with the Red Line\u2019.\nTo check the irrational use of antibiotics, the \u2018red line\u2019 will help the users to differentiate them from other drugs.\nThis campaign is aimed at discouraging unnecessary prescription and over-the-counter sale of antibiotics causing drug resistance for several critical diseases including TB, malaria, urinary tract infection and even HIV.\nWhat are the other government Initiatives that help to curb Anti-Microbial Resistance (AMR) in India?\n\nThe Union Health Minister of India in the International Conference on Anti-Microbial Resistance had stated that the first step in addressing the problem of AMR is to avoid the need for antibiotics at all in the first place. Improved water, vaccination, and sanitation may control inappropriate antibiotic use indirectly. The main government policies that help in this process are:\n\nThrough the Swacch Bharat program, the Government has taken active steps to improve hygiene and sanitation and reduce the environmental spread of pathogens.\nVaccination is an equally important public health measure, and through Mission Indradhanush, India has set itself an ambitious goal of increasing routine immunization coverage to 90% within just a few years.\n\nNote:\n\nIndia faces a twin challenge of overconsumption of antibiotics breeding drug-resistant bacteria while ensuring that the poor and vulnerable have easy access.\nThe lack of access or delayed access to effective antibiotics is causing more deaths in India than from drug-resistant bacteria.\nWhat are the strategies of WHO\u2019s Global Action Plan\u00a0on Anti-Microbial Resistance?\nTo improve awareness and understanding of antimicrobial resistance through effective communication, education, and training.\nTo strengthen the knowledge and evidence base through surveillance and research.\nTo reduce the incidence of infection through effective sanitation, hygiene and infection prevention measures.\nTo optimize the use of antimicrobial medicines in human and animal health.\nTo develop the economic case for sustainable investment that takes account of the needs of all countries and to increase investment in new medicines, diagnostic tools, vaccines and other interventions.\nWhat are the other solutions available to combat Antimicrobial Resistance?\nEncourage the appropriate and informed healthcare-seeking behaviour among the citizens.\nEducate patients and the general community on the appropriate use of antimicrobials and create awareness about the dangers of taking antibiotics without being prescribed.\nEducate all groups of prescribers and dispensers (including drug sellers) on the importance of appropriate antimicrobial use and containment of antimicrobial resistance.\nThe Prescription Audit may minimize the overuse and misuse of drugs, helps to plan essential drug selection and to estimate the drug need of the community and help the health administrators, policy planners, manufacturers, distributors, health professionals and various consumer groups for their decision making.\nThe regular review of health care procedures and documentation of auditing is also important in combating AMR.\nLink professional registration requirements for prescribers and dispensers to requirements for training and continuing education.\nControl and monitor pharmaceutical company promotional activities within the hospital environment and ensure that such activities have an educational benefit.\nEstablish infection control programs, based on current best practices, with the responsibility for effective management of antimicrobial resistance in hospitals and ensure that all hospitals have access to such a program.\nImproving sanitation, proper vaccination and maintaining a good and healthy lifestyle can prevent the use of antibiotics to an extent.\nConclusion\n\nAMR has emerged as the number one public health challenge faced by the world today.\n\nThrough the International Conference on Antimicrobial Resistance, India shows her willingness to work with the other Member States to achieve the common goal of Anti-Microbial Resistance (AMR) containment.\n\nIndia adopted the redline campaign when the consumption of antibiotics in India has increased sharply while the effectiveness of these drugs to treat bacterial infections has been steadily declining.\n\nIn the final reports of the Global Review on Antimicrobial Resistance, India had appreciated for Medicines with the Red Line campaign on antibiotics. The global review was commissioned by the UK Prime Minister David Cameron in 2014 and was chaired by economist Jim O\u2019Neil.\n\nIndia\u2019s idea of Medicines with the red line is now being cited as a model that can be used globally to counter the rising threat of superbugs.\n\nThe WHO Global Strategy defines the appropriate use of antimicrobials as the cost-effective use of antimicrobials that maximizes clinical therapeutic effect while minimizing both drug-related toxicity and the development of antimicrobial resistance.\n\nAny intervention to limit access by enforcing prescription-only laws unwittingly cuts off a vast majority of the population, particularly in rural areas, that lacks access to doctors.\n\nAlso read: Indian Health Sector Problems \u2013 Can the National Health Policy 2017 Make a change?\n\nArticle by Priyanka Sunil",

It has the potential to revolutionize biology, medicine, and agriculture by enabling the modification of specific genes to achieve desired outcomes. The most well-known and widely used gene editing technology is CRISPR-Cas9, but there are others as well.\n\nDNA is inserted, deleted, or replaced in the genome of a living organism using\u00a0engineered\u00a0nucleases or molecular scissors.\n\nCurrently, there are four families of engineered nucleases that are being used 1) Meganucleases, 2) Zinc finger nucleases (ZFNs), 3) Transcription activator-like effector-based nucleases (TALEN), 4) Clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats (CRISPR)-Cas system.\nThese nucleases create site-specific\u00a0double-strand breaks (DSBs) at desired locations in the genome.\nThe induced double-strand breaks are repaired through the end-joining or recombination, resulting in targeted mutations.\n\nGene editing technologies like CRISPR-Cas9 allow scientists to precisely target and modify specific genes or segments of DNA. This precision has far-reaching implications in fields such as medicine, agriculture, and biotechnology.\n\nMedicine: Gene editing holds promise for treating genetic disorders like sickle cell anemia, cystic fibrosis, and muscular dystrophy by correcting the underlying genetic mutations.\nAgriculture: Gene editing can be used to develop crops with improved resistance to pests, diseases, and environmental stresses, potentially increasing food security.\nBiotechnology: It enables the creation of genetically modified organisms (GMOs) with desired traits, such as disease resistance, enhanced growth, or increased productivity.\n\nAlso read: Mitochondrial Donation Treatment\n\n\ud83d\udc49 Which year are YOU targeting for success in the IAS/IPS/IFS Exam? \ud83d\ude80\n\n(1) \u21d2 UPSC 2025: Prelims cum Mains\n\n(2) \u21d2 UPSC 2026: Prelims cum Mains\n\n(3) \u21d2 UPSC 2027 Prelims cum Mains\n\nTip: Know more about ClearIAS Courses (Online/Offline)\n\nWhat is CRISPR-Cas9?\n\nCRISPR is a dynamic, versatile tool that allows us to target nearly any genomic location and potentially repair broken genes. It can remove, add, or alter specific DNA sequences in the genome of higher organisms.\nCRISPR (Clustered Regularly Interspaced Short Palindromic Repeats) are sections of DNA and are sections of genetic code containing short repetitions of base sequences followed by spacer DNA segments.\nCAS-9 (CRISPR-associated protein 9) is an enzyme. It uses a synthetic guide RNA to introduce a double-strand break at a specific location within a strand of DNA. It is a system used by bacterial cells to recognize and destroy viral DNA as a form of adaptive immunity.\n\nAlso read: Genome Sequencing\n\nHow does CRISPR-Cas9 work?\nCRISPR scans the genome looking for the right location and then uses the Cas9 protein as molecular scissors to snip through the DNA.\nCas9 endonuclease \u2013 guide RNAs to direct it to a particular sequence to be edited. The genetic sequence of the RNA matches the target sequence of the DNA that has to be edited.\nWhen Cas9 cuts the target sequence, the cell repairs the damage by replacing the original sequence with an altered version.\nUnlike other gene-editing methods, it is cheap, quick, easy, safer and more accurate to use because it relies on RNA\u2013DNA base pairing, rather than the engineering of proteins that bind particular DNA sequences.\nWhat are the pros of Gene editing?\nCRISPR could be used to modify disease-causing genes in embryos brought to term, removing the faulty script from the genetic code of that person\u2019s future descendants as well. Genome editing (Gene editing) could potentially decrease, or even eliminate, the incidence of many serious genetic diseases, reducing human suffering worldwide.\nIt might also be possible to install genes that offer lifelong protection against infection.\n\nAlso read: Genome India Project (GIP)\n\nWhat are the cons of Gene editing?\nMaking irreversible changes to every cell in the bodies of future children and all their descendants would constitute extraordinarily risky human experimentation.\nThere are issues including off-target mutations (unintentional edits to the genome), persistent editing effects, genetic mechanisms in embryonic and fetal development, and longer-term health and safety consequences.\nSome argue that we do not understand the operations of the genome enough to make long-lasting changes to it. Altering one gene could have unforeseen and widespread effects on other parts of the genome, which would then be passed down to future generations.\nMany consider genome alterations to be unethical, advocating that we should let nature run its course.\nFew argue that permitting human germline gene editing for any reason would likely lead to its ignorance of the regulatory limits, to the emergence of a market-based eugenics that would exacerbate already existing discrimination, inequality, and conflict.\nIt will become a tool for selecting desired characteristics such as intelligence and attractiveness.\nWhat are the risks associated with Gene Editing?\nIn the 2016\u00a0Worldwide Threat Assessment of the US Intelligence Community statement\u00a0United States Director of National Intelligence,\u00a0James R. Clapper, named genome editing as a potential\u00a0weapon of mass destruction, stating that genome editing conducted by countries with regulatory or ethical standards \u201cdifferent from Western countries\u201d probably increases the risk of the creation of harmful biological agents or products.\nThe low cost and accelerated pace of development of this technology and its deliberate or unintentional misuse might lead to far-reaching economic and national security implications.\nIt could lead to the manufacture of\u00a0biological weapons\u00a0by potential bioterrorists who might use the knowledge to create vaccine-resistant strains of other pox viruses, such as smallpox, that could affect humans.\n\nAlso read: Assisted Reproductive Technology\n\nHow is this technology being regulated worldwide?\n\nThe United States has banned federal aid from being used to support germline editing.\n\nIn the United Kingdom, one can apply to the regulatory body for a license to edit the genomes of a human embryo, but only for research work. The embryos have to be destroyed within 14 days.\n\nThe recently held International Summit on Human Gene Editing announced that it would be irresponsible to proceed with any clinical use of germline editing until the relevant safety and efficiency issues were resolved.\n\nIn India, there is no law for forbidding research laboratories and private companies from using the technology to experiment on embryos.

This carries genetic instructions for the development of all organisms. (2)\n\nA nucleotide consists of sugar, phosphate and nitrogenous base. There are four types of bases namely Adenine (A), Cytosine (C), Guanine (G) and Thymine (T). \u2018A \u2018bonds only with \u2018T \u2018and \u2018C \u2018only with \u2018G\u2019. This is called base pairing.\n\nWhat is genome sequencing?\n\nSequencing a genome means finding out the order of base pairs in the nucleotides in the DNA.\n\nA nucleotide sequence is the order of nucleotides in a DNA. This sequence contains the information for building an organism.\n\nPhysical Map vs Cytogenic Map vs Genetic Map\nPhysical Map vs Cytogenic Map vs Genetic Map\n\nA physical map of a genome shows the physical location of genes or DNA sequences.\n\nA cytogenic map shows the appearance of chromosomes when examined using a microscope.\n\nA genetic map shows the relative location of genes and is based on the idea of linkage \u2013 i.e. if two genes are located closer to each other, there is a greater probability that they will be inherited together.\n\nPotential uses of Gene Mapping with respect to India\nA reference genome of the Indian population could lead to the development of an understanding of the nature of diseases and specific interventions required for various ethnic groups.\nMapping the diversity of India\u2019s gene pool could lead to the development of personalized medicine and to reduce the genetic disease burden.\nCreating a catalogue of genetic variations and their disease-causing effects. This will lead to better research into genetic disorders and their treatment.\nAnticipating and preparing for future diseases.\nDeveloping precision medicines.\nThe extension of the project to agriculture, \u2019ll enhance the resistance of crops to diseases and reduce the dependency on insecticides/pesticides.\nThe project will also lead to a renewed understanding of India\u2019s ethnic groups and their genetic origins.\n\nAlso read: Gene Editing \u2013 What is CRISPR-Cas9?\n\nIssues with respect to the Genome India Project\n\nSome ethical, social and legal issues associated with the project are listed below.\n\nGenetic discrimination: Discrimination based on genetic makeup in case of health insurance, employment etc is possible. This could provide a genetic angle to the burning questions regarding indigenous population, race / caste-based politics and origin tracing.\nGenome editing: Changing the DNA leading to change in physical traits. While treatments such as gene therapy have the potential to treat several diseases, there are ethical concerns regarding the extent to which the same can be employed \u2013 a slippery slope that could lead to genetic enhancement.\nPrivacy: There are privacy issues regarding consent of research participants, usage of the findings and associated risks. There are knowledge and cultural barriers to fully understand the potential benefits and identifying risks attached to gene mapping. Further, the question of storage and protection of data needs to be addressed considering the possibility of misuse of data.\nUnequal access: Limited access to genetic testing and preventive medication could further the prevailing inequality and create social tensions.\n\nAlso read: Mitochondrial Donation Treatment\n\nGenome India Project: Policy interventions required\nGenomic data sharing policy which addresses the privacy issues of participants.\nLaws that prohibit usage of DNA data collection and usage without the consent of participants\nConfidentiality agreements that limit data access to limited researchers\nLaws prohibiting the prenatal genetic screening\nLaws restricting usage of genetics to prevent diseases and not to enhance human capability\nCreating a regulatory authority that regulates the genetic tests and determines the utility of the tests.\nLaws governing how DNA samples are stored, how the DNA database is maintained and who can access such a database\nLaws that prohibit discrimination based on genetic information\nEfforts to include under-represented population in genetic study and to address the complicated relationship between genetics and gaps in the health of the hither-to excluded population.\nSetting up training centres, programs, funding research in genetic studies\n\nAlso read: Assisted Reproductive Technology\n\nConclusion\n\nThe GIP has the potential to transform healthcare using precision medicine, addressing genetic disorders and improving agriculture by identifying genes and genetic variations in our country.\n\nHowever, the various risks and issues associated with gene-mapping, storing and usage of genetic data must be addressed and clear policy is drawn for the better usage of this novel technology.",

Most people recover from the COVID-19 infection within 28 days, when proper supportive care is given.\n\nAlso read: Covid-19 \u2013 Join the \u2018Break The Chain\u2019 Campaign\n\nViruses and Viral Infections\nViruses are found everywhere and their origins are unclear.\nViruses are neither dead nor alive, but to be considered inhabiting \u2018the edge of life\u2019.\nThey have a simple structure \u2013 a genetic material, DNA or RNA, surrounded by a protein called the capsid. Although viruses have genes, they don\u2019t have a cellular structure and hence viruses\u00a0cannot reproduce without infecting a cell.\nOnce inside, they assemble inside the cell, and using the machinery of the host cell they produce copies of themselves.\nRelease of the virus from the host cell causes the bursting of its membrane and cell wall, thus killing the cell.\n\nBroadly viruses can be classified as DNA viruses and RNA viruses based on the genetic material within them.\n\nA DNA virus enters the nucleus of the host cell and using the cell\u2019s enzymes, it\u2019ll replicate the viral DNA.\nAn RNA virus will inject the RNA into the cytoplasm (the material inside a living cell excluding the nucleus) to synthesize proteins and form replica viruses. Alternatively the RNA can be converted to DNA using a process called reverse transcription. This DNA will be integrated with that of the host DNA in a process similar to a DNA virus.\nCoronavirus Genome\nCoronavirus consists of an RNA genome and is one of the largest in the RNA family.\nCoronaviruses are enveloped and contain single-stranded positive-sense RNA. The RNA attaches to the host cell\u2019s ribosome for translation. Positive sense RNA can function as messenger RNA, meaning that viral RNA sequence may be directly translated into the desired viral proteins.\nCoronavirus (COVID-19) \u2013 Origin and Transmission\nCoronaviruses originate in animals like camels and bats and are zoonotic diseases as it passes from animals to humans occasionally.\nThe source of a zoonotic disease is called reservoir species. (For SARS, the reservoir species was identified as bats).\nThe first known case of COVID-19 was reported in the Chinese city of Wuhan in December 2019 and was traced to an animal market in the city.\nResearch is ongoing on how COVID-19 spreads. However, as per WHO, the disease spreads in humans via exposure to respiratory secretions \u2013 the small droplets from the nose or mouth of an infected person \u2013 either directly or indirectly.\nThe basic reproduction number (R_0) is a measure of transmissibility that aims to describe the average number of people a new case will infect. For COVID-19, WHO estimates R_0 = 1.4 to 2.5. However, many researchers think this figure is under-estimated.\nCompared to earlier outbreaks of SARS and MERS, COVID-19 has a greater global spread and researchers think that mutation in the virus strain is enabling it to be more efficiently transmitted.\nCoronavirus (COVID-19) \u2013 Clinical Manifestations\nIn humans, it affects the upper respiratory tract with varying severity.\nRespiratory infections range from the common cold to bronchiolitis. Pneumonia, gastroenteritis and neurological disorders can also occur.\nOther symptoms are headache, chills, sore throat, and cough.\nThe incubation period is from 2 to 5 days and symptoms have a range of 3 to 18 days.\nCoronavirus (COVID-19) \u2013 Prevention and Treatment\n\nNo vaccine is currently available to prevent COVID-19.\nAvoiding exposure is the only way to prevention. Preventive actions include:\nAvoiding close contact with infected people.\nAvoiding touching eyes, nose, and mouth.\nStaying home when infected and using a facemask.\nCovering while coughing or sneezing.\nDisinfecting frequently touched objects and surfaces.\nNo specific antiviral treatment is recommended for COVID-19. Infected people should receive supportive care based on symptoms and for severe cases, treatment should support vital organ functions.\nOther Human Coronaviruses\n\nTwo other human coronaviruses,\u00a0MERS-CoV\u00a0and\u00a0SARS-CoV\u00a0were previously identified.\n\nMiddle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS): MERS cases were reported mainly in the Arabian Peninsula. Symptoms usually include fever, cough, and shortness of breath which often progress to pneumonia. About 3 or 4 out of every 10 patients reported with MERS have died.\nSevere acute respiratory syndrome (SARS): It is believed that the 2003 SARS epidemic started when the virus spread from small mammals in China. SARS symptoms often included fever, chills and body aches which usually progressed to severe pneumonia and breathing difficulty. SARS is more deadly but much less infectious than COVID-19. There have been no outbreaks of SARS anywhere in the world since 2003.\nGlobal Impact of Novel Coronavirus COVID-19\n\nA \u2018Pandemic\u2019 is an epidemic that has spread worldwide and is no longer confined to a particular region. COVID-19 is fast approaching pandemic status with many countries implementing pandemic measures.\n\nEconomic Impact\nThe Coronavirus 2019 has badly impacted the global supply chain.\nCOVID-19 emergence coincides with a slowing Chinese economy, growing trade, and tariff-related tensions.\nChina is the biggest exporter of intermediate manufactured goods and economies dependent on Chinese imports will be disrupted. For example, Wuhan hosts hundreds of automotive, hardware, electrical equipment, consumer products, and other industries that serve many major manufacturers whose links to the global supply chain now stand severed.\nThese are crucial lessons on the importance of having a diversified supply chain.\nChina accounts for about 17% of the global GDP and it\u2019s the largest trading partner for most of its neighbors. Economies dependent on China will be hit the hardest.\nImpact on supply chain notwithstanding, other sectors like airlines and tourism are directly impacted. Markets across the world reacted adversely and fears of a global recession have been stoked.\nThe SARS pandemic of 2003 is estimated to have caused a global economic loss of $40 billion. COVID-19 will have a more significant impact as the Chinese share of global GDP has quadrupled since then. Some economists estimated that the expected annual losses from pandemic risk to be about $500 billion per year, accounting for both lost income and the intrinsic cost of elevated mortality. (5)\nPolitical Impact\nThe COVID-19 episode has resulted in public outrage against the initial cover-up attempts of the Chinese authorities.\nAfter the initial phase, authoritarian attempts to halt the disease, use of high-tech surveillance, mass quarantine camps and state of lockdown have once again brought forth questions regarding the balance between the freedom of citizens and dealing with a serious national problem.\nThe impact on the legitimacy of Chinese President Xi Jinping and the reputation of the Communist Party of China will be judged on how well the crisis will be handled. However, this episode has exposed a systemic weakness in the Chinese top-down model.\nSocial Impact\nThe direct health impact on infected people can be disastrous. Pandemics tend to have a disproportionately higher effect on younger people.\nShortage of protective equipment and other necessities due to panic buying and hoarding.\nIncrease in the burden of health care infrastructure and lack of access to routine health care.\nSudden population movement due to large-scale disease outbreaks can have destabilizing effects. Migration also compounds the risk of spreading disease.\nThe outbreak of infectious diseases can further stigmatize already vulnerable social groups and increase existing social inequalities.\nThe spread of rumours and misinformation aided and accelerated by social media makes it harder for people to find reliable guidance.\nAdverse social impact on the people in a state of lockdown.\nPublic Policy for Handling Pandemics\n\nFollowing the H1N1 pandemic Influenza, the Government of India issued \u2018Clinical management Protocol and Infection Control Guidelines. (7) But an overarching strategy is needed for handling a pandemic in the Indian context where the responsibilities lie divided between the central, state, and local governments.\n\nCase Study 1: Pandemic Interval Framework\nFigure: Pandemic Interval Framework\n\nU.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) has developed a Pandemic Interval Framework (PIF) (8) to guide executives on the kind of public health action required at various stages of the progression of a pandemic. The six intervals and the action to be taken at each interval is summarized below.\n\nTable: Public Health Action at Different Intervals\n\nIntervals\n\t\nPublic Health Actions\n\n\nInvestigation of cases of novel virus infection\n\t\ntargeted monitoring and investigation.\nrisk assessment of that virus with certain tools.\n\n\nRecognition of the potential for transmission\n\t\nfocus on control of the outbreak.\ntreatment of sick persons.\n\n\nInitiation\u00a0of a pandemic wave\n\t\noccurs when people are easily infected with the novel virus\n\n\nThe acceleration of a pandemic wave\n\t\nfocuses on the use of appropriate non-pharmaceutical interventions like the closure of schools and social distancing and\nthe use of medications (antivirals) and vaccines.\nthe goal is to reduce the spread of the disease and prevent illness.\n\n\nDeceleration of a pandemic wave\n\t\ncontinued vaccination, and monitoring of pandemic virus circulation.\nreducing the use of non-pharmaceutical interventions.\n\n\nPreparation for future pandemic waves\n\t\ncontinued monitoring of pandemic virus activity.\npreparing for potential additional waves of infection.\nCase Study 2: How Kerala Handled Nipah Virus Outbreak\nFigure: Flattening the infection curve: Dealing with pandemics (Courtesy: CDC and Vox)\nThe Nipah outbreak in Kerala was a serious challenge because of high mortality rates (it killed nearly 70% of those affected during a previous outbreak in Bangladesh), lack of vaccines or specific treatment, and Kerala\u2019s relative inexperience in handling virus outbreaks.\nThat the very second case was diagnosed correctly points towards an alert medical community in the state.\nAll contacts were traced, surveillance was carried out by a team of medical officials and district administration and potential cases were isolated.\nIn this way, every single case reported thereafter was traced back to the first case or its related contacts.\nAll contacts of all the cases (around 2000 people) were followed up on a daily basis.\nAll suspected cases were moved to the isolation facility set up at Government Medical College, Kozhikode.\nAn isolation protocol was established. Health personnel was trained and required safety gear was provided.\nFor those infected, anti-viral drugs and life support, measures were provided.\nThe state health minister actively supervised these efforts and the outbreak subsided in around five weeks. The deaths were limited to 16.\nCase Study 3: China\u2019s use of technology to manage the spread of COVID-19\nFigure: Covid-19 China \u2013 Age-Wise Fatality (Courtesy: Vox)\nAggressive use of surveillance technology by the Chinese government aided by technology companies.\nTech giants such as Alibaba and Baidu offer Artificial Intelligence (AI) gene sequencing tools.\nInfrared and facial recognition technology to identify and screen travelers.\nAI-enabled temperature measurement using thermal cameras.\nUse of robots and drones to remotely disinfect hospitals, deliver food and enforce quarantine measures.\nApps that alert users when they are close to infected areas.\nBased on ID numbers and travel history, users of various tech platforms are assigned a QR code that instructs them whether they need to be in quarantine or are free to travel.\nKnow the difference: Outbreak, Epidemic, and Pandemic\n\nAn outbreak is the occurrence of disease cases in excess of what\u2019s normally expected. An epidemic is when there is a sudden increase in reports of a particular disease in a particular area (say a state or country). When an epidemic spreads over several countries or continents it is called a pandemic.\n\nWhen Coronavirus was limited to Wuhan, it was an outbreak. It became an epidemic when it spread across China. It is now a pandemic as it spreads worldwide.\n\nThe Novel Coronavirus Pandemic: Latest statistics\n\nThe details about the latest number of confirmed cases on a global level are available from the below links.\n\nChannelNewsAsia.\nWorldometers.\nBing\nConclusion\n\nIndia faces a clear and present danger from the spreading of COVID-19.\n\nThe central, state, and local governments need to synchronize their actions to identify and isolate potential cases as in the case of the Nipah virus outbreak in Kerala.\n\nKey institutions must be identified as resource centers and to act as nodal points for contact tracing, testing, communications, and case management. Special focus must be on point of entry screening. The use\u00a0of technology like the Chinese example, but without authoritarian measures, will greatly help in the fight against the virus.\n\nFurther, in the long-term perspective, a well-researched pandemic/epidemic management strategy delineating the roles of different authorities and action points at various stages needs to be formulated.\n\nArticle by Ganesh Kumar V B.

The most popular ones are Rapid Antigen Test and RT-PCR Test.\n\n1. Rapid Antigen Test\nSpecimen: Nasopharyngeal swab\nWhat the test will look for: Antigen (Protein) of Covid-19 Virus\nProcess: Nasal samples are collected and tested for antigens, which are found in the SARS-CoV-2 virus. It can be even performed outside the conventional laboratory setting. This test is used to quickly obtain a diagnostic result.\n\nThis test is a rapid chromatographic immunoassay for the qualitative detection of specific antigens to SARS-CoV-2 present in the human nasopharynx. It provides only an initial screening test result. More specific alternative diagnosis methods should be performed in order to obtain the confirmation of SARS-CoV-2 an infection like COVID 19 PCR.\n\nThe test result must always be evaluated with other data available to the physician.\n\nPositive results are (in general) confirmatory.\n\nNegative results in a symptomatic person require further RT-PCR/CBNAAT/TRUENAT test.\n\nA negative result may occur if the concentration of antigen in a specimen is below the detection limit of the test., therefore a negative test result does not eliminate the possibility of SARS-CoV-2 infection, and should be confirmed by COVID 19 RT PCR.\n\nChildren tend to shed virus for longer periods of time than adults, this result in differences in sensitivity between adults and children.\n\nNeither the quantitative value nor the rate of SARS-CoV-2 antigen concentration can be determined by this qualitative test.\n\n2. Real-time PCR\nSpecimen: Nasopharyngeal / oropharyngeal Swab\nWhat the test will look for: Nucleic acids ie. RNA of Covid-19 Virus\nProcess: A sample is collected from deep inside the patient\u2019s nose and the back of the throat with a swab. The sample is then treated with chemical solutions that remove proteins and fats, leaving only the RNA present in the sample. The sample is then sent to the laboratory for analysis where an RT-PCR machine is used to detect the virus.\n\nRTPCR stands for Reverse Transcription Polymerase Chain Reaction. It is also known as Real-Time Polymerase Chain Reaction. This is a molecular test which looks for the genetic material of the virus.\n\nReal Time-PCR test is intended for the qualitative detection of nucleic acid from the 2019-nCoV in upper and lower respiratory specimens collected from individuals who meet 2019-nCoV clinical or epidemiological criteria.\n\nThe assay uses RNA extracted from clinical samples. Using the RNA extracted, the assay performs the RT-PCR reaction by dividing it into two assays for accurate detection of SARS-CoV-2.\n\nEach assay amplifies E gene and the COVID -19 specific target, RdRp/N/ORF1ab gene if present; thus it is designed for both the screening and specific detection of 2019-nCoV.\n\nPositive results are indicative of the presence of SARS-CoV-2 RNA. However, clinical correlation with patient history and other diagnostic information is necessary to determine patient infection status.\n\nNegative results do not preclude SARS-CoV-2 infection and should not be used as the sole basis for patient management decisions. Negative results must be combined with clinical observations, patient history, and epidemiological information. A false-negative result may occur if an inadequate number of organisms are present in the specimen due to improper collection, transport or handling. False-negative results may also occur if amplification inhibitors are present in the specimen.\n\nA single negative test result, particularly if this is from an upper respiratory tract specimen, does not exclude infection. Repeat sampling and testing of the lower respiratory specimen are strongly recommended in severe or progressive disease. The repeat specimens may be considered after a gap of 2 \u2013 4 days after the collection of the first specimen for additional testing if required.\n\nNote: RT-PCR is a type of Nucleic Acid Amplification Tests (NAAT). There are many other NAAT available for SARS-CoV-2 diagnosis.\n\n3. TruNAT\nSpecimen: Nasopharyngeal / oropharyngeal Swab\nWhat the test will look for: RdRp enzyme found in the RNA of Covid-19 Virus\nProcess: A TrueNat machine detects the RdRp enzyme found in the virus RNA in nasal or oral swabs.\n\nTruNat test works on the same principle as RT-PCR. However, it has a smaller kit and produces faster results. TruNat is not only used to detect Covid but also for detecting tuberculosis and HIV.\n\nAntibody Tests for Covid-19 (Serological Tests)\n\nAntibody tests detect antibodies produced by the body\u2019s immune system in response to SARS-CoV-2.\n\nCOVID-19 serology tests can tell whether or not you have had the viral infection in the past. However, antibody tests are not the preferred tests to diagnose current infections.\n\nAntibodies don\u2019t show up for about 1 to 2 weeks after you first become sick so antibody tests could miss some early infections.\n\nAntibodies are also known as immunoglobulins(Ig).\n\nCommonly tested antibodies are IgG and IgM.\n\nProcess: Rapid antibody testing involves taking a blood sample from the finger and putting it in a testing template. The blood is then examined for two types of antibodies \u2013 IgM antibodies, which appear early in an infection, and IgG antibodies, which are more likely to show up later.\n\nAntibodies can take days or weeks to develop in the body following exposure to a SARS-CoV-2 (COVID-19) infection and it is unknown how long they stay in the blood.\n\nAn antibody test does not detect the presence of the SARS-CoV-2 virus to diagnose COVID-19.\n\nThese tests can return a negative test result even in infected patients (for example, if antibodies have not yet developed in response to the virus) or may generate false-positive results (for example, if antibodies to another coronavirus type are detected).\n\nA positive antibody test does not necessarily mean you are immune from SARS-CoV-2 infection, as it is not known whether having antibodies to SARS-CoV-2 will protect you from getting infected again. It also does not indicate whether you can infect other people with SARS-CoV-2.\n\nThings to know about Coronaviruses\nCoronaviruses are non-segmented positive-stranded RNA viruses with a roughly 30 kb genome surrounded by a protein envelope.\nCoronaviruses have an envelope of about 80 to 120 nm in diameter. Its genetic material is the largest of all RNA viruses.\nMost coronaviruses cause diseases in their particular host species; those that can infect humans through cross-species transmission have become an important threat to public health.\nSevere acute respiratory syndrome-related coronavirus (SARSr-CoV) is a species of coronavirus that infects humans, bats and certain other mammals. It is a member of the genus Betacoronavirus and subgenus sarbecoronavirus.\nTwo strains of the virus have caused outbreaks of severe respiratory diseases in humans: (1) SARS-CoV , which caused the 2002-2004 outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), and (2) SARS-CoV-2, which is causing the 2019\u201320 pandemic of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). Other strains of Sarbecovirus are only known to infect non-human species: bats are a major reservoir of many strains.\nSince December 2019, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has been recognised as the causal factor in a series of severe cases of pneumonia originating in Wuhan in Hubei province, China. This disease has been named coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) by WHO.\nCommon signs of a person infected with a Coronavirus include respiratory symptoms, fever, cough, shortness of breath, acute respiratory syndrome and dyspnea.",

Read to know more.\n\nHave you ever visited any amusement park or shopping mall that offers 3D Virtual Reality?\n\nHave you ever played video games with your digital avatars?\n\nIf yes, you may be able to understand the concept of Metaverse quite easily.\n\nMetaverse is an elaborated version of these virtual reality platforms with personalized digital avatars.\n\nTable of Contents\n\nMetaverse: A virtual universe\nSo, what is metaverse?\nMetaverse: The Word Meaning\nWhere did the idea of the metaverse originate?\nWhy Metaverse is in the news?\nMetaverse: The future of the internet?\nHow is Metaverse different from the present form of the Internet?\nMetaverse: Everything you need to know\nExamples of a Meta-Verse 3D Space\nWhat is the present state of Metaverse?\nThe Potential of Metaverse:\nWhat are the challenges at present?\nCriticisms\nConcepts to focus on in this article\nMetaverse: A virtual universe\n\nInstead of sitting at the game console and watching the game unfold on the screen, what if you can participate as the player inside the game?\n\nWhat if you sitting in Delhi and can have dinner with your family living in Mumbai at a restaurant table located in Kolkatta?\n\n\ud83d\udc49 Which year are YOU targeting for success in the IAS/IPS/IFS Exam? \ud83d\ude80\n\n(1) \u21d2 UPSC 2025: Prelims cum Mains\n\n(2) \u21d2 UPSC 2026: Prelims cum Mains\n\n(3) \u21d2 UPSC 2027 Prelims cum Mains\n\nTip: Know more about ClearIAS Courses (Online/Offline)\n\nYes, the metaverse is a virtual world where people interact via their digital avatars!\n\nIn that virtual world, people will be able to do almost anything \u2013 go shopping, attend meetings, play with their friends, and so on.\n\nThis virtual universe can be accessed from devices like smartphones, or computers. However, to get the complete immersion experience \u2013 specific hardware devices like virtual reality headsets, augmented reality glasses, gaming consoles, etc are recommended.\n\nSo, what is metaverse?\n\nYou can call it a platform, environment, ecosystem, world, or universe.\n\nWe call it a futuristic virtual universe.\n\nNeed a more elaborate definition?\n\nMetaverse is a futuristic digital world where people get chances to immerse in virtual and augmented versions of reality through their digital avatars.\n\nMetaverse: The Word Meaning\n\nMetaverse is a combination of the words \u2018meta\u2019 and \u2018universe\u2019.\n\n\u2018Meta\u2019 means \u2018Beyond\u2019.\n\nSo metaverse is a universe that is beyond the universe as we know it. It exists in the virtual realm but feels just as real.\n\nWhere did the idea of the metaverse originate?\nThe term \u2018metaverse\u2019 was first mentioned in the 1992 science fiction novel \u2018Snow Crash\u2019 by Neal Stephenson.\nThe novel is set in a dystopian world where the governments have ceded power to private corporations and have references to many present-day aspects of the modern world such as virtual reality, digital currency, etc.\nMany movies have explored this concept such as \u2018The Matrix\u2019, \u2018Ready Player One\u2019, \u2018The Tron Legacy\u2019 etc.\nWhy Metaverse is in the news?\n\nMultiple companies investing in metaverse-related technologies.\n\nFacebook recently changed its name to \u2018Meta\u2019 to align the company with its ambitions to build the \u2018metaverse\u2019.\nMicrosoft has come up with its \u2018Mesh\u2019 platform which has mixed reality capabilities.\nNvidia is working on their versions of the virtual universe.\nEpic, the company behind the video game phenomenon Fortnite, has moved beyond games to social experiences like dance parties and virtual music concerts.\nMetaverse: The future of the internet?\n\nThe metaverse is not yet a reality, it is still a work in progress.\n\nHowever, the metaverse could be the next evolution of the internet.\n\nMany are hypothesizing that the metaverse will be the next iteration of the internet.\n\nHow is Metaverse different from the present form of the Internet?\n\nThe present form of the Internet is two-dimensional ie 2D.\n\nIf you are browsing Facebook, you are seeing your social connections on a 2D screen as 2D images, right?\n\n2D to 3D is the next move.\n\nSo Metaverse is internet rendered in 3D! OR Internet brought to life!\n\nMetaverse: Everything you need to know\nMetaverse will include elements from both physical and virtual worlds.\nThe metaverse will be decentralized (just like the internet).\nNobody owns the metaverse like how nobody owns the internet. It is an open platform.\nThere will be many companies and individuals that will operate their own spaces within the virtual world.\nA metaverse is a form of mixed reality ie a\u00a0combination of augmented and virtual reality.\nMetaverse will introduce digital elements in the real world.\nMetaverse will support 3-D virtual spaces.\n3D spaces in the virtual world will let you socialize, learn, collaborate, and play in ways that go beyond what we can imagine.\nAs per Facebook, the metaverse is the next evolution of social connection.\nMetaverse is expected to expand the internet to combine digital spaces like online gaming, social media, cryptocurrency, virtual reality, and augmented reality.\nExamples of a Meta-Verse 3D Space\n\nScenario 1: Meet your friend living in New York City in a local coffee shop in Mumbai \u2013 in a virtual environment in real-time via digital avatars.\n\nScenario 2: Shop with your friend living in Australia in a shopping mall in Delhi \u2013 in a virtual environment in real-time via digital avatars.\n\nScenario 3: Land and walk on the moon \u2013 in a virtual environment.\n\nWhat is the present state of Metaverse?\nGaming: As of now, many gaming platforms have successfully used the metaverse concept. For example, Epic Games, the creator of Fortnite, recently held a music concert by pop singer Ariana Grande in their game.\nCryptocurrency: Cryptocurrency is another aspect of a virtual universe that has been successfully realized, and it will be part of the new metaverse world order where all services will be offered in exchange for crypto.\nThe Potential of Metaverse:\nHardware Sales: Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg believes augmented reality glasses will eventually be as widespread as smartphones. If that is the case, this will be a very big market.\nSoftware Sales: Huge scope in the development of software applications to support the meta-verse ecosystem.\nGaming:\u00a0Facebook\u2019s gaming platform Oculus VR is expected to be the gateway into the metaverse.\nPhysical Sales: Sales of physical goods and services will be linked to the virtual ecosystem in the future.\nImmersive Learning: Immersive Learning is a training methodology that uses Virtual Reality (VR) to simulate real-world scenarios and train students in a safe and engaging immersive training environment.\ndecentralized commerce (dCommerce): in-world transactions to happen peer-to-peer.\nNon-Fungible Tokens (NFTs): NFTs \u2013 the claim of ownership for a unique, non-interchangeable digital asset that is stored on a blockchain \u2013 may be widely adopted.\nWhat are the challenges at present?\n\nAt this moment, no one is sure about the final form of Metaverse. There are also questions about who will finally have control over this virtual environment.\n\nThis mixed reality space will represent an entire ecosystem of various virtual realities that cannot be built by just one company hence building one is likely to take decades and require thousands of companies to pool in resources, including hardware, software, and content.\n\nThe metaverse requires technologies and infrastructure that currently do not exist. The current form of the Internet and its bandwidth is limited in their design to hold the 3D digital space.\n\nThe space will need a broader and more complex set of standards and protocols than the traditional Internet. This means large technology companies like Amazon, Google, and Facebook will need to prepare for cross-integrating their systems.\n\nThe interoperable virtual environment could also raise questions about data protection in the industry as wide consensus on data security and persistence will be harder to establish.\n\nThis virtual universe will need altogether new rules for censorship, control of communications, regulatory enforcement, tax reporting, the prevention of online radicalization, and many more challenges that are still unresolved today.\n\nCriticisms\n\nMany criticize \u2018Metaverse\u2019 as an over-hyped concept based on existing technology. Such critics argue that technologies like AR, and VR are existing for quite some time. Even the term \u2018Metaverse\u2019 is not new.\n\nExperts point out that VR data is biometric. In such a case, all personal and behavioral characteristics of the people will be recorded making them susceptible to cyber-crimes.\n\nUser addiction is a concern for the development of virtual reality.\n\nThe metaverse may distort users\u2019 perceptions of reality with biased content to keep them engaged.\n\nConcepts to focus on in this article\nMetaverse\nVirtual Reality (VR)\nAugmented Reality (AR)\nMixed Reality (MR)\nExtended Reality (XR)\nImmersive Learning\n3D spaces\ndecentralized commerce (dCommerce)\nnon-fungible tokens (NFTs)\nBlock-chain technology",

    "[CONTENT] #66": "Net neutrality is the principle that Internet service providers (ISPs) should treat all data on the Internet the same way, and not discriminate or charge differently by user, content, website, platform, or application.\n\nIn essence, it advocates for an open Internet where all data is treated equally, and users have equal access to all lawful content without any form of discrimination.\n\nNet neutrality has been a subject of debate and regulatory discussions in many countries. Some countries have implemented strong net neutrality regulations to ensure an open Internet, while others have taken a more hands-off approach, allowing ISPs more flexibility in how they manage their networks.\n\nTable of Contents\n\nWho are the Internet Service Providers\u00a0(ISPs)?\nHow can ISPs treat data on the Internet unequally?\nWhat is Net Neutrality, in simple words?\nInternet.org and Free basics \u2013 A case of violation of Net Neutrality\nAirtel Zero \u2013\u00a0A case of violation of Net Neutrality\nArguments supporting Net Neutrality\nArguments against Net Neutrality\nTelecom Regulatory Authority of India (TRAI)\u2019s Stand\nTRAI\u2019s Recommendations\nThe Significance of TRAI\u2019s Recommendations\nIs there a law in India that enforces Net Neutrality?\nConclusion and Way Forward\nWho are the Internet Service Providers\u00a0(ISPs)?\n\nCompanies like Airtel, BSNL, Reliance (Jio), Vodaphone, Idea, etc provide Internet Service.\n\nInternet Service Providers (ISPs) are companies that provide Internet access services to individuals, businesses, and other organizations. They play a crucial role in connecting users to the global network of the internet. ISPs offer various types of internet connections, services, and plans, allowing users to access the internet for different purposes.\n\nTypes of Internet Connections:\n\nBroadband: This is the most common type of internet connection provided by ISPs. It includes Digital Subscriber Line (DSL), cable, fiber-optic, and satellite connections.\nDSL: Uses telephone lines to provide internet access.\nCable: Uses cable television lines.\nFiber-Optic: Employs optical fibers to transmit data at high speeds.\nSatellite: Relies on satellite signals for internet connectivity.\n\nServices Offered by ISPs:\n\n\ud83d\udc49 Which year are YOU targeting for success in the IAS/IPS/IFS Exam? \ud83d\ude80\n\n(1) \u21d2 UPSC 2025: Prelims cum Mains\n\n(2) \u21d2 UPSC 2026: Prelims cum Mains\n\n(3) \u21d2 UPSC 2027 Prelims cum Mains\n\nTip: Know more about ClearIAS Courses (Online/Offline)\n\nInternet Access: Providing users with the ability to connect to the internet.\nEmail Services: Many ISPs offer email services to their subscribers.\nWeb Hosting: Some ISPs provide web hosting services for individuals and businesses.\nVirtual Private Networks (VPNs): ISPs may offer VPN services for enhanced security and privacy.\nHow can ISPs treat data on the Internet unequally?\n\nIdeally, ISPs should charge users based on the data consumed or on a subscription basis (monthly) plans. But what if they charge you based on the websites you visit?\n\nFor example, if an ISP Company XYZ, provides Services like Skype, Bing, and Facebook for FREE, and charges you for using Google, this is a clear violation of net neutrality. Here Skype, Bing, and Facebook get a competitive advantage, while Google will lose a lot of traffic and revenue. Also, it is a case where ISPs interfere with the choice of consumers.\n\nWhat is Net Neutrality, in simple words?\n\nNet Neutrality is the principle that Internet Service Providers should enable access to all content and applications without favoring or blocking particular websites.\n\nThe term was coined by Columbia University media law professor Tim Wu in 2003.\n\nKey principles of net neutrality include:\n\nEqual Treatment of Data: Net neutrality advocates for the equal treatment of all data on the Internet. This means that ISPs should not favor or block particular websites or services, nor should they throttle (slow down) or prioritize certain types of data traffic.\nNo Discrimination: Net neutrality opposes any form of discrimination against specific websites, services, or applications. ISPs should not provide preferential treatment to their content or that of affiliated partners, nor should they disadvantage competitors.\nTransparency: ISPs are expected to be transparent about their network management practices, ensuring that consumers are aware of how their Internet traffic is being treated.\nNo Paid Prioritization: Net neutrality discourages the practice of paid prioritization, where companies or individuals could pay ISPs for faster or better access to their content, creating a tiered Internet.\nInnovation and Competition: Supporters of net neutrality argue that an open Internet fosters innovation and competition by allowing new and small players to compete on an equal footing with established ones.\nConsumer Rights: Net neutrality is seen as protecting the rights of consumers by ensuring that they have unrestricted access to the content and services of their choice without interference from ISPs.\nInternet.org and Free basics \u2013 A case of violation of Net Neutrality\nInternet.org is a partnership between Social Networking services company Facebook and six other companies that plan to bring affordable access to selected Internet services to less developed countries.\n\u201cFree Basics\u201d is the name of the app that delivers these services.\nHowever, this was a violation of the concept of Net Neutrality.\nRegulators banned the Free Basics service in India based on the \u201cProhibition of Discriminatory Tariffs for Data Services Regulations\u201d.\nAirtel Zero \u2013\u00a0A case of violation of Net Neutrality\nAirtel announced Airtel Zero, an initiative that would allow applications to purchase data from Airtel in exchange for the telecom company offering them to consumers free of cost.\nAirtel Zero was widely perceived as a violation of net neutrality.\nBy paying to be on Airtel Zero, companies could make sure that their users get free access to their service, while smaller players are at a disadvantage.\nHowever, Airtel has said that zero-rating does not violate net neutrality as it lowers the cost of access and it is \u201cnon-discriminatory\u201d.\nTo prevent such things, it appears necessary to have a specific mandating a neutral internet.\nArguments supporting Net Neutrality\nServices on the internet must be equally accessible to all and no discrimination should be there.\nWithout Net neutrality, the right to freedom of speech and expression would be affected.\nIt would be detrimental from the consumer point of view too.\nNet neutrality will promote architecture and innovative development of the Internet.\nThe Internet is the result of the time and creativity of many volunteers for many decades and hence it should not be left in the hands of the few, hence ethically wrong if it is done away with.\nWithout Net neutrality, the new start-ups would be at a disadvantage.\nArguments against Net Neutrality\nThe economic principle of paying differently for different levels of service and experience is recognized by Differential Pricing.\nMassive investment loss would be there.\nFuture investments in telecommunications infrastructure will be curtailed, thereby impacting user experience.\nApplications that use the voice over internet protocol (VoIP), have led to a reduction in voice-based traffic.\nIt will impact the government\u2019s Digital India initiative.\nIt is ethically questionable because operators have to invest in maintaining and expanding the Internet\u2019s infrastructure to support new services while most benefits are reaped by Internet content companies like Google, Facebook, etc.\nThe Internet has survived because of little or no regulation, hence creativity and future development should not be crippled.\nTelecom Regulatory Authority of India (TRAI)\u2019s Stand\n\nTRAI is the Telecom regulator in India.\n\nThe TRAI had ruled for Net Neutrality thus banning Facebook\u2019s Free Basics and Airtel Zero in India.\n\nTRAI\u2019s Recommendations\nThere should not be any discrimination.\nProtection of rights of citizens.\nIt excludes specialized services and content delivery networks (CDNs).\nSetting up a multi-stakeholder body.\nThe Significance of TRAI\u2019s Recommendations\nConstitutional promises are fulfilled.\nUsers\u2019 right to freedom of speech and expression is prioritized.\nIt also ensures a level playing field for service providers to innovate and customize in India.\nDemocracy of the internet is kept intact.\nIt helps build the Internet as a public platform with open access to all.\nIt addresses the problem of anti-competitive practices.\nJudicious and transparent use of national resources for a greater public benefit.\nPeople\u2019s participation in decision-making is enhanced.\nIs there a law in India that enforces Net Neutrality?\n\nAlthough TRAI guidelines for the Unified Access Service License promote net neutrality, it does not enforce it.\n\nThere are no laws enforcing net neutrality in India.\n\nThe Information Technology Act 2000 also does not prohibit companies from throttling their service.\n\nConclusion and Way Forward\nIndia\u2019s Internet adoption rate remains among the lowest in the Asia-Pacific region with 422 million subscribers. 500-550 million Indians use feature phones that offer no data services. A Kleiner Perkins Internet Trends Report for 2017 notes that even though smartphone and data costs are declining in India, they are still too high for most.\nIndia\u2019s decision to uphold Net neutrality assumes greater significance, given that in the U.S., the rules on the network neutrality were repealed.\nAs there is no country-wide law now in the US favoring Net Neutrality, states like Massachusetts are coming up with state-level laws.\nThe scrapping of the net neutrality rules in the US sets a dangerous precedent for other countries like India where emboldened regulators could pursue similar routes. As a way forward in India, a proper mechanism needs to be instituted.\nTelcos\u2019 must also make adequate investments to cater to the explosion of data traffic.\n\nArticle by Ipsita Mishra",

This supercomputer is capable of 33.8 petaflop/s.\nTitan \u2013 from the US. Computing capacity is 17.5 petaflop/s.\nWhat is the next generation supercomputing?\nOptical computing calculations with the near speed of light by using optical devices and connections in place of transistors. Latest developments in this field have already taken place with the optical equivalent of transistors being switched on using photons and not electrons. Since photons travel at speed of light, therefore, calculations may be done at sub-light speed.\nDNA computing calculations by recombining DNA in a parallel environment. Numerous possibilities are tried at the same time; the most optimal solution will be \u201cthe strongest to survive.\u201d\nQuantum computing not in practical use yet only conceptual proofing done but think of it as calculations being done before you have thought of them. Work is done in the blink of an eye since time is of no essence here.\nWhat are the Applications of a Supercomputer?\n\nAcademic research: For observing and simulating the phenomena which are too big, too small, too fast, or too slow to observe in laboratories. For example, astrophysicists use supercomputers as \u201ctime machines\u201d to explore the past and the future of our universe. Another important area is quantum mechanics.\nWeather and climate modeling to forecast with better accuracy by analyzing multiple factors and their interrelationships.\nMedicine discovery for e.g. How a protein folds information leads to the discovery of new drugs.\nMonsoon Forecasting using dynamic Models.\nBig data mining to strengthen and better mobilization of digital India mission.\nOil and gas exploration, therefore, ensuring energy security of India.\nAirplane and spacecraft aerodynamics research and development, therefore better safety standards and smoother connectivity thereby helping in ease of transportation.\nSimulation of nuclear fission and fusion processes, therefore imparting better nuclear infrastructure models and helping in energy security of the nation.\nMolecular dynamics: supercomputer simulations allow scientists to dock two molecules together to study their interaction which may lead to the development of innovative materials for future generation technologies.\nIn 1994, A supercomputer was used to alert the scientists about the collision of a comet with Jupiter, providing them time to prepare to observe and record the event for useful analysis and its application in predicting future comet collision with the earth.\nWhat are the initiatives taken by the Government of India?\nIn the 12th five-year plan, the government of India (GOI) had committed that $2.5bn would be sanctioned for the research in the supercomputing field.\nIn 2015, GOI approved 7-year supercomputing program known as National Supercomputing Mission which aims to create a cluster of 73 supercomputers connecting various academic and research institutions across India with $730mn investment.\nSome facts for Prelims\nThere are no exaflop (higher than petaflops) computing supercomputers in the world and the first product is expected around 2019-20.\nIndia is also preparing to launch its exaflop supercomputers by 2020.\nChina\u2019s, Sunway TaihuLight is the fastest supercomputer (93 Pflops) and China has more supercomputers than the USA as of July 2016.\nPossible Sample Questions for Mains\nWhat are supercomputers? What is its status in India? How does it help in the development of India and the world?\n\u00a0Supercomputers have more strategic significance than scientific. Illustrate.\nSample Questions for Prelims\n\nQuestion: With reference to supercomputers,\u00a0petaflops are related to?\n\n\ud83d\udc49 Which year are YOU targeting for success in the IAS/IPS/IFS Exam? \ud83d\ude80\n\n(1) \u21d2 UPSC 2025: Prelims cum Mains\n\n(2) \u21d2 UPSC 2026: Prelims cum Mains\n\n(3) \u21d2 UPSC 2027 Prelims cum Mains\n\nTip: Know more about ClearIAS Courses (Online/Offline)\n\nA \u2013 The latest model of sSupercomputers developed by China.\nB \u2013 The latest model of supercomputers developed by the USA.\nC \u2013 The performance of supercomputers.\nD \u2013 Floppy disks which are used on normal desktop computers.\n\nAnswer:\u00a0(Option C)\u00a0The performance of supercomputers.\n\nLearning Zone:\u00a0The performance is generally evaluated in petaflops (1 followed by 15 zeros) and some supercomputers may even perform quadrillions flops.\n\nArticle by: Nishant\u00a0Raj.

    "[CONTENT] #72": "Artificial Intelligence (AI) is a hot word these days. In this post, we cover artificial intelligence in detail \u2013 its meaning, scope, risks, ethics etc.\n\nTable of Contents\n\nWhat is Artificial Intelligence (AI)?\nIs it possible for a computer to become completely Artificially Intelligent?\nWhat is the philosophy and ethics of Artificial Intelligence?\nThree main philosophical questions related to Artificial Intelligence\nExamples of Artificially Intelligent Technologies\nApplications of Artificial Intelligence (AI)\nWhat are the downsides and risks of Artificial Intelligence (AI)?\nPossible areas for AI applications in Indian conditions\nWhich is the nodal organization of the government for the research work on Artificial Intelligence (AI)?\nWhat are the challenges India\u2019s Artificial Intelligence Development is facing?\nLatest Developments\nConclusion\nWhat is Artificial Intelligence (AI)?\nTo make it simple \u2013 Artificial Intelligence is intelligence exhibited by machines.\nIt is a branch of computer science that deals with creating computers or machines as intelligent as human beings.\nThe term was coined in 1956 by John McCarthy at the Dartmouth conference, Massachusetts Institute of Technology.\nIt is a simulation of human intelligence processes such as learning (the acquisition of information and rules for using the information), reasoning (using the rules to reach approximate or definite conclusions), and self-correction by machines, especially computer systems.\nNowadays it has become an umbrella term that encompasses everything from robotic process automation to actual robotics.\nRecently it has become widely popular and gained prominence due to its multifaceted application ranging from healthcare to military devices.\nIs it possible for a computer to become completely Artificially Intelligent?\n\nWork is being done in this arena however except in some instances of computers playing games faster than the best human players no success has been achieved.\nFor Example: In May 1997, an IBM super-computer called Deep Blue defeated world chess champion Gary Kasparov in a chess match.\nAnother recent example of 2016 is, AlphaGo, a program driven by Google\u2019s DeepMind AI, which has won Korean Lee Sedol, one of Go\u2019s most dominant players.\nWhat is the philosophy and ethics of Artificial Intelligence?\nThe research and development of AI started with the intention of creating intelligence in machines that we find and regard as high in humans. Thus answering the big question which is can machines think and behave like humans do?\nThree main philosophical questions related to Artificial Intelligence\nAre they dangerous to humanity? How can we ensure that machines behave ethically and that they are used ethically?\nIs artificial general intelligence probable? Can a machine decipher any problem that a human being can solve using intelligence? Or are there hard boundaries to what a machine can accomplish?\nIs it possible for machines to have a mind, consciousness, and mental state in the same sense that human beings do? Can a machine be sentient, and thus deserve certain rights? Can a machine intentionally cause harm?\nExamples of Artificially Intelligent Technologies\nRobotic process automation: Automation is the process of making a system or process function automatically. Robots can be programmed to perform high-volume, repeatable tasks normally performed by humans and further, it is different from IT automation because of its agility and adaptability to the changing circumstances.\nNatural language processing (NLP) is the processing of human language and not computer language by a computer program. For Example, spam detection, which looks at the subject line and the text of an email and decides if it\u2019s junk.\nPattern recognition is a branch of machine learning that focuses on identifying patterns in data.\nMachine vision is the science of making computers visualize by capturing and analyzing visual information using a camera, analog-to-digital conversion, and digital signal processing. It is often compared to human eyesight, but machine vision isn\u2019t bound by biology and can be programmed to see through walls. It is used in a range of applications from signature identification to medical image analysis.\nMachine learning: A field of study that gives computers the ability to learn without being explicitly programmed. \u00a0Deep learning is a subset of machine learning and can be thought of as the automation of predictive analytics.\nRobotics is a field of engineering focused on the design and manufacturing of robots. Robots are often used to perform tasks that are difficult for humans to perform or perform consistently.\nApplications of Artificial Intelligence (AI)\n\nHealthcare Sector: Machine learning is being used for faster, cheaper, and more accurate diagnosis thus improving patient outcomes and reducing costs. For Example, IBM Watson and chatbots are some of such tools.\nBusiness Sector: To take care of highly repetitive tasks Robotic process automation is applied which performs faster and effortlessly than humans. Further, Machine learning algorithms are being integrated into analytics and CRM platforms to provide better customer service. Chatbots are being used in websites to provide immediate service to customers. Automation of job positions has also become a talking point among academics and IT consultancies such as Gartner and Forrester.\nEducation Sector: AI can make some of the educational processes automated such as grading, rewarding marks, etc. therefore giving educators more time. Further, it can assess students and adapt to their needs, helping them work at their own pace. AI may change where and how students learn, perhaps even replacing some teachers.\nFinancial Sector: It can be applied to personal finance applications and could collect personal data and provide financial advice. Today software trades more than humans on Wall Street.\nLegal Sector: Automation can lead to faster resolution of already pending cases by reducing the time taken while analyzing cases thus better use of time and more efficient processes.\nManufacturing sector: Robots have been used for manufacturing for a long time now, however, more advanced exponential technologies have emerged such as additive manufacturing (3D Printing) which with the help of AI can revolutionize the entire manufacturing supply chain ecosystem.\nIntelligent Robots \u2212 Robots can perform the tasks given by a human because of sensors to detect physical data from the real world such as light, heat, temperature, movement, sound, bump, and pressure. Moreover, they have efficient processors, multiple sensors, and huge memory, to exhibit intelligence. Further, they are capable of learning from their errors and therefore can adapt to the new environment.\nGaming \u2013 AI has a crucial role in strategic games such as chess, poker, tic-tac-toe, etc., where the machine can think of a large number of possible positions based on heuristic knowledge.\nSpeech Recognition \u2013 There are intelligent systems that are capable of hearing and grasping the language in terms of sentences and their meanings while humans talk to it. It can handle different accents, slang words, noise in the background, changes in human noise due to cold, etc.\nCyber Security: In the 20th conference on e-governance in India it was discussed that AI can provide more teeth to cyber security and must be explored.\n\nRead:\u00a0AI in Elections\n\nWhat are the downsides and risks of Artificial Intelligence (AI)?\nThe decrease in demand for human labour is due to machines and intelligent robots taking over the jobs in the manufacturing and services sectors. For Example: In China, some customs officers are now robots, In Japan robots such as housemaids is an emerging trend.\nExistential risks: Stephen Hawkins once said \u201cThe development of full artificial intelligence could spell the end of the human race. Once humans develop artificial intelligence, it will take off on its own and redesign itself at an ever-increasing rate. Humans, who are limited by slow biological evolution, couldn\u2019t compete and would be superseded\u201d.\nAI technologies falling into terrorist hands may unleash modern terror networks including machines and therefore vulnerability of humans may magnify.\nIt may lead to moral degradation in society due to decreased human-to-human interactions.\n\nIn such an era of rapid and disruptive changes, many questions arise:\n\nWill these technological changes be accompanied by equally profound economic, social, and cultural changes?\nWill technology destroy jobs at a faster rate than the rate of creation of jobs?\nWill future governments be forced to fork out Universal Basic Income?\nHow could education be redefined with artificial intelligence, big data, augmented reality, and personalized learning pathways?\nAre conventional manufacturing plants under threat with the advent of additive manufacturing?\nWhat will be the impact on the skills required?\nAfter all these changes, do people-to-people communication and socio-economic activities remain the same?\nPossible areas for AI applications in Indian conditions\nIt can complement Digital India Mission by helping in the big data analysis which is not possible without using AI.\nTargeted delivery of services, schemes, and subsidies can be further fine-tuned.\nSmart border surveillance and monitoring to enhance security infrastructure.\nWeather forecasting models may become proactive and therefore preplanning for any future mishaps such as floods, and droughts and therefore addressing the farming crisis, farmer\u2019s suicide, crop losses, etc.\nBy analyzing big data of road safety data and NCRB (National Crime Record Bureau) data for crimes, new policies can be formulated.\nDisaster management can be faster and more accessible with the help of robots and intelligent machines.\nIn the counterinsurgency and patrolling operations, we often hear the loss of CRPF jawans which can be minimized by using the robotic army and lesser human personnel.\nAI can be used to automate government processes, therefore, minimizing human interactions and maximizing transparency and accountability.\nIt can be applied to study ancient literature on medicines and therefore help in modernizing health care with the juxtaposition of modern machines and ancient techniques.\nIn the remotest areas where the last leg of governance is almost broken, AI can do the job. For Example: in the tribal areas and the hilly areas of the northeast.\nWhich is the nodal organization of the government for the research work on Artificial Intelligence (AI)?\nCentre for Artificial Intelligence and Robotics (CAIR), is the primary laboratory of DRDO for research and development in different areas of defense, Information and Communication Technology (ICT) and is located in Bangalore. It is involved in the Research & Development of high-quality Secure Communication, Command, and Control, and Intelligent Systems.\nCAIR came into existence in 1986.\nProjects: NETRA- software to intercept online communication, SECOS- Secure operating system.\nWhat are the challenges India\u2019s Artificial Intelligence Development is facing?\nAI-based applications are mostly driven largely by the private sector and have been focused largely on consumer goods.\nPublic-private funding model which is a success in the United States, China, South Korea, and elsewhere may be considered good for India. Presently it is not present in India.\nOur educational system is not updated to modern technologies and is outdated in today\u2019s economic environment as the nature of jobs shifts rapidly and skills become valuable and obsolete in a matter of years.\nThe debate of poverty vs. technology and where to spend the most is more likely to persist until the political class takes a higher interest in real issues than trivial ones.\nLatest Developments\n\nMarch 2024: The UN General Assembly adopted a landmark resolution to promote \u201csafe, secure and trustworthy\u201d artificial intelligence (AI) systems that will also benefit sustainable development for all.\n\n\ud83d\udc49 Which year are YOU targeting for success in the IAS/IPS/IFS Exam? \ud83d\ude80\n\n(1) \u21d2 UPSC 2025: Prelims cum Mains\n\n(2) \u21d2 UPSC 2026: Prelims cum Mains\n\n(3) \u21d2 UPSC 2027 Prelims cum Mains\n\nTip: Know more about ClearIAS Courses (Online/Offline)\n\nThe Assembly resolved to bridge the artificial intelligence (AI) and other digital divides between and within countries and promote safe, secure and trustworthy AI systems to accelerate progress towards the full realization of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development.\nThe United States is spearheading the first United Nations resolution on\u00a0artificial intelligence, aimed at ensuring that the new technology is \u201csafe, secure and trustworthy\u201d and that all countries, especially those in the developing world, have equal access.\nThe resolution aims at closing the digital divide between countries and making sure they are all at the table in discussions on AI \u2014 and that they have the technology and capabilities to take advantage of its benefits, including detecting diseases, predicting floods and training the next generation of workers.\nConclusion\n\nDespite these threats and challenges, it would be stupid to argue that Artificial Intelligence (AI) is not the future and it\u2019s only a matter of time before machines replace most jobs. It does not mean the end of the road for humanity and we have a history of technological revolutions causing social and political changes in society.\n\nThere were bound to be some fears and challenges in the early years, but so was the case with the French Revolution, steam engines, industrial revolutions, and most recently the computers.\n\nNevertheless, there will be more opportunities in the fields not yet known and there will be more jobs to cater to human needs. In the case of India, Innefu is one such Artificial Intelligence (AI) based company that is still in its nascent phase but soon may challenge global companies and therefore can create an AI ecosystem in India.\n\nAlso read: Future of Work and AI; IndiaAI Mission;\u00a0International AI Treaty\n\nArticle by: Nishant\u00a0Raj.

But what if tomorrow, your refrigerator directly orders for vegetables after analysing the shortage in stock? Yes, that is possible with the emergence of a new concept called the Internet of Things (IoT).\n\nTable of Contents\n\nWhat is the \u201cInternet of Things (IoT)\u201d?\nInternet of Things \u2013 Example\nWho coined the term the Internet of Things?\nWhich devices can be part of IoT?\nWhy would we want an Internet of Things?\nIoT \u2013 Opportunities and Benefits\nIoT \u2013 Threats and Challenges\nSummary\nWhat is the \u201cInternet of Things (IoT)\u201d?\n\nSubscribe to the ClearIAS YouTube Channel for more informative videos on UPSC preparation, tips, and strategies. Stay updated with our latest content and enhance your exam readiness.\n\nThe Internet of Things (IoT) is a concept that describes the idea of everyday physical objects being connected to the internet. In the Internet of Things, the connected devices should be able to identify themselves to other devices.\n\nSimply put, this is the concept of basically connecting any device with an ON and OFF switch to the Internet or to each other. This includes everything from cell phones, coffee makers, washing machines, headphones, lamps, wearable devices and almost anything else you can think of.\n\nOr, if you want us to make it more simple \u2013 the Internet of Things (IoT) is a concept where Things can talk to other Things!\n\nInternet of Things \u2013 Example\n\nLet\u2019s go back to my morning and there I am lying blissfully asleep or so it seems.\n\nThe sensors in my arm\u00a0sent something is very wrong my heart rate \u2013 it is going up, my breathing has become erratic, and instead of this time gently waking me, it vibrates aggressively to get my attention, and as I roll over, I I\u2019m grabbing my chest, and I\u2019m I\u2019m like what\u2019s going on, so I reach over to my phone.\n\nI pull it up and sure enough there\u2019s a message it says I\u2019m having high blood pressure in my breathing as a radicand and it suggests that I take a two aspirin right away and then goes on to say it says all my vital signs have been recorded in electronically transmitted to my medical provider.\n\nSo back at the hospital the doctors already evaluating my data and in his professional opinion I need to get in the hospital right away so we electronically dispatch Emergency Medical Team directly to my home including pertinent data about my current medical situations so they know how to take care of me and I even get a notice or a message from the EMT that they\u2019re about to arrive I\u2019m whisking to the hospital and I\u2019m put under keen observation.\n\nThe good news is later that morning that doctor comes and says you\u2019re going to be fine. You were suffering a heart attack and we avoided any major damage because you got the treatment you needed in just the nick of time so now is the internet of things worth it maybe all because things can talk to other things or what we call the Internet of Things Thank you.\n\nNote: This is an excerpt from the speech by\u00a0Benson Hougland at TEDxTemecula.\n\n\ud83d\udc49 Which year are YOU targeting for success in the IAS/IPS/IFS Exam? \ud83d\ude80\n\n(1) \u21d2 UPSC 2025: Prelims cum Mains\n\n(2) \u21d2 UPSC 2026: Prelims cum Mains\n\n(3) \u21d2 UPSC 2027 Prelims cum Mains\n\nTip: Know more about ClearIAS Courses (Online/Offline)\n\nWho coined the term the Internet of Things?\n\nIn 1999 Kevin Ashton, then at P&G (later MIT\u2019s Auto-ID Center), coined the term \u2018Internet of Things\u2019. It was a new term, but not a new operation. It was known as pervasive computing, ubicomp, and ambient intelligence.\n\nThe first version of the internet was about data created by the internet. The next version is about the data created by things.\n\nWhich devices can be part of IoT?\n\nAnything that can be connected, will be connected.\n\nAny device, if it has an on and off switch then chances are it can be a part of the IoT. Very often the connected devices will have an I.P address. With Internet Protocol Version 6 (IPv6), assigning an IP address to billions of devices has become very much feasible.\n\nExamples of \u2018things\u2019 which can be connected to internet include:\n\nConnected Wearables \u2013 Smartwatches, Smart glasses, fitness bands etc.\nConnected Homes \u2013 connecting household appliances to the network.\nConnected Cars \u2013 vehicles that are connected to the internet.\nConnected Cities \u2013 smart meters which analyse usage of water, gas, electricity etc connect cities to IoT\n\nOperationally this means that we can define the Internet of Things as the seamless flow between the\u00a0\u2013\n\nBAN (body area network): wearables,\nLAN (local area network): smart home,\nWAN (wide area network): connected car, and\nVWAN (very wide area network): the smart city.\n\nKey to this flow is having control of the data.\n\nThat is why Google is offering a Glass and a Lens so you can synchronize your health data into the NEST and the Google Car throughout the smart city applications of google.org. The idea is that in consumer applications and services you never have to leave the Google Cloud. The products are gateways linking up the networks.\n\nWhy would we want an Internet of Things?\n\nWe want it because it can offer us \u2013\n\nthe best possible feedback on physical and mental health.\nthe best possible resource allocation based on real-time monitoring.\nbest possible decision making on mobility patterns.\nthe best possible alignments of local providers with global potential.\nIoT \u2013 Opportunities and Benefits\n\nIoT offers us the opportunity to be more efficient in how we do things, saving us time, money and often emissions in the process.\n\nInternet of Things can be used to tackle simpler day-to-day issues \u2013 like finding a car parking space in busy areas, linking up your home entertainment system and using your fridge webcam to check if you need more milk on the way home.\n\nIoT\u00a0offers many other benefits industrially, such as:\n\nUnprecedented connectivity:\u00a0IoT\u00a0data and insights\u00a0from connected applications and devices empower organizations with the ability to deliver innovative new products and services faster than their competitors.\nIncreased efficiency:\u00a0IoT networks of smart and intelligent devices provide real-time data to arm employees with the information they need to optimize their day-to-day efficiency and productivity.\nCost savings:\u00a0IoT devices provide accurate data collection and automated workflows to help organizations reduce their operating costs and minimize errors.\nTime savings:\u00a0Connected smart devices can help organizations enhance the performance of systems and processes to save time.\nIoT \u2013 Threats and Challenges\n\nThere is a very clear danger that technology is running ahead of the game.\n\nMore than 7 billion devices will need to be made secure by their manufacturers before 2020.\n\nThe need to secure every connected device by 2020 is \u201ccritical\u201d.\n\nIoT botnets, created using a network of out-of-date devices took\u00a0large websites and services offline\u00a0in 2016.\n\nEverything that\u2019s connected to the internet can be hacked, IoT products are no exception to this unwritten rule. (Remember the car hacking scene in the \u2018Fate of the Furious\u2019 movie).\n\nIf every product becomes connected then there\u2019s the potential for unbridled observation of users. This will create a lot of privacy issues.\n\nIn the future, intelligence services might use the internet of things for identification, surveillance, monitoring, location tracking, and targeting for recruitment, or to gain access to networks or user credentials.\n\nSummary\n\nSimply, the Internet of Things is made up of devices \u2013 from simple sensors to smartphones and wearables \u2013 connected together.\n\nIoT is increasingly being used to define objects that \u201ctalk\u201d to each other.\n\nIoT is a giant network of connected \u201cthings\u201d (which also includes people). \u00a0The relationship will be between people-people, people-things, and things-things.\n\nCompanies are using IoT, AI and machine learning to rapidly evolve in a way we\u2019ve never seen before\n\nReferences:\n\nWired\nGoldmansachs\nRobotics Business Review\nWikipedia\nForbes",

    "[CONTENT] #78": "Blockchain technology has become a regular news item with the emergence of cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin.\nToday, Blockchain technology is disrupting almost all markets, changing the way we do our day-to-day business. Yes, blockchain technology is changing our world.\n\nLet\u2019s decode the latest buzzword \u2013 Blockchain Technology \u2013 in this post. Thank you for the excellent feedback on our earlier articles in this series \u2013 on Artificial Intelligence,\u00a0Internet of Things (IoT), and Automation. Feel free to post your feedback on this article in the comment section at the post bottom.\n\nTable of Contents\n\nComparing Blockchain to an Excel Sheet\nWhat is a blockchain?\nDefinition of Blockchain\nWho invented blockchain technology?\nInternet Technology vs Blockchain Technology\nTechnologies behind blockchain technology!\nWhat is the need for blockchain technology?\nBlockchain technology \u2013 opportunities and advantages\nBlockchain Technology \u2013 Criticisms and Challenges\nSummary\nReferences\nComparing Blockchain to an Excel Sheet\n\nImagine a Microsoft Excel Sheet file on your laptop with details of some transactions you made. You can call it a ledger.\n\nNow, imagine that your Excel Sheet file is copied to hundreds of your friends\u2019 computers, connected forming a network. The ledger in your laptop has become a distributed ledger.\n\nThen imagine that this network of computers is designed with a technology to regularly update this Excel Sheet, whenever you or your friends update the ledger.\n\nYou now have a basic understanding of the blockchain!\n\nWhat is a blockchain?\n\nIn simple terms, blockchain is a digital ledger.\n\n\ud83d\udc49 Which year are YOU targeting for success in the IAS/IPS/IFS Exam? \ud83d\ude80\n\n(1) \u21d2 UPSC 2025: Prelims cum Mains\n\n(2) \u21d2 UPSC 2026: Prelims cum Mains\n\n(3) \u21d2 UPSC 2027 Prelims cum Mains\n\nTip: Know more about ClearIAS Courses (Online/Offline)\n\nWondering what is a ledger?\n\nA ledger is a book containing accounts to which debits and credits are posted from books of original entry.\n\nA blockchain is a digitized, decentralized, public\u00a0ledger. So simple, right?\n\nDefinition of Blockchain\nThe main chain (black) consists of the longest series of blocks from the genesis block (green) to the current block. Orphan blocks (purple) exist outside of the main chain.\n\nThe blockchain is an incorruptible digital ledger of transactions that can be programmed to record virtually everything of value.\n\nEach list of records in a blockchain is called a block.\n\nSo a blockchain\u00a0is a continuously growing list of records called blocks, which are linked and secured.\n\nWho invented blockchain technology?\n\nBlockchain Technology was invented by\u00a0Satoshi Nakamoto\u00a0in 2008 for use in the\u00a0cryptocurrency\u00a0bitcoin, as its public transaction\u00a0ledger.\u00a0Satoshi Nakamoto\u2019s aim in creating the decentralized Bitcoin ledger\u2014the blockchain\u2014was to allow users to control their own money so that no third party, not even the government, would be able to access or monitor it.\n\nThe creator of Bitcoin, Satoshi, disappeared back in 2011, leaving behind open-source software that the users of Bitcoin could update and improve.\n\nThe invention of the blockchain for Bitcoin made it the first digital currency to solve the double spending problem without the need of a trusted central authority or central server.\n\nThe Bitcoin design has been the inspiration for other applications.\n\nInternet Technology vs Blockchain Technology\n\nIn the 1990s, when internet technology (TCP/IP or HTTP) was in the native stages, email was the first major application. Later new applications like web browsers came. Websites became popular. People started using chat software like Skype. Now if you look at your mobile, see how many different applications are run using the Internet.\n\nSimilarly, when blockchain technology emerged, bitcoin was the first major application that used it. Other cryptocurrencies followed the trend. Now, blockchain technology is used in a variety of applications like security, online voting, etc.\n\nSimply put, the Internet allows computers to exchange information; Blockchain allows computers to record information.\n\nBoth use a lot\u00a0of computers (nodes).\n\nThe Digital Economy, Wikinomics is bold on the subject and reflects on Blockchain that:\n\nThe first generation of the digital revolution brought us the Internet of information. The second generation \u2014 powered by blockchain technology \u2014 is bringing us the Internet of value: a new platform to\u00a0reshape the world of business and transform the old order of human affairs for the better.\n\nBlockchain is a vast, global distributed ledger or database running on millions of devices and open to anyone, where not just information but anything of value \u2014 money, but also titles, deeds, identities, even votes \u2014 can be moved, stored and managed securely and privately. Trust is established through mass collaboration and clever code rather than by powerful intermediaries like governments and banks.\n\nTechnologies behind blockchain technology!\n\nPrivate Key Cryptography\nP2P Network (Peer-2-Peer)\nProgram (the blockchain\u2019s protocol)\nWhat is the need for blockchain technology?\n\nThe blockchain is a mechanism to bring everyone to the highest degree of accountability. No more missed transactions, human or machine errors, or an exchange that was not done with the consent of the parties involved.\n\nThe most critical area where Blockchain helps is to guarantee the validity of a transaction by recording it not only on the main register but a connected distributed system of registers, all of which are connected through a secure validation mechanism.\n\nBlockchain technology can find applications in the following areas in the future:\n\nSmart contracts \u2013 Any industry heavily reliant on contracts, such as insurance, financial institutions, real estate, construction, entertainment, and law, would benefit from blockchain\u2019s indisputable way of updating, managing, tracking, and securing contracts. Smart contracts, those that are embedded with if/then statements and are executed without the involvement of an intermediary, also use blockchain technology.\nSupply chain management \u2013\u00a0Whenever value changes hands or the status of an asset changes, blockchain is ideally suited for managing the process.\nAsset protection \u2013\u00a0Whether you\u2019re a musician who wants to ensure you get royalties when your music gets played or a property owner, blockchain technology can help you protect your assets by creating an indisputable record of real-time ownership.\nPersonal Identification \u2013 Governments manage vast amounts of personal data from birth and death records to marriage certificates, passports, and census data. Blockchain technology offers a streamlined solution for managing all of it securely.\nPayment processing \u2013\u00a0Blockchain has the potential to be highly transformative to any company that processes payments. It can eliminate the need for intermediaries that are common in payment processing today.\nCrowdfunding \u2013\u00a0As with traditional crowdfunding, a blockchain-powered crowdfunding campaign seeks to secure investment for a new project from an interested community. But in this instance, funding is most likely to come in the form of bitcoin or other cryptocurrencies.\nBlockchain technology \u2013 opportunities and advantages\n\nThe blockchain allows our smart devices to speak to each other better and faster.\nBlockchain solves the problem of manipulation.\u00a0It brings everyone to the highest degree of accountability.\nOnline identity and reputation will be decentralized. We will own the data that belongs to us.\nCryptocurrencies take the power away from governments to control the value of currencies and hand it to people.\nThe potential is great for people in the informal economy to exploit the blockchain\u2019s middleman-free way to exchange assets.\nBlockchain technology can more equitably address issues related to freedom, jurisdiction, censorship, and regulation, perhaps in ways that nation-state models and international diplomacy efforts regarding human rights cannot.\nBlockchain-based systems allow for the removal of intermediaries involved in the record-keeping and transfer of assets.\nThe removal of intermediaries and settlement on distributed ledgers allows for dramatically increased transaction speeds compared to a wide range of existing systems.\nData entered on the blockchain is immutable, preventing fraud through manipulating transactions and the history of data. Transactions entered on the blockchain provide a clear trail to the very start of the blockchain allowing any transaction to be easily investigated and audited.\n\nRead:\u00a0National Blockchain Framework\n\nBlockchain Technology \u2013 Criticisms and Challenges\n\nHuge power required: Remember all that computing power required to verify transactions? Those computers need electricity. Bitcoin is a poster child of the problematic escalation in power demanded by a large blockchain network. That\u2019s not appealing given today\u2019s concerns about climate change, the availability of power in developing countries, and the reliability of power in developed nations.\n\nSecurity about the private key: The private key must remain secret at all times because revealing it to third parties is equivalent to giving them control over the bitcoins secured by that key. The private key must also be backed up and protected from accidental loss, because if it\u2019s lost it cannot be recovered and the funds secured by it are forever lost, too.\n\nTransaction speed: Transaction speed is also an issue. As we noted above, blocks in a chain must be verified by the distributed network, and that can take time.\n\nSummary\n\nIn scaling society up from tribes and small groups, governments have had to confront the problem of enabling secure commerce and other interactions among strangers. The methods now may be very different, but the goal is still the same \u2013 a secure way of transactions.\n\nThe complex world of big data and IoT is emerging.\u00a0 Blockchain\u00a0will be an important part of our financial and technological digital future.\n\nThe \u2018blockchain\u2019 technology behind Bitcoin could prove to be an ingredient of an entirely new world of technology, as big as the internet itself, a wave of innovation that drives the middleman out of much commerce and leaves us much more free to exchange goods and services with people all over the world without going through corporate intermediaries.\n\nIt could radically decentralize society itself, getting rid of the need for banks, governments, even companies and politicians.\n\nRead:\u00a0Bitcoin halving\n\nReferences\nInvestopedia\u00a0| FusionTourism\u00a0| Blockgeeks\u00a0| Wikipedia\u00a0| Digitial Trends\u00a0| Efuture\u00a0| Forbes",

Fears that automation will kill more jobs continues to grow.\n\nNow, the world is dealing not only with robots that do physical labor but with Artificial Intelligence that does mental labor as well.\n\nTable of Contents\n\nWhat is Automation?\nWhat is the Timeline of Automation?\n\u00a0What are the major advantages of automation?\nWhat are the main disadvantages of automation?\nWhat are some applications of Automation in society?\nWhat are the new challenges emerging out of automation?\nParadox of Automation\nConclusion\nWhat is Automation?\n\nIt was first coined in 1948, in the manufacturing sense, by Ford Motors Vice President Delmar S. Harder.\nAutomation or automatic control is about the usage of various control systems for the operation of equipment such as machinery, processes in factories, boilers, and heat treating ovens, switching on telephone networks, steering, and stabilization of ships, aircraft and other applications and vehicles with insignificant or reduced human involvement.\nIn other words, it can also mean the use of computers to control a specific process in order to upturn consistency and efficacy thereby reducing human labor.\nWhat is the Timeline of Automation?\nDate\n\t\nDevelopments\n\n\n1500-1600\n\t\nWater power for metalworking; rolling mills for coinage strips.\n\n\n1600-1700\n\t\nHand lathe for wood; mechanical calculator.\n\n\n1700-1800\n\t\nBoring, turning, and screw cutting lathe, drill press\n\n\n1800-1900\n\t\nCopying lathe, turret lathe, universal milling machine; advanced mechanical calculators.\n\n\n1808\n\t\nSheet-metal cards with punched holes for automatic control of weaving patterns in looms.\n\n\n1863\n\t\nAutomatic piano player (Pianola)\n\n\n1900-1920\n\t\nGeared lathe; automatic screw machine; automatic bottle-making machine.\n\n\n1920\n\t\nFirst use of the word robot\n\n\n1920-1940\n\t\nTransfer machines; mass production.\n\n\n1940\n\t\nFirst electronic computing machine.\n\n\n1943\n\t\nFirst digital electronic computer.\n\n\n1945\n\t\nThe first use of the word automation.\n\n\n1947\n\t\nThe invention of the transistor.\n\n\n1952\n\t\nFirst prototype numerical control machine tool.\n\n\n1954\n\t\nDevelopment of the symbolic language APT (Automatically Programmed Tool); adaptive control.\n\n\n1957\n\t\nCommercially available NC machine tools.\n\n\n1959\n\t\nIntegrated circuits; first use of the term group technology\n\n\n1960\n\t\nIndustrial robots.\n\n\n1965\n\t\nLarge-scale integrated circuits\n\n\n1968\n\t\nProgrammable logic controllers\n\n\n1970s\n\t\nFirst integrated manufacturing system; spot welding of automobile bodies with robots; microprocessors; minicomputer-controlled robot; flexible manufacturing system; group technology.\n\n\n1980s\n\t\nArtificial intelligence; intelligent robots; smart sensors; untended manufacturing cells.\n\n\n1990-2000s\n\t\nIntegrated manufacturing systems; intelligent and sensor-based machines; telecommunications and global manufacturing networks; fuzzy-logic devices; artificial neural networks; Internet tools; virtual environments; high-speed information systems\n\n\n2000-onwards\n\t\n4th Industrial Revolution, Internet of Things (IoT), Wearable devices, Personal and professional robots, Robotics from manufacturing to services and even the primary sectors of the economy, Big data.\n\u00a0What are the major advantages of automation?\nIt can replace hard physical and monotonous work such as daily routine works.\nIt can be maintained and even upgraded by simple quality checks.\nIncreased throughput time that is time to complete a job, therefore, increased productivity.\nImproved quality due to the replacement of humans by machines, therefore, reducing human induced errors.\nImproved reliability of processes and products by timely problem escalation and resolution if any the process or the product.\nIncreased speed of production due to advancement in technology, therefore, better production time and thus higher output.\nSavings on the long-term costs of the labor and the cost of poor quality.\nHigher flexibility of skills as well as adaptation.\nIn the jobs where there is a requirement of hard physical or monotonous work or dangerous environments (i.e. fire, space, volcanoes, nuclear facilities, underwater, etc.), robots can deliver better.\nSome tasks which are beyond human capabilities of size, weight, speed, endurance, such as lifting heavy machines, faster computing, weather perdition etc can be done be them efficiently.\nOpen opportunities at the higher level in the development, deployment, maintenance and running of the automated processes.\nWhat are the main disadvantages of automation?\nSecurity and vulnerability to hacking.\nThe rise of unemployment across the manufacturing and services sectors and in the short term it would prove to be a huge challenge to the administration.\nInitial costs during the research and development may sometimes exceed the cost saved by automating the process.\nThe initial capital requirement is very high and common people can\u2019t afford it.\nThe decrease in demand for human labor due to machines and intelligent robots taking over the jobs in the manufacturing and the services sectors. For example: In china, some customs officers are now robots, in Japan robots as housemaid is emerging trend.\nAutomated technologies falling into the hands of the terror groups may unleash modern terror network including machine and therefore vulnerability of humans may magnify.\nWhat are some applications of Automation in society?\n\nAutomation is playing many roles across the sectors to ease human life and make living conditions better. Some of its applications are:\n\nManufacturing sector: Industrial robots have changed the game of production and now a single production line can produce multiple variants and therefore minimize the cost and optimize the timing of production.\nHealth Sector: Automation of surgical instruments, health database and information on diseases of different types has led to the faster diagnosis and better drug prescription and further higher survival rates to the humans.\nService sector: Robots are replacing to humans in the jobs across the restaurants, tourism, customs in the developed countries however it is still in nascent phase.\nEducation: New kinds of tools which would be based upon the skill set and capability of the student can be developed. It can lead to education as per need, not as a directly forced medicine.\nWomen and children: Automation can lead to the better surveillance system and therefore reduced crimes against them.\nCorruption: Automation in governance such as E-governance, in service delivery system such as E-sahyog may start an era of more transparent and good governance.\nAutomated retail stores: Example \u2013 Macdonald keep robots as waiting manager, Bengaluru-based Pace Automation Ltd. has partnered with IBM to provide a cloud-based solution to help native Kirana merchants turn into e-tailers.\nAutomated stores: Many supermarkets across the developed countries are going full automation to save costs.\nAutomated Mining: We often hear the loss of human lives due to mining accidents. Therefore to reduce such instances people are being replaced by robots.\nAutomated highway system: It\u2019s very popular in western countries and recently our government has announced road safety policy on similar lines.\nEmerging trend is about Home automation using Internet of things where appliances are connected either by apps or by any local machine.\nWearable devices: Next step of revolution is different kinds of devices which can monitor health 24*7*365 and even apply for medicines if required. Further, they will take care of other needs such as connectivity, exercise, education etc. Therefore all in one machine.\nWeather prediction: Natural calamities such as droughts, tsunami, floods, cyclones etc. can be predicted in advance and further early warning systems can help in reducing human and environmental loss.\nIT Automation: In judiciary may lead to faster resolution of cases and reduce justice delivery time.\nAutomated patrolling: of border areas may strengthen our internal and border security and help in curbing cross-border terrorist infiltrations, human-animal-resource trafficking at the borders.\nWhat are the new challenges emerging out of automation?\n\nSafety and security of data.\nAs per a World Bank report, Automation looms threat on 69 percent of the jobs in India and 77 percent in China.\nAs per reports by HR Honchos, 60% of the global workforce may get displaced in future by the automation and artificial\nThe threat to privacy which is evident from the recent hacking of Debit cards.\nRegulation of these new technologies.\nThe textile sector which used to employ 40 workers for an investment of 1 crore now employs only 25 workers per Rs.1 crore.(Texprocil and Ernest & Young report)\nRising unemployment due to faster change of skills and technologies.\nModern cyber criminals who remains invisible and cause pain to millions by direct or indirect criminality.\nIt has become a tool for the terror group to spread their propaganda and attract young youths. For example social media such as Facebook, twitter has become hiring tool for them.\nA recent emerging threat is about the \u201cTrust\u201d on machines. Recent elections where EVMs were used led to some people speculating that they have been compromised. Therefore they may sometimes pose administrative challenges of this sort.\nParadox of Automation\n\nThe Paradox of Automation says that the more efficient the automated system, the more crucial the human contribution of the operators. Though the number of humans involved is less, their involvement becomes more critical. If an automated system has an error, it will multiply that error until it\u2019s fixed or shut down. This is where human operators come in.\n\n\ud83d\udc49 Which year are YOU targeting for success in the IAS/IPS/IFS Exam? \ud83d\ude80\n\n(1) \u21d2 UPSC 2025: Prelims cum Mains\n\n(2) \u21d2 UPSC 2026: Prelims cum Mains\n\n(3) \u21d2 UPSC 2027 Prelims cum Mains\n\nTip: Know more about ClearIAS Courses (Online/Offline)\n\nA fatal example of this was Air France Flight 447, where a failure of automation put the pilots into a manual situation they were not prepared for.\n\nConclusion\n\nMany experts have described the rise of automation as one of the most important economic and social developments in history. The World Economic Forum (WEF) has characterized it as the fulcrum of a 4th Industrial Revolution. Moreover, the economist Andrew McAfee said, \u201cDigital technologies are doing for human brainpower what the steam engine and related technologies did for human muscle power during the Industrial Revolution. They\u2019re allowing us to overcome many limitations rapidly and to open up new frontiers with unprecedented speed. It\u2019s a very big deal. But how exactly it will play out is uncertain.\u201d\n\nIt may cause unemployment, unease in the mindset of masses, and even social conflict at many conflicts at many reasons. In the short run, it is very difficult to predict who will get the most of the benefits however better policy guidelines, better regulations, and social security measures will essentially bring overall goodness to the society.\n\nArticle by: Nishant\u00a0Raj.

    "[CONTENT] #84": "Almost everyone is familiar with the term computer virus, but only a few might have heard about the term malware. A computer virus is a type of malware. Malware includes computer\u00a0viruses,\u00a0worms,\u00a0Trojan horses, spyware, ransomware and many others. In this post, we analyse the different types of malware including the Wannacry, which is a form of ransomware.\n\nTable of Contents\n\nWhat is a Malware?\nEvolution of Malware\nWhat is the purpose of creating a Malware?\nList of Common Malware types:\nHow does a Malware spread?\nRecent case of Malware attack: WannaCry\nWhat is WannaCry?\nWhat is the Origin of Wannacry attack?\nWhat does it do the computer?\nHow does it spread?\nHow to remain protected from ransomware?\nSome Initiatives by Government of India:\nWhat is a Malware?\n\nMalware is the shortened form of malicious software.\nMalware is an umbrella term used to refer to a variety of forms of hostile or intrusive software including Ransom wares, Computer Viruses, Worms, Trojan Horses, Spyware, Adware, Scareware etc.\nThis is any program or file that is harmful to a computer user.\nThe term refers to software that is deployed with malicious intent.\nMalware can be deployed even remotely, and tracking the source of malware is hard.\nIt can take the form of executable code, scripts, active content, and other software.\nThese malicious programs can perform a variety of functions, including stealing, encrypting or deleting sensitive data, altering or hijacking core computing functions and monitoring users\u2019 computer activity without their permission.\nThis combination has enabled commercial malware providers to supply sophisticated black markets for both malware and the information that it collects.\nEvolution of Malware\nComputer-enabled fraud and service theft evolved in parallel with the information technology that enabled it.\nThe term malware was first used by computer scientist and security research YisraelRadai in 1990.\nBefore the term malware, malicious software was referred to as computer viruses.\nOne of the first known examples of malware was the Creeper virus in 1971, which was created as an experiment by BBN Technologies engineer Robert Thomas.\nWhat is the purpose of creating a Malware?\nInitially, it started as a prank among software developers. However, later on, malware converted into a full-fledged industry of black and white market.\nIt may be used by black hat hackers or even some governments for monitoring their targets.\nDemand for sophisticated malware is created primarily by organised crime syndicates and state-sponsored espionage agents.\n\nMalware is typically used:\n\nTo steal information that can be readily monetized, such as login credentials, credit card and bank account numbers,\nAnd intellectual property such as computer software, financial algorithms, and trade secrets.\nTo ransom money in Bitcoin, for example, Wannacry Ransomware.\nSpy on computer users for an extended period without their knowledge, for example, Reign Malware.\nIt may be designed to cause harm, often as sabotage for example Stuxnet.\nExtort payment for example Cryptolocker.\nList of Common Malware types:\n\nAdware: The least dangerous and most lucrative Malware. Adware displays ads on your computer.\nSpyware: Spyware is software that spies on you, tracking your internet activities in order to send advertising (Adware) back to your system.\nVirus: A virus is a contagious program or code that attaches itself to another piece of software, and then reproduces itself when that software is run. Most often this is spread by sharing software or files between computers.\nSpam: Spamming is a method of flooding the Internet with copies of the same message. Most spams are commercial advertisements which are sent as an unwanted email to users. Spams are also known as Electronic junk emails or junk newsgroup postings. These spam emails are very annoying as it keeps coming every day and keeps your mailbox full.\nWorm: A program that replicates itself and destroys data and files on the computer. Worms work to \u201ceat\u201d the system operating files and data files until the drive is empty.\nTrojan: A Trojan horse or Trojan is a type of malware that is often disguised as legitimate software. Trojans are written with the purpose of discovering your financial information, taking over your computer\u2019s system resources, and in larger systems creating a \u201cdenial-of-service attack\u201d which is making a machine or network resource unavailable to those attempting to reach it. Example: Google, AOL, Yahoo or your business network becoming unavailable.\nBackdoors: Backdoors are much the same as Trojans or worms, except that they open a \u201cbackdoor\u201d on a computer, providing a network connection for hackers or other Malware to enter or for viruses or SPAM to be sent.\nRootkit: This one is likened to the burglar hiding in the attic, waiting to take from you while you are not home. It is the hardest of all Malware to detect and therefore to remove; many experts recommend completely wiping your hard drive and reinstalling everything from scratch. It is designed to permit the other information gathering Malware in to get the identity information from your computer without you realising anything is going on.\nKeyloggers: Records everything you type on your PC in order to glean your log-in names, passwords, and other sensitive information, and send it on to the source of the keylogging program. Many times keyloggers are used by corporations and parents to acquire computer usage information.\nRogue security software: This one deceives or misleads users. It pretends to be a good program to remove Malware infections, but all the while it is the Malware. Often it will turn off the real Anti-Virus software.\nRansomware: If you see this screen that warns you that you have been locked out of your computer until you pay for your cybercrimes. Your system is severely infected with a form of Malware called Ransomware. Even if you pay to unlock the system, the system is unlocked, but you are not free of it locking you out again.\nBrowser Hijacker: When your homepage changes to one that looks like those in the images inserted next, you may have been infected with one form or another of a Browser Hijacker. This dangerous Malware will redirect your normal search activity and give you the results the developers want you to see. Its intention is to make money off your web surfing. Using this homepage and not removing the Malware lets the source developers capture your surfing interests.\nHow does a Malware spread?\n\nCybercriminals continuously devise innovative resources to get malware into the computer. Here are some of the most common ways of spreading:\n\nEmail: Cybercriminals are notorious for including malicious attachments and links in emails that appear to come from friends, reputable organisations, or other trusted sources. Some malicious emails can even infect your computer from the email client\u2019s preview pane, without your opening or be downloading an attachment or a link.\nThe Internet: Surfing the Web may feel like a private activity, but in fact, you\u2019re exposing your computer to unwanted contact with anyone else who has a computer and Internet access.\nOutdated software: Malwares can crawl the Internet, looking for vulnerabilities of outmoded software to spread its influence over computer systems.\nLocal Area Networks (LANs): A LAN is a group of locally connected computers that can share information over a private network. If one computer becomes infected with malware, all other computers in the LAN may quickly become infected as well.\nInstant messaging (IM) and peer-to-peer (P2P) file-sharing systems: If one is using a client for these online activities, malware may spread to your computer.\nSocial networks: Malware authors take advantage of many popular social networks, infecting the massive user-data networks with worms. If a social website account is infected with a worm, just about anyone who visits a poster\u2019s profile page could \u201ccatch\u201d the worm on her system.\nPop-ups: Some of the most sophisticated malware spreads through well-disguised screen pop-ups that look like genuine alerts or messages. One particularly devious and widespread \u201choax pop-up\u201d claims to have scanned your computer and detected malware. If you attempt to remove the malware as urged, you\u2019ll actually\u00a0install\u00a0the malware.\nComputer storage media: Malware can be easily spread if you share computer storage media with others, such as USB drives, DVDs, and CDs. While it may seem safe to open a CD of photos from a colleague, it\u2019s always best to scan unfamiliar files first for possible corruptions or security risks before you copy or open them.\nMobile devices: Mobile malware threats have become increasingly prevalent, as more people use their smartphones and tablets as mini-computers, helping malware problems proliferate across additional platforms.\nRecent case of Malware attack: WannaCry\n\nIn 2017 May, there was a massive global ransomware attack. The attack infected more than 230,000 computers in 150 countries including India, demanding ransom payments in bitcoin in 28 languages.\n\n\ud83d\udc49 Which year are YOU targeting for success in the IAS/IPS/IFS Exam? \ud83d\ude80\n\n(1) \u21d2 UPSC 2025: Prelims cum Mains\n\n(2) \u21d2 UPSC 2026: Prelims cum Mains\n\n(3) \u21d2 UPSC 2027 Prelims cum Mains\n\nTip: Know more about ClearIAS Courses (Online/Offline)\n\nWhat is WannaCry?\n\nWannaCry is Encrypting Ransomware or Crypto Locker type of ransomware that is programmed to attack Microsoft Windows software.\nAccording to some statistics, hackers extorted business and institutions for more than $209 million in Ransomware payments in the first three months of 2016. The business of Ransomware is on pace to be a $1 billion a year crime.\nShadow Brokers: People (Hackers) behind these attacks call themselves by this term.\n\nSeverely affected:\n\nBritain\u2019s National Health Service (NHS),\nSpain\u2019s Telef\u00f3nica,\nFedEx\u00a0(USA)\nDeutsche Bahn\nSeveral plants of carmakers Renault and Nissan had stopped production in France and England due to the malware,\nThe Russian Interior Ministry had reported about 1,000 computers.\nAffected Areas in India: Andra Pradesh, Kerala, some Pharma companies and over 48,000 attempts of ransomware attacks were detected in India. 60% of the attempts targeted enterprises, while 40% targeted individual customers said a cyber-security firm, Quick Heal Technologies.\nWhat is the Origin of Wannacry attack?\nIt is said by Wikileaks that National Security Agency (NSA) of USA had these methods to have monitored over subjects.\nThis loophole was recently leaked by WikiLeaks.\nThe same vulnerability of Windows Operating system was used by ransomware.\nHowever, Microsoft had released the security patches for the same earlier.\nWhat does it do the computer?\nSome variants of ransomware encrypt data in such a way that it is impossible to decrypt unless the user has an encryption key. These are called \u2018Encrypting Ransomware\u2019\u00a0that incorporate advanced encryption methods.\nAnother type of ransomware that is frequently circulated is\u00a0\u2018Locker ransomware, which locks the victim out of the operating system, making it impossible to access the desktop and any apps or files.\u00a0CryptoLocker, like WannaCry, is a malware when injected into a host system, scans the hard drive of the victim and targets specific file extensions and encrypts them.\nHow does it spread?\nWannacry encrypts the files on an infected computer.\nIt spreads by using a vulnerability in implementations of Server Message Block (SMB) of Windows systems. This exploit is known as ETERNALBLUE.\nIt encrypts hard disk/drive and then spread laterally between computers on the same LAN.\nIt also spreads through the malicious Email-attachment.\nHow to remain protected from ransomware?\n\nRegular Data Backup: This helps restore the last saved data and minimise data loss. Ransomware also attacks servers; hence it is important to have a backup on a disconnected hard drive or external device on the pre-defined regular basis.\nPrevention:\u00a0To prevent infiltration of malware, having password protected tools to identify and filter certain file extensions like \u201c.exe\u201d or \u201c. Zip\u201d, are essential. Emails that appear suspicious should also be filtered at the exchange level. There are also some tools that detect the entry of such malware with features of zero days\u2019 protection which work on threat emulation and threat extraction techniques. Users and businesses also need to ensure that hidden file extension is displayed since it becomes easier to filter them.\nUser awareness:\u00a0Awareness among users needs to be created to avoid opening the unsolicited attachment. Malware is typically designed to mimic identities of people that users interact with on a regular basis either on a personal or professional level.\nRules in IPS:\u00a0It\u2019s necessary to create rules in the Intrusion Prevention Software (IPS) to discard or disallow the opening of files with extension \u201c.exe\u201d from local App data folders or AppData.\nRegular patch and upgrades:\u00a0To prevent leaks or vulnerabilities in software, ensure to regularly update the software versions and apply patches released by the vendor. These patches and version are often released to wrestle with known or newly discovered exploits and can prevent known signatures of these malware, Trojans or ransomware to enter the system.\nInstall and run anti-malware and firewall software. When selecting software, choose a program that offers tools for detecting, quarantining, and removing multiple types of malware.\nThe combination of anti-malware software and a firewall will ensure that all incoming and existing data gets scanned for malware and that malware can be safely removed once detected.\nKeep software and operating systems up to date with current vulnerability patches. These patches are often released to patch bugs or other security flaws that could be exploited by attackers.\nBe vigilant when downloading files, programs, attachments, etc. Downloads that seem strange or are from an unfamiliar source often contain malware.\nSome Initiatives by Government of India:\nNational Cyber Security Policy 2013: Indian Government already have a National Cyber Security Policy in place. The National Cyber Security Policy document outlines a roadmap to create a framework for comprehensive, collaborative and collective response to deal with the issue of cyber security at all levels within the country.\nComputer Emergency Response Team (CERT-In) has been designated to act as a nodal agency for coordination of crisis management efforts. CERT-In will also act as an umbrella organisation for coordination actions and operationalization of sectoral CERTs. CERT-in will also issue early warnings.\nCyber\u00a0Swachhta\u00a0Kendra: The \u201cCyber\u00a0Swachhta\u00a0Kendra\u201d is a Botnet Cleaning and Malware Analysis Centre (BCMAC), operated by the Indian Computer Emergency Response Team (CERT-In) as part of the Government of India\u2019s Digital India initiative under the Ministry of Electronics and Information Technology (MeitY). Its goal is to create a secure cyberspace by detecting botnet infections in India and to notify, enable cleaning and securing systems of end users so as to prevent further infections.\n\nArticle by: Nishant\u00a0Raj.

Read to know more.\n\nThe dark web or darknet is in the news frequently. It is important to understand the different terminologies associated with the concept. As easy as it is available to use, the sheer complexity of it in the cyber world is baffling and hard to trace or control.\n\nThe easy availability of dark web forums dedicated to freely sharing privacy-enabling technologies, intrusion software, and exploitable code means global law enforcement agencies are constantly engaged.\n\nTable of Contents\n\nWhat is a dark web or darknet?\nSurface web vs Deep Web vs Dark Web (DarkNet)\nWhat is the deep web?\nWhat is Darknet?\nThe exploitation of the dark web\nChallenges to regulate the dark web\nWay forward\nWhat is a dark web or darknet?\n\nSubscribe to the ClearIAS YouTube Channel for more informative videos on UPSC preparation, tips, and strategies. Stay updated with our latest content and enhance your exam readiness.\n\nThe darknet is a part of the internet that cannot be accessed through traditional search engines like Google nor is it accessible by normal browsers like Chrome or Safari.\n\nIt uses non-standard communication protocols which make it inaccessible to internet service providers (ISPs) or government authorities.\n\n\ud83d\udc49 Which year are YOU targeting for success in the IAS/IPS/IFS Exam? \ud83d\ude80\n\n(1) \u21d2 UPSC 2025: Prelims cum Mains\n\n(2) \u21d2 UPSC 2026: Prelims cum Mains\n\n(3) \u21d2 UPSC 2027 Prelims cum Mains\n\nTip: Know more about ClearIAS Courses (Online/Offline)\n\nSurface web vs Deep Web vs Dark Web (DarkNet)\n\nThe World Wide Web (www) hosts the many connections of web pages on the network of computers connected through the internet. The www, or the web, consists of the \u2018surface\u2019 web and the \u2018deep\u2019 web.\n\nThe surface web is that portion that can be accessed by ordinary internet users using standard search engines like Google, Yahoo, etc. But it can retrieve only approximately 4 percent of the search results, while the majority of the results are hidden.\n\nWhat is the deep web?\n\nThe deep web constitutes 96 percent of the web- the password-protected or paywall-protected websites, including online banking services, for instance, are considered a part of the deep web. Such websites hold information relating to accounts of millions of individuals that are not accessible to the entire web population. The content of personal databases like email accounts, social media accounts, scientific and academic databases, legal documents, etc. that are accessible to only a closed group also forms part of the deep web.\n\nWhat is Darknet?\n\nThe darknet is a part of the deep web, but the deep web is accessible whereas the darknet is deliberately hidden.\n\nThe content of the darknet is encrypted and requires specific browsers such as TOR (The Onion Ring), FreeNet, Invisible Internet Project (I2P), TAILS (The Amnesic Incognito Live System), Whonix browser to access those pages.\n\nTOR was developed by United States Naval Research laboratory employees to protect US intelligence communications online. It is termed so as the traffic from the browser created several layers like those of an Onion before reaching the destination site.\n\nTOR is also used for legitimate purposes like secure and sensitive communications relating to medical ailments, helping law enforcement officials track down criminals, and assisting cybersecurity professionals to conduct security testing on their networks securely. It also provides access to social media websites in countries where they are banned. Using the Tor browser is not a criminal activity, although intelligence units keep track of Tor downloads to predict any possible criminal activity.\n\nAlso read: Dark Patterns\n\nThe exploitation of the dark web\n\nThe dark web has turned into the site of illegal transactions, posing a threat to cyberspace across multiple dimensions. Since anonymizers on the dark web make it difficult to track web patterns such as browsing history, location, etc., they are misused by criminals to hide their identities and carry out illegal activities.\n\nThe dark web market, \u2018Silk Road\u2019, was the first modern darknet market known for selling illegal drugs. This was taken down in 2013. But since then, users across the world have searched the online dark market to anonymously access weapons, credit card data, malware, Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS), stolen data, etc.\n\nCriminal and terrorist activities: The anonymous chat rooms and communication services on the dark web make it an ideal platform for planning and coordinating dangerous criminal and terrorist activities.\n\nDrug trafficking: In March 2021, the World Health Organisation (WHO) warned people against the sale of counterfeit COVID-19 vaccines, particularly on the dark web. Fraud services like fake vaccines have the potential to exploit the huge unmet global demand for COVID-19 vaccines criminally.\n\nIllegal activities like money laundering, drug trafficking, terrorism financing, ransomware, and cryptocurrencies on the dark web are all strongly linked to one another.\n\nChallenges to regulate the dark web\n\nEncryption technique and anonymity: This is one of the biggest challenges faced by the authorities- the dark web is completely anonymous making it difficult to attain sufficient information that could help combat cybercrimes and track criminals who exploit this space.\n\nCryptocurrency: Most financial transactions on the dark web are performed in cryptocurrencies which provide further anonymity. The technology of cryptocurrency called the blockchain is a digital ledger of transactions distributed across the network in which the blocks are cryptographically secured. It records information in a way that makes it difficult or impossible to modify or hack the system.\n\nBitcoin transactions have facilitated all kinds of illegal activities by cybercriminals and terrorists on the dark web and this has made it extremely difficult for law enforcement agencies to follow the trail of money to gather evidence of a crime. Regulation of cryptocurrencies is possible only concerning their legitimate use while a large portion of them can still be used for illegitimate purposes.\n\nWay forward\n\nThe dark web is a complex environment having both benefits and disadvantages based on whether it is utilized or exploited by the user.\n\nDarknet helps to protect the right to freedom of information and online privacy of individuals and is therefore often used by journalists and other activists across the world to carry out communication safely and securely. At the same time, it is misused by miscreants giving rise to a series of crimes.\nLaw enforcement agencies need to take a refined approach to protect the benefits of this space as well as eliminate the illegal activities in it.\nCooperation between public and private organizations can help in dealing with the new and emerging technological challenges of the dark web, by providing solutions such as new encrypting tools, etc. Law enforcement agencies should actively take the help of sophisticated technologies like artificial intelligence, machine learning, etc.\nA specified regulation on the amount of personal data collected by various companies and their automatic deletion after a stipulated period could increase the efficiency of cyber systems to secure the data and prevent such incidents in the future to a large extent.\nThe challenges of the trans-border nature of the dark web can be dealt with by sharing intelligence data across different sectors, agencies, and organizations.\nInternational cooperation in the form of multilateral exchanges through seminars, forums, and joint capacity-building exercises is highly beneficial in this regard.\n\nRelated article:\u00a0Dark patterns",

Let\u2019s discuss in this post certain keywords related to Space Technology and ISRO like GSLV D5, Cryogenic Engine, GSAT-14 etc.\n\nAlso read: Aditya-L1 Mission\n\nTable of Contents\n\nGSLV D5 : The rocket\nPropellants used in the three stages of GSLV\nAbout the cryogenic engine\nGSLV Variants:\nGSAT 14 : The Satellite\nPSLV and GSLV\nPerigee and Apogee\nTargeted Orbit of GSLV-D5\nMock questions to test your grasp\nRelated Posts\nGSLV D5 : The rocket\n\nFor beginners : Rocket and Satellite are two different entities. Rocket or launch vehicle is the vehicle used to launch satellites. In other words, launch vehicle will have a rocket engine in it and this rocket engine is fired to launch the satellites into the orbit. Examples of launch vehicles include PSLV, GSLV etc. Examples of satellites include GSAT, INSAT, IRS etc.\n\nGSLV D5: GSLV D5 is a rocket (launch vehicle) used to launch the satellite GSAT 14. The rocket engine used in this launch vehicle was a cryogenic one, which uses cryogenic propellants at low temperature.\n\nWhat\u2019s special about GSLV D5 launch?\u00a0India already had successfully launched many satellites using launch vehicles in the PSLV and GSLV series. But this was for the first time, India successfully launched a satellite using its indigenous developed cryogenic engine. In the previous missions of GSLV, we were using Russian Technology for cryogenic engines. But now, we have mastered cryogenic technology and have emerged as a major space power.\n\nGSLV is a three-stage launch vehicle with solid, liquid and\u00a0cryogenic stages. It is designed to inject 2 Ton class of\u00a0communication satellites to Geosynchronous Transfer Orbit\u00a0(GTO).\u00a0GSLV-D5 vehicle is configured with its first and second\u00a0stages similar to the ones\u00a0flown during earlier GSLV\u00a0missions. The third stage is\u00a0the indigenous cryogenic\u00a0stage.\n\n\ud83d\udc49 Which year are YOU targeting for success in the IAS/IPS/IFS Exam? \ud83d\ude80\n\n(1) \u21d2 UPSC 2025: Prelims cum Mains\n\n(2) \u21d2 UPSC 2026: Prelims cum Mains\n\n(3) \u21d2 UPSC 2027 Prelims cum Mains\n\nTip: Know more about ClearIAS Courses (Online/Offline)\n\nPropellants used in the three stages of GSLV\n1 Stage (Strap- Ones) : UH25 & N2O4.\n1 Stage (Core Stage) : \u00a0HTPB.\n2 Stage : UH25 & N2O4.\n3 Stage : LH2 & LOX.\n\nHTPB : Hydroxyl Terminated Poly Butadiene, LH2: Liquid Hydrogen, LOX : Liquid Oxygen.\nN2O4 : Nitrogen Tetroxide, UH25 : Unsymmetrical Dimethyl Hydrazine + 25% Hydrazine Hydrate.\n\nCryogenic propellants used in this mission: liquid oxygen at minus 183 degrees Celsius and liquid hydrogen at minus 253 degrees\u2019 Celsius.\n\nAbout the cryogenic engine\n\nIndia\u2019s indigenous cryogenic engine is named\u00a0CE-7.5.\u00a0\u00a0This\u00a0cryogenic rocket engine\u00a0is used\u00a0to power the upper stage of GSLV. The engine was developed as a part of the Cryogenic Upper Stage Project (CUSP). It will replace the\u00a0KVD-1\u00a0(RD-56) currently powering the upper stage of\u00a0GSLV.\n\nAdvantages: Cryogenic rocket stage is more efficient and provides more thrust for every kilogram of propellant it burns compared to solid and earth-storable liquid propellant rocket stages. Specific impulse (a measure of the efficiency) achievable with cryogenic propellants (liquid Hydrogen and liquid Oxygen) is much higher compared to earth storable liquid and solid propellants, giving it a substantial payload advantage. However, cryogenic stage is technically a very complex system compared to solid or earth-storable liquid propellant stages due to its use of propellants at extremely low temperatures and the associated thermal and structural problems.\n\nGSLV Variants:\n\nThe main variants are GSLV Mk.I and\u00a0GSLV Mk.II.\u00a0GSLV Mk.II\u00a0variant uses an Indian cryogenic engine, the\u00a0CE-7.5, and is capable of launching 2500\u00a0kg into geostationary transfer orbit. Previous GSLV vehicles (GSLV Mk.I) have used Russian cryogenic engines.\u00a0GSLV Mk.I had three sub-variants like\u00a0GSLV Mk.I (a),\u00a0GSLV Mk.I (b) and\u00a0GSLV Mk.I (c).\n\nGSAT 14 : The Satellite\n\nGSAT-14 is a\u00a01,982-kg \u00a0communication satellite.\u00a0GSAT-14 is expected to replace the GSAT-3 satellite, which was launched in 2004. GSAT-14 was launched by a Geosynchronous Satellite Launch Vehicle Mk.II (GSLV D5), which incorporated an Indian-built cryogenic engine on the third stage.\n\nAfter reaching\u00a0Geosynchronous Transfer Orbit (GTO),\u00a0GSAT-14 will use its own propulsion system to reach its geostationary\u00a0orbital home and will be stationed at 74\u00ba East longitude.\n\nGSAT-14 will help provide many satellite based communication services to the country including tele-education and telemedicine. The satellite carries six Ku-band and six Extended C-band transponders to provide coverage of the whole of India. GSAT-14 also carries two Ka-band beacons which will be used to conduct research into how weather affects Ka-band satellite communications. The satellite is powered by two solar arrays, generating 2,600 watts of power.\n\n\nPSLV and GSLV\nIndia had in the last two decades 25 consecutive successes of its Polar Satellite Launch Vehicles (PSLVs).\nGSLV could not claim such a success rate.\u00a0GSLV has attempted eight launches to date, since its first launch in 2001 through its most recent launch in 2014. Three launches have been successful, four have failed, and one was a partial failure, placing the satellite into an unplanned, but recoverable, orbit.\nWhile PSLV can carry satellites up to 2 tones to a low earth orbit, GSLV was needed for the launch of heavier satellites, especially of the telecommunication variety that need to be put in a 36,000km geosynchronous orbit.\nPerigee and Apogee\n\nPerigee is the point nearest to earth while Apogee is the farthest point from earth.\u00a0After a flight of 17 minutes 5 seconds, GSAT-14 satellite was precisely injected into a Geosynchronous Transfer Orbit with a Perigee (nearest point to Earth) of 175 km and an Apogee (farthest point to Earth) of 35,945 km with an orbital inclination of 19.3 degree with respect to the equator.\n\nTargeted Orbit of GSLV-D5\nPerigee : 180 \u00b1 5 km\nApogee : 35975 \u00b1 675 km\nInclination : 19.3 \u00b1 0.1 deg\nMock questions to test your grasp\n\nQn 1 : Which among the following statements are true regarding India\u2019s space technology?\n\nGSAT and PSLV are the main rocket launching vehicles of India.\nSatellite launching center of India is at Wheeler Islands, Odisha.\nIndia\u2019s indigenous cryogenic engine is named Cryo 2014.\n\nAnswer Choices :\n\nA: 1 only.\nB: \u00a02 and 3 only.\nC: All the above.\nD: None of the above.\n\nQn 2: Which among the following statements is true?\n\nThe Perigee of a satellite corresponds to the farthest point from Earth in its orbit.\nBefore placing GSAT 14 into the final Geosynchronous orbit, it was first placed into the Geosynchronous Transfer Orbit (GTO)\nIndia\u2019s indigenous cryogenic engine used for GSAT 14 launch, used liquid Hydrogen and Oxygen in its cryogenic stage.\nGSLV D5 had 4 stages.\nGSAT 14 carried Ku band transponders as well as C band transponders.\n\nAnswer Choices :\n\nA: 1 only.\nB: \u00a02 and 3 only.\nC: 2, 3, and 5 only.\nD: 1, 3, and 5 only.\nRelated Posts\nGreen Propulsion System\nISRO\u2019s World Record PSLV C37 Launch: Top 10 Facts You Should Know",

    "[CONTENT] #96": "The successful testing of the Scramjet engine designed by ISRO represents a major milestone in India\u2019s future space programs. But what is a Scramjet Engine?\n\nA scramjet engine, short for Supersonic Combustion Ramjet, is an advanced air-breathing propulsion system designed for high-speed flight in the hypersonic regime, typically defined as speeds greater than Mach 5.\n\nUnlike traditional jet engines, scramjets do not use rotating compressors and turbines. Instead, they rely on the forward speed of the vehicle to compress incoming air before combustion.\n\nTable of Contents\n\nWhat is a Scramjet Engine?\nWhat is the main difference between a Jet and a Rocket engine?\nJet Engine\nThe main processes in a Jet Engine\nTypes of Jet Engines\nScramjet (Supersonic Combustion Ramjet): Operation Details\nKey Features of Scramjet Engines\nIndia and Scramjet Technology\nScramjet \u2013 Challenges \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\nThe importance of having this technology\nAvatar\nSummary\nWhat is a Scramjet Engine?\nAn illustration of a jet plane with a Scramjet Engine attached at the bottom\n\nTo make it simple, a scramjet is a\u00a0supersonic combusting ramjet). This is a variant of a ramjet jet engine in which combustion takes place in supersonic airflow.\n\nAir Inlet: Scramjets are most effective at high speeds where the incoming air can be compressed without the need for traditional compressors. The engine has an inlet that slows down and compresses incoming air.\nSupersonic Combustion: As the air enters the combustion chamber, it is mixed with fuel (typically hydrogen) and ignited. Unlike traditional jet engines, where air enters the combustion chamber at subsonic speeds, scramjets rely on supersonic combustion, meaning the air is still moving at very high speeds when combustion occurs.\nExpansion and Exhaust: The combustion process generates high-velocity exhaust gases, which are expelled from the engine to produce thrust. The high-speed exhaust gases are then expelled through a nozzle to further accelerate the exhaust flow.\n\nAs Scramjet is essentially a Ramjet with variations, it would be easy if we started our learning process from Ramjet. Let\u2019s first start with the basics \u2013 the difference between a jet engine and a rocket engine.\n\nWhat is the main difference between a Jet and a Rocket engine?\n\nThe main difference is that a rocket carries its supply of oxygen (Oxidizer Tank) for combustion while a jet engine utilizes oxygen from the atmosphere for combustion. This makes rocket engines less energy efficient when compared to Jet engines.\n\n\ud83d\udc49 Which year are YOU targeting for success in the IAS/IPS/IFS Exam? \ud83d\ude80\n\n(1) \u21d2 UPSC 2025: Prelims cum Mains\n\n(2) \u21d2 UPSC 2026: Prelims cum Mains\n\n(3) \u21d2 UPSC 2027 Prelims cum Mains\n\nTip: Know more about ClearIAS Courses (Online/Offline)\n\nJet Engine\n\nA jet engine is a machine that converts energy-rich, liquid fuel into a powerful pushing force called thrust. The thrust from one or more engines pushes a plane forward, forcing air past its scientifically shaped wings to create an upward force called lift that powers it into the sky.\n\nThe first operational Jet Engine was developed by Hans von Ohain of Germany. But the credit for its discovery went to Great Britain\u2019s Frank Whittle (1930).\n\nThe main processes in a Jet Engine\n\nA Jet Engine has 3 main processes:\n\n1. Compression\n\nIt increases the pressure of the air trapped inside the chamber.\n\n2. \u00a0Combustion\n\nIt increases the temperature of the air-fuel mixture by releasing heat energy from the fuel.\n\n3. Exhaust\n\nIt increases the velocity of the exhaust gases, thereby powering the vehicle. (Newton\u2019s third law of motion)\n\nTypes of Jet Engines\n\nAll jet engines and gas turbines work in broadly the same way. Hence they all share five key components: an inlet, a compressor, a combustion chamber, and a turbine (arranged in exactly that sequence) with a driveshaft running through them. Even though they have similarities, jet engines differ in their extra components. The main types of Jet engines based on how air is compressed in the engine are as below:\n\n1. Turbo Jet\n\nThe Turbojet engine is an air-breathing jet engine.\u00a0This is one of the most common types of jet engines. It is still widely used in airplanes.\n\n2. Turbofan Engines\n\nTurbofans differ from turbojets in the way they have an additional component \u2013 a fan.\u00a0The fan sucks in the air and then further gets compressed and combustion takes place in the burner.\n\n3. Ramjet\n\nHigh-speed forward motion is used to compress the air (no compressor). Fuel is injected into the combustion chamber where it mixes with the hot compressed air and ignites. The average speed of Ramjet is 3-6 Mach. But the ramjet efficiency starts to drop when the vehicle reaches hypersonic speeds.\n\n4. Scramjet\n\nHere also, the high-speed forward motion is used to compress the air (no compressor), but it is an improvement over the ramjet engine as it efficiently operates at hypersonic speeds and allows supersonic combustion. Speed is greater than 6 Mach (Six times the speed of Sound).\n\n5. Dual mode Ramjet (DMRJ)\n\nType of jet engine where a ramjet transforms into scramjet over Mach 4-8 range, therefore, it can operate both in subsonic and supersonic combustion modes.\n\nScramjet (Supersonic Combustion Ramjet): Operation Details\n\nTo fire something we need air, that is oxygen. Rockets usually carry oxygen in an oxidizer tank even when it is traveling in Earth\u2019s atmosphere. But, if we can use atmospheric oxygen during this time it would become energy efficient. Here comes the importance of the Scramjet engine.\n\nScramjet engine designed by ISRO uses Hydrogen as fuel and Oxygen from the atmospheric air as the Oxidizer. This makes the system much lighter, more efficient, and cost-effective.\nThe scramjet engine was test launched on board of Rohini 560 sounding rocket (Research Rocket). This RH 560 is a two-stage Advanced Technology Vehicle (ATV) and is designed & developed by ISRO to test the scramjet engine. ATV is the heaviest (3 tons) sounding rocket developed to date by the ISRO.\nKey Features of Scramjet Engines\nAir-Breathing: Scramjets are air-breathing engines, meaning they take in air from the atmosphere for combustion. This design eliminates the need to carry onboard oxidizers, making them more efficient for certain flight regimes.\nHypersonic Speeds: Scramjets are specifically designed for hypersonic flight, operating efficiently at speeds greater than Mach 5. They become more efficient as the speed of the vehicle increases.\nNo Moving Parts: Unlike traditional jet engines, scramjets have no rotating parts like compressors and turbines. Instead, they rely on the aerodynamic design of the engine to compress incoming air.\nLimited Usefulness at Lower Speeds: Scramjets are most effective at high speeds, and they typically need to be accelerated to a certain speed before they become operational. Below a certain speed, other propulsion systems may be more practical.\nIndia and Scramjet Technology\n\nNote: Subscribe to the ClearIAS YouTube Channel to learn more.\n\nIndia had started the efforts on Scramjet technology long back and we did ground testing in 2006 which validated the design of the engine. And now, India has become the fourth country to claim the successful testing of Scramjet Engine. Russia was the first country who claim scramjet flight test in 1991, and later US and European Space agency also joined the elite group.\n\nScramjet \u2013 Challenges \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\nAs mentioned earlier, Scramjet does not have a compressor to compress the air, instead, it uses its high-speed forward motion to compress the air. Therefore scramjet cannot produce efficient thrust unless boosted to high speed. From this, we understood that a scramjet engine cannot work until it attains enough speed. This is the main drawback of the Scramjet Engine.\nAs we all know, Launch Vehicles have multiple stages with each having a different engine. After the fuel burns out in the first stage, the engine is jettisoned to reduce the weight of the vehicle. So when the second stage ignition begins, speed is enough for the scramjet to function. Therefore ISRO used a scramjet engine at the second stage during the flight test and using this technique it excelled in overcoming the drawback.\nSome of the other technological challenges handled by ISRO during the development of the Scramjet engine include the design and development of the Hypersonic engine air intake, the supersonic combustor, the development of materials withstanding very high temperatures, computational tools to simulate hypersonic flow, ensuring performance and operability of the engine across a wide range of flight speeds, proper thermal management and ground testing of the engines.\nThe importance of having this technology\nThe efficiency of the launch vehicle depends on how much weight it can carry with a particular amount of fuel. Currently, Indian rockets carry a huge quantity of oxygen (approx.200 tons) that is nearly 85 percent of the rocket mass and it gets burnt during the atmospheric flight phase of the rocket. The use of Scramjet would help to reduce the weight of the launch vehicle and increase the speed. It would help India to do more with a limited space budget.\nThe satellite launching business is gaining momentum and Antrix Corporation (the Commercial wing of ISRO) has been launching satellites at a lower cost when compared to other players. This can be further augmented by using Scramjet Engine which would help to minimize the cost.\nScramjet engines can be used to augment ISRO\u2019s reusable launch vehicle (RLV).\nAvatar\n\nAvatar (from \u201cAerobic Vehicle for Transatmospheric Hypersonic Aerospace TrAnspoRtation\u201d) is DRDO\u2019s reusable launch vehicle platform which is capable of carrying out satellite launches like normal aircraft, taking off vertically and landing back on a runway.\n\nIt is designed to use ramjets and scramjets for thrust. Each of these engines will be used in different stages of the flight wherein scramjets are used at hypersonic speeds.\n\nSummary\n\nIn a nutshell, the development of Scramjet engines is an important milestone in ISRO\u2019s endeavor towards its future space transportation systems. Air-breathing propulsion is a solution for a powered long return cruise flight necessary for reusable launch vehicles. In addition to this, DRDO has been working on developing the Brahmos II Cruise Missile based on the same scramjet technology. This calls for the faster development of ramjet or scramjet technologies which would help India execute advanced space missions in the future. Also, it will add colors to our much-hyped Make In India initiative.\n\nArticle contributed by Sree Resmi S",

I have no doubt India will develop her scientific researches and I hope Indian scientists will use the atomic force for constructive purposes. But if India is threatened, she will inevitably try to defend herself by all means at her disposal.\n\n1940s-1950s: Early Developments\n\nIndia\u2019s interest in nuclear technology began during the colonial era, and scientific research in nuclear physics gained momentum in the 1940s.\nIndia\u2019s nuclear program started in March 1944 and its three-stage indigenous efforts in technology were established by Dr. Homi Bhabha when he founded the nuclear research center, the Institute of Fundamental Research.\nThe establishment of the Tata Institute of Fundamental Research (TIFR) and the Atomic Energy Commission (AEC) marked significant steps in India\u2019s nuclear research.\n\n1960s-1970s: Peaceful Nuclear Explosions\n\nIndia\u2019s loss of territory to China in the war of 1962, provided the New Delhi government impetus for developing nuclear weapons as a means of deterring potential Chinese aggression.\nIndia conducted its first peaceful nuclear explosion (PNE) in 1974 at the Pokhran Test Range in Rajasthan. This test, codenamed \u201cSmiling Buddha,\u201d marked India\u2019s entry into the global nuclear stage.\nThe PNE was presented as a demonstration of India\u2019s nuclear capabilities for peaceful purposes, but it had military implications.\n\n1980s: Shift towards Weaponization\n\nIn the 1980s, India\u2019s nuclear program shifted from a focus on peaceful uses of nuclear technology to military applications.\nConcerns about regional security dynamics, including China\u2019s nuclear capabilities and the proliferation of nuclear weapons, contributed to this shift.\n\n1998: Pokhran-II Tests\n\nIn May 1998, India conducted a series of nuclear tests, known as \u201cPokhran-II,\u201d (code-named \u201cOperation Shakti\u201d) at the Pokhran Test Range. Five nuclear devices were detonated.\nThese tests included both fission and thermonuclear (fusion) devices, showcasing India\u2019s ability to develop a range of nuclear weapons.\nIndia\u2019s No-First-Use Policy and Doctrine of Credible Minimum Deterrence (CMD)\n\nIn August 1999, the Indian government released a draft of the doctrine which asserts that nuclear weapons are solely for deterrence and that India will pursue a policy of \u201cretaliation only\u201d.\n\nThe document also maintains that India \u201cwill not be the first to initiate a nuclear first strike, but will respond with punitive retaliation should deterrence fail\u201d and that decisions to authorize the use of nuclear weapons would be made by the Prime Minister or his \u2018designated successor(s).\n\n\u2018 The doctrine of \u201cNo first use\u201d means \u201cno first use against non-nuclear-weapon states\u201d, as clarified by our NSA. The doctrine of \u201cno first use against non-nuclear-weapon states\u201d reflected India\u2019s strategic culture, with its emphasis on minimal deterrence.\n\nIndia\u2019s nuclear doctrine emphasizes a retaliatory strike capability and NFU. The doctrine also stresses a massive retaliation policy against any nuclear aggression.\n\nAlso read: Indian Arms Import\n\nIndia\u2019s Nuclear Weapon Programme: Main Authorities\n\nNames to remember Nuclear Command Authority (NCA), Strategic Nuclear Command, Cabinet Committee on Security, National Security Advisory Board, etc.\n\nCabinet Committee on Security (CCS)\n\nThe civil leadership, in the form of the CCS (Cabinet Committee on Security), is the only body authorized to order a nuclear strike against another offending strike: In effect, it is the Prime Minister who has his finger \u201con the button.\u201d\n\nNuclear Command Authority (NCA)\n\nOn January 4, 2003, the\u00a0Cabinet Committee on Security (CCS) constituted the Nuclear Command Authority (NCA). NCA has two councils: the Executive Council and the Political Council.\n\nThe Executive Council is chaired by the\u00a0National Security Advisor (NSA) while the Political Council is chaired by the Prime Minister.\n\nThe National Security Advisor gives the inputs to the Political Council, which authorities a nuclear attack when deemed necessary. This mechanism of the Political Council is advised by the Executive Council and letting the \u201cnuclear button remain with PM\u201d was implemented to ensure that Indian nukes\u00a0remain firmly in\u00a0civilian control\u00a0and that there exists a sophisticated\u00a0Command and Control (C2) mechanism to prevent their accidental or unauthorized use.\n\nStrategic Nuclear Command or\u00a0Strategic Forces Command\n\nStrategic Nuclear Command, forms part of India\u2019s\u00a0Nuclear Command Authority\u00a0(NCA).\u00a0India\u2019s Strategic Nuclear Command was formally established in 2003.\n\nThe Joint Services SNC is the custodian of all of India\u2019s nuclear weapons, missiles, and assets. It is also responsible for executing all aspects of India\u2019s nuclear policy.\n\nThe directives of the NCA are to be operationalized by the Strategic Forces Command\u00a0under the control of a Commander-in-Chief of the rank of\u00a0Air Marshal\u00a0(or its equivalent) in charge of the management and administration of the tactical and strategic nuclear forces. (So as it is clear, Strategic Nuclear Command is the implementing agency of the nuclear decision.)\n\nNational Security Council\u00a0(NSC) of India\n\nThe\u00a0National Security Council (NSC) of India is the apex agency looking into the country\u2019s political, economic, energy, and strategic security concerns. (Please note that the NSC has roles beyond nuclear deterrence.\n\nThe chief executive is the\u00a0National Security Adviser. Before the formation of the NSC, these activities were overseen by the Principal Secretary to the Prime Minister).\u00a0\n\nThe three-tiered structure of the NSC comprises the Strategic Policy Group, the National Security Advisory Board, and a Secretariat represented by the Joint Intelligence Committee\u00a0(JIC).\n\nAlso read: India\u2019s Defence Exports\n\nHow does Nuclear Deterrence Work in India?\n\nThe executive council of the NSA advises the political council of the NSA in case of any security threat or nuclear action needed. The political council gives orders to Strategic Nuclear Command.\n\nStrategic Nuclear Command possesses all major nuclear arsenals, and it is the agency responsible for executing a nuclear retaliation. SNC requires approval from NCA for any nuclear action. Recent estimates suggest that India has between 90 and 110 nuclear weapons.\u00a0\n\nNuclear Triad\n\nNuclear Triad is a term used to denote a nation that has the capabilities of a nuclear strike from land, air, and water. India has tested its abilities on land, air, and sea.\n\nFrom Land: Ballistic missiles with a nuclear warhead in the Prithvi and Agni Series.\nFrom Air: Nuclear bombs from\u00a0Dassault Mirage 2000s\u00a0and\u00a0SEPECAT Jaguars. (Free-falling and un-guided method).\nFrom Sea: \u00a0Submarines: Sagarika K-15 missile in Arihant Submarine; Ship: Dhanush missile from ships like INS\u00a0Subhadra or\u00a0INS Rajput.\nIndia\u2019s Nuclear Weapon programme: Current status\n\nIndia has regularly engaged in diplomatic efforts to improve its nuclear standing on the global stage.\n\nThe Indo-US Civil Nuclear Agreement in 2008 allowed for international civilian nuclear trade with India despite its status as a non-signatory of the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty (NPT).\nDeveloping anti-satellite weapon (ASAT) capabilities; successfully carried out an ASAT missile test in March 2019\nPossesses several types of operational nuclear-capable land-based ballistic missiles, SLBMS, and\u00a0cruise missiles\nSuccessfully conducted 11 missile tests in late 2020, including the new naval version of the BrahMos cruise missile and hypersonic Shaurya missile\nOn October 14, 2022, India conducted a successful test launch of a submarine-launched ballistic missile (SLBM) from an Arihant-class SSBN.\nAs of January 2023, India was estimated to have a growing stockpile of 164 nuclear weapons, a small increase from the previous year\u2019s count of 160. These weapons are assigned to a nuclear triad of aircraft, land-based missiles, and nuclear-powered ballistic missile submarines.\nConclusion\n\nIndia\u2019s nuclear weapon program has been a subject of debate and discussion both within the country and internationally. While India maintains its nuclear weapons for deterrence purposes and emphasizes its commitment to responsible nuclear behavior, questions about non-proliferation, disarmament and regional security dynamics remain important aspects of the global nuclear landscape.\n\nRead: India\u2019s nuclear future;\u00a0Mission Divyastra",

    "[CONTENT] #108": "The Indian Ballistic Missile Defence (BMD) Programme is an attempt to develop and use a multi-layered ballistic missile defence system to protect from ballistic missile attacks. India\u2019s decision to develop Ballistic Missile Defense (BMD) was introduced in light of the ballistic missile threat mainly from Pakistan, especially can be attributed to the Kargil War in 1999.\n\nTable of Contents\n\nWhat are Ballistic missiles?\nWhat are the advantages of Ballistic Missile?\nWhat\u2019s a Ballistic Missile Defence (BMD) System?\nIndia\u2019s Ballistic Missile Defence System\nTwo- tiers of India\u2019s BMD\nPrithvi Air Defence (PAD)\nAdvanced Air Defence (AAD)\nConfigurations of BMD\nWhy should India need BMD?\nApprehensions regarding BMD\nConclusion\nWhat are Ballistic missiles?\n\nA ballistic missile/projectile follows a \u201cballistic trajectory\u201d.\n\u00a0The ballistic trajectory is the path followed by the projectile (missile) after thrust forces (propulsion) stop and the projectile is only acted upon by gravity and friction (drag forces).\nA ballistic missile thus is guided in the initial phase, i.e. lift off, while the rest of the trajectory is dependent on gravity and requires minimal guidance.\nWhat are the advantages of Ballistic Missile?\nThey have a very long range, as they travel above the atmosphere, experience less drag, and use gravity and earth\u2019s rotation.\nThey are highly fuel efficient. Only fuel requirements are during the lift-off phase and course correction measures.\nMultiple independent targetable re-entry vehicles (MIRV) capability can be achieved in ballistic missiles.\nDue to fuel efficiency, their payload-carrying capacity is significantly more than cruise missiles.\nWhat\u2019s a Ballistic Missile Defence (BMD) System?\nA Ballistic Missile Defence system (BMD) is a missile defence system that acts as a shield against ballistic missile attacks.\nYou may not that the purpose is defence (by intercepting a ballistic missile) and not attack/offense.\n\nA ballistic missile can be intercepted in three phases:\n\nTerminal phase: During the atmospheric descent phase.\nMid-course interception (in-flight interception) \u2013 Most preferred interception.\nThe lift-off phase\u2013 i.e. targeting at the launch point- requires advanced radars.\n\nGenerally, a BMD is a two-tier automated system that has:\n\nThe advanced radar system, Early warning system ( Also called sensors system).\nIntegrated command and control centre.\nInterceptor missile batteries- need to be agile, mobile, and strategically located on land and sea.\nIndia\u2019s Ballistic Missile Defence System\n\n\u00a0India\u2019s BMD development began in 1999, after the Kargil war.\nThe primary aim was to bolster India\u2019s defence against a possible nuclear attack from Pakistan. It holds a place of prime importance especially when India follows the \u2018No first use\u2019 policy.\nIndia seeks to deploy a functional \u2018iron dome\u2019 ballistic missile defence (BMD), incorporating both low-altitude and high-altitude interceptor missiles.\nIndia\u2019s BMD is primarily developed by DRDO with the help of many public and private firms like BEL, Astra Microwave, L&T, etc.\n\nIndia\u2019s BMD is being developed in 2 phases:\n\nThe first phase aims to develop a shield to intercept missiles with a range of up to 2000 km. 1st phase radar range is up to 600 km.\nThe second phase will have an intercept missile with a 5000 km range. The radar range of this phase would be 1500 km.\nTwo- tiers of India\u2019s BMD\n\nThey are Prithvi Air Defence (PAD) and Advanced Air Defence (AAD) respectively.\n\n\ud83d\udc49 Which year are YOU targeting for success in the IAS/IPS/IFS Exam? \ud83d\ude80\n\n(1) \u21d2 UPSC 2025: Prelims cum Mains\n\n(2) \u21d2 UPSC 2026: Prelims cum Mains\n\n(3) \u21d2 UPSC 2027 Prelims cum Mains\n\nTip: Know more about ClearIAS Courses (Online/Offline)\n\nPrithvi Air Defence (PAD)\n\n\u00a0Also referred to as Pradyumna Ballistic Missile Interceptor.\nIt\u2019s designed for High-altitude interception ( exo-atmospheric interception).\nIntercept missiles at altitudes between 50 \u2013 80 km.\nThe interceptor is a Prithvi Defence Vehicle ( PDV) which has two stages, both with solid propellants.\nAdvanced Air Defence (AAD)\nAlso called Ashwin Ballistic Missile Interceptor.\nIt\u2019s an endo-atmospheric interception system ( for low-altitude interception).\nAltitude of interception is range up to 30 km.\nIt has a single-stage solid-fueled missile.\nConfigurations of BMD\n\nAccording to Lieutenant General Balraj Nagal (retired), director of the Centre for Land Warfare Studies. There are five possible configurations of BMD. These are:\n\nA land and sea-based defence system against all kinds of threats. This system is too expensive and requires too much technological and infrastructural development. Though it is the safest configuration, it still isn\u2019t 100% secure.\nIn the Second configuration, BMD is deployed to protect critical population centres, control, and command centres, critical infrastructure centres (including nuclear facilities), and major economic zones. It\u2019s strategically and economically more pragmatic than the first configuration. Yet, it is too costly for a nation like India.\nIn the third configuration, protection is provided to command and control centres, nuclear forces, and important citizen population centres.\nBMD will protect command and control centres nuclear forces and the capital in the fourth configuration. This is the most suitable candidate considering the nascent stage of India\u2019s BMD and also the weak financial condition of the nation. It protects critical nodes of governance as well as of counter-attack.\nThe final configuration would involve BMD deployment only around the command and control centre and the capital. Its purpose is only for total defence and not able to provide the ability to counterattack as nuclear forces are left out of it.\nWhy should India need BMD?\nIndia follows the \u2018No First Use policy\u2018. A robust BMD provides an opportunity for the nation to strike back if a nuclear projectile is launched by an enemy state.\nIn the past efforts have been made by radicalized non-state fractions in Pakistan to obtain Missile technology. BMD would shield from non-state actors initiated missile warfare and thus could avoid the Mutual Destruction trap.\nIndia has hostile, nuclear states in its north. It\u2019s only practical for the nation to prepare in advance.\nChina is developing new technologies to implement its Anti-Access/Area-Denial (A2/AD) strategy in the Western Pacific. It can impact the mainland in Indian water. A robust BMD is a proactive measure to tackle China\u2019s A2/AD strategy.\nBMD reduces the incentive for the enemy state to launch a nuclear attack, Thus enhancing strategic stability.\nAn indigenous system would reduce the import bill of defence systems from other nations.\nThere are side benefits of BMD too, like better reconnaissance, detection, tracking, and situation awareness.\nTechnology developed for BMD can be used in other sectors, especially in space technology.\nApprehensions regarding BMD\nIt may start the arms race with Pakistan investing in more powerful missiles to thwart BMD\u2019s disturbing strategic balance.\nBMD is ineffective against Cruise missiles. Both China and Pakistan have cruise missiles capable of delivering the nuclear payload.\nNo BMD can have a 100% success rate in the interception of the projectile (ballistic missile).\nBMD is a very costly affair. For example, the U.S. Continental System is estimated to have cost around $100 bn from 2002 onwards.\nIndia has a wide and segregated geography. It creates a problem in the protection of all critical centres and the creation of land infrastructure for BMD in many areas.\nEven after interception, there remain chances of damage, especially if the interception is done in the terminal phase of the ballistic missile.\nBMD testing is done in a controlled atmosphere raising the question of its efficacy in wartime.\nDRDO has been criticized for not releasing whole data related to the BMD system. It evokes a sense of suspicion regarding BMD\u2019s capability.\n\nAlso read: India\u2019s Defence Exports\n\nConclusion\n\nIn the fast-changing geo-political scenario, strategic preparedness and self-reliance are the new currency of defence. BMD fulfils all such criteria and creates a protective shield that has not only physical but also psychological effects on hostile nations.\n\nIt bolsters India\u2019s NO FIRST USE policy by providing the second strike capability.\n\nThough there are issues related to its cost, effectiveness, and extent; nevertheless with development in technology and support from Make in India, it can augment over some time. As for now, BMD is an idea whose time has come and will remain so for a long.\n\nRead:\u00a0\n\nIndia\u2019s Missile Systems\nMissile Fuel Technology\nIron Dome: Israeli Air Defence system\n\nArticle by: Alok Singh",

    "[CONTENT] #117": "Speciation is the evolutionary process by which populations evolve to become distinct species. It occurs when groups within a species become reproductively isolated and diverge genetically over time. This can result in the formation of new species with distinct characteristics that prevent interbreeding with the original population. Read here to learn more.\n\nSpeciation is how a new kind of plant or animal species is created. It occurs when a group within a species separates from other members of its species and develops its unique characteristics.\n\nThe demands of a different environment or the characteristics of the members of the new group will differentiate the new species from their ancestors.\n\nTable of Contents\n\nSpeciation\nTypes of Speciation\nSignificance of Speciation\nWhy in the news?\nConclusion\nSpeciation\n\nAn example of speciation is the Gal\u00e1pagos finch. Different species of these birds live on different islands in the Gal\u00e1pagos archipelago, located in the Pacific Ocean off South America.\n\nThe finches are isolated from one another by the ocean. Over millions of years, each species of finch developed a unique beak that is specially adapted to the kinds of food it eats.\nSome finches have large, blunt beaks that can crack the hard shells of nuts and seeds.\nOther finches have long, thin beaks that can probe into cactus flowers without the bird being poked by the cactus spines.\nStill, other finches have medium-sized beaks that can catch and grasp insects.\nBecause they are isolated, the birds don\u2019t breed with one another and have therefore developed into unique species with unique characteristics. This is called allopatric speciation.\nTypes of Speciation\n\nThere are five types: allopatric, peripatric, parapatric, sympatric and artificial.\n\n\ud83d\udc49 Which year are YOU targeting for success in the IAS/IPS/IFS Exam? \ud83d\ude80\n\n(1) \u21d2 UPSC 2025: Prelims cum Mains\n\n(2) \u21d2 UPSC 2026: Prelims cum Mains\n\n(3) \u21d2 UPSC 2027 Prelims cum Mains\n\nTip: Know more about ClearIAS Courses (Online/Offline)\n\nAllopatric:\nIt occurs when populations are geographically separated, preventing gene flow between them.\nProcess: Physical barriers such as mountains, rivers, or distances isolate populations. Over time, genetic drift, mutation, and natural selection cause the populations to diverge.\nExample: The formation of different species of Darwin\u2019s finches on the Gal\u00e1pagos Islands.\nSympatric:\nIt occurs without geographic isolation; populations diverge while living in the same area.\nProcess: This can be driven by factors such as ecological niche differentiation, behavioural isolation, or polyploidy in plants (an increase in the number of chromosome sets).\nExample: Cichlid fish in African lakes diversify based on different feeding strategies and habitats within the same lake.\nParapatric:\nIt occurs when populations are adjacent to each other, with limited interbreeding along a boundary zone.\nProcess: Gradual divergence occurs due to varying environmental conditions or selective pressures along the gradient. Hybrids in the overlap zone may be less fit, reinforcing isolation.\nExample: Grass species that adapt to different soil types along a contamination gradient near mines.\nPeripatric:\nA subtype of allopatric speciation where a small population at the edge of a larger one becomes isolated.\nProcess: The small, isolated population undergoes rapid genetic changes due to genetic drift and founder effects, leading to divergence from the main population.\nExample: The formation of new species on isolated islands from mainland populations.\nArtificial:\nIt is the creation of new species by people. This is achieved through lab experiments, where scientists mostly research insects like fruit flies.\nSignificance of Speciation\nBiodiversity: It is the fundamental process that generates biodiversity. The formation of new species increases the variety of life forms and contributes to the complexity of ecosystems.\nEvolutionary Adaptation: Through speciation, populations can adapt to new and changing environments. This evolutionary flexibility allows life to thrive in diverse habitats and under varying environmental conditions.\nEcological Niches: The emergence of new species often leads to the occupation of different ecological niches, promoting resource partitioning and reducing competition among species.\nConservation Biology: Understanding speciation helps in conservation efforts by identifying evolutionarily significant units (ESUs) that need protection. This ensures the preservation of genetic diversity and the potential for future speciation events.\nHuman Impacts: Human activities, such as habitat fragmentation and climate change, can influence speciation processes. Studying speciation helps predict and mitigate the impacts of these activities on biodiversity.\nScientific Research: Speciation is a central concept in evolutionary biology and helps scientists understand the mechanisms of evolution, the history of life on Earth, and the relationships among species.\nWhy in the news?\n\nResearchers at IIT Bombay discovered the role of environmental resources, genes and mating in species in the development of new species in the same area, challenging the traditional view that new species can develop only in distinct geographies.\n\nTraditionally, it is believed that speciation largely occurs when populations of a species are isolated from each other by geographical barriers such as mountains or bodies of water. This is called allopatric speciation.\nHowever, the new IIT Bombay research suggests that speciation can happen even when populations live in the same area without geographical barriers. This mode of speciation is called sympatric speciation.\nConclusion\n\nSpeciation is a crucial evolutionary process that leads to the formation of new species, contributing to the richness and diversity of life on Earth.\n\nUnderstanding the mechanisms and significance of speciation helps in appreciating the dynamic nature of biodiversity, guiding conservation efforts, and providing insights into evolutionary processes\n\nRelated articles:\n\nEcology and environment- important terminologies\nMass extinctions\n\n-Article by Swathi Satish",

Essentially, this means using a domestically produced item in place of an imported one.\n\nThe term \u201cindigenization\u201d refers to the replacement of an imported good with one produced domestically. This does not mean that the domestically produced object is a copy of the imported one.\n\nAlthough functionally identical, it can feature more contemporary, energy-efficient, compact, and dependable parts and subassemblies that could be either imported or domestically produced.\n\n\ud83d\udc49 Which year are YOU targeting for success in the IAS/IPS/IFS Exam? \ud83d\ude80\n\n(1) \u21d2 UPSC 2025: Prelims cum Mains\n\n(2) \u21d2 UPSC 2026: Prelims cum Mains\n\n(3) \u21d2 UPSC 2027 Prelims cum Mains\n\nTip: Know more about ClearIAS Courses (Online/Offline)\n\nThe government is thinking about establishing a centre for focused study on the most modern electronic equipment that can be produced domestically to improve its technological competence in the field of homeland security.\n\nThe \u201cMake in India\u201d initiative was introduced in 2014 with the goal of enhancing India\u2019s manufacturing capabilities and creating more job opportunities. The main objective of this program was to encourage the localization of technology, including electronics, ICT, defence, space, and transportation.\n\nSignificance of Indigenization of Technology and Developing New Technologies\nThe process of indigenization is essential for a developing economy to become a developed one. As a result, it has enormous economic significance. As globalization progresses, more and more individuals and material resources are becoming available for other countries to use through bilateral relations.\nAs a result, the nation fails to fully utilize its own resources for development. Utilizing one\u2019s natural resources is less expensive and simpler.\nIt should be emphasized that for emerging countries, indigenization serves as the precursor to the creation of new technologies. Therefore, indigenous development is important for R&D as well. A nation gains the ability to stand alone, conduct independent research, and create new technologies as long as it can successfully implement the indigenization of technology.\nThis represents not just a technological achievement in and of itself but also a major morale booster for Indians. After all, creating new technologies depends on innovation.\nThe development of a country into a superpower on the international stage is based on science and technology. As a result of fierce international rivalry, science is always evolving and has made jobs easier and more efficient throughout time.\nTherefore, continuing to rely on foreign technology will give that country access to all of our data and information, which is a very dangerous game in and of itself.\nTherefore, using indigenous technology is the only way to secure national interests and restrict foreign countries\u2019 access to our country\u2019s information. This gives indigenous peoples security in their own countries and territories importance.\nAdvantages of Indigenization of Technology\n\nThe successful indigenization of foreign technology can take many different forms. It has a significant psychological and socioeconomic impact, to start with. Citizens develop a sense of freedom and accomplishment as a result of indigenous development.\n\nAdditionally, it expands the range of jobs available in the manufacturing and other service sectors. Additionally, the cost of production after indigenization is less expensive for products of the same quality compared to importing the technology.\n\nThe country\u2019s culture of science and technology is also promoted by indigenous people. The scope of research and development is greatly expanded if we have complete autonomy over technology and can effectively refer to it as \u201cours,\u201d which encourages various institutes to take on new initiatives under the banner of innovation. This finally results in our country\u2019s technological development, which further advances the economy.\n\nFinally, only locals have a complete understanding of the requirements and ideal calibrations a machine needs to function in the local environment. Locals will be more adept at using technology and increase the productivity of the specific sector of the application when it suits their unique needs and desires.\n\nDevelopment of New Technology\n\nThe following step involves innovation to create new technology once a country achieves technological self-sufficiency. To bear in mind all the requirements for developing new technology calls for efforts at various levels as well as appropriate cooperation and coordination.\n\nFirst and foremost, the government\u2019s responsibilities include carrying out federal and state policies to create a favourable climate that fosters competition and innovation in both the commercial and public sectors. By emphasizing the following four key areas,\n\nMaintaining strong competitive pressure on the domestic market.\nHarboring high-quality human capital.\nImproving the networking between industry-institution-academia.\nOpenness and ease of access to foreign technologies.\n\nThe nation\u2019s Intellectual Property Rights (IPR) framework is also a significant and essential influence. IPR prevents others from using a person\u2019s or a group\u2019s original creation, invention, or discovery for financial gain. This promotes national research and development, which advances homegrown technologies.\n\nSecond, it\u2019s critical for businesses in both the public and private sectors to recognize and enthusiastically support prospective talent. This will increase the companies\u2019 earnings and reputation, which will ultimately lead to the advancement of technology in the nation.\n\nTo achieve this, the country\u2019s youth potential can be utilized by funding and investing in entrepreneurship and intrapreneurship enterprises. A further sort of assistance could be the acquisition of tools and materials for the development of the new technology.\n\nIndigenization of Technology in Various Sectors of the Indian Economy\nIndia began to work for the indigenization of several economic sectors as early as 1947 after realizing the necessity of being a self-sufficient country. It is generally acknowledged that, in terms of bolstering the science and technology sector, the Indian economy grew in five stages.\nBuilding relevant infrastructure was the primary focus of Phase I. Reorientation and the use and application of indigenous technology were the primary focuses of phases 2, 3, and 4. Moving toward economic liberalization was the focus of Phase 4, and the advancement of science and technology in an economically liberalized country was the primary focus of Phase 5.\nThe extent of indigenization and development of new technology in India can be measured using six keystone sectors-\nAgriculture; as it has a major share of India\u2019s GDP.\nAutomobiles; are a vital part of connectivity and networking.\nInformation and Communication Technology is the fastest-growing sector in India.\nHealthcare and biotechnology; emerging field of science and technology.\nSpace; has symbolic significance in the field of science and technology.\nDefense; is crucial for maintaining the security of the state.\nIndigenous industries have historically tended to be in agriculture. Improving the state of agriculture and livestock production has been a priority since the first five-year plan was created in order to address the food shortages brought on by the abrupt population growth brought on by the refugee inflow.\nIn the 20th century, agriculture was already the largest industry in terms of production and employment. Numerous industry-specific revolutions, such as the Green Revolution, which made use of innovative fertilizers, HYV plants, and cutting-edge irrigation technologies in farming, were seen in an effort to further increase agricultural and animal productivity.\nWhite Revolution: Enhanced milk production through improving collaboration between primary and downstream producers (milkmen and companies). Aquaculture quality was increased by the blue revolution, while India\u2019s yellow revolution enhanced the extraction, processing, and market for vegetable oils.\nGenetically modified crops have recently been launched as innovative, disease-resistant, high-yielding crops. These were created by integrating rDNA technology into farming procedures.\nThe transportation and vehicle industries have continued to be in demand, particularly in light of rising urbanization. Private sector players have long dominated this industry. The first automobiles came from Britain and other European countries. This made the Indian market more accessible to Western automakers.\nFollowing this, the first attempt at indigenization was made with the establishment of Fiat\u2019s first production facilities in India. As more and more western companies entered the Indian auto market over time, competition grew.\nIn the 1980s, Maruti and Tata, two Indian competitors, also made their entrance into this market (a decade later). Due to their effective manoeuvrability on Indian roads, which Western cars lacked, they were a hit on the road. Today\u2019s automotive titans in the country, Maruti and Tata, have produced world-class cars.\nThe Indian economy\u2019s ICT and IT sector may be its greatest economic success story to date. It all began in 1974 when Burroughs, a producer of computer mainframes, asked Tata Consultancy Services, its Indian sales agency, to outsource programmers to\nThe Indian economy\u2019s ICT and IT sector may be its greatest economic success story to date. It all began in 1974 when Burroughs, a maker of mainframe computers, approached Tata Consultancy Services, an Indian sales agent, to hire programmers on their behalf. India was only beginning to gain recognition as a capable IT services nation.\nHowever, the technology we used was a Western import. Computers, teachers, students, and the products being produced were more geared toward the global market than the domestic one. But as more and more Indian IT businesses gained notoriety for their cutting-edge designs that appealed to home customers, this was to change over time.\nThe likes of Infosys, Wipro, Anand Computing, iBall, Tata Elxsi, etc. are the evidence of indigenization and development of modern and target-consumer-specific computers.\nHealthcare is an important sector in which India has been able to achieve great heights. Today, people from around the world are coming to India to conduct their treatment in Indian hospitals. While the indigenization of medical and biotechnological resources is yet to be fully achieved, the workforce consisting of doctors, paramedics, and nurses has become adept at using the current technologies.\nBiotechnology is comparatively a newer field than healthcare and medicine. But even this sector has made a considerable impact in healthcare practices by introducing innovative applications like gene mapping, tailor-made drug dosage, and other such technologies.\nCompanies like Biocon, Panacea Biotech, and others have already been well-established and are prompting more and more biotech students to take up employment in their sector\nSpace has been a muscle flex by India in various other countries. From launching Aryabhatta on a Russian rocket to launching missile Chandrayaan 2\u00a0on an indigenous rocket, these have always brought laurels to India.\nDr. Vikiram Sarabhai and ISRO are to be thanked for the feats achieved by India in terms of space technology in recent years, launching satellites and spacecraft with minimal budgets. Indian Space research and development have been sufficiently funded and supported by the union governments down the line, providing them with funds and resources to carry forward R&D.\nFinally, we come to the defence. India\u2019s mixed economy puts all the defence manufacturing under public sector undertaking. With that being said, India is also the world\u2019s largest importer of arms and military equipment. Most of the aircraft, guns, and ships are from Western countries, especially Russia, the USA, Israel, and other places.\nRussia has been India\u2019s all-weather ally and has been constantly supplying weapons and aircraft to India. But over the years, Indian military forces have become vintage in nature. The weapons that we use as well as a few planes that are still in service signify the need for immediate modernization of the forces.\nBut thankfully, India has started to take baby steps toward defence indigenization. The F-INSAS program is supposed to convert the Indian Army into a futuristic terrestrial force and is completely being developed under Indian supervision.\nSimilarly, HAL Tejas, a light combat aircraft has been the first single-engine fighter plane to be completely manufactured in India. Tejas was the star of the \u2018Make in India\u2019 policy.\nWhile these steps are being taken to ensure that the military can keep up with the levels of other military forces, India\u2019s tag as the largest military importer will remain for a while indicating complete indigenization to be difficult soon.\nConclusion\n\nTechnological development is essential for a country\u2019s economy to grow. The indigenization of that technology, however, is even more crucial in order for it to be used fully in addressing and effectively resolving problems.\n\nAdditionally, indigenization is seen as a precursor to innovation, which results in the creation of new technology at a price significantly lower than that of imported technology.\n\nAdditionally, indigenization strengthens residents\u2019 sense of national identity by giving them a sense of shared pride in having technology they can call \u201cIndian\u201d property.\n\nThis has a good impact on people\u2019s confidence, which manifests in their work and eventually increases productivity. Governments and businesses should therefore support indigenization and the creation of new technology as it is a noble endeavor that will result in a better future for the country.\n\nArticle written by:\u00a0 Aseem Muhammed",

This initiative has led to significant advancements in digital payments, e-governance, and internet accessibility across the country.\nStartups\nIn terms of the number of startups, India is currently the third-largest nation. In the upcoming years, it is anticipated that this number will increase tremendously.\nThe Atal Innovation Mission (AIM) was established by the government to drastically change the nation\u2019s innovation, entrepreneurship, and start-up ecosystems.\nGlobal participation\n\nThe government is sponsoring numerous research and development programs as part of the national policy to boost scientific activities. Thus, we discover that scientific knowledge and modern technology have had an impact on practically every field, including ocean development, nuclear energy, space technology, electronics, agriculture, and industry.\n\nLeading some groundbreaking research being done around the world are scientists from India. It has been exciting to see recent advancements in frontier science and technology made by Indian scientists.\nFor instance, 37 Indian scientists from nine Indian institutes were instrumental in the gravitational wave discovery that won the 2017 Physics Nobel Prize.\nThe Laser Interferometer Gravitational-Wave Observatory (LIGO), located in the United States, discovered a neutron star merger with the assistance of Indian scientists.\nAdditionally, it boasts the third-largest technical and scientific labor force in the entire world.\nDevelopments in Science and Technology-Effects in Everyday Life\n\nEvery day of the year, from the moment we wake up until the time we go to bed, science and technology have an impact on all of us. Science has given us many things, including our digital alarm clock, the weather report, the cars we drive and the buses we ride, our choice to eat a baked potato rather than fries, our cell phones, the antibiotics that treat sore throats, the clean water, and the light. Developments in Science and technology have impacted both Socialization and productivity.\n\nBecause of the internet\u2019s strength, it is now easier to share ideas and resources and to create global communities. Without the knowledge and technologies made possible by science, the modern world would not even remotely be modern.\nScience has a rising impact on people\u2019s lives. Even while the benefits to humanity in recent decades have been unsurpassed in the history of the human species, there have been certain cases where the influence has been negative or the long-term implications raise grave concerns.\nToday, there is a sizable amount of popular skepticism about science and anxiety around technology. This is partly due to the perception held by some people and communities that they will be the ones to experience the unintended negative effects of technological advancements made to benefit a wealthy minority.\nBecause research can effect change, scientists have a responsibility to act and speak with extreme prudence. Scientists ought to consider the social repercussions of technological applications or the dissemination of incomplete information resulting from their work, and they ought to explain to the general public and decision-makers the level of scientific uncertainty or incompleteness in their conclusions.\nTo help people adapt to environmental change, they should also not be afraid to fully utilize the predictive capacity of science when done right, especially in situations where there are immediate concerns like natural disasters or water shortages.\nThe S&T sector offers straightforward, reasonably priced scientific solutions that enable people to save time and effort and increase their revenue. Technologies provide value to the goods produced by the cottage and small-scale industries, boosting their competitiveness.\nBy focusing on computer literacy and making IT accessible to individuals without formal schooling, S&T can, in general, play a significant role in bringing IT to the most isolated regions of the nation.\nBy focusing on computer literacy and making IT accessible to individuals without formal schooling, S&T can, in general, play a significant role in bringing IT to the most isolated regions of the nation.\nThus, via skill development and training that is activity-oriented, supporting the growth of entrepreneurship, and promoting self-employment using new technologies, the \u201cproblem population\u201d can be transformed into an important \u201chuman resource.\u201d\nS&T provides solutions for short-term issues like switching to non-conventional energy sources and product packaging as well as long-term issues like drought, epidemics, drinking water shortages, nutrition, sanitation, health, and housing.\nThrough the use of environmentally friendly technology, S&T knowledge can be used to create ways to encourage people to develop the habit of using natural resources like wood, bamboo, medicinal plants, etc. more wisely.\nDevelopments in Science and Technology and Society\n\nIn the past 200 years, the wealthier sectors of the human race have primarily exploited science as a tool for military might and economic advancement. It is increasingly obvious that the existing use of natural resources and growing strains on the local and regional environment cannot go on indefinitely without the breakdown of the natural support systems that enable current civilizations.\n\nScience, which played a role in creating this scenario, now bears the primary duty of assisting societies in moving away from a fixation with growth and toward the development of an ecological and economic system that is dynamically stable and sustainable.\n\nAn alliance between contemporary technical science with the universal knowledge of indigenous societies and philosophers from all cultures can be crucial throughout this transition.\n\nThe pace of change in both natural and human conditions and problems is predicted to increase in the twenty-first century.\n\nScientists have a growing responsibility to work with policymakers and the general public to find and implement solutions or means of adaptation to issues that are both local and global, such as balancing the current competitive profit motive with the common good; allowing contributions from and benefits to marginalized elements of society and minority cultures; justifying current expenditures to avoid costs or damages to future generations; and rewarding scientific achievement.\n\nThere has never been a more crucial time for Developments in Science and Technology to influence and progress society and government.\n\nArticle written by Aseem Muhammed",

However, this system was often manipulated for political purposes.\n\nJulian Calendar and the Introduction of Leap Years\n\nThe story begins with the Julian calendar, introduced by Julius Caesar in 45 BC.\nAdvised by the astronomer Sosigenes, Caesar reformed the Roman calendar to include 365 days and introduced an extra day every four years.\nThis system was revolutionary but not without flaws. It assumed a year of precisely 365.25 days, slightly overestimating the solar year\u2019s length.\n\nTransition to the Gregorian Calendar\n\nBy the 16th century, the Julian calendar had caused a significant drift from the astronomical seasons, affecting the timing of Easter.\nThe Gregorian calendar reform, instituted by Pope Gregory XIII in 1582, introduced a more refined leap year rule: years divisible by 4 would be leap years, except for those divisible by 100, unless they were also divisible by 400.\nThis system significantly improved the calendar\u2019s accuracy, aligning it closely with the solar year.\nThe Significance of Leap Years\n\nLeap years serve several crucial functions, primarily ensuring that our calendar remains in alignment with Earth\u2019s position relative to the Sun. This alignment is vital for several reasons:\n\nSeasonal Alignment: The primary reason for leap years is to keep the calendar year synchronized with the astronomical seasons. Without this adjustment, our calendar would drift approximately one day every four years, leading to a shift of about 25 days after a century. This drift would eventually result in noticeable shifts in the seasons as marked on the calendar, affecting agriculture, seasonal observances, and daily life.\nAgricultural Practices: Many farming practices are tied to the seasons. A calendar out of sync with the natural cycle would disrupt planting and harvesting schedules, leading to confusion and potential food shortages.\nCultural and Religious Observances: Many festivals and ceremonies are tied to specific seasons or dates. Leap years help maintain the consistency of these observances.\nHow Leap Years Work?\n\nThe current rule for determining a leap year is straightforward but effective in aligning the calendar year with the astronomical year:\n\nBasic Rule: Any year that is divisible by 4 is a leap year.\nCentury Years: These are leap years only if they can be evenly divided by 400. Thus, while the year 2000 was a leap year, 1900 was not, and 2100 will not be.\n\nThis system corrects the Julian calendar\u2019s overestimation, removing three leap days every four centuries and maintaining a closer approximation to the solar year.\n\nCultural and Practical Impacts\n\nLeap years have more than just astronomical significance; they affect various aspects of human culture and practical life:\n\nTimekeeping and Work Schedules: An extra day every four years requires adjustments in work schedules, financial calculations, and even software programming to account for February 29.\nTraditions and Superstitions: Some cultures have developed unique traditions and superstitions around leap years, such as the belief that they are auspicious or inauspicious for weddings, or the custom in some places that women may propose marriage to men on February 29.\nLeap Seconds\n\nBeyond leap years, the concept of leap seconds further illustrates our need to adjust timekeeping systems to match Earth\u2019s rotational irregularities.\n\nSince the planet\u2019s rotation is not perfectly consistent, occasional leap seconds are added to or subtracted from Coordinated Universal Time (UTC) to keep clocks in sync with Earth\u2019s rotation.\nCriticisms\n\nDespite the effectiveness of the Gregorian calendar, some critics argue that leap years are a patchwork solution to deeper inaccuracies in our calendar system.\n\nProposals for new calendars, such as the World Calendar or the International Fixed Calendar, seek to eliminate the need for leap years through a more systematic approach to dividing the year.\n\nHowever, the widespread adoption of such calendars faces significant cultural and logistical hurdles.\n\nConclusion\n\nLeap years are a cornerstone of our modern calendar system, embodying our ongoing quest to harmonize human-made systems with the natural world\u2019s cycles.\n\nThey remind us of the complexities involved in this endeavor and the ingenious solutions humanity has devised to bridge the gap between celestial phenomena and the practicalities of daily life.\n\nAs we continue to refine our understanding of Earth\u2019s movements and the cosmos at large, the concept of leap years represents a fascinating intersection of science, history, and culture, highlighting our perpetual effort to measure and organize time.\n\nRelated articles:\n\nSolstice and Equinox\nOrigin of Earth\nGeological Time scale\n\n-Article by Swathi Satish",

J. Thomson and Lord Rutherford.\n\n\ud83d\udc49 Which year are YOU targeting for success in the IAS/IPS/IFS Exam? \ud83d\ude80\n\n(1) \u21d2 UPSC 2025: Prelims cum Mains\n\n(2) \u21d2 UPSC 2026: Prelims cum Mains\n\n(3) \u21d2 UPSC 2027 Prelims cum Mains\n\nTip: Know more about ClearIAS Courses (Online/Offline)\n\nRaman\u2019s specialty had been the study of the vibrations and sounds of stringed instruments such as the violin, the Indian veena, and tambura, and two uniquely Indian percussion instruments, the tabla, and the mridangam.\n\nBut it was the return trip from London to Bombay aboard the SS Narkunda that would change forever the direction of Raman\u2019s future.\n\nDuring the fifteen-day voyage, his restless and probing mind became fascinated with the deep blue color of the Mediterranean.\nUnable to accept Lord Rayleigh\u2019s explanation that the color of the sea was just a reflection of the color of the sky, Raman proceeded to outline his thoughts on the matter while still at sea and sent a letter to the editors of the journal Nature when the ship docked in Bombay.\n\nA short time later Raman was able to show conclusively that the color of the sea was the result of the scattering of sunlight by the water molecules.\n\nIronically, it was the same argument that Rayleigh had invoked when explaining the color of the sky \u2013 the blue was the result of the scattering of sunlight by the molecules in the air.\n\nAlso read: Indian Scientists: From Ancient to Modern Era\n\nNobel Prize and the Raman Effect\n\nCV Raman\u2019s most celebrated discovery, the Raman Effect, came in 1928. It demonstrated that when light traverses a transparent material, some of the deflected light changes wavelength and amplitude.\n\nThis discovery was groundbreaking because it confirmed the quantum nature of light and was the first strong evidence of the quantum behavior of molecules.\nRaman used a simple apparatus to show that when light passes through a transparent substance, it scatters, and the scattered light contains frequencies not present in the original light, a phenomenon that could not be explained by classical physics.\n\nFor this discovery, he was awarded the Nobel Prize in Physics in 1930, becoming the first Asian and the first non-white to receive a Nobel Prize in the sciences.\n\nWhat is the Raman effect?\n\nThe Raman Effect occurs when light interacts with the molecules of a material, causing a change in the energy and wavelength of the scattered light.\n\nWhen monochromatic light (light of a single wavelength, usually from a laser) is directed at a material, most of the light scatters elastically (Rayleigh scattering), meaning it retains its original energy and wavelength.\nHowever, a small fraction of the light (approximately 1 in 10 million photons) scatters inelastically, either gaining or losing energy in the process. This inelastic scattering is the Raman Effect.\n\nStokes and Anti-Stokes Scattering\n\nThe energy change in the scattered light corresponds to the vibrational energies of the molecules in the material.\n\nIf the scattered light loses energy (shifts to a longer wavelength), it is called Stokes scattering.\nConversely, if the scattered light gains energy (shifts to a shorter wavelength), it is called Anti-Stokes scattering.\nThe difference in energy between the incident and scattered light directly relates to the vibrational energy levels of the molecules in the sample.\n\nThe discovery of the Raman Effect was a milestone in experimental physics and quantum theory.\n\nIt provided the first experimental evidence of the quantum nature of light and molecules, supporting the theoretical predictions of quantum mechanics.\nThe Raman Effect showed that light-matter interactions could result in the exchange of energy, leading to a deeper understanding of molecular energy levels and the electromagnetic spectrum.\nApplication of Raman effect\n\nPhysics:\n\nIn the first seven years after its discovery, the Raman Effect was the subject of more than 700 papers in the scientific literature, mostly by physicists who were using the technique to study the vibration and rotation of molecules and relating those phenomena to the molecular structure.\n\nChemistry:\n\nBy the late 1930s, the Raman Effect had become the principal method of non-destructive chemical analysis for both organic and inorganic compounds.\n\nThe unique spectrum of Raman scattered light for any particular substance served as a \u201cfingerprint\u201d that could be used for qualitative analysis, even in a mixture of materials.\nRaman spectroscopy could be applied not only to liquids but also to gases and solids.\nThe use of Raman spectroscopy as a basic analytical tool changed sharply after World War II.\nDuring the war, infrared spectroscopy was enhanced by the development of sensitive detectors and advances in electronics.\n\nOther applications:\n\nMaterial Science: It helps in characterizing materials, understanding their structure, and studying phase transitions.\nBiological Studies: Raman spectroscopy is used in the medical field to diagnose diseases, analyze biochemical changes in cells, and study drug interactions at the molecular level.\nPharmaceuticals: It assists in drug development and quality control by identifying the molecular composition and crystalline forms of drugs.\nEnvironmental Science: It is employed in detecting pollutants and analyzing environmental changes.\nAcademic and Research Contributions\n\nAfter his Nobel win, Raman\u2019s reputation and influence grew. He served as the director of the Indian Institute of Science (IISc) in Bangalore from 1933 to 1937.\n\nHe established the Raman Research Institute in Bangalore in 1948, where he worked until he died in 1970.\n\nHe also founded the Indian Journal of Physics in 1926, of which he is the Editor. Raman sponsored the establishment of the Indian Academy of Sciences and has served as President since its inception.\n\nHis research at these institutions spanned various domains of physics, including crystal dynamics, musical instruments, and the properties of diamonds.\n\nLegacy\n\nRaman\u2019s legacy is not just in his scientific discoveries but also in his role as a leader in Indian science. He was instrumental in promoting scientific research in India, inspiring generations of scientists.\n\nDespite facing several challenges, including limited resources and recognition from the global scientific community initially, Raman\u2019s perseverance and dedication to science shone brightly. His work laid the groundwork for numerous scientific advancements, including the study of molecular energy levels, chemical analysis techniques, and even the investigation of quantum mechanics.\n\nSir CV Raman passed away on November 21, 1970, leaving behind a rich legacy of scientific inquiry and discovery. His life and work continue to inspire scientists around the world, underscoring the importance of curiosity, perseverance, and the relentless pursuit of knowledge.\n\nRelated article:\n\nIndian Scientists\nJagadish Chandra Bose\nCSIR\nWomen in STEM\n\n-Article by Swathi Satish",

    "[CONTENT] #135": "Bitcoin halving is a significant event in the cryptocurrency world that directly impacts the number of new bitcoins generated and rewarded to miners for validating transactions and securing the Bitcoin network. Read here to learn more about it.\n\nThis event occurs approximately every four years, or more precisely, every 210,000 blocks.\n\nThe process is a core part of Bitcoin\u2018s economic model, based on deflationary principles, to control the supply of new bitcoins entering the market and, over time, mimic the scarcity and value preservation similar to precious metals like gold.\n\nWhat is the significance of this event and why does it matter to cryptocurrency investors?\n\nTable of Contents\n\nWhat Happens During a Bitcoin Halving?\nSignificance of Bitcoin Halving\nWhat impact will the Bitcoin Halving have on investors?\nChallenges and Criticisms\nWhy in the news?\nFuture of Bitcoin Halving\nConclusion\nWhat Happens During a Bitcoin Halving?\n\nWhen Bitcoin miners successfully process other people\u2019s cryptocurrency transactions and add them to the blockchain, a public digital record, they are rewarded with 50% less money. This is known as the \u201cBitcoin Halving.\u201d\n\nMining Bitcoin requires sophisticated computer hardware to solve a challenging mathematical puzzle through a method called \u201cProof of work,\u201d which is necessary to \u201cgrow\u201d the blockchain and maintain the ecosystem.\n\n\ud83d\udc49 Which year are YOU targeting for success in the IAS/IPS/IFS Exam? \ud83d\ude80\n\n(1) \u21d2 UPSC 2025: Prelims cum Mains\n\n(2) \u21d2 UPSC 2026: Prelims cum Mains\n\n(3) \u21d2 UPSC 2027 Prelims cum Mains\n\nTip: Know more about ClearIAS Courses (Online/Offline)\n\nBitcoin transactions have a significant carbon footprint and need a significant amount of power due to their intensive activity.\n\nDuring a Bitcoin halving, the reward that miners receive for adding a new block to the Bitcoin blockchain is cut in half.\n\nWhen Bitcoin was first introduced in 2009, the block reward was 50 bitcoins per block.\nThe first halving in 2012 reduced this reward to 25 bitcoins, the second halving in 2016 brought it down to 12.5 bitcoins, and the third halving in 2020 further reduced the reward to 6.25 bitcoins per block.\nThe next halving is expected to occur in 2024, which will decrease the block reward to 3.125 bitcoins.\nSignificance of Bitcoin Halving\nControlled Supply: Bitcoin\u2019s total supply is capped at 21 million coins. Halvings are crucial to ensure that this cap is not reached too quickly. By reducing the rate at which new bitcoins are generated, Bitcoin mimics the extraction curve of a resource like gold\u2014becoming harder and more resource-intensive to mine over time.\nInflation Rate: Halving events decreases the rate at which new bitcoins are created, effectively lowering the inflation rate of the Bitcoin ecosystem. This is in stark contrast to fiat currencies, where central banks can print money at will, potentially leading to high inflation.\nMarket Impact: Historically, halving events have led to increased public interest and speculative activity around Bitcoin, often resulting in significant price movements. Many investors view halving as a bullish event due to the reduced supply of new bitcoins against what is assumed to be a consistently growing or stable demand.\nMiner\u2019s Revenue: The halving can impact miners\u2019 profitability as their rewards for mining new blocks are reduced. However, if the price of Bitcoin increases sufficiently following a halving, it can potentially offset the reduced block reward, maintaining or even increasing the profitability of mining.\nWhat impact will the Bitcoin Halving have on investors?\n\nThese impacts are multifaceted, affecting investor sentiment, market volatility, and the long-term valuation of Bitcoin. Understanding these impacts can help investors navigate the complexities of cryptocurrency markets, especially around halving events.\n\nShort-term Impact on Investors\n\nIncreased Volatility: Halving events often leads to increased market volatility. Investors might see significant price swings as the halving approaches and in the immediate aftermath. This volatility can create profit opportunities but also poses substantial risks.\nSpeculative Trading: The anticipation of a halving can attract speculative trading, as some investors may buy Bitcoin hoping its price will increase post-halving, given the reduced supply of new bitcoins entering the market. This speculative frenzy can inflate prices temporarily but can also lead to corrections if the price increase is not sustained in the aftermath.\n\nLong-term Impact on Investors\n\nPotential Price Appreciation: Historically, Bitcoin\u2019s price has appreciated significantly following halving events, although past performance is not indicative of future results. The reduced pace at which new bitcoins are generated post-halving can create supply pressures if demand remains constant or increases, potentially driving up the price over the long term.\nIncreased Institutional Interest: The deflationary aspect of Bitcoin becomes more pronounced with each halving, which can attract institutional investors looking for a hedge against inflation. Increased institutional investment can bring more stability to the Bitcoin market, benefiting long-term investors.\nRisk and Reward Reassessment: The changing dynamics post-halving require investors to reassess their risk and reward expectations. As the block reward decreases and the cost of mining increases, the security and economic model of Bitcoin may also evolve, affecting its long-term viability and value.\nChallenges and Criticisms\nMiner Concentration: As block rewards decrease, smaller miners may find it unprofitable to continue mining, potentially leading to a concentration of mining power among large-scale mining operations. This centralization can pose security risks to the Bitcoin network.\nMarket Volatility: Halving events can introduce significant volatility in the Bitcoin market. Speculative trading in anticipation of price increases can lead to sharp price swings.\nEnergy Consumption: The Bitcoin mining process is energy-intensive, and as the rewards decrease, there is a concern about the sustainability of mining practices, especially if the energy used is sourced from non-renewable resources.\nWhy in the news?\n\nThe next Bitcoin Halving is due to take place around April 2024.\n\nAs of February 14, 2024, the price of 1 BTC was around $49,528. This means a mining reward on February 14 would be worth around $3,09,550 (6.25 x price of 1 BTC).\nWhether this value will rise or fall after the Bitcoin Halving depends on the price of Bitcoin.\nFuture of Bitcoin Halving\n\nThe process of halving will continue approximately every four years until the maximum supply of 21 million bitcoins has been mined, which is expected to occur around the year 2140.\n\nAfter the last Bitcoin halving, miners will no longer receive block rewards in the form of new bitcoins.\n\nInstead, their compensation will solely come from transaction fees paid by users to process transactions. This shift is anticipated to ensure the long-term economic viability and security of the Bitcoin network.\n\nConclusion\n\nBitcoin halving remains a fundamental aspect of Bitcoin\u2019s economic model, demonstrating its unique approach to creating a decentralized, deflationary, and digital store of value. While it presents challenges, particularly for miners, its historical significance in driving interest and investment in Bitcoin cannot be understated.\n\n-Article by Swathi Satish",

The protection duration is believed to be at least 5 years, with ongoing studies to determine the exact duration of immunity.\nTypbar Vi Polysaccharide Vaccine: While effective, the immunity from the polysaccharide vaccine tends to wane after 2 to 3 years, necessitating booster doses for continued protection.\n\nAdministration:\n\nThe Typbar vaccine is administered as an injection. The TCV is usually given as a single dose, which can simplify vaccination campaigns and ensure broader coverage in endemic areas.\n\nSafety and Side Effects:\n\nThe Typbar vaccine is generally safe and well-tolerated. Common side effects are mild and may include pain at the injection site, fever, headache, and nausea. These side effects typically resolve without treatment within a few days.\n\nWhat is a Conjugate Vaccine?\n\nTypbar TCV is a conjugate vaccine.\n\nConjugate vaccines combine a weak antigen with a strong antigen or carrier protein. This augments the immune response to the weak antigen, creating a more robust and durable immune response.\n\nFor Typbar, the weak S. Typhi antigen is conjugated with a carrier protein. When injected, this triggers the body to produce T-cell-dependent anti-S. Typhi antibodies and memory B cells.\n\nThe carrier protein enables the induction of immune memory, providing long-lasting immunity against typhoid fever.\n\nAlso read: Immunity: Understand Human Immune System\n\nSignificance of Typbar Typhoid Vaccine\n\nThe significance of the Typbar Typhoid Vaccine is:\n\nThe results so far demonstrate Typbar TCV\u2019s ability to provide durable, long-term protection against typhoid fever in both children and adults.\nIt is the first typhoid vaccine to show efficacy beyond 2 years post-vaccination.\nEarlier efficacy trials had follow-up periods of only 2-3 years after vaccination.\nThe 4-year protection data is vital evidence for policymakers considering large-scale typhoid vaccination.\nThe findings validate Typbar TCV\u2019s role in long-term typhoid control and prevention in endemic regions.\nTyphoid Disease Burden\n\nTyphoid remains a serious public health problem that disproportionately impacts children and marginalized populations in Asia and Sub-Saharan Africa lacking access to safe water and sanitation.\n\nIn 2019, nearly 11 million typhoid cases and 110,000 typhoid deaths occurred globally.\nChildren bear the highest burden, with the majority of cases and deaths occurring in children under 15 years of age.\nSouth Asia accounts for nearly 80% of the global typhoid burden, followed by Sub-Saharan Africa.\nAntimicrobial resistance is making typhoid harder to treat, increasing risks of complications and death.\nOutbreaks continue to emerge globally, including in Fiji, Pakistan, and the Democratic Republic of Congo in recent years.\nClimate change and increasing urbanization may further increase typhoid risk in vulnerable regions.\n\nAlso Read: Sanitation System in India\n\nRole of Vaccination\n\nThe role of vaccination for typhoid is:\n\nTyphoid vaccination is an important prevention strategy, alongside safe water, sanitation, and hygiene interventions.\nMultiple typhoid vaccines exist, but Typbar TCV is the only one suitable for children under 2 years old.\nIts compatibility with routine childhood immunization schedules facilitates reaching high coverage.\nWHO recommends routine programmatic use of TCVs in typhoid-endemic countries.\nGavi provides financial support for vaccine introduction in eligible low-income countries.\nOver 20 countries have introduced TCVs so far, including Nepal, Bangladesh, Pakistan, Liberia, Zimbabwe, and India.\nWidespread TCV vaccination can significantly reduce disease incidence and save lives.\nWhy in the news?\n\nRecently, a phase-3 clinical trial conducted in Malawi, Africa has demonstrated the long-term protective efficacy of Bharat Biotech\u2019s Typbar Typhoid Conjugate Vaccine (TCV) in children and adults.\n\nThese landmark findings have vital implications for India\u2019s typhoid control strategy.\n\nThe trial provides the first evidence of long-term efficacy for TCVs in children aged 9 months to 12 years.\n\nTypbar TCV conferred 77% protective efficacy against typhoid fever through 4 years post-vaccination.\nThe efficacy was consistent across all age groups studied, including infants, toddlers, young children, and older children.\nTypbar is the world\u2019s first clinically proven conjugate typhoid vaccine with long-term protection data.\nThe results validate Typbar TCV as a tool to improve long-term typhoid fever control in endemic regions.\nTrial Design of Typbar Typhoid Vaccine\n\nPhase 3, a double-blind, randomized, controlled field trial was conducted from 2015 to 2019 in Blantyre, Malawi. This urban area has a high burden of typhoid.\n\nThe trial had over 20,000 participants aged between 9 months and 45 years. They were randomized to receive either a single dose of Typbar TCV or a control vaccine.\n\nBlood samples were collected and tested for anti-S. Typhi antibodies periodically after vaccination. Participants were followed for typhoid fever incidence through passive surveillance at health centers.\n\nKey Findings\n\nSome important findings related to the Typbar Typhoid Vaccine are:\n\nFrom 9 months to 4 years post-vaccination, the cumulative efficacy of Typbar was 77%.\nProtection was consistent across all pediatric age cohorts \u2013 infants, toddlers, young children, and older children.\nSeroconversion rates (antibody response) exceeded 90% in all age groups.\nNo significant waning in antibody titers occurred during the 4 years, indicating sustained vaccine effectiveness.\nThe vaccine was well-tolerated with no serious adverse events reported.\nThe Way Forward\n\nThe Malawi trial results validate Typbar TCV as an effective, practical tool for long-term typhoid control even in very young children.\n\nPolicymakers in typhoid-endemic countries should utilize these findings to make evidence-based decisions on national typhoid vaccination policies and strategies.\n\nFinancial and technical support from partners like Gavi must continue to expedite TCV rollout in countries that need them most.\n\nInvesting in typhoid vaccines today will ultimately help save lives, reduce poverty, unlock human potential, and accelerate progress towards the UN Sustainable Development Goals.\n\nConclusion\n\nThe proven long-term efficacy of Typbar TCV is a game-changer for typhoid control in India.\n\nWidespread TCV vaccination, as recommended by WHO, combined with continued investments in water, sanitation, and hygiene, will be pivotal for India to achieve its target of typhoid elimination by 2030 in line with the Sustainable Development Goals.\n\nOn the self-reliance front, Typbar demonstrates India\u2019s growing capabilities in developing and producing life-saving vaccines domestically.\n\nRead: Modern vaccines: Why do they have low durability?\n\nArticle Written By: Priti Raj",

Initial experiments in the late 1900s demonstrated the feasibility of direct brain-to-machine communication.\n\n\ud83d\udc49 Which year are YOU targeting for success in the IAS/IPS/IFS Exam? \ud83d\ude80\n\n(1) \u21d2 UPSC 2025: Prelims cum Mains\n\n(2) \u21d2 UPSC 2026: Prelims cum Mains\n\n(3) \u21d2 UPSC 2027 Prelims cum Mains\n\nTip: Know more about ClearIAS Courses (Online/Offline)\n\nHow do BCIs Work?\nBCIs read brain signals, translate them into digital commands, and send these commands to an output device. This process involves signal acquisition, signal processing, and command execution.\nThere are invasive (implanted electrodes) and non-invasive methods (EEG, fMRI) of signal acquisition. Invasive methods offer higher accuracy but come with greater medical risks.\nTypes of BCIs\n\nThere are two main types of brain-computer interfaces: invasive and non-invasive.\n\nInvasive BCI\n\nUsing surgical techniques, invasive BCIs are implanted directly into a patient\u2019s brain tissue.\nInvasive brain-computer interfaces (BCIs) are a better option for individuals recovering from serious diseases such as paralysis, accidents, and neuromuscular disorders since surgery carries significant risks.\n\nNon-invasive BCI\n\nWhen a patient wears a non-invasive brain-machine interface (BCI), an electrical sensor-equipped device acts as a two-way communication channel between the patient\u2019s brain and the machine.\nSince these brain-computer connections aren\u2019t attached directly to brain tissue, their impulses are weaker.\nTherefore, non-invasive BCIs would be more appropriate for applications like augmented reality, virtual gaming, and controlling the movements of robots and other devices.\nApplications of Brain-Computer Interface\nMedical Rehabilitation: BCIs have been instrumental in aiding patients with paralysis or loss of limb function. Devices controlled by neural activity can restore some degree of autonomy, enabling individuals to control prosthetic limbs, wheelchairs, or computers.\nCommunication Aid: For individuals with conditions like ALS or severe paralysis, BCIs offer a means of communication, using brain signals to operate speech-generating devices or keyboards.\nNeurofeedback and Therapy: BCIs are used in neurofeedback therapies for conditions like ADHD or PTSD, helping patients learn to regulate their brain activity.\nAugmenting Human Capabilities: In non-medical applications, BCIs are being explored for enhancing cognitive abilities, gaming, and even in military applications.\nDrones: Research is been going on to develop hands-free drones for military use. This would allow soldiers to telepathically control swarms of unmanned aerial vehicles.\nChallenges and Ethical Considerations\nTechnical Challenges: The accuracy, speed, and reliability of BCIs are ongoing challenges. Signal interference and the complexity of the brain\u2019s neural network are significant hurdles.\nEthical and Privacy Issues: BCIs raise ethical questions about privacy (thoughts read by machines), identity (changes in self-perception), and equity (access to advanced technologies).\nRegulatory Hurdles: The regulation of BCIs, especially in medical contexts, is complex, involving various standards and approvals to ensure safety and efficacy.\nSocial Impact: As BCIs become more prevalent, there are concerns about societal impacts, including the potential for widening the gap between those with access to such technologies and those without.\nExamples of BCIs developed\n\nNEURALINK\u2019S COIN-SIZED BRAIN CHIP\n\nThe neurotechnology company, headed by Elon Musk, is developing a coin-sized surgical implant. To monitor brain activity as closely as possible, Neuralink\u2019s device, the Link, uses micron-scale wires of electrodes that fan out into the brain. Its primary focus is to treat paralysis. In addition to a \u201cFitbit for your skull,\u201d the startup is building an eight-foot robot to place the neural threads.\n\nNEURABLE\u2019S BCI-ENHANCED HEADPHONES\n\nThe brain-computer interface startup is building software and hardware, in the form of headphones that interpret brain signals to level up productivity. The wearable, BCI-enhanced device auto-mutes notifications, activates noise canceling, and turns on \u2018Do Not Disturb.\u2019 It also tracks how different songs and genres impact a user\u2019s focus, then recommends personalized playlists and suggests breaks.\n\nPRECISION NEUROSCIENCE\u2019S ELECTRODE-PACKED FILM\n\nThe neural platform is approaching brain-computer interface systems with a surgically implanted brain chip that\u2019s minimally invasive and fully reversible. The Layer 7 Cortical Interface is a thin film of micro-electrodes, about 1.5 centimeters in length and a fraction of a hair thick, that conforms to the brain\u2019s cortex just under the skull without damaging any tissue. Precision tech wants to mainstream BCIs from small-scale research labs to medical facilities as a way to treat neurological diseases. In June 2023, Precision conducted an in-human clinical study of its neural implant.\n\nSYNCHRON\u2019S ENDOVASCULAR ALLOY CHIP\u00a0\n\nBacked by Bill Gates and Jeff Bezos, Synchron, a bioelectronics medicine company, is mapping the brain via blood vessels. Inserted through the jugular vein, the Stentrode is a neuroprosthesis placed in the superior sagittal sinus near the motor cortex. The eight-millimeter flexible alloy chip transmits neurological signals to a receiver unit implanted into the patient\u2019s chest, which then translates thoughts into clicks and keystrokes on a computer or mobile device in real-time. Synchron received approval from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration for human clinical trials in 2021, totaling four patients thus far, according to medical journal JAMA Network.\n\nBLACKROCK NEUROTECH\u2019S MESH LACE\n\nThe neurotech platform Blackrock Neurotech has been testing its devices in humans since 2004 in its two decades of brain-computer interface development. Blackrock\u2019s product portfolio has helped patients regain tactile function, movement of their limbs and prosthetics as well as the ability to control digital devices solely from thought. Its latest project, Neuralace, is a flexible, hexagonal mesh patch \u2014 thinner than an eyelash \u2014 designed to conform to the fissures and sulci of the brain. Its large surface area can capture 10,000 neural channels, inching closer to whole-brain data capture.\n\nConclusion\n\nBrain-computer interfaces stand at the convergence of technology and human cognition, offering revolutionary applications that could redefine medical treatment, communication, and human-computer interaction.\n\nWhile the path forward is fraught with technical, ethical, and social challenges, the potential benefits of BCIs in improving quality of life and enhancing human capabilities are immense.\n\nThe future of BCIs is incredibly promising, with ongoing research pushing the boundaries of what is possible. Developments in machine learning, nanotechnology, and neuroimaging are likely to enhance the capabilities and applications of BCIs.\nCollaborative efforts between neuroscientists, engineers, ethicists, and policymakers are crucial to addressing the challenges and harnessing the full potential of BCIs responsibly.\n\nAs we venture further into this uncharted territory, it is imperative to navigate these challenges thoughtfully, ensuring that the development of BCIs is guided by a commitment to bettering human lives and upholding ethical standards.\n\nAlso Read:\u00a0Artificial Neural Network\n\n-Article by Swathi Satish",

Read further to learn more about the powerful event.\n\nA new study has suggested that GRBs have the potential to temporarily destroy the ozone layer.\n\nOne of the brightest GRBs since the start of human civilization was recorded by the observatories. It was named BOAT, short for \u201cBrightest of All Time\u201d.\n\nIt didn\u2019t originate from the Milky Way. No, the BOAT came from a galaxy behind our own, or, in other words, the BOAT\u2019s brightness really cannot be overstated.\n\nGRBs are some of the most powerful events in the universe, emitting more energy in a few seconds than our sun will do in its entire lifetime.\n\nTable of Contents\n\nGamma-ray bursts\nThe scientific significance of GRBs\nImpact of GRBs on Planets\nConclusion\nGamma-ray bursts\n\nGamma-ray bursts (GRBs) are the most powerful and explosions in the known universe. These brief flashes of high-energy light result from some of the universe\u2019s most explosive events, including the birth of black holes and collisions between neutron stars.\n\n\ud83d\udc49 Which year are YOU targeting for success in the IAS/IPS/IFS Exam? \ud83d\ude80\n\n(1) \u21d2 UPSC 2025: Prelims cum Mains\n\n(2) \u21d2 UPSC 2026: Prelims cum Mains\n\n(3) \u21d2 UPSC 2027 Prelims cum Mains\n\nTip: Know more about ClearIAS Courses (Online/Offline)\n\nGamma-ray bursts release a tremendous amount of energy in a short period, typically ranging from milliseconds to several minutes. The energy emitted during a GRB is so intense that it can outshine an entire galaxy for a brief moment.\n\nGamma-ray bursts were first discovered in the late 1960s by satellites designed to monitor the Partial Test Ban Treaty.\n\nThe Vela satellites, part of the United States Vela Hotel program, detected bursts of gamma rays coming from random directions in space.\nSince then, dedicated satellites like NASA\u2019s Swift Observatory and the Fermi Gamma-ray Space Telescope have been used to observe and study GRBs.\n\nGamma-ray bursts are broadly classified into two types:\n\nLong-duration bursts, lasting more than two seconds, are associated with the collapse of massive stars. The progenitors of long-duration gamma-ray bursts are believed to be massive stars that have exhausted their nuclear fuel and undergo core collapse, leading to the formation of a black hole.\nShort-duration bursts, lasting less than two seconds, are thought to result from the merger of compact objects like neutron stars. Short-duration bursts are associated with the merger of compact binary systems, such as neutron star-neutron star or neutron star-black hole pairs.\nThe scientific significance of GRBs\n\nAfter the initial burst of gamma rays, there is often an \u201cafterglow\u201d in other wavelengths, such as X-rays, visible light, and radio waves.\n\nStudying the afterglows allows astronomers to gather information about the environment surrounding the burst, the distance to the burst, and the nature of the progenitor system.\n\nGamma-ray bursts are distributed isotropically in the sky, indicating that they come from all directions in the universe.\n\nThey are thought to be associated with extremely distant and powerful events.\nBecause of their immense energy, they can be detected across vast cosmic distances, providing insights into the early universe.\n\nWhile gamma-ray bursts are intriguing cosmic phenomena, they are not a direct threat to Earth.\n\nThe intense bursts of gamma rays, however, could potentially impact the atmospheres of planets in the line of sight if they were to occur in relatively proximity to our solar system.\n\nStudying gamma-ray bursts is crucial for understanding the processes associated with extreme astrophysical events, the formation and behavior of black holes, and the conditions in the early universe. They serve as natural laboratories for testing the limits of our understanding of physics.\n\nImpact of GRBs on Planets\n\nWhile GRBs themselves are not a direct threat to planets in the vicinity, their impact could potentially influence the atmospheres of planets under certain conditions.\n\nIonization of Atmospheres: The intense gamma-ray radiation from a GRB could ionize the atmospheres of planets in the line of sight. This ionization process involves stripping electrons from atoms, creating charged particles. The extent of ionization depends on factors such as the distance from the GRB, the intensity of the burst, and the composition of the planet\u2019s atmosphere.\nOzone Depletion: Gamma-ray bursts have the potential to deplete ozone in a planet\u2019s atmosphere. The high-energy gamma rays can break apart oxygen molecules in the atmosphere, leading to the destruction of ozone. Ozone depletion could have implications for a planet\u2019s climate and the levels of ultraviolet radiation reaching the surface.\nBiological Impact: On Earth, the ozone layer provides a crucial shield against harmful ultraviolet (UV) radiation from the Sun. If a nearby GRB were to cause significant ozone depletion, it could have adverse effects on the biosphere by allowing more UV radiation to reach the surface. This could harm living organisms, particularly those not adapted to higher UV levels.\nGalactic and Cosmic Impacts: While individual GRBs are rare and generally occur at cosmological distances, their cumulative impact over cosmic time could have broader effects on the chemistry and composition of galaxies and the interstellar medium.\nPlanetary Conditions: The potential impact of a GRB on a planet\u2019s atmosphere also depends on the specific conditions of the planet, such as its atmospheric composition, magnetic field strength, and the presence of protective elements. Planets with thick atmospheres and strong magnetic fields may be more resilient to the effects of GRBs.\n\nThe impact of a GRB on a planet depends on its distance from the burst. The intensity of gamma-ray radiation diminishes with distance, so planets located far from the source of the GRB would experience less ionization and atmospheric effects\n\nConclusion\n\nGamma-ray bursts continue to be a fascinating area of research in astrophysics, and advances in observational technology and theoretical modeling contribute to our growing understanding of these spectacular cosmic events.\n\nRelated articles:\n\nFast Radio bursts\nMajor telescopes\n\n-Article by Swathi Satish",

Read here the know in detail about the structure, composition, and features of the Sun.\n\nRecently scientists have predicted that the Sun is expected to reach the peak of its activity in 2024, a year earlier than previous estimates.\n\nThis activity, known as \u201csolar maximum\u201d, in the current 11-year cycle will be between January and October 2024, according to the US National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA).\n\nThe 11-year activity cycle of the Sun is tied to the number of sunspots, which in turn are linked to the intensity of space weather, including solar flare activity from the star.\n\nTable of Contents\n\nSolar Cycle\nWhat is space weather?\nThe Sun: structure\nComposition\nFeatures of Sun\nConclusion\nSolar Cycle\n\nThe solar cycle is the cycle that the Sun\u2019s magnetic field goes through approximately every 11 years.\n\nEvery 11 years or so, the Sun\u2019s magnetic field completely flips. This means that the Sun\u2019s north and south poles switch places.\nThen it takes about another 11 years for the Sun\u2019s north and south poles to flip back again.\nThe solar cycle affects activity on the surface of the Sun, such as sunspots which are caused by the Sun\u2019s magnetic fields.\nAs the magnetic fields change, so does the amount of activity on the Sun\u2019s surface.\n\nOne way to track the solar cycle is by counting the number of sunspots.\n\n\ud83d\udc49 Which year are YOU targeting for success in the IAS/IPS/IFS Exam? \ud83d\ude80\n\n(1) \u21d2 UPSC 2025: Prelims cum Mains\n\n(2) \u21d2 UPSC 2026: Prelims cum Mains\n\n(3) \u21d2 UPSC 2027 Prelims cum Mains\n\nTip: Know more about ClearIAS Courses (Online/Offline)\n\nThe beginning of a solar cycle is a solar minimum, or when the Sun has the least sunspots. Over time, solar activity and the number of sunspots increase.\nThe middle of the solar cycle is the solar maximum, or when the Sun has the most sunspots. As the cycle ends, it fades back to the solar minimum, and then a new cycle begins.\n\nGiant eruptions on the Sun, such as solar flares and coronal mass ejections, also increase during the solar cycle. These eruptions send powerful bursts of energy and material into space.\n\nThis activity can have effects on Earth. For example, eruptions can cause lights in the sky, called aurora, or impact radio communications. Extreme eruptions can even affect electricity grids on Earth.\n\nWhat is space weather?\n\nActivity on the Sun\u2019s surface creates a type of weather called space weather. The Sun is about 93 million miles (150 million kilometers away from Earth. However, space weather can affect Earth and the rest of the solar system.\n\nThe Sun is always spewing gas and particles into space. This stream of particles is known as the solar wind.\nThe gas and particles come from the Sun\u2019s hot outer atmosphere, called the corona.\nThese particles from the corona are charged with electricity. The solar wind carries these particles toward Earth at up to a million miles per hour!\n\nThe Earth\u2019s magnetic field and atmosphere act as a shield protecting it from the majority of solar wind blasts.\n\nThe Sun: structure\nCourtesy: NASA\n\nThe Sun is located at the center of our solar system. It has a layered structure, consisting of several distinct regions or zones, moving from its core outward.\n\nCore: The core is the innermost region of the Sun, where nuclear fusion reactions take place. It is the hottest part, with temperatures exceeding 15 million degrees Celsius. These high temperatures and pressures cause hydrogen nuclei to fuse into helium, releasing a tremendous amount of energy in the form of light and heat.\nRadiative Zone: Surrounding the core is the radiative zone. In this region, energy generated in the core is transported outward primarily through the process of radiation. Photons of light are absorbed and re-emitted by charged particles, gradually making their way to the next layer.\nConvective Zone: Beyond the radiative zone is the convective zone. In this region, energy is transported by the physical motion of material. Hot, less dense plasma rises from the core to the surface, while cooler, denser material sinks back down in a process called convection.\nPhotosphere: The photosphere is the visible surface of the Sun that emits the light we see. It has an average temperature of around 5,500 degrees Celsius. The photosphere contains various features like sunspots, granules, and supergranules, which are related to the Sun\u2019s magnetic activity.\nChromosphere: Above the photosphere is the chromosphere, a layer of the Sun\u2019s atmosphere. During a solar eclipse, the chromosphere is visible as a reddish-pink ring around the dark disk of the Moon. This region is hotter than the photosphere.\nTransition Region: The transition region is a narrow layer between the chromosphere and the outer atmosphere, known as the corona. Temperatures in the transition region rise rapidly.\nCorona: The corona is the outermost layer, extending millions of kilometers into space. It is incredibly hot, with temperatures exceeding a million degrees Celsius. The corona is visible during a total solar eclipse as a halo of faint, white light radiating from the Sun\u2019s disk.\nComposition\n\nThe Sun is primarily composed of hydrogen (about 74% by mass) and helium (about 24% by mass).\n\nThese two elements undergo nuclear fusion reactions in the core, primarily the fusion of hydrogen nuclei (protons) to form helium nuclei.\nIn addition to hydrogen and helium, the Sun contains trace amounts of other elements, including carbon, nitrogen, oxygen, and heavier elements like iron.\nFeatures of Sun\n\nThe giant star exhibits various features and phenomena:\n\nSunspots: Sunspots are dark, cooler regions on the Sun\u2019s surface caused by strong magnetic activity. They appear in cycles and are associated with the Sun\u2019s magnetic field.\nSolar Flares: Solar flares are sudden and intense bursts of energy and radiation from the Sun\u2019s surface, often associated with sunspots and magnetic activity.\nProminences: Solar prominences are enormous, arching structures of hot, glowing gas that extend from the Sun\u2019s surface into its outer atmosphere. They are often seen during total solar eclipses.\nSolar Wind: The Sun continually emits a stream of charged particles called the solar wind. It can affect Earth\u2019s magnetic field and cause phenomena like the Northern and Southern Lights (Aurora Borealis and Aurora Australis).\nCoronal Mass Ejections (CMEs): CMEs are massive eruptions of solar material from the Sun\u2019s corona. When directed toward Earth, they can disrupt satellites, power grids, and communication systems.\nConclusion\n\nThe Sun\u2019s energy output, in the form of sunlight and solar radiation, is essential for life on Earth and has a profound influence on our planet\u2019s climate and environment. Understanding the Sun\u2019s structure, composition, and features is critical for studying solar physics, space weather, and the impact of solar activity on Earth.\n\nRelated posts:\n\nParker Solar Probe\nAditya-L1 Mission\nArtificial Sun\n\n-Article by Swathi Satish",

Stay updated with our latest content and enhance your exam readiness.\n\nCloud seeding is a weather modification technique that improves a cloud\u2019s ability to produce rain or snow by introducing tiny ice nuclei into certain types of subfreezing clouds.\n\nThe primary goal of it is to enhance precipitation in areas facing water shortages, droughts, or where water resources are critical for agriculture, hydroelectric power generation, or other purposes.\n\nHere\u2019s how cloud seeding works:\n\n\ud83d\udc49 Which year are YOU targeting for success in the IAS/IPS/IFS Exam? \ud83d\ude80\n\n(1) \u21d2 UPSC 2025: Prelims cum Mains\n\n(2) \u21d2 UPSC 2026: Prelims cum Mains\n\n(3) \u21d2 UPSC 2027 Prelims cum Mains\n\nTip: Know more about ClearIAS Courses (Online/Offline)\n\nSelection of Clouds: It typically targets clouds that are rich in supercooled water droplets, which are water droplets that remain in a liquid state at temperatures below freezing.\n\nSeeding Agents: There are two common seeding agents:\n\nSilver Iodide: Silver iodide is the most widely used seeding agent for enhancing snowfall in cold clouds. It has a crystalline structure similar to that of ice, making it effective for promoting the formation of ice crystals.\nCalcium Chloride: Calcium chloride is used for seeding in warmer clouds to encourage raindrop formation.\nOther chemicals: Potassium iodide, dry ice, propane, calcium carbide, ammonium nitrate, sodium chloride, and urea compounds.\n\nDispersion: Seeding agents are dispersed into the clouds using various methods, such as aircraft, ground-based generators, or rockets. These agents provide a nucleus for ice crystal or raindrop formation, allowing precipitation to occur.\n\nAlso read: Clouds\n\nTypes of cloud seeding\n\nDynamic Cloud Seeding: This method aims to stimulate the formation of ice crystals within supercooled water droplets in clouds, particularly in cold cloud systems.\n\nIn this, substances known as cloud seeding agents, such as silver iodide or potassium iodide, are released into clouds. These substances act as ice nuclei, providing a surface for water droplets to freeze onto. Supercooled water droplets that collide with the ice nuclei freeze and grow, forming ice crystals. These ice crystals eventually become large enough to fall as snow or rain.\nIt is most effective in cold cloud systems where temperatures are below freezing but not too cold for ice crystal growth.\nIt is often used in regions that experience water scarcity or where snowpack augmentation is critical for water resource management.\n\nStatic Cloud Seeding: It aims to enhance rainfall from warm clouds, which are typically not cold enough for natural ice crystal formation.\n\nIn this, hygroscopic cloud seeding agents, such as calcium chloride or sodium chloride, are dispersed into warm clouds. These substances attract and absorb moisture, increasing the size of cloud droplets. As the droplets grow larger, they coalesce and become heavy enough to fall as rain.\nIt is suitable for warm cloud systems with high humidity levels but lacks sufficient droplet size for precipitation formation.\nIt is used to increase rainfall in agricultural regions, enhance water resources, and mitigate drought conditions in areas where warm clouds predominate.\n\nHygroscopic Flares: Hygroscopic flares release hygroscopic (water-absorbing) chemicals, such as calcium chloride, into clouds. These chemicals absorb moisture and lead to the growth of cloud droplets into raindrops.\n\nAcoustic Cloud Seeding: It is an experimental technique that uses ground-based or airborne acoustic generators to produce sound waves in clouds. These sound waves can encourage the coalescence of cloud droplets, leading to increased precipitation.\n\nElectric Cloud Seeding: It involves releasing charged particles, such as silver iodide or calcium chloride, into clouds to alter the electrical charge distribution within the clouds. This can influence the collision and coalescence of cloud droplets, leading to enhanced precipitation.\n\nBio-Cloud Seeding: Some researchers have explored the use of bacteria as seeding agents. Certain bacteria can serve as ice nuclei and potentially enhance precipitation when introduced into clouds.\n\nApplications\nDrought Mitigation: It is used to combat drought conditions by increasing precipitation. It is particularly valuable in arid and semi-arid regions.\nWater Resource Management: It is used to augment water resources for agricultural and municipal use. It can help refill reservoirs and aquifers.\nSnowpack Enhancement: In regions that rely on snowmelt for water supply, this method can be used to increase snowfall in mountains, contributing to higher snowpack levels.\nAir Quality Improvement: In some cases, cloud seeding can be employed to reduce air pollution by encouraging precipitation that washes pollutants from the atmosphere.\nChallenges and Concerns\n\nThe effectiveness of cloud seeding can vary depending on several factors, including cloud type, temperature, humidity, and the choice of seeding agents. It is not a guaranteed solution and is subject to natural meteorological conditions.\n\nThe technique has faced some controversies and concerns, including questions about its environmental impact and the safety of the chemicals used.\n\nSome critics argue that the environmental effects and long-term consequences of cloud seeding are not fully understood.\n\nEnvironmental Impact: Cloud seeding typically involves the release of substances into the atmosphere, such as silver iodide or potassium iodide. These substances can have environmental impacts, including concerns about potential toxicity and accumulation in ecosystems.\nHealth and Safety: There are concerns about the health and safety of people exposed to the substances used as seeding agents. While they are typically released at high altitudes, some of these particles may eventually reach the ground.\nUnintended Consequences: It can have unintended consequences. Altering weather patterns in one region can affect weather patterns in neighboring areas, potentially causing droughts or excessive rainfall in unintended places.\nRegulatory Challenges: Regulations and oversight of cloud seeding activities can be inconsistent, leading to concerns about the accountability and transparency of such programs.\nEffectiveness: The effectiveness of the method can vary depending on meteorological conditions and the type of cloud-seeding materials used. It is not always a reliable or predictable method for increasing precipitation.\nLack of Scientific Consensus: While some studies suggest that cloud seeding can be effective in enhancing precipitation, there is not a universal consensus on its efficacy. The scientific community continues to study and debate its effectiveness.\nEthical and Legal Issues: There can be ethical concerns about artificially modifying weather patterns, as it may affect the natural balance of ecosystems and disrupt the environment. Legal issues related to liability and compensation for potential damages can also arise.\nCost-Effectiveness: Such programs can be costly to implement, and their cost-effectiveness is a subject of debate. Weighing the benefits against the expenses is a crucial consideration.\nPublic Concerns: Public perception of cloud seeding programs can vary. Some may support such efforts to address drought conditions, while others may have concerns about the environmental and health impacts.\nTransboundary Issues: Weather systems do not adhere to political borders. Cloud seeding in one region can affect weather patterns in neighboring countries, leading to potential diplomatic and international concerns.\nLong-Term Impact: The long-term impact of cloud seeding on ecosystems, including water resources, air quality, and climate, remains a topic of research and concern.\nConclusion\n\nCloud seeding is a valuable tool for increasing precipitation in regions where water resources are limited, but it is not a standalone solution to address long-term water scarcity.\n\nIt is typically used in conjunction with other water resource management strategies. Additionally, cloud seeding programs often require careful monitoring and regulation to ensure they are conducted safely and responsibly.\n\nIn light of these concerns, proponents of cloud seeding argue that it can be a valuable tool in managing water resources, particularly in regions facing water scarcity. Critics, however, emphasize the need for rigorous scientific assessments, responsible regulation, and transparent communication with the public to address these concerns and challenges associated with cloud seeding.\n\nRelated article:\u00a0E-Technology in the aid of farmers\n\n-Article by Swathi Satish",

    "[CONTENT] #180": "A fast radio burst, or FRB, is a pulse of radio-frequency electromagnetic radiation. It lasts a small fraction of a second but outshines most other sources of radio waves in the universe. Radio waves have the longest wavelengths in the electromagnetic spectrum. Read here to learn more about FRBs.\n\nRecently, astronomers have detected an intense flash of radio waves coming from what looks like a merger of galaxies dating to about 8 billion years ago \u2013 the oldest-known instance of a phenomenon called a fast radio burst that continues to defy explanation.\n\nThis burst in less than a millisecond unleashed the amount of energy our sun emits in three decades, researchers said.\n\nIt was detected using the Australian SKA Pathfinder, a radio telescope in the state of Western Australia. Its location was pinpointed by the European Southern Observatory\u2019s Very Large Telescope in Chile, one of the most powerful optical telescopes.\n\nTable of Contents\n\nFast Radio Bursts\nScientific significance\nFast Radio burst discoveries\nConclusion\nFast Radio Bursts\n\nFast Radio Bursts (FRBs) are intense, millisecond-duration bursts of radio waves that originate from outside of our galaxy.\n\nThese astronomical phenomena were first discovered in 2007 and have since become an intriguing area of study in astrophysics.\n\n\ud83d\udc49 Which year are YOU targeting for success in the IAS/IPS/IFS Exam? \ud83d\ude80\n\n(1) \u21d2 UPSC 2025: Prelims cum Mains\n\n(2) \u21d2 UPSC 2026: Prelims cum Mains\n\n(3) \u21d2 UPSC 2027 Prelims cum Mains\n\nTip: Know more about ClearIAS Courses (Online/Offline)\n\nFRBs are incredibly brief, often lasting just a few milliseconds, but they release as much energy in that short time as the Sun does in weeks or even years.\n\nThe exact origins of FRBs are still not completely understood. There are several theories, including magnetars (highly magnetic neutron stars), supermassive black holes, or even extraterrestrial civilizations. Some FRBs repeat while others are one-time events.\nFRBs are detected using radio telescopes, and they appear as short-lived bursts of radio waves. The bursts are typically identified after the fact through data analysis, and their source location is not always immediately determined.\n\nOne of the key characteristics of FRBs is their dispersion measure, which is a measure of how much the burst\u2019s radio waves are spread out as they travel through space.\n\nThis dispersion can provide information about the density of the interstellar or intergalactic medium through which the signal has traveled.\nLocating the exact source of an FRB is challenging because they appear and disappear rapidly. However, advances in technology and the detection of repeating FRBs have improved our ability to determine their origins.\nFRBs are believed to be of cosmic origin, and they have been detected in various parts of the universe. They can provide insights into distant and extreme astrophysical environments.\nScientific significance\n\nStudying FRBs can help scientists learn more about the distribution of matter in the universe, the properties of neutron stars, and the conditions in regions near black holes. They also hold the potential to be used as cosmological probes.\n\nSome have proposed that FRBs could be used for interstellar communication or for \u201cbeacon\u201d signals to locate advanced civilizations in the universe, although this remains highly speculative.\nThe researchers believe that studying these bursts also can help to detect and measure the immense amount of matter believed to populate the expanses of space between galaxies.\nThe study of Fast Radio Bursts is still an active area of research in astrophysics, and discoveries are being made regularly. Ongoing efforts aim to understand the origins and nature of FRBs and use them to probe the universe\u2019s most extreme environments.\n\nFRBs are a relatively new and enigmatic discovery, and they represent a significant astrophysical mystery. The exact sources and mechanisms that produce these bursts are still not fully understood, and solving this mystery has captured the imagination of astronomers and astrophysicists.\n\nFRBs are believed to originate from extremely distant galaxies. Studying them provides a unique opportunity to explore the cosmos at vast distances and investigate the environments and conditions in distant parts of the universe.\nFRBs can serve as probes of the intervening space between their source and Earth. As the bursts travel through space, they interact with the surrounding environment and can provide information about the density, composition, and magnetic fields of the intergalactic and interstellar medium.\nThe energy levels associated with FRBs are incredibly high, making them a subject of interest in high-energy astrophysics. Understanding the sources and mechanisms behind FRBs can shed light on extreme physical processes in the universe.\nBecause FRBs travel such vast distances, they have the potential to be used as cosmological tools. By studying their dispersion and redshift, astronomers can gain insights into the expansion rate of the universe and the distribution of matter along the path of the burst.\nSome FRBs have been linked to magnetars, highly magnetized neutron stars. This connection provides an opportunity to study the extreme conditions near these exotic objects and to investigate the relationship between magnetars and FRBs.\nThe polarization properties of FRBs can provide information about the magnetic fields in their source regions and the intervening medium. Studying polarization and Faraday rotation can yield insights into the magnetic environments of the universe.\nSome FRBs may be associated with neutron stars or black holes. Investigating the circumstances that lead to FRBs originating from these environments can offer insights into the behavior of these compact and dense objects.\nThe extreme nature of FRBs makes them suitable for the search for new physics. Some theories propose that FRBs could be linked to exotic phenomena, such as cosmic strings or axion mini clusters, which could expand our understanding of the fundamental laws of the universe.\nFast Radio burst discoveries\n\n2001: The Parkes Observatory in Australia made the first detection of an FRB as it blasted out of the Small Magellanic Cloud, a satellite galaxy of the Milky Way. However, this event would not be discovered until 2007, when astrophysicist Duncan Lorimer and colleagues found it in archival data from the observatory, thus named the Lorimer burst.\n\n2011: The Keane burst, or FRB 010621 was the second FRB to be detected and was observed in data from the Parkes Multibeam Pulsar Survey.\n\n2012: In 2012, the Arecibo Observatory, a former radio telescope in Puerto Rico, discovered the first repeating FRB, designated FRB 121102.\n\nSince then, FRBs have been reported almost every year.\n\nUntil now, the oldest-known such burst dated to 5 billion years ago, making this one 3 billion years older. The universe is about 13.8 billion years old. For comparison, Earth is about 4.5 billion years old.\n\nConclusion\n\nFRBs are among the most enigmatic and exciting phenomena in modern astronomy, and they continue to pique the interest of scientists and astronomers worldwide as they seek to unlock the mysteries surrounding these cosmic radio bursts.\n\nRelated articles:\n\nLife cycle of a star\nFermions and Bosons\nMajor telescopes\nJames Webb telescope\nSolar system\nThe Universe\nGamma-ray bursts (GRBs)\n\n-Article by Swathi Satish",

Their optical and electronic properties, including the absorption and emission of light, are highly dependent on their size. This phenomenon is known as quantum confinement.\nPhotoluminescence: They exhibit strong and tunable photoluminescence, meaning they can emit light of different colors (wavelengths) depending on their size. This property makes them valuable for applications in displays, lighting, and biological imaging.\nNarrow Emission Peaks: These particles have narrow emission peaks, resulting in highly saturated and pure colors. This characteristic is advantageous in display technologies where a wide color gamut is desired.\nSemiconductor Behavior: These behave like semiconductors, which means they can conduct electricity under certain conditions. This property opens up possibilities for their use in electronics and photodetectors.\nApplications of quantum dots\nCourtesy: https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/science.aaz8541\nDisplay Technology: Quantum dots are used in quantum dot displays, also known as QLED (Quantum Dot Light Emitting Diode) displays. They enhance the color accuracy, brightness, and energy efficiency of displays compared to traditional LCD technology.\nBiological Imaging: They are employed as fluorescent probes in biological and medical imaging. Their small size and bright, tunable emissions make them useful for tracking cellular and molecular processes.\nSolar Cells: QDs have the potential to improve the efficiency of solar cells. Researchers are exploring their use in photovoltaics to capture a broader spectrum of light.\nLED Lighting: QDs are used in LED lighting to produce high-quality, energy-efficient white light. They can be used to generate warm or cool white light with excellent color rendering.\nQuantum Computing: QDs are being studied for their potential use in quantum computing due to their ability to trap and manipulate individual electrons and quantum states.\nCancer Detection: QDs functionalized with targeting molecules can be used for cancer detection. They can selectively bind to cancer cells, aiding in early diagnosis.\n\nRead: Nanotechnology in health\n\nConcerns\n\nQuantum dots often contain toxic materials like cadmium, which raises environmental and health concerns. Research is ongoing to develop safer quantum dot materials.\n\nToxicity: Some types of quantum dots, particularly those containing heavy metals like cadmium and lead, can be toxic to living organisms, including humans. The release of these toxic materials into the environment or the human body can have adverse health effects.\nEnvironmental Impact: Quantum dots, especially those used in consumer electronics and displays, may contribute to electronic waste if not properly managed. E-waste contains hazardous materials, including quantum dots, which can leach into the environment if not disposed of responsibly.\nHealth Risks: Quantum dots may pose health risks when used in medical applications. While they have potential in imaging and drug delivery, their long-term effects on the human body are not fully understood, and more research is needed to assess their safety.\nManufacturing Challenges: The production of quantum dots can be complex and energy-intensive. The synthesis of quantum dots often requires the use of hazardous chemicals, and the manufacturing process may result in waste byproducts.\nPrivacy Concerns: Quantum dots have been proposed for use in security and surveillance applications, including invisible ink and tracking technologies. These applications raise privacy concerns, as quantum dot-based tracking could be used for invasive surveillance.\nRegulatory Oversight: The regulatory framework for quantum dots and nanotechnology, in general, is still evolving. Ensuring proper safety assessments, labeling, and disposal guidelines is essential to mitigate potential risks.\nEthical Considerations: As with any emerging technology, there are ethical considerations surrounding the use of quantum dots, especially in areas like surveillance and privacy. Ethical guidelines and discussions are necessary to navigate these issues.\nCommercial Interests: Quantum dots have attracted significant commercial interest, and there may be pressure to rush products to market without adequate safety testing. This could potentially lead to unforeseen consequences.\nNobel Prize in chemistry\n\nThe discovery of quantum dots, and the ability to synthesize such materials with high accuracy but relatively simple chemical methods, was an important step in the development of nanoscience and nanotechnology.\n\nThe core principle of nanoscience is that at the scale of nanometres, materials, and particles attain new, size-dependent properties that can be harnessed and controlled for novel applications.\nThe tools of chemistry are an indispensable enabler of nanotechnology, with applications in areas as diverse as biotechnology, catalysis, sensing, medical diagnostics, electronics, photonics, and quantum technology.\n\nThe research won the Nobel prize and was shared by three scientists:\n\nIn the early 1980s, Alexei Ekimov succeeded in creating size-dependent quantum effects in colored glass. He demonstrated that the particle size affected the color of the glass via quantum effects.\nA few years later, Louis Brus was the first scientist in the world to prove size-dependent quantum effects in particles floating freely in a fluid.\nIn 1993, Moungi Bawendi developed a technique to make quantum dots of well-defined sizes and with high optical quality\nConclusion\n\nQuantum dots are nanoscale semiconductor particles with unique optical and electronic properties. Their size-dependent behavior and tunable emissions make them valuable in a wide range of applications, from display technology to medical imaging and beyond.\n\nHowever, addressing environmental and health concerns associated with certain quantum dot materials is an important area of ongoing research and development.\n\nRelated articles:\u00a0Quantum cryptography; Quantum Entanglement; National Quantum Mission\n\n\u00ad-Article by Swathi Satish",

An imbalance or dysbiosis in the microbiome has been associated with conditions such as obesity, diabetes, autoimmune diseases, and gastrointestinal disorders.\n\nMicrobiota stimulates the immune system, breaks down potentially toxic food compounds, and synthesizes certain vitamins and amino acids.\nAntibiotic use can disrupt the balance of the microbiome by killing both harmful and beneficial bacteria.\nThe diet also plays a significant role in shaping the composition of the microbiome. High-fiber diets, for example, promote the growth of beneficial bacteria.\nThe highest amounts are found in raw versions of the following: garlic, onions, leeks, asparagus, Jerusalem artichokes, dandelion greens, bananas, and seaweed.\nIn general, fruits, vegetables, beans, and whole grains like wheat, oats, and barley are all good sources of prebiotic fibers.\nOngoing research is exploring the therapeutic potential of manipulating the microbiome to treat various health conditions. This includes the use of probiotics, prebiotics, fecal microbiota transplantation (FMT), and other interventions.\n\nRead:\u00a0Microbes in\u00a0Human Welfare\n\nEnvironmental Microbiomes\n\nBeyond the human microbiome, microbiomes exist in various environmental settings, such as soil, water, and air. These environmental microbiomes play essential roles in ecological processes, nutrient cycling, and ecosystem health.\n\nThe environmental microbiome refers to the diverse communities of microorganisms (bacteria, archaea, fungi, viruses, and other microorganisms) that inhabit various ecosystems on Earth.\n\nThese microorganisms play crucial roles in maintaining the health and functioning of the environment.\nThe environmental microbiome is incredibly diverse, with countless species of microorganisms inhabiting various environments such as soil, water, air, sediments, and extreme environments like hot springs and deep-sea hydrothermal vents.\n\nMicroorganisms in the environment provide essential ecosystem services, including nutrient cycling, decomposition of organic matter, soil fertility, and detoxification of pollutants. They play a fundamental role in sustaining life on Earth.\n\nNutrient Cycling: Microbes are involved in the cycling of essential nutrients like carbon, nitrogen, and phosphorus. For example, they decompose dead organic matter, returning nutrients to the ecosystem for use by plants and other organisms.\nBioremediation: Certain microorganisms can break down and degrade pollutants, making them valuable for bioremediation efforts to clean up contaminated environments. This includes the degradation of oil spills, industrial waste, and chemical contaminants.\nPlant-Microbe Interactions: Microbes in the soil form symbiotic relationships with plants, such as mycorrhizal fungi that enhance nutrient uptake, and nitrogen-fixing bacteria that provide plants with essential nitrogen. These interactions are critical for plant growth and ecosystem productivity.\nClimate Regulation: Microbes play a role in regulating greenhouse gas emissions. They are involved in processes like carbon sequestration, methane production, and nitrous oxide emissions, all of which influence the Earth\u2019s climate.\nHuman Impact: Human activities, such as deforestation, agriculture, and pollution, can significantly impact the composition and functioning of environmental microbiomes. These changes can have far-reaching ecological consequences.\nMicrobiome Research: Advances in DNA sequencing and metagenomic analysis have allowed scientists better to understand the complexity and diversity of environmental microbiomes. Research in this field is uncovering new insights into microbial communities and their ecological roles.\nMicrobiome Conservation: Recognizing the importance of the environmental microbiome, conservation efforts are increasingly focused on protecting microbial diversity and ecosystem health. This includes strategies to prevent habitat destruction and reduce pollution.\n\nUnderstanding the environmental microbiome has practical applications in fields such as agriculture (e.g., soil microbiome management for sustainable farming), biotechnology (e.g., bioprospecting for novel microbial products), and environmental management (e.g., using microbes for wastewater treatment).\n\nMicrobiome Studies and Ethical Considerations\n\nAdvances in DNA sequencing technology have enabled the study of microbial communities in unprecedented detail. Techniques like metagenomics allow researchers to analyze the genetic material of entire microbiomes.\n\nThe study and manipulation of the microbiome raise ethical questions related to consent, privacy, and the potential consequences of altering microbial communities.\n\nConclusion\n\nUnderstanding the microbiome and its role in human health is an area of active research with the potential to revolutionize medicine and our understanding of the complex relationship between microorganisms and their hosts.

How are animal and plant kingdoms classified? What are the characteristics of the Five Kingdoms? Read further to know more.\n\nIn the past, all living beings were divided into two realms. The plant kingdom was one, while the animal kingdom was another.\n\nThe animal world included every living organism that could eat, move, grow to a certain size, and then stop growing.\n\nThe plant world, on the other hand, consisted of living beings that did not move or eat yet continued to grow throughout their lives.\n\nTable of Contents\n\nThe Evolution of the Five Kingdom Classification\nFive kingdom classification of animals and plants\nCharacteristics of the Five Kingdoms\nKingdom Monera\nKingdom Protista\nSub-groups of Protista\nKingdom Fungi\nKingdom Plantae\nKingdom Animalia\nSubphyla of Animalia\nConclusion\nPrevious year\u2019s UPSC question\nThe Evolution of the Five Kingdom Classification\n\nAristotle developed the first biological taxonomy of plants and animals based on simple morphological characteristics- animal or plant origin. This initial observation by the Greek philosopher was expanded in the 19th and 20th centuries by the discovery of new kingdoms, finally arriving at today\u2019s widely-recognized five, which cover the 8.7 million species\u00a0that live on Earth, according to estimates by the United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP).\n\nSome scientists classified them as plants and animals, while others, such as Robert Whittaker, Ernst Haeckel, and others, attempted to classify them as part of a larger system.\nLinnaeus divided all living organisms into two kingdoms: Plantae and Animalia.\nR.H. Whittaker offered a detailed five-kingdom classification of animals and plants, which included Monera, Protista, Fungi, Plantae, and Animalia. This five-kingdom category was the most commonly utilized one.\nIt was first established in 1969, with the names Monera, Protista, Fungi, Plantae, and Animalia.\n\nThe complexity of cell structure and organisms, body organization, mode of nourishment, reproduction, and interrelationships are the key classification criteria in the five-kingdom system.\n\nThe five kingdom classification of animals and plants defines whether the organism is eukaryotic or prokaryotic, unicellular or multicellular, asexual or sexual, autotrophic, heterotrophic, or a combination of these characteristics.\n\n\ud83d\udc49 Which year are YOU targeting for success in the IAS/IPS/IFS Exam? \ud83d\ude80\n\n(1) \u21d2 UPSC 2025: Prelims cum Mains\n\n(2) \u21d2 UPSC 2026: Prelims cum Mains\n\n(3) \u21d2 UPSC 2027 Prelims cum Mains\n\nTip: Know more about ClearIAS Courses (Online/Offline)\n\nFive kingdom classification of animals and plants\n\n\u201cThe system of biological kingdoms is the way in which science classifies living things according to their ancestry over the course of evolution.\u201d\n\nFive kingdom classifications of animals and plants include:\n\nKingdom Monera\nKingdom Protista\nKingdom Fungi\nKingdom Plantae\nKingdom Animalia\n\nBacteria are classified as Kingdom Monera in the five-kingdom categorization. Chrysophytes, Dinoflagellates, Euglenoids, Slime-moulds, and Protozoans are all members of the kingdom Protista.\n\nMembers of Kingdom Fungi demonstrate a wide variation in architecture and environment. Saprophytic nutrition is used by the majority of fungi.\n\nAll eukaryotic chlorophyll-containing creatures are classified as Plantae. This group includes algae, bryophytes, pteridophytes, gymnosperms, and angiosperms.\n\nThe Kingdom Animalia includes heterotrophic eukaryotic multicellular creatures without a cell wall. Certain acellular species, such as viruses and viroids, as well as lichens, are not classified using the five kingdom concept.\n\nCharacteristics of the Five Kingdoms\n\nThe five kingdoms have been subdivided into phylum (animals) and divisions (plants). They are further classified into the following categories: Class, Order, Family, Genus, and Species.\n\nKingdom \u2192 Phylum \u2192 Class \u2192 Order \u2192 Family \u2192 Genus \u2192 Species\n\nLet us now examine the various kingdoms, as well as their characteristics and examples.\n\nKingdom Monera\nProkaryotes are creatures that do not have distinct nuclei or organelles.\nThis group comprises Blue-green algae or cyanobacteria (which have cell walls)and mycoplasma (which doesn\u2019t have a cell wall) are two well-known bacteria.\nThese are the most abundant microorganisms and thrive in harsh environments.\nSome of the bacteria have cell walls, while others like mycoplasma do not.\nThe mode of nourishment of organisms in this group can be either self-synthesis (autotrophic) or acquisition from the environment (heterotrophic).\nThe species in this kingdom are prokaryotic and unicellular. Furthermore, these species lack a well-defined nucleus.\nSimilarly, it lacks cell organelles. Some creatures in this kingdom have a cell wall, whereas others have not.\nMany of them live as parasites in or on other creatures.\n\nBacteria are classified into four types based on their spherical form.\n\nSpherical Coccus\nRod-shaped Bacillus\nComma-shaped Vibrium\nSpiral Spirillum\n\nSome of the bacteria are autotrophic, which means they produce their food. They can be photosynthetic or chemosynthetic autotrophs (metabolic synthesis of organic compounds by living organisms using energy derived from reactions involving inorganic chemicals). Bacteria, mycoplasma, cyanobacteria, and other organisms are all members of the Monera kingdom.\n\nAlso Read: Diseases caused by microorganisms \u2013 ClearIAS\n\nKingdom Protista\nProtista includes all single-celled eukaryotes.\nThis kingdom\u2019s borders are not well-defined. This kingdom is related to the kingdoms of plants, animals, and fungi.\nChrysophytes, Dinoflagellates, Euglenoids, Slime molds, and Protozoans are all members of this group. Unicellular algae, diatoms, and protozoans are some examples. Protozoans are heterotrophic organisms that live as parasites or predators.\nIts feeding mode might be autotrophic or heterotrophic.\nProtista is mostly aquatic organisms. Several organisms contain flagella or cilia that aid in locomotion.\nProtists reproduce both asexually and sexually through cell fusion and zygote development.\nSUB-GROUPS OF PROTISTA\n\nThe kingdom Protista is divided into the following subgroups:\n\nChrysophytes: This group includes golden algae (desmids) and diatoms. They can be found in both saltwater and freshwater settings.\nDinoflagellates are typically photosynthetic and saltwater organisms. Their color is determined by the major pigments in their cells; they can be red, blue, brown, green, or yellow.\nEuglenoids are freshwater organisms that live in still water. They lack a cell wall and instead have a protein-rich layer termed a pellicle.\nSlime Moulds are saprophytic molds. The organism glides along putrefying leaves and twigs, feeding on organic matter. Plasmodial slime molds formed when they were exposed to favorable conditions.\nKingdom Fungi\nThese are eukaryotic heterotrophic organisms.\nSaprophytes are fungi that are heterotrophic and absorb soluble organic materials from dead substrates.\nParasites are organisms that rely on live plants and animals for survival.\nSeveral fungal species have long-term mutually beneficial partnerships with blue-green algae (or cyanobacteria). They are known as symbiotic connections.\nLichens are the name given to these symbiotic life forms. They can also exist as mycorrhizal symbionts with the roots of higher plants. Lichens = Fungi + Bluegreen algae (Cyanobacteria)\nFungi can reproduce vegetatively through fragmentation, fission, and budding.\nConidia, sporangiospores, and zoospores are asexual spores, while oospores, ascospores, and basidiospores are sexual spores.\nFungal creatures include multicellular, eukaryotic, and heterotrophic organisms. Furthermore, we can see that their mode of nourishment is saprophytic. This is because this kingdom feeds on decomposing organic debris.\nThe cell walls of all species in this kingdom are made of a material called chitin.\nFor example, the Fungi kingdom includes mushrooms, yeast, Aspergillus, and other organisms.\n\nAlso Read: Fungal Diseases \u2013 ClearIAS\n\nKingdom Plantae\nPlants\u00a0are multicellular eukaryotes with cellulose-based cell walls.\nThey are autotrophs and employ chlorophyll for photosynthesis.\nA few members, such as insectivorous plants and parasites, are partially heterotrophic. Insectivorous plants include bladderwort and Venus fly trap, while Cuscuta is a parasite.\nAlgae, Thallophyta, Bryophyta, Pteridophyta, Gymnosperms, and Angiosperms are all members of the Plantae family.\nPlants have two unique life cycles, the diploid sporophytic and the haploid gametophytic, which alternate.\nThe lengths of the haploid and diploid phases, as well as whether these phases are free-living or dependent on others, varied between plant groupings. This is known as the alternation of generation.\nAll plants, including trees, bushes, ferns, herbs, and others, are included in this kingdom. Furthermore, this kingdom is divided into several divisions based on bodily differentiation and whether or not specialized vascular tissue is present.\nPlantae Kingdom includes pines, Spirogyra, mango plants, ferns, and other plants.\nKingdom Animalia\nThis category includes all multicellular eukaryotes without cell walls. These are heterotrophic organisms.\nThey rely on plants for food, either directly or indirectly. They digest their meals in an internal cavity and store food reserves as glycogen or fat.\nTheir form of nourishment is the Holozoic, meaning they consume food.\nThey have distinct growth patterns and mature into adults with distinct shapes and sizes.\nHigher forms have more complex sensory and neuromotor mechanisms. The majority of them can move around.\nCopulation of male and female is followed by embryological development in sexual reproduction.\nThese organisms lack a cell wall. Also, their feeding method is heterotrophic. Similarly, they are extremely diverse.\nSome species in this kingdom are simple, whilst others have a sophisticated body with specialized tissue differentiation and bodily organs.\nAnimalia is separated into several classes and phyla.\nSUBPHYLA OF ANIMALIA\n\nAnimalia has been subdivided into ten subphyla depending on their bodily architecture or differentiation. The following are the different phyla of the animal kingdom:\n\nPorifera: Porifera, often known as sponges, are characterized by having holes in their bodies. Spongilla and Sycon are phylum Porifera examples.\nCoelenterata (Cnidaria): The Greek word \u201ckilos,\u201d which connotes a hollow stomach, is where the word \u201cCoelenterates\u201d first appeared. Its body cavity is hollow, and its body is divided into two ends. The inner and outer linings are the two cell layers that make up its body. Coelenterata members include Hydra and Jellyfish.\nPlatyhelminthes: Flatworms are the common name for Platyhelminthes. Their bodies are flattened dorsoventrally. They are either free-living (like liver flukes) or parasitic (Planaria). Tapeworm and Planaria are two examples of the phylum Platyhelminthes.\nNematoda: They are cylindrical-bodied roundworms. Nematoda is a subclass of animals that includes Ascaris and Wuchereria.\nAnnelida: Often, annelids are referred to as segmented or ringed worms. They have a cylindrical body with segments. Examples of the Annelida phylum include earthworm leeches.\nArthropod: Arthropods are animals with jointed appendages, and the word \u201carthropod\u201d means \u201cwith jointed legs.\u201d They are bilaterally symmetrical, making them the largest phylum of animals. They have segmented bodies, bear-jointed appendages, and an exoskeleton. Phylum Arthropoda examples include spiders, butterflies, and mosquitoes.\nMollusca: The second-largest animal phylum is called Mollusca. Their bodies are less segmented, and their organs and organ systems are well-developed. They are often triploblastic and bilaterally symmetric. Mollusca includes creatures like snails and octopuses\nEchinodermata: Originating from the Greek terms echinos, which meant hedgehog, and derma, which meant skin, are Echinodermata. Hence, echinoderms are creatures with spiky skin. Echinodermata includes sea urchins and starfish.\nHemichordata: Hemichordata is a class of soft-bodied, delicate creatures.\nThe epidermis only has one layer.

Fungi and plants, for example, were grouped based on the presence of a cell wall.\n\nSimilarly, unicellular and multicellular species were classed together. The five-kingdom classification of animals and plants is superior to the older classification of plants and animals because it eliminates the confusion caused by classifying the same species in two separate kingdoms.\n\nWhile the Five Kingdom Classification was widely used for many years, advancements in molecular biology and genetic studies have led to the development of more complex classification systems, such as the Six Kingdom Classification (adding Archaea as a separate kingdom) and the Three-Domain System (dividing life into Bacteria, Archaea, and Eukarya).\n\nThese modern classification systems provide a more accurate representation of the evolutionary relationships among living organisms based on genetic similarities and shared ancestry.\n\nPrevious year\u2019s UPSC question\n\nQ.

They found that applying pressure to certain crystals, such as quartz, tourmaline, and Rochelle salt, produced electrical charges on their surfaces.\n\nThe Curie brothers also observed that the magnitude of the charge depended on the amount of pressure applied and that the charge would disappear when the pressure was released.\n\nThe discovery of the piezoelectric effect was a significant breakthrough in the field of physics, as it demonstrated a previously unknown relationship between mechanical stress and electrical charge.\nThe effect was quickly recognized as having important practical applications, and over the years, scientists have worked to identify and develop materials that exhibit strong piezoelectric properties.\n\nToday, piezoelectric materials are used in a wide range of applications, including sensors, actuators, ultrasound devices, and energy harvesting technologies.\n\n\ud83d\udc49 Which year are YOU targeting for success in the IAS/IPS/IFS Exam? \ud83d\ude80\n\n(1) \u21d2 UPSC 2025: Prelims cum Mains\n\n(2) \u21d2 UPSC 2026: Prelims cum Mains\n\n(3) \u21d2 UPSC 2027 Prelims cum Mains\n\nTip: Know more about ClearIAS Courses (Online/Offline)\n\nThey are also used in everyday consumer products, such as piezoelectric lighters and piezoelectric buzzers in electronic devices.\nThe discovery of the piezoelectric effect has had a profound impact on our understanding of materials science and continues to drive innovation in many fields.\nWhat is the Piezoelectric Effect?\n\nThe piezoelectric effect is a phenomenon where materials generate an electrical charge when subjected to mechanical stress or pressure.\n\nThis effect occurs when the molecules within the material become polarized, resulting in positive and negative charges being separated from each other.\nThe polarization generates an electric potential across the material, allowing a current to flow if the material is connected to a circuit.\nConversely, applying an electric potential to the material can cause mechanical deformation.\nQuartz, ceramics, and certain types of crystals are common piezoelectric materials.\nQuartz is widely used in analog wristwatches and clocks as a piezoelectric crystal.\n\nKey features of the piezoelectric effect include:\n\nDirect Piezoelectric Effect: When mechanical stress or pressure is applied to a piezoelectric material, it undergoes a slight deformation, causing the positive and negative charges within the material\u2019s atomic structure to become displaced. This charge separation results in the generation of an electric voltage across the material.\n\nConverse Piezoelectric Effect: Conversely, when an electric field is applied to a piezoelectric material, the positive and negative charges within the material shift, leading to a mechanical deformation or strain. In this case, the electric field induces mechanical motion in the material.\n\nCrystal Symmetry: The piezoelectric effect is most pronounced in crystals that possess a non-centrosymmetric crystal structure. Non-centrosymmetric means that the crystal structure lacks an inversion center, where the positive and negative charges are perfectly balanced.\n\nThe piezoelectric effect can be harnessed to convert mechanical vibrations or movement into electrical energy. This concept is used in self-powered sensors and energy-harvesting devices.\n\nPiezoelectric Materials\n\nMany materials exhibit piezoelectric behavior, including:\n\nQuartz\nRochelle salt\nTourmaline\nTopaz\nLead zirconate titanate (PZT)\nBarium titanate (BaTiO3)\nLithium niobate (LiNbO3)\nPotassium niobate (KNbO3)\nPolyvinylidene fluoride (PVDF)\n\nThese materials have unique crystal structures and properties that make them suitable for different applications, such as sensors, actuators, transducers, and energy harvesting devices.\n\nThe choice of material depends on the specific application requirements, such as sensitivity, frequency response, temperature stability, durability, and cost.\n\nApplications of Piezoelectric Effect\n\nThe piezoelectric effect has numerous applications in various fields. Here are some examples:\n\nSensors: Piezoelectric sensors are widely used in various applications such as pressure sensors, acceleration sensors, force sensors, and vibration sensors. They can convert mechanical stress into electrical signals and are used in industries like automotive, aerospace, and medical.\nActuators: Piezoelectric actuators can convert electrical signals into mechanical movements. They are used in various applications such as precision positioning, valves, and micropumps.\nEnergy Harvesting: Piezoelectric materials can be used to generate electrical energy from mechanical vibrations or deformations. This technology is being explored for powering small devices such as wireless sensors and implantable medical devices.\nSonar: The piezoelectric effect is used in sonar devices to generate and receive sound waves. They are used in applications such as underwater imaging, fish finders, and navigation systems.\nPiezoelectric Motors: Piezoelectric motors use the piezoelectric effect to create motion without any mechanical components. They are used in applications such as autofocus cameras, micro pumps, and micro robots.\nNon-destructive Testing: Piezoelectric transducers are used in non-destructive testing techniques such as ultrasonic testing, where they can send and receive ultrasonic waves to detect flaws in materials.\n\nAlso read: Semiconductor Industry in India\n\nPossible Applications of the New Discovery\n\nThe recent discovery of the piezoelectric effect in liquids has opened up exciting possibilities for new applications that were previously inaccessible using solid-state materials.\n\nFurthermore, these liquid materials have the added benefit of being more readily recyclable and causing fewer environmental issues than many commonly used piezoelectric materials.\n\nInterestingly, the liquids also exhibit the inverse piezoelectric effect. This means that they become distorted when an electric charge is applied to them.\n\nThis unique property can be utilized to control how the liquids bend light passing through them.\nBy passing different currents through the liquids, it is possible to manipulate how light is refracted, effectively turning vials of these liquids into lenses with dynamic focusing abilities.\n\nThe discovery of the piezoelectric effect in liquids challenges the existing theory that describes this phenomenon and opens the door to a wide range of previously unanticipated applications in electronic and mechanical systems.\n\nThe ability to manipulate the properties of these liquids with electric charges presents a significant breakthrough in the development of new technologies, with potential applications ranging from advanced sensors and actuators to high-speed communication systems and optical devices.\n\nMoreover, the use of these liquids as piezoelectric materials offers several advantages over traditional solid-state materials.\n\nIn addition to being more environmentally friendly and readily recyclable, they also offer greater flexibility in terms of their physical properties.\nThis means that they can be tailored to suit specific applications, making them a highly versatile material for use in a wide range of technologies.\nConclusion\n\nThe piezoelectric effect plays a crucial role in various technologies and devices, contributing to advancements in diverse fields such as electronics, medical imaging, consumer electronics, and industrial applications.\n\nIts ability to convert between mechanical and electrical energy makes it a valuable property in a wide range of engineering and scientific applications.\n\nThe discovery of the piezoelectric effect in liquids has opened up exciting new possibilities for the development of advanced electronic and mechanical systems.\n\nThis breakthrough offers a new level of control over the properties of materials, enabling the creation of dynamic lenses and other novel technologies that were previously impossible using solid-state materials.\n\nAs research in this field continues, we will likely see even more innovative applications of this fascinating phenomenon in the years to come.\n\nAlso read: Medical Device Sector in India\n\nArticle Written By: Priti Raj",

Some believe that the whale regurgitates the mass, earning it its well-known nickname \u2018whale vomit\u2019.\n\nUses\n\nAmbergris has been used for centuries in the perfume industry as a fixative, which helps to stabilize and prolong the scent of other fragrances.\n\nIts unique aroma blends well with other ingredients and helps to enhance and \u201cfix\u201d the fragrance molecules, allowing the perfume to last longer on the skin.\nHowever, it\u2019s important to note that the use of ambergris in perfumes has become controversial due to ethical concerns surrounding its sourcing.\nSperm whales are protected species, and the production of ambergris involves the harvesting of a substance expelled naturally by these whales.\nTherefore, many perfume companies have shifted to using synthetic substitutes or alternative natural ingredients to avoid contributing to the demand for ambergris.\n\nIn some countries, the trade and sale of ambergris are regulated or even banned, while in others, such as New Zealand, it is legal to trade ambergris found on beaches. There is also a market for collectors and enthusiasts who appreciate the rarity and unique properties of ambergris.\n\nAmbergris has been used for more than just perfume, however. Early Arab civilizations named it ambar and used it as incense, an aphrodisiac, and medicine to cure many ailments, including those of the brain, heart, and senses.\n\nAlso read: Coinage of India: Coins Used in Ancient India\n\nBan on ambergris in India\n\nAmbergris is illegal to possess and trade in several nations, including the USA, Australia, and India, although it is legal to trade in several other nations.\n\nAccording to Schedule 2 of the Wildlife Protection Act, 1972, sperm whales are a protected species in India, and it is thus forbidden to possess or sell any of their byproducts, including ambergris.\nIt has been noted that the gangs trafficking ambergris buy it in coastal regions and export it to target nations via certain other nations with whom India has relatively lax maritime trade regulations.\nSperm whale\n\nSperm whales are the largest of the toothed whales and have one of the widest global distributions of any marine mammal species.\n\nThey are found in all deep oceans, from the equator to the edge of the pack ice in the Arctic and Antarctic.\nThey are named after the waxy substance, spermaceti, found in their heads.\nThe spermaceti is an oil sac that helps the whales focus on sound. Spermaceti was used in oil lamps, lubricants, and candles.\n\nSperm whales were a primary target of the commercial whaling industry from 1800 to 1987, which nearly decimated all sperm whale populations.\n\nWhile whaling is no longer a major threat, sperm whale populations are still recovering.\nThe sperm whale is listed as endangered under the Endangered Species Act and depleted under the Marine Mammal Protection Act.\nThey are designated as Vulnerable on the IUCN Red List of Threatened Species.\n\nSperm whales inhabit all of the world\u2019s oceans. Their distribution is dependent on their food source and suitable conditions for breeding and varies with the sex and age composition of the group.\n\nSperm whale migrations are not as predictable or well-understood as migrations of baleen whales.\nSome populations appear to have different migration patterns by life history status, with adult males making long oceanographic migrations into temperate waters whereas females and young staying in tropical waters year-round.\n\nThere are numerous man-made threats to the whale species:\n\nVessel strikes can injure or kill sperm whales. Few vessels strike of sperm whales have been documented, but vessel traffic worldwide is increasing, which increases the risk of collisions.\nSperm whales can become entangled in many different types of fishing gear, including trap lines, pots, and gill nets.\nUnderwater noise pollution can interrupt the normal behavior of sperm whales, which rely on sound to communicate.\nSperm whales can ingest marine debris, as do many marine animals. Debris in the deep scattering layer where sperm whales feed could be mistaken for prey and incidentally ingested, leading to possible injury or death.\nThe effects of climate and oceanographic change on sperm whales are uncertain, but both can potentially affect habitat and food availability. Whale migration, feeding, and breeding locations for sperm whales may be influenced by factors such as ocean currents and water temperature.\nThe threat of contaminants and pollutants to sperm whales and their habitat is highly uncertain and further study is necessary to assess the effects of this threat.\n\nAlso read: Bureau of Indian Standards\n\nAmbiguous legalities of Ambergris\n\nAround the world, several laws govern the acquisition and selling of ambergris. Ambergris and all other whale-derived items are illegal in certain nations, but lawful or illegal in others.\n\nAll live species of whales, dolphins, and porpoises are legally protected in the UK and throughout Europe.\n\nIt is permitted to gather ambergris from the sea or beach since the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species (CITES) views it as a naturally occurring waste product of sperm whales.\n\nWay forward\n\nSynthetic alternatives to ambergris do exist and the use of these should be encouraged. This would prevent whales from being viewed in any way as a resource that humans can exploit.\n\n-Article by Swathi Satish",

As a result, the sea level is 100 meters lower than the average for the world.\n\nWhile we know quite a few things about the Earth\u2019s surface or the crust, its interior is still a mystery.

Known as the Indian Ocean Geoid Low (IOGL), it is dominated by a significant gravity low where the ocean surface plunges to 106 meters.\n\nThough several studies in the past have tried to answer this, most of them attributing it to a remnant of an earlier plate that dived into the Earth\u2019s mantle beneath another plate millions of years ago, there had been no convincing explanation of the source until now.\n\nCause of Indian Ocean Geoid Low\n\nIn the recent study, the researchers employ numerical models of \u2018mantle convection\u2019 to explain the mass deficit.\n\nMantle convection is a type of movement caused within the Earth\u2019s mantle or the middle layer, where hotter and lighter material rises to the top and cooler and denser material sink due to gravity.\nThis convective movement within the mantle was driven by seismic tomography models that use seismic waves to obtain a 3-dimensional picture of the Earth\u2019s interior.\n\nLow-density anomalies or the presence of lighter materials in the upper to mid mantle below the Indian Ocean Geoid Low, were responsible for the gravity low in this region.\n\nMantle plumes or the rising of abnormally hot rock within the Earth\u2019s mantle can result in low-density anomalies.\nHowever, no known mantle plume exists beneath the Indian Ocean Geoid Low, ruling out this theory.\nHowever, they found that there was hot material rising from the African large low-shear-velocity province (LLSVP), or the African superplume, in the neighborhood of the IOGL, that was getting deflected eastward and terminating beneath the IOGL.\nThe deflection is possibly due to the fast motion of the Indian plate, argues the researchers.\nGravity anomalies\n\nThe gravity anomaly on the Earth\u2019s surface is the difference between the observed value of gravity and the value predicted by a theoretical model.\n\nGravity anomalies reveal rock density variations-\n\nShort-wavelength (< 250 km) gravity anomalies are usually correlated with crustal structures.\nLong-wavelength (< 1000 km) gravity anomalies are correlated with variations in mantle densities.\n\nThe largest positive anomalies over the continents were associated with the Andes, the East European Platform, the Alpine\u2013Mediterranean fold belt, and the central southeastern part of North America.\n\nThe largest negative anomalies, indicating a thin lithosphere, are associated with vast Cenozoic regions of plume\u2013lithosphere interaction: the East African Rift and the Basin and Range Province of western North America.\n\nWay forward\n\nThe study into the Indian Ocean Geoid low can pave to further understanding of the origins of Earth.\n\nThe ancient Tethys Ocean began to close as the Indian continent separated from the African, Antarctic, and Australian continents during the Late Cretaceous to early Paleocene, leading to the opening of the Indian Ocean.\nResearchers believe that during this period, slabs of oceanic origin were subducted into a slab graveyard in the lower mantle which possibly contributed to the IOGL.\n\nSuch uncertainties regarding the formation of the earth, as we see it today, can be answered through IOGL studies.\n\nThe data obtained can also understand science beneath the unexplored parts of oceanic plates but will also help to quantify deep-ocean wave dynamics.\n\n-Article written by Swathi Satish",

Its also known as a three-parent baby, as the baby has three parents in terms of genetic material. Pioneering technology was used to facilitate this, to prevent the child from inheriting the mother\u2019s mitochondrial disease. Read here to learn more about MDT.\n\nMitochondrial Donation Treatment offers families with severe inherited mitochondrial illnesses do not pass on the gene to their children.\n\nIt is a form of IVF that replaces faulty mitochondrial DNA in the patient\u2019s eggs with healthy mitochondrial DNA from a donor egg.\n\nMost of the baby\u2019s DNA comes from its parents, and just a little percentage comes from the donor, whose mitochondria were used to fertilize the egg.\n\nAlthough the phrase \u201cthree-parent babies\u201d is widely used in the media, most of the baby\u2019s DNA comes from its two parents, with around 0.1% from the donor.\n\nTable of Contents\n\nMitochondrial Donation Treatment\nWhat are mitochondria?\nAdvantages and Concerns of Mitochondrial Donation Treatment\nConclusion\nMitochondrial Donation Treatment\n\n\ud83d\udc49 Which year are YOU targeting for success in the IAS/IPS/IFS Exam? \ud83d\ude80\n\n(1) \u21d2 UPSC 2025: Prelims cum Mains\n\n(2) \u21d2 UPSC 2026: Prelims cum Mains\n\n(3) \u21d2 UPSC 2027 Prelims cum Mains\n\nTip: Know more about ClearIAS Courses (Online/Offline)\n\nWith the use of assisted reproductive technologies, some women may be able to prevent passing on mitochondrial illness to their biological offspring. It is also known as mitochondrial replacement therapy (MRT).\n\nThe phrase describes a variety of methods used to guarantee that only healthy mitochondria are transferred to an embryo.\n\nTwo techniques for mitochondrial donation have been developed and widely used:\n\nMaternal spindle transfer (MST)\nPronuclear transfer (PNT)\n\nIn both techniques, eggs or embryos are created using nuclear genetic material and healthy donated mitochondria.\n\nIn MST, the nuclear genetic material is removed from the eggs and transferred into donated eggs that have had their nuclear genetic material removed. The eggs are then fertilized with sperm to create embryos.\nIn PNT, the eggs are fertilized with sperm in a lab to create embryos. The nuclear genetic material within each embryo is then transferred into embryos created using donated eggs and sperm from the sperm provider. Again, the nuclear genetic material will have been removed from the donated eggs.\n\nIn both MST and PNT, the resulting embryos would contain the biological parents\u2019 genetic material and only the mitochondrial DNA of the donor. Both techniques work equally well.\n\nWhat are mitochondria?\n\nMitochondria are double-membraned cell organelles present in nucleated mammalian cells in large numbers.\n\nThey are the powerhouse of the cells as they produce the energy currency called adenosine triphosphate (ATP) through oxidative phosphorylation.\nEvery cell has 100-1000 mitochondria, and this variation in copy number depends on the energy requirement of the type of organ.\n\nThe mitochondria have their genetic material, and its number is 2-10 copies of DNA per mitochondria.\n\nMitochondrial DNA tends to undergo high mutation rates.\nAll the mitochondrial DNA is strictly inherited from the mother, hence its maternal inheritance.\n\nMutations in mitochondrial DNA can result in serious disorders which are quite severe and life-threatening.\n\nSome common mitochondrial diseases are-\n\nmitochondrial myopathy\nencephalomyopathy, lactic acidosis, stroke-like symptoms (MELAS)\nmyoclonic epilepsy with ragged red fibers (MERRF)\nmyoneurogenic gastrointestinal encephalopathy (MNGIE)\nneuropathy, ataxia, retinitis pigmentosa, and ptosis\nLeigh syndrome\nLeber\u2019s hereditary optic neuropathy\ndiabetes mellitus\ndeafness\n\nMitochondrial disease affects around one in 6000 babies. It is not a single disorder but an umbrella term for dozens of disorders in which the mitochondria are not able to produce energy for cells to work properly. These conditions vary in severity, are often life-limiting, and currently have no cure.\n\nAdvantages and Concerns of Mitochondrial Donation Treatment\n\nThe major advantage is obvious as MDT will give families affected by serious mitochondrial disease a chance of having healthy children free of a devastating and often life-limiting disease.\n\nMany children who are born with such genetic disorders would not have to undergo the painful ordeal of growing up or dying because of them at an early age.\nThese procedures can reduce infant mortality.\n\nAs beneficial as this technique may be, it comes with a fair share of concerns as well.\n\nThe technique itself does not guarantee the complete removal of faulty mitochondria as the complete extraction of the nucleus without some mitochondria remaining attached to it is tricky even for experts.\nThe ethical, legal, and social issues that are raised concerning these reproductive techniques are debatable and are mainly the reason why these techniques have not been legalized globally.\nThe safety of the technique is debatable and the concern of the development of \u2018designer babies\u2019 has been the most raised issue.\nSocial issues also arise due to the Tri paternal aspect, as children formed from these techniques might be subjected to mental agony due to discrimination or it may cause legal complications.\nThe cost of the procedure is high and can be afforded by a certain section of society.\nConclusion\n\nEven though research in mitochondrial donation treatment is still in its infancy, mitochondrial donation is a blessing for the vast majority of people who suffer from mitochondrial disorders for whom there is no known solution.\n\nThis is a great solution since it may also prevent these illnesses from affecting future generations.\n\nAs far as the moral questions surrounding the \u201cThree-Parent Baby\u201d are concerned, the baby\u2019s physical appearance is solely determined by its total metabolic fitness, not by its mitochondrial DNA.\n\nHowever, further study is still required and subject to evaluation to fully understand the long-term impacts of this procedure.\n\nFurthermore, these methods undoubtedly help families whose future children, who will suffer significantly and may not survive through early childhood owing to mitochondrial illnesses, have a limited chance of living a quality life.\n\n-Article written by Swathi Satish\u00a0",

People of all ages can take part in clinical trials, including children.\n\nThere are 4 phases of biomedical clinical trials:\n\nPhase I studies usually test new drugs for the first time in a small group of people to evaluate a safe dosage range and identify side effects.\nPhase II studies test treatments that are safe in Phase I but now need a larger group of human subjects to monitor for any adverse effects.\nPhase III studies are conducted on larger populations and in different regions and countries, and are often the step right before a new treatment is approved.\nPhase IV studies take place after country approval and there is a need for further testing in a wide population over a longer timeframe.\nClinical Trials in India\n\nClinical trials hold enormous potential for benefiting patients, improving therapeutic regimens, and ensuring advancement in medical practice that is evidence-based.\n\nUnfortunately, the data and reports of various trials are often difficult to find and in some cases do not even exist as many trials are abandoned or are not published due to \u201cnegative\u201d or equivocal results.\nHowever, this tendency for the availability of only selective information from the innumerable clinical trials conducted is not proportionate with the practice of \u201cevidence-based medicine\u201d.\nToday, the world over, a need has been felt the imperative for transparency, accountability, and accessibility to re-establish public trust in clinical trial data.\nAnd this would be feasible only if all clinical trials conducted are registered in a centralized clinical trials registry.\nRegistration of trials will ensure transparency, accountability, and accessibility of clinical trials.\nClinical Trials Registry- India (CTRI)\n\nThe Clinical Trials Registry- India (CTRI), hosted at the ICMR\u2019s National Institute of Medical Statistics (NIMS), is a free and online public record system for registration of clinical trials being conducted in India that was launched in 2007.\n\nToday, any researcher who plans to conduct a trial involving human participants, of any intervention such as drugs, surgical procedures, preventive measures, lifestyle modifications, devices, educational or behavioral treatment, rehabilitation strategies as well as trials being conducted in the purview of the Department of AYUSH is expected to register the trial in the CTRI before enrollment of the first participant.\n\nTrial registration involves public declaration and identification of trial investigators, sponsors, interventions, patient population, etc before the enrollment of the first patient.\nSubmission of Ethics approval and DCGI approval (if applicable) is essential for trial registration in the CTRI.\nMulti-country trials, where India is a participating country, which has been registered in an international registry, are also expected to be registered in the CTRI.\nIn the CTRI, details of Indian investigators, trial sites, Indian target sample size, and date of enrolment are captured.\nAfter a trial is registered, trialists are expected to regularly update the trial status or other aspects as the case may be.\nAfter a trial is registered, all updates and changes will be recorded and available for public display.\n\nMission\n\nThe mission of the CTRI is to ensure that all clinical trials conducted in India are prospectively registered, i.e. before the enrolment of the first participant.\n\nAdditionally, post-marketing surveillance studies, BA/BE studies as well as clinical studies as part of the PG thesis are also expected to be registered in the CTRI.\n\nVision\n\nThe vision of the CTRI is to ensure that every clinical trial conducted in the region is prospectively registered with full disclosure of the trial data set items.\nWhile this register is meant primarily for trials conducted in India, the CTRI will also accept the registration of trials conducted in other countries in the region, which do not have a Primary Registry of its own, provided ethics approval (in English) is available and the study has not begun enrolling.\n\nThrough several key drivers, India is emerging as a favorable destination to conduct clinical trials, per a joint report by PwC India & USAIC (US-India Chamber of Commerce) titled, \u201cClinical Trial opportunities in India\u201d.\n\nImportant details from the report:\n\nThe private sector is a well-suited channel for top biopharma to conduct more efficient clinical trials with easier and faster access to investigators and patients.\nIndian states with high disease prevalence (e.g., cancer) also have the most number of tier-1 cities, with advanced medical infrastructure and availability of investigators. Targeting these states can provide biopharma companies faster access to patients, sites, and investigators.\nThe total number of investigators has increased by 2x between 2015 and 2020, with the majority of the increase occurring in the internal medicine and oncology specializations. However, the growth in the number of investigators is largely restricted to tier-1 and 2 cities.\nWhile the top 20 pharma activity for the major therapy classes in India has remained largely constant in the last decade, growth opportunities exist across key diseases (e.g., pain, epilepsy, cervical cancer) and orphan diseases (\u03b2-thalassemia, Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy).\nIndia has overall clinical trial participation of ~3% but contributes upwards of 15% to the global burden of most highly prevalent diseases (e.g., respiratory infections, cardiovascular, diabetes, cervical cancer), representing an untapped potential for top pharma.\nTop biopharma should align their strategy towards tier-1 cities (e.g., Mumbai, Delhi, Bengaluru, Chennai) where the higher bed capacity, number of doctors, and presence of tertiary care multi-city hospitals can support enablement efforts of running faster and more efficient clinical trials.\nRegulatory Mechanism in India\n\nRegulations have been set to ensure the integrity of the data collected from clinical trials which assure the safety, right,s and welfare of the subject.\n\nLaw: Drugs and Cosmetics Act 1940 and Rules 1945\nRegulation: Schedule Y for clinical research by CDSCO\nGuidelines: ICMR guidelines and ICH-GCP guidelines\n\nThe main steps to go through for conducting clinical trials in India are-\n\nStep 1: Approval from the Drugs Controller General, India.\nStep 2: Permission from the particular Ethics Committee where the clinical study is designed.\nStep 3: Compulsory registration on the ICMR website.\n\nTo advance clinical research in the nation, the Union Ministry for Health and Family Welfare has published the Drugs and Clinical Trials Rules, 2019.\n\nThe new regulations will alter the country\u2019s regulatory environment for the licensing of new pharmaceuticals and the conduct of clinical studies.\nAll new medications, experimental pharmaceuticals intended for human use, bioequivalence research, and clinical trials in India will be subject to these regulations.\nChallenges for performing clinical trials in India\nThere have also been ethical concerns due to non-transparency and consent processes, which have been addressed through stricter and more monitored processes.\nQuality of the trial, data protection, improper documentation, data quality, and GCP issues, are some of the considerations that need more attention.\nDelays for approval of clinical trials due to shortage of technical staff or trained staff.\nWay forward\n\nThe patient benefits from the 2019 new drug development regulations since they are thorough, well-balanced and have greater ethical balance.\n\nClinical trial approval in India within 30 days can expedite the trial procedure and support Indian drug development.\n\nNew regulations that guarantee adherence to moral standards and the preservation of patients\u2019 rights provide a chance for early access to revolutionary medical products.\n\nThese modifications raise the sponsor\u2019s obligations and demand a higher degree of management oversight to guarantee compliance.\n\nBiopharma may profit from the vital innovation-enabling components of India\u2019s private healthcare system and use the country\u2019s rapidly developing healthcare infrastructure.\n\nPrivate biopharma businesses have a great chance to take advantage of India\u2019s diverse population and advanced healthcare system because of the country\u2019s rising interest in clinical trials.\n\nIndia provides a good environment for biopharma businesses to perform successful and affordable clinical trials because of its big and diversified patient pool, streamlined regulatory procedures, and highly qualified workforce.\n\nBy taking advantage of this chance, businesses may hasten the process of developing new drugs, boost the effectiveness of their research, and provide patients with cutting-edge therapies, thereby enhancing global healthcare.\n\nRead: Patients safety rights\n\n-Article written by Swathi Satish",

Autoantibodies, which are proteins released by the body, assault healthy cells.\nSome autoimmune disorders exclusively affect a single organ. The pancreas is harmed by type 1 diabetes. Other illnesses, such as lupus or systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), can have a total body impact.\n\nDoctors are unsure of the precise etiology of immune system malfunction.\n\nAccording to a 2014 study, 6.4% of women and 2.7% of males respectively experience autoimmune disorders. The illness frequently begins in women who are of reproductive age (15 to 44).\nSpecific ethnic groups are more likely to develop specific autoimmune illnesses. For instance, lupus affects white individuals less than it does African Americans and Hispanics.\nSeveral autoimmune diseases, including lupus and multiple sclerosis, run in families. Although not every family member will necessarily have the same illness, they all have a propensity for autoimmune diseases.\n\nResearchers believe environmental factors like infections and exposure to chemicals or solvents may potentially play a role in the rise in the prevalence of autoimmune illnesses.\n\nCommon autoimmune diseases\n\nScientists know about more than 80 autoimmune diseases. Some are well-known, such as type 1 diabetes, multiple sclerosis, lupus, and rheumatoid arthritis, while others are rare and difficult to diagnose.\n\nType 1 diabetes: The immune system attacks and destroys insulin-producing cells in the pancreas.\nRheumatoid arthritis: The immune system attacks the joints.\nPsoriasis: The causes skin cells to multiply too quickly. The extra cells build up and form inflamed, red patches, commonly with silver-white scales of plaque.\nMultiple sclerosis: It damages the myelin sheath, the protective coating surrounding nerve cells in your central nervous system.\nSystemic lupus erythematosus (SLE): It is a skin disease because of the rash it commonly produces, but it affects many organs, including the joints, kidneys, brain, and heart.\nInflammatory bowel disease: It describes conditions that cause inflammation in the lining of the intestinal wall.\nAddison\u2019s disease: It affects the adrenal glands, which produce the hormones cortisol and aldosterone as well as androgen hormones.\nGraves\u2019 disease: It attacks the thyroid gland in the neck, causing it to produce too much of its hormones.\nSj\u00f6gren\u2019s syndrome: This condition attacks the glands that provide lubrication to the eyes and mouth.\nHashimoto\u2019s thyroiditis: The thyroid hormone production slows to a deficiency.\nMyasthenia gravis: It affects nerve impulses that help the brain control the muscles.\nAutoimmune vasculitis: This happens when the immune system attacks blood vessels.\nPernicious anemia: This condition causes a deficiency of a protein made by stomach lining cells, which is an intrinsic factor needed for the small intestine to absorb vitamin B12 from food.\nCeliac disease: People with celiac disease can\u2019t eat foods containing gluten, a protein found in wheat, rye, and other grain products.\nWhat causes autoimmune diseases?\nCourtesy: National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences, US\n\nAccording to studies, genetic and environmental factors combine to cause certain disorders.\n\nCharacteristics of gender, race, and ethnicity are associated with a higher risk of getting an autoimmune illness.\n\nWhen humans come into touch with specific environmental exposures, as stated below, autoimmune illnesses are more prevalent.\n\nUltraviolet radiation from sunlight may be connected to the development of juvenile dermatomyositis, an autoimmune disease.\nChildhood poverty maybe be linked to rheumatoid arthritis in adulthood.\nExposure to some pesticides may play a role in the development of rheumatoid arthritis in male farm workers.\nMercury, even at exposure levels generally considered safe, may be linked to the development of autoimmune antibodies in women of reproductive age.\nGenetic risk factors are associated with autoimmune muscle disease in Caucasian populations.\nThe mechanics of a gene-environment interaction could explain why the genetic risk for some of the diseases is amplified by environmental pollutants like cigarette smoke.\nVitamin D may be important for preventing immune dysfunction in older populations.\nConclusion\n\nAutoimmune disorders, formerly thought to be uncommon, are now the leading cause of chronic illnesses in India and the leading source of morbidity in both men and women across practically all age groups.\n\nThe present lifestyle and dietary conditions are attributed to the prevalence of these diseases.\n\nFoods loaded with pesticides and preservatives, excessive exposure to antibiotics, pollution-causing cellular damage, excessive stress disrupting immune functioning, and frequent infections on the rise, all contribute to an increasing number of autoimmune diseases in the global population.\n\n-Article written by Swathi Satish",

The population will alter or evolve through time as the qualities that allow species to live and reproduce become more prevalent.\n\nTheory of natural selection\n\nDarwin developed the idea of natural selection after a five-year voyage to study plants, animals, and fossils in South America and on islands in the Pacific.\n\nNatural selection is the process through which populations of living organisms adapt and change.\n\nIndividuals in a population are naturally variable, meaning that they are all different in some ways.\nThis variation means that some individuals have traits better suited to the environment than others.\nIndividuals with adaptive traits that give them some advantage are more likely to survive and reproduce.\nThese individuals then pass the adaptive traits on to their offspring.\nOver time, these advantageous traits become more common in the population.\nThrough this process of natural selection, favorable traits are transmitted through generations.\n\nNatural selection can lead to speciation, where one species gives rise to a new and distinctly different species.\n\nIt is one of the processes that drives evolution and helps to explain the diversity of life on Earth.\nAt that time, Darwin wasn\u2019t aware that genes existed, but he could see that many traits are heritable, passed from parents to offspring.\n\nNatural selection is sometimes summed up as \u201csurvival of the fittest\u201d because the \u201cfittest\u201d organisms most suited to their environment are the ones that reproduce most successfully, and are most likely to pass on their traits to the next generation.\n\nDarwin\u2019s examples of natural selection\nThe Galapagos finches provide a superb illustration of natural selection. Finches of several species have short, thick beaks. They are used to consuming buds, fruits, and seeds. The beaks of certain others are long and straight. They mostly live off of floral nectar. A quick shift in environmental conditions may favor some traits over others.\nThe finest illustration of natural selection is the alterations that took place in the moth population in various parts of England. Tree trunks were lighter and there were more light-colored moths before industrialization. There were a few dark-colored moths, but they weren\u2019t many. Pollution brought on by industrialization caused tree trunks to become darker. As a result, the light-colored moths were easier for birds to see and were thus consumed by their predators. Due to this, ordinary light-colored moths were nearly entirely replaced by the black type by the end of the 19th century.\nImportance of the theory of evolution\n\nThe idea that species evolved by natural selection is recognized as a significant development in the field of evolutionary theory.\n\nBy describing the diversity of living things and emphasizing the crucial role of natural selection, Darwin made a significant contribution to our current knowledge of biological evolution.\n\nHe shared the ignorance of most nineteenth-century scientists on heredity and the transmission of certain features from one generation to the next.\n\nHis hypothesis lacks an understanding of contemporary genetics. However, the origins of differences between species were described by the mutation hypothesis.\n\nThe genetic laws of inheritance were eventually proposed by Gregor Mendel in 1866.\n\nFour of Darwin\u2019s contributions to evolutionary biology are particularly significant since they had a momentous impact outside of that field as well.\n\nThe first is the current understanding of evolution itself or the instability of species.\nThe second is the idea of branching evolution, which postulates that all species of living creatures on Earth descended from a single original source in common.\nPrior to 1859, all theories of evolution, including those of the biologist Jean-Baptiste Lamarck, advocated a teleological march towards greater perfection known as linear evolution. This idea had been popularised by Aristotle\u2018s Scala Naturae (the chain of being) theory. Darwin added that there should be no significant interruptions or discontinuities in the course of evolution.\nFinally, he concluded that natural selection was the process of evolution.\nConclusion\n\nDarwin\u2019s theory of evolution was not absolute and does not answer many variations seen during the evolutionary process. But his work laid the foundation for more biologists to research further on the facts.\n\nBecause it challenges claims about the literal reality of the Bible and the biblical creation myth, the Darwinian theory of evolution has been the subject of intense debate and is still rejected by certain religious people.\n\nAll of the traditional, outdated notions that the emergence of distinct species was a supernatural occurrence or an act of God were disproved by Darwin\u2019s theory of evolution.\n\nA more logical explanation for how new species are created was found in Darwin\u2019s evolutionary theory of natural selection.\n\n\u00ad-Article written by Swathi Satish",

Hanford and Livingston in the USA and Virgo in Italy are the first three LIGO interferometers.\nGiven the complexity of gravitational wave detectors, to increase the odds that four detectors are running at the same time, there is a need for more than four in a network.\nThe fourth detector, Kagra, in Japan, is also online since 2021.\n\u00a0The\u00a0Virgo detector is a 3 km interferometer in Cascina, Italy. It is operated by the European Gravitational Observatory and funded by INFN (Italy), CNRS (France), and Nikhef (Netherlands).\nThe\u00a0KAGRA observatory\u00a0is an underground 3 km interferometer in Kamioka, Japan.\nLIGO India will be the all-important fifth, located in the Hingoli district of Maharashtra.\nWhen it begins operation, LIGO India will significantly improve the likelihood that four detectors are operating at any given moment. This is the critical role that LIGO India will play in the global gravitational wave detector network.\n\nThe LIGO Laboratory and India are both making significant financial and intellectual contributions to the project:\n\nThe LIGO Laboratory is providing the hardware for a complete LIGO interferometer, technical data on its design, installation, and commissioning, training and assistance with installation and commissioning, and the requirements and designs for the necessary infrastructure (including the vacuum system).\nIndia is providing the site, the vacuum system, and other infrastructure required to house and operate the interferometer, as all labor, materials, and supplies for installation, commissioning, and operations.\nFunding for the LIGO-India facilities comes from the Indian Department of Atomic Energy (DAE) and the Department of Science and Technology (DST), with DAE acting as the lead agency.\n\nOnce it becomes operational, LIGO-India will be scientifically managed and operated in collaboration with the US LIGO detectors to optimize the scientific return.\n\nBenefits of LIGO-India\n\nThe scientific benefits of the project are manifold-\n\nAdding a new detector to the existing network will increase the expected event rates, and will boost the detection confidence of new sources.\nIt will increase the sensitivity, sky coverage, and duty cycle of the network.\nLIGO-India would help in localizing gravitational wave sources in the sky. Sky-location of the gravitational wave sources is computed by combining data from geographically separated detectors.\nAdding a new detector in India, geographically well separated from the existing LIGO-Virgo detector array, will dramatically improve the source-localization accuracies (5 to 10 times).\nImpact on Indian Science, Industry, and Education\n\nIndian science:\n\nThe proposed LIGO-India project will help the Indian scientific community to be a major player in the emerging research frontier of gravitational wave astronomy.\nA major initiative like LIGO-India will further inspire frontier research and development projects in India.\nIt will bring together scientists and engineers from different fields like optics, lasers, gravitational physics, astronomy and astrophysics, cosmology, computational science, mathematics, and various branches of engineering.\nThe LIGO-India project will join forces with several Indian astronomy projects like the Astrosat project, future upgrades of the India-based Neutrino Observatory, and optical/radio telescopes.\n\nImpact on industry:\n\nThe high-end engineering requirements of the project such as the world\u2019s largest ultra-high vacuum facility will provide unparalleled opportunities for Indian industries in collaboration with academic research institutions.\nLIGO project has facilitated major industry-academic research partnerships in the USA and Europe and has produced several important technological spin-offs.\n\nEducation and public outreach:\n\nThis cutting-edge project in India can serve as a local focus to interest and inspire students and young scientists.\nThe LIGO-India project involves high-technology instrumentation and its scale will motivate young students to choose experimental physics and engineering physics as career options.\nAlso, the observatory will be one of the very few research facilities in India of this scale, international relevance, and technological innovation to which the general public and students can have access.\nAbout LIGO\n\n\u00a0\n\nCourtesy: Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences\n\nThe Laser Interferometer Gravitational-Wave Observatory (LIGO) was designed to open the field of gravitational-wave astrophysics through the direct detection of gravitational waves predicted by Einstein\u2019s General Theory of Relativity.\n\nLIGO\u2019s multi-kilometer-scale gravitational wave detectors use laser interferometry to measure the minute ripples in space-time caused by passing gravitational waves from cataclysmic cosmic events such as colliding neutron stars or black holes, or by supernovae.\nLIGO consists of two widely separated interferometers within the United States, one in Hanford, Washington, and the other in Livingston, Louisiana, operated in unison to detect gravitational waves.\n\nThe LIGO in the US first detected gravitational waves in 2015, which led to a Nobel Prize in Physics in 2017.\n\nThese gravitational waves were produced by the merger of two black holes, which were about 29 and 36 times the mass of the Sun, 1.3 billion years ago.\nGravitational waves\n\nGravitational waves are \u2018ripples\u2019 in space-time caused by some of the most violent and energetic processes in the Universe.\n\nAlbert Einstein predicted the existence of gravitational waves in 1916 in his general theory of relativity.\n\nEinstein\u2019s mathematics showed that massive accelerating objects (such as neutron stars or black holes orbiting each other) would disrupt space-time in such a way that \u2018waves\u2019 of undulating space-time would propagate in all directions away from the source.\nThese cosmic ripples would travel at the speed of light, carrying with them information about their origins, as well as clues to the nature of gravity itself.\n\nThe strongest gravitational waves are produced by cataclysmic events such as colliding black holes, supernovae (massive stars exploding at the end of their lifetimes), and colliding neutron stars.\n\nOther waves are predicted to be caused by the rotation of neutron stars that are not perfect spheres, and possibly even the remnants of gravitational radiation created by the Big Bang.\n\nRelated article: Indian Neutrino Observatory\n\n-Article written by Swathi Satish",

Studies show that HIV may have jumped from chimpanzees to humans as far back as the late 1800s.\n\nThe chimpanzee version of the virus is called the simian immunodeficiency virus.\nIt was probably passed to humans when humans hunted these chimpanzees for meat and came in contact with their infected blood.\nSigns and symptoms\n\nThe symptoms of HIV vary depending on the stage of infection and people living with HIV tend to be most infectious in the first few months after being infected, many are unaware of their status until the later stages.\n\nIn the first few weeks after the initial infection people may experience no symptoms or an influenza-like illness including fever, headache, rash, or sore throat.\nAs the infection progressively weakens the immune system, they can develop other signs and symptoms, such as swollen lymph nodes, weight loss, fever, diarrhea, and cough.\nWithout treatment, they could also develop severe illnesses such as tuberculosis (TB), cryptococcal meningitis, severe bacterial infections, and cancers such as lymphomas and Kaposi\u2019s sarcoma.\n\nHIV infection can be detected with great accuracy using WHO-prequalified tests within a nationally approved testing strategy and algorithm.\n\nMost widely-used HIV diagnostic tests detect antibodies produced by the person as part of their immune response to fight HIV.\nIn most cases, people develop antibodies to HIV within 28 days of infection.\nTreatment for HIV AIDS\n\nAs of now, there is no treatment for HIV AIDS, but the disease can be prevented and managed.\n\nHIV is not transmitted if a person\u2019s sexual partner is virally suppressed on Antiretroviral therapy (ART), so increasing access to testing and supporting linkage to ART is an important component of HIV prevention.\n\nThe standard treatment consists of a combination of drugs (often called \u201chighly active antiretroviral therapy\u201d or HAART) that suppress HIV replication.\nCurrent antiretroviral therapy (ART) does not cure HIV infection but suppresses viral replication and allows an individual\u2019s immune system recovery to strengthen and regain the capacity to fight off opportunistic infections and some cancers.\n\nIn 2021, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved Cabenuva, which contains two different types of HIV drugs: cabotegravir and rilpivirine.\n\nHIV AIDS in India\n\nThe number of people contracting HIV (human immunodeficiency virus) in the last 10 years has come down significantly. HIV AIDS is an epidemic in India.\n\nIndia has a very good network with the National AIDS Control Organization (NACO), a Government of India organization, which is responsible for managing HIV patients right from his/her diagnosis.\n\nWith the easy availability of Highly Active Anti-Retroviral Treatment (HAART), the prognosis of HIV patients has improved over the last two decades.\n\nNational AIDS Control Organization is a division of the Ministry of Health and Family Welfare that provides leadership to HIV/AIDS control programs in India through 35 HIV/AIDS Prevention and Control Societies.\n\nIn 1986, following the detection of the first AIDS case in the country, the National AIDS Committee was constituted in the Ministry of Health and Family Welfare.\nAs the epidemic spread, the need was felt for a nationwide program and an organization to steer the program.\nIn 1992 India\u2019s first National AIDS Control Programme (1992-1999) was launched, and National AIDS Control Organization (NACO) was constituted to implement the program.\n\nThe HIV and AIDS (Prevention & Control) Act, 2017 is a central legislation protecting and promoting the rights of persons infected with and affected by HIV and AIDS.\n\nThe Act came into force on September 10, 2018, intending to prevent and control the spread of HIV and AIDS and for reinforcing the legal and human rights of persons infected with and affected by HIV and AIDS.\nIt also seeks to protect the rights of healthcare providers.\nThe Act addresses stigma & discrimination and strives to create an enabling environment for enhancing access to services.\nIt provides diagnostic facilities related to ART and opportunistic infection management to people living with HIV and AIDS.\nThe Act also provides for a robust grievance redressal mechanism in the form of an Ombudsman at the State level and a Complaints Officer at the establishment level aiming to provide speedy redressal.\nWay forward\n\nMisinformation and fear increase the stigma surrounding HIV and AIDS. One in eight people with HIV is denied health services because of stigma and discrimination.\n\nProviding clear information about HIV, plus public awareness campaigns and stigma-reduction sessions for healthcare professionals and others can help people recognize and address the stigmatizing attitudes they hold.\n\nProtecting, promoting, respecting, and fulfilling people\u2019s human rights is an essential part of an effective HIV response.\n\nEnsuring people with HIV and people most at risk of HIV are included in responses to humanitarian crises is key to minimizing the impact emergencies have on these communities.\n\n\u00ad-Article written by Swathi Satish",

It is often called as the \u201cmaster gland\u201d because it produces and secretes a variety of hormones that regulate the function of many other endocrine glands in the body.\n\nThe pituitary gland is divided into two main parts: the anterior pituitary (adenohypophysis) and the posterior pituitary (neurohypophysis). The anterior pituitary is composed of glandular tissue and secretes several hormones, while the posterior pituitary is made up of nerve tissue and stores and releases two hormones produced by the hypothalamus.\n\n\ud83d\udc49 Which year are YOU targeting for success in the IAS/IPS/IFS Exam? \ud83d\ude80\n\n(1) \u21d2 UPSC 2025: Prelims cum Mains\n\n(2) \u21d2 UPSC 2026: Prelims cum Mains\n\n(3) \u21d2 UPSC 2027 Prelims cum Mains\n\nTip: Know more about ClearIAS Courses (Online/Offline)\n\nHormones Produced by the Anterior Pituitary:\nGrowth Hormone (GH): Stimulates growth and cell reproduction in bones, muscles, and other organs.\nThyroid-Stimulating Hormone (TSH): Stimulates the thyroid gland to produce thyroid hormones that regulate metabolism.\nAdrenocorticotropic Hormone (ACTH): Stimulates the adrenal glands to produce cortisol, a hormone that helps the body respond to stress.\nFollicle-Stimulating Hormone (FSH) and Luteinizing Hormone (LH): Regulate the menstrual cycle and reproductive function in females and stimulate the production of testosterone in males.\nProlactin: Stimulates milk production in females after childbirth.\nMelanocyte-Stimulating Hormone (MSH): Stimulates the production of melanin, a pigment that gives color to the skin, hair, and eyes.\nHormones Produced by the Posterior Pituitary:\nAntidiuretic Hormone (ADH): Regulates water balance by decreasing the amount of water excreted in the urine.\nOxytocin: Stimulates uterine contractions during childbirth and promotes the release of milk from the breasts during nursing.\nThyroid Gland\n\nThe thyroid gland is a butterfly-shaped endocrine gland located in the neck, just below Adam\u2019s apple. It produces and secretes several hormones that are essential for maintaining normal bodily functions.\n\nThe thyroid gland is composed of two lobes that are connected by a small band of tissue called the isthmus. It is situated in front of the trachea and just below the larynx. The thyroid gland is made up of follicular cells, which produce and secrete the hormones T3 and T4, and parafollicular cells, which produce the hormone calcitonin.\n\nHormones Produced by the Thyroid Gland:\nThyroxine (T4): The thyroid gland produces about 80% of T4, which is converted to T3 in various organs and tissues. T4 and T3 are responsible for regulating metabolism, growth, and development in the body.\nTriiodothyronine (T3): T3 is the more active form of thyroid hormone and is responsible for regulating metabolic processes such as energy production, heart rate, and body temperature.\nCalcitonin: Calcitonin helps regulate calcium levels in the body by reducing the amount of calcium released from bones.\nAdrenal Gland\n\nThe adrenal gland is an endocrine gland located above each kidney. It plays a critical role in the body\u2019s response to stress and the regulation of various bodily functions.\n\nThe adrenal gland is divided into two main regions: the outer adrenal cortex and the inner adrenal medulla. The adrenal cortex produces hormones that are essential for life, while the adrenal medulla produces hormones that help the body respond to stress.\n\nHormones Produced by the Adrenal Cortex:\nCortisol: Cortisol is the primary hormone produced by the adrenal cortex and plays a vital role in regulating metabolism, immune response, and the body\u2019s response to stress.\nAldosterone: Aldosterone is a hormone that helps regulate salt and water balance in the body by increasing the reabsorption of sodium ions and the excretion of potassium ions.\nAndrogens: The adrenal cortex also produces androgens, which are male sex hormones that are also present in females. Androgens play a role in the development of male sexual characteristics and contribute to the sex drive in both men and women.\nHormones Produced by the Adrenal Medulla:\nEpinephrine (adrenaline): Epinephrine is a hormone that is released in response to stress and helps prepare the body for the \u201cfight or flight\u201d response. It increases heart rate, dilates blood vessels, and causes the air passages in the lungs to widen, allowing more oxygen to enter the body.\nNorepinephrine (noradrenaline): Norepinephrine is another hormone that is released in response to stress and works with epinephrine to prepare the body for the \u201cfight or flight\u201d response.\nPancreas\n\nThe pancreas is a vital organ located in the abdomen, behind the stomach. It plays an essential role in both the digestive and endocrine systems of the body.\n\nThe pancreas is a glandular organ that is approximately 6 to 10 inches long and shaped like a thin, flat tadpole. The pancreas is divided into two main sections: the exocrine pancreas and the endocrine pancreas.\n\nHormones Produced by the Endocrine Pancreas:\nInsulin: Insulin is a hormone that regulates the body\u2019s blood sugar levels. It is produced by beta cells in the islets of Langerhans and helps to lower blood sugar by promoting the uptake and use of glucose by cells throughout the body.\nGlucagon: Glucagon is a hormone that works in opposition to insulin, raising blood sugar levels. It is produced by alpha cells in the islets of Langerhans and promotes the breakdown of glycogen (stored glucose) in the liver, releasing glucose into the bloodstream.\nSomatostatin: Somatostatin is a hormone that inhibits the release of both insulin and glucagon, helping to regulate blood sugar levels.\n\nAlso read: Endocrine-Disrupting Chemicals (EDCs)\n\nGonads\n\nThe gonads are a pair of endocrine glands responsible for the production of sex hormones and gametes (reproductive cells) in both males and females. In males, the gonads are the testes, while in females, the gonads are the ovaries.\n\nThe testes and ovaries are both responsible for producing sex hormones and gametes, but they have different structures and functions. The testes are located in the scrotum, and they are responsible for the production of testosterone, which is the primary male sex hormone. Testosterone is responsible for the development of male reproductive organs, secondary sexual characteristics, and the regulation of sperm production.\n\nThe ovaries are located in the pelvis, and they are responsible for the production of estrogen and progesterone, which are the primary female sex hormones. Estrogen is responsible for the development of female reproductive organs, secondary sexual characteristics, and the regulation of the menstrual cycle. Progesterone is involved in the regulation of the menstrual cycle and plays a crucial role in pregnancy.\n\nHormones Produced by the Gonads:\nTestosterone: Testosterone is produced by the Leydig cells in the testes and is responsible for the development of male reproductive organs, secondary sexual characteristics, and the regulation of sperm production.\nEstrogen: Estrogen is produced by the follicles in the ovaries and is responsible for the development of female reproductive organs, secondary sexual characteristics, and the regulation of the menstrual cycle.\nProgesterone: Progesterone is produced by the corpus luteum in the ovaries and is involved in the regulation of the menstrual cycle and plays a crucial role in pregnancy.\nThymus gland\n\nThe thymus gland is a small, bi-lobed organ located behind the sternum and in front of the heart. It is part of the endocrine system and plays a critical role in the development of the immune system.\n\nThe thymus gland is a unique organ because it is active primarily during childhood and adolescence, gradually becoming smaller and less active as we age.\n\nHormones Produced by the Thymus:\nThymosin: Thymosin is a hormone that is involved in the maturation of T-cells. It is produced by the epithelial cells in the thymus and helps to stimulate the development and differentiation of T-cells.\nThymulin: Thymulin is a hormone that is involved in the regulation of the immune system. It is produced by the epithelial cells in the thymus and helps to stimulate the production of T-cells and the function of certain immune cells.\nHeart\n\nThe heart is primarily known for its role in pumping blood throughout the body, but it also has an endocrine function.\n\nThe heart is a muscular organ that is located in the chest cavity. It is composed of four chambers: the right and left atria and the right and left ventricles. The heart\u2019s primary function is to pump blood throughout the body, but it also plays a role in the endocrine system.\n\nHormones Produced by the Heart:\nAtrial natriuretic peptide (ANP): ANP is a hormone that is produced by the cells in the atria of the heart. It helps to regulate blood pressure and blood volume by promoting the excretion of sodium and water by the kidneys.\nBrain natriuretic peptide (BNP): BNP is a hormone that is produced by the cells in the ventricles of the heart. It also helps to regulate blood pressure and blood volume by promoting the excretion of sodium and water by the kidneys.\nC-type natriuretic peptide (CNP): CNP is a hormone that is produced by the cells in the endothelium of the heart. It helps to regulate blood pressure by promoting vasodilation, which widens blood vessels and increases blood flow.\nGastrointestinal tract\n\nThe gastrointestinal tract (GI tract), also known as the digestive system, is responsible for the digestion and absorption of food. It is also an important endocrine gland that produces several hormones involved in the regulation of various bodily processes.\n\nIt is composed of several organs, including the mouth, esophagus, stomach, small intestine, large intestine, rectum, and anus. The primary function of the GI tract is to break down food into nutrients that can be absorbed into the body.\n\nHormones Produced by the GI Tract:\nGastrin: Gastrin is produced by the cells in the stomach lining. It stimulates the production of hydrochloric acid in the stomach, which helps to break down food.\nSecretin: Secretin is produced by the cells in the duodenum (the first part of the small intestine). It stimulates the pancreas to produce bicarbonate, which neutralizes the acid in the stomach and helps to protect the small intestine from damage.\nCholecystokinin (CCK): CCK is produced by the cells in the duodenum. It stimulates the pancreas to produce enzymes that help to break down fats, proteins, and carbohydrates in food. It also stimulates the gallbladder to release bile, which helps to digest fats.\nGlucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1): GLP-1 is produced by the cells in the small intestine. It stimulates the pancreas to produce insulin and inhibits the production of glucagon, which helps to regulate blood sugar levels.\nKidneys\n\nThe kidneys are complex organs responsible for filtering blood and removing waste products from the body. In addition to their well-known role in excretion and regulation of fluid and electrolyte balance, the kidneys also function as an endocrine gland.\n\nHormones Produced by the Kidneys:\nErythropoietin (EPO): EPO is produced by cells in the kidneys and stimulates the production of red blood cells in the bone marrow. It is essential for maintaining adequate levels of oxygen in the body.\nRenin: Renin is produced by cells in the kidneys and is involved in regulating blood pressure. It works by converting angiotensinogen, a protein produced by the liver, into angiotensin I, which is then converted into angiotensin II. Angiotensin II causes blood vessels to constrict, which raises blood pressure.\nCalcitriol: Calcitriol, also known as vitamin D3, is produced by cells in the kidneys and is involved in regulating calcium levels in the body. It stimulates the absorption of calcium from the intestines and helps to maintain healthy bones.\nPineal gland\n\nThe pineal gland is a small, pinecone-shaped endocrine gland located in the brain. It produces the hormone melatonin, which plays a crucial role in regulating the body\u2019s sleep-wake cycle.\n\nThe pineal gland is located in the center of the brain, between the two hemispheres. It is made up of pinealocytes, which are specialized cells that produce and secrete melatonin. The pineal gland is controlled by the suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN) of the hypothalamus, which receives information from the eyes about light and darkness and helps to regulate the body\u2019s circadian rhythms.\n\nHormone Produced by the Pineal Gland:\n\nThe pineal gland produces the hormone melatonin, which is involved in regulating the body\u2019s sleep-wake cycle. Melatonin is produced in response to darkness and is inhibited by light. It is released into the bloodstream and helps to promote sleepiness and regulate the timing of sleep.\n\nParathyroid gland\n\nThe parathyroid gland is a small endocrine gland located in the neck, near the thyroid gland. It produces a hormone called parathyroid hormone (PTH), which plays a crucial role in regulating the body\u2019s calcium levels.\n\nHormone Produced by the Parathyroid Gland:\n\nThe parathyroid gland produces a parathyroid hormone (PTH), which plays a critical role in maintaining the body\u2019s calcium balance. PTH is released in response to low levels of calcium in the blood, and it works to increase the levels of calcium by stimulating the release of calcium from bones, increasing the absorption of calcium in the intestines, and reducing the excretion of calcium in the kidneys.\n\nConclusion\n\nIn conclusion, the endocrine system is a complex network of glands and hormones that regulate numerous physiological processes in the body. The proper functioning of the endocrine system is essential for maintaining homeostasis, growth, development, and reproduction. Hormones play a critical role in this system by acting as chemical messengers that communicate with cells throughout the body.\n\nArticle Written By: Priti Raj",

In simple words, it is an unusually weak spot in the earth\u2019s magnetic field. Read here to learn more about the phenomenon.\n\nEarth\u2019s magnetic field acts like a protective shield around the planet, repelling and trapping charged particles from the Sun.\n\nBut over South America and the southern Atlantic Ocean, an unusually weak spot in the field called the South Atlantic Anomaly (SAA), allows these particles to dip closer to the surface than normal.\n\nParticle radiation in this region can knock out onboard computers and interfere with the data collection of satellites that pass through it a key reason why scientists want to track and study the anomaly.\n\nTable of Contents\n\nSouth Atlantic Anomaly (SAA)\nVan Allen belt\nMechanism of SAA\nConsequences of South Atlantic anomaly\nConclusion\nSouth Atlantic Anomaly (SAA)\nCourtesy: European space agency\n\nThe South Atlantic Anomaly is a weak spot in Earth\u2019s magnetic field, which protects the planet from high doses of solar wind and cosmic radiation.\n\nThis anomaly exists because the Earth\u2019s inner Van Allen radiation belt comes closest to the planet\u2019s surface, causing an increased flux of energetic particles.\n\n\ud83d\udc49 Which year are YOU targeting for success in the IAS/IPS/IFS Exam? \ud83d\ude80\n\n(1) \u21d2 UPSC 2025: Prelims cum Mains\n\n(2) \u21d2 UPSC 2026: Prelims cum Mains\n\n(3) \u21d2 UPSC 2027 Prelims cum Mains\n\nTip: Know more about ClearIAS Courses (Online/Offline)\n\nIn turn, this anomaly also causes technical disturbances in satellites and spacecraft orbiting Earth.\n\nCurrently, the SAA creates no visible impacts on daily life on the surface.\nHowever, recent observations and forecasts show that the region is expanding westward and continuing to weaken in intensity.\n\nThe recent data shows the anomaly\u2019s valley, or region of minimum field strength, has split into two lobes, creating additional challenges for satellite missions.\n\nVan Allen belt\nCourtesy: NASA\n\nA Van Allen radiation belt is a zone of energetic charged particles, most of which originate from the solar wind.\n\nThese particles are captured by and held around a planet by that planet\u2019s magnetosphere.\nIt surrounds Earth, containing a nearly impenetrable barrier that prevents the fastest, most energetic electrons from reaching Earth.\n\nThe outer belt is made up of billions of high-energy particles that originate from the Sun and become trapped in Earth\u2019s magnetic field, an area known as the magnetosphere. The inner belt results from interactions of cosmic rays with Earth\u2019s atmosphere.\n\nThe Van Allen radiation belts were discovered in 1958 by James A. Van Allen, the American physicist who designed the instruments on board\u00a0Explorer 1,\u00a0the first spacecraft launched by the United States.\n\nAlthough images of the Van Allen radiation belts make them look visible and colorful, this is actually just a representation.\n\nThe radiation belts themselves are so dilute that astronauts don\u2019t even see or feel them when they are outside in their spacesuits.\nIn fact, scientists only detect them using sensitive instruments inside satellites and spacecraft.\nMechanism of SAA\n\nThe South Atlantic Anomaly arises from two features of Earth\u2019s core:\n\nThe tilt of its magnetic axis\nThe flow of molten metals within its outer core.\n\nEarth is a bit like a bar magnet, with north and south poles that represent opposing magnetic polarities and invisible magnetic field lines encircling the planet between them.\n\nBut unlike a bar magnet, the core magnetic field is not perfectly aligned through the globe, nor is it perfectly stable.\nThat\u2019s because the field originates from Earth\u2019s outer core: molten, iron-rich, and in vigorous motion 1800 miles below the surface.\nThese churning metals act like a massive generator, called the geodynamo, creating electric currents that produce the magnetic field.\n\nThe magnetic field fluctuates in both space and time along with the core motion as a result of intricate geodynamic conditions both inside the core and at the boundary with the solid mantle above.\n\nThese dynamic processes in the core bounce outward to the magnetic field around the globe, creating the SAA and other characteristics in the near-Earth environment including the tilt and drift of the magnetic poles, which are shifting over time.\nThese evolutions in the field, which happen on a similar time scale to the convection of metals in the outer core, provide scientists with new clues to help them unravel the core dynamics that drive the geodynamo.\n\nThe forces in the core and the tilt of the magnetic axis together produce the anomaly, the area of weaker magnetism \u2013 allowing charged particles trapped in Earth\u2019s magnetic field to dip closer to the surface.\n\nConsequences of South Atlantic anomaly\n\nThe Sun expels a constant outflow of particles and magnetic fields known as the solar wind and vast clouds of hot plasma and radiation called coronal mass ejections.\n\nWhen a particularly strong storm of particles from the Sun reaches Earth, the Van Allen belts can become highly energized and the magnetic field can be deformed, allowing the charged particles to penetrate the atmosphere.\nThe region can be hazardous for low-Earth orbit satellites that travel through it.\nThe International Space Station, which is in low-Earth orbit, also passes through the SAA.\nNASA has reported that modern laptops have crashed when Space Shuttle flights passed through the anomaly.\nIt may also affect the navigation-mapping, telecommunication, and satellite systems which depend on the geomagnetic field.\n\nEarth\u2019s magnetic field changes in strength and direction over time. It is believed that these fluctuations may eventually trigger a reversal of the Earth\u2019s magnetic field. The effect of the south Atlantic anomaly may also contribute to this reversal.\n\nConclusion\n\nScientists are evaluating the status of the magnetic field using data from the European Space Agency\u2019s Swarm constellation to comprehend how the SAA is changing and to prepare for upcoming hazards to satellites and sensors.\n\nResearchers now have new possibilities to comprehend Earth\u2019s core dynamics and how they affect other facets of the Earth system.\n\nResearchers can better understand how our planet is changing by monitoring this slowly shifting \u201cdent\u201d in the magnetic field. This will also help us make satellites safer in the future.\n\n-Article written by Swathi Satish",

They can penetrate deep into food materials and bring about desired effects.\n\nIrradiation works by disrupting the biological processes that lead to decay.\n\nIn their interaction with water and other molecules that make up food and living organisms, radiation energy is absorbed by the molecules they contact.\nThe interaction of radiation and radiolytic products of water with DNA impair the reproducing capacity of microorganisms and insects as well as the ability of potato and onion to sprout.\n\nIrradiated foods do not become radioactive, meaning they do not give off radiation. Eating irradiated foods does not expose you to or contaminate you with radiation or radioactive materials.\n\nAlso read: Food Safety and Standards Authority of India (FSSAI)\n\nBenefits of food irradiation\n\nBefore entering our homes and arriving at our tables, our food travels through several stages. At every stage of the food supply chain, food can become contaminated.\n\nIrradiated food selection is an extra step that can aid in preventing foodborne illness.\n\nEven though the food was radioactively irradiated, practicing proper food safety at home, including cleaning fruit and fully cooking meats, is still crucial.\n\nCertain produce, which is generally consumed raw, can be made safer by irradiation.\n\nRadiation technology offers several advantages for processing food-\n\nIt is a physical, non-additive process, that causes a minimal change in food\nIt is highly effective compared to chemicals and fumigants\nIt does not leave harmful residue on food\nIt can be applied to bulk as well as pre-packaged food\nIt is a cold process and preserves food in its natural form\nIt does not destroy heat-labile aroma constituents of food\nThe process is safe for workers and friendly to the environment\nConcerns\n\nConsumer concerns persist over the numerous potential negative impacts of irradiating food.\n\nConcern about the formation of radiolytic by-products in irradiated food.\nFood irradiation does not inactivate dangerous toxins which have already been produced by bacteria before irradiation.\nThe long-term impacts of this on health remain unknown. Far more research is required before exposing populations to such a diet.\nThe risk of recontamination of food after irradiation is severe as near sterile food is an ideal medium for the very rapid growth of re-introduced bacteria.\nIrradiation can cause mutations in bacteria and viruses leading to potentially resistant strains.\nFood irradiation can and has been used to mask poor hygiene practices in food production.\nRegulations for food irradiation in India\nThe Radura is the international symbol indicating a food product has been irradiated.\nFor the commercial application of the technology in India, Atomic Energy (Control of Irradiation of Food) Rules were notified in 1991 and later amended in 1996.\nIn 2012, a new amendment resulted in the notification of the current Atomic Energy (Radiation Processing of Food and Allied Products) Rules, 2012.\nThe Atomic Energy Regulatory Board (AERB) is the regulatory authority in India for enforcing these rules.\nIn 1994, the Government of India amended the Prevention of Food Adulteration Act (1954) Rules and approved the irradiation of onions, potatoes, and spices for the domestic market. Additional items were approved in 1998 and 2001.\nAfter the establishment of the Food Safety & Standards Authority of India (FSSAI) under the Food Safety & Standards Act, 2006, the new regulations on radiation processing have been notified under the Food Safety and Standards (Food Products Standards and Food Additives) Amendment Regulations, 2016.\nAs per Food Safety Standards (Food Product Packaging and Labelling) Regulations, 2011, the irradiated products are labeled and can be identified with the \u2018Radura\u2019 logo shown above on a typical label.\nGlobal use of irradiation technology\n\nFood irradiation is permitted in more than 60 countries and the volume of food processed by radiation for value addition is increasing.\n\nChina, followed by the USA, is the major user of the technology.\nSpices, dry vegetable seasonings, meat and meat products, herbs and herbal products, and fresh fruits and vegetables are currently the major commodity groups where irradiation technology is frequently used.\nIn the irradiated fresh fruits and vegetable category, the USA (mainland) and New Zealand are the largest importers, while the US (State of Hawaii), Australia, Mexico, Vietnam, Thailand, and India are the major exporters.\nWay forward\n\nToday, the required expertise, know-how, and adequate sources of radiation are available in India for setting up advanced radiation processing facilities.\n\nThe much-needed enabling legislations are in place. The government is also encouraging private entrepreneurs to set up radiation processing plants to improve food processing infrastructure in the country.\n\nThe radiation technology has immense potential in reducing post-harvest losses of food. The installation and operation of adequate numbers of food irradiation facilities with required logistics and infrastructures across the country have enough potential to save monetary loss associated with food wastage.\n\nThe global trade and consumer acceptance of irradiated food has shown favorable trends.

Similar to constructing bricks, they come in a variety of sizes and shapes.\n\nLiving organisms are made up of cells of different shapes and sizes. In addition, it gives structure to the body and converts nutrients into energy.\n\nThe first live cell was observed and described by Anton Von Leeuwenhoek. The nucleus was later discovered by Robert Brown. All the cell\u2019s structural features were revealed thanks to the advent of the microscope and its advancement into the electron microscope.\n\nTypes of Cell\n\nCells and thus organisms can be categorized as eukaryotic or prokaryotic depending on whether they include or lack a membrane-bound nucleus and other organelles.\n\nProkaryotic Cells\nProkaryotic cells are those without a membrane-bound nucleus.\nProkaryotic cells are single-celled microorganisms that are thought to be the oldest on the planet.\nBacteria, blue-green algae, mycoplasma, and PPLO (Pleuro Pneumonia Like Organisms) are examples of prokaryotic cells.\nThey typically have a smaller size and reproduce more quickly.\nThey could have a wide range of sizes and shapes.\nWith the exception of mycoplasma, prokaryotes have a cell wall that surrounds the cell membrane.\nA prokaryotic cell has a single membrane, all reactions take place in the cytoplasm.\nNo distinct nucleus is present.\nThe genetic material is essentially naked because it is not surrounded by a nuclear membrane.\nThe genetic material is contained on a single chromosome.\nLysosomes, chloroplasts, Golgi bodies, and mitochondria are not present.\nRibosomes are connected to the cell\u2019s plasma membrane in prokaryotes. Ribosomes responsible for protein synthesis\nThe cell wall determines the shape of the cell and provides strong structural support to prokaryotes. And to prevent the bacterium from bursting or collapsing.\nProkaryotes are distinguished by a specific type of differentiated cell membrane called a mesosome. In essence, they are infoldings of the cell membranes.\nThe term \u201ccapsule\u201d refers to the outer protective layer that bacteria have in addition to their cell walls. It aids in the retention of moisture, guards against cell engulfment, and aids in the clinging of cells to surfaces and nutrients.\nProkaryotic cells store extra material as inclusion bodies in the cytoplasm. Phosphate granules, cyanophycean granules, and glycogen granules are a few examples of those that are not bound by any membrane systems and are found floating freely in the cytoplasm.\nThey reproduce asexually through binary fission.\nFurther membrane expansions into the cytoplasm called chromatophores, which contain pigments, are seen in some prokaryotes such as cyanobacteria.\nEukaryotic Cells\nEukaryotic cells have a well-organized nucleus surrounded by a nuclear envelope.\nProtists, plants, animals, and fungi are all considered to be eukaryotes.\nThe existence of membrane-bound organelles results in considerable compartmentalization of cytoplasm in eukaryotic cells.\nEukaryotic cells feature a wide range of intricate cytoskeletal and locomotory structures.\n\u00a0The genetic material in their bodies is organized into chromosomes.\nNot every eukaryotic cell is the same. Plant cells differ from animal cells in that they have a cellwall, plastids, and a huge central vacuole, which are all absent in animal cells.\nThey can reproduce asexually or sexually.\nA process known as mitosis divides the cells.\nDifference Between Eukaryotic cell and Prokaryotic cell\nBasis of comparison\n\t\nProkaryotes\n\t\nEukaryotes\n\n\nCell Type\n\t\nThese cells are exclusively unicellular.\n\t\nEukaryotic cells can be unicellular or multicellular in nature.\n\n\nSize of the cell\n\t\nThe typical range of a cell\u2019s diameter is between 0.2 and 2.0 micrometers.\n\t\nEukaryotic cells have a diameter of 10 to 100 micrometers.\n\n\nCell Wall\n\t\nProkaryotic cells have a cell wall, which is complex and multi-faceted.\n\t\nCell walls are extremely rare in eukaryotic cells, and when they do exist, they are of a simple chemical nature.\n\n\nCytoplasm\n\t\nCytoplasm is found in prokaryotic cells but is absent from the majority of cell organelles.\n\t\nIt is made up of both cytoplasm and organelles in eukaryotic cells.\n\n\nNucleus\n\t\nThis cell\u2019s actual nucleus is lacking; instead, nucleotides are present.\n\t\nIt has a real nucleus.\n\n\nRibosomes\n\t\nThere are ribosomes, but they are tiny and spherical in shape.\n\t\nAlthough ribosomes are present, they have a large and linear form.\n\n\nDNA Arrangements\n\t\nDNA is structured in a circular pattern.\n\t\nDNA has a linear structure.\n\n\nMitochondria\n\t\n\nThere are no mitochondria.\n\n.\n\n\t\nMitochondria are present, which is a cell\u2019s powerhouse\n\n\nLysosomes, Endoplasmic Reticulum, and centromeres\n\t\nThere are no lysosomes, endoplasmic reticulum, or centromeres.\n\t\nLysosomes, centromeres, and the endoplasmic reticulum are all present.\n\n\nPlasmid\n\t\nIn prokaryotes, plasmids are typically present.\n\t\nPlasmids are extremely rare in eukaryotes.\n\n\nCell Division\n\t\nBinary fission is the method used in cell division.\n\t\nMitosis is a process for cell division.\n\n\nFlagella\n\t\nFlagella are tiny in size.\n\t\nLarge flagella are present.\n\n\nReproduction\n\t\nOnly asexual reproduction takes place in these cells.\n\t\nReproduction is asexual as well as sexual.\n\n\nExamples\n\t\nExamples include bacteria and archaea.\n\t\nExamples include cells from plants and animals.\nCell Organelles\n\nA cell organelle is a subcellular structure that, like an organ in the body, has one or more specific tasks to carry out within the cell. The nucleus, mitochondria, and ribosomes are a few of the more significant cell organelles.\n\nThese cell organelles comprise both membrane and non-membrane-bound organelles that exist within cells and have diverse shapes and functions. They collaborate effectively and work together to support the cell\u2019s normal operation. \u00a0 The cell has a variety of organelles that are divided into three groups based on whether or not they have a membrane.\n\nOrganelles without membranes: Non-membrane-bound cell organelles include the cell wall, ribosomes, and cytoskeleton. They can be found in both eukaryotic and prokaryotic cells.\n\nOrganelles with a single membrane-bound: vacuole, lysosome, Golgi apparatus, and endoplasmic reticulum are single membrane-bound organelles\n\nDouble membrane-bound organelles:\u00a0 the nucleus, mitochondria, and chloroplast, which are double membrane-bound organelles, which are present in the eukaryotic cell only.\n\nLet\u2019s now examine specific cell organelles to learn more about their structure and functions.\n\nCell Membrane\n\nThe plasma membrane is another name for the cell membrane.\n\nThe cell\u2019s plasma membrane is its outermost layer, separating its interior from the outside world.\n\nThe cell membrane is made up of lipids organized in a bilayer. The membrane\u2019s lipid component is primarily composed of phosphoglycerides.\n\nThe movement of molecules through the plasma membrane is one of its key activities. The membrane is selectively permeable to some molecules present on either side of it. Neutral solutes can pass across the membrane through the process of simple diffusion down the concentration gradient, or from a higher concentration to a lower concentration.\n\nCell Wall\n\nThe cell wall is a non-living hard structure that produces an exterior coating for the plasma membrane of fungi and plants. The cell wall not only gives the cell structure and safeguards it from mechanical harm and infection, but it also facilitates cell-to-cell communication and acts as a barrier to unwanted macromolecules.\nThe cell wall is absent in animals.\n\nCytoplasm\n\nIt is the jelly-like material situated between the nucleus and the cell membrane. The liquid substance that makes up the plasma membrane is called cytoplasm.\nSeveral specialized cell organelles are also present.\n\n\u00a0\n\nCytoskeleton\n\nThe term \u201ccytoskeleton\u201d refers to an intricate web of proteinaceous filaments that are found in the cytoplasm. A cell\u2019s cytoskeleton performs a variety of tasks, including movement, mechanical support, and maintaining the shape of the cell.\n\nNucleus\n\nEvery eukaryotic cell has a double-membraned organelle called the nucleus. It is the largest organelle and serves as the command center for cellular operations as well as the Genetic repository for the cell.\n\nBy structure, the nucleus is dark, spherical, and surrounded by a nuclear membrane. It is a porous membrane-like cell membrane and forms a boundary between the cytoplasm and nucleus.\n\nNucleolus, or tiny spherical entities, are found inside the nucleus.\n\nIt also contains chromosomes, a crucial component. Genes are vital biological structures that are carried by chromosomes, which are delicate, thread-like structures.\n\nIn organisms, genes function as a genetic unit, assisting in the transmission of features from one generation to another. As a result, the nucleus manages the traits and operations of our body\u2019s cells.\n\nUsing the genetic information contained in DNA, the nucleus\u2019 main job is to keep track of cellular functions like metabolism and growth.\n\nRNA and protein synthesis in the nucleus is carried out by nucleoli. Nucleoli are spherical structures found in the nucleoplasm.\n\nMitochondria\n\nMitochondria are the sites of aerobic respiration.\n\nThey are referred to as the \u201cpowerhouses\u201d of the cell since they generate cellular energy in the form of ATP.\n\nThe mitochondrion is a double membrane-bound structure with the outside and inner membranes distinctively partitioning its lumen into two aqueous compartments, namely the outer and inner compartments.\n\nThe matrix is the name of the inside compartment. The continuous limiting boundary of the organelle is formed by the outer membrane.\n\nThe cristae are a series of infoldings that the inner membrane forms as it moves toward the matrix. The surface area is increased by the cristae. Each of the two membranes has unique enzymes related to mitochondrial activity.\n\n\u00a0\n\nThe Endoplasmic Reticulum\n\nThe endoplasmic reticulum (ER) is a network or reticulum of minute tubular structures dispersed throughout the cytoplasm. They are the cell\u2019s transport system and are responsible for moving materials around the cell.\n\nHence, the ER separates the intracellular space into two different compartments, namely the luminal (inside the ER) and extraluminal (cytoplasm) compartments.\n\nThe endoplasmic reticulum\u2019s variations include:\n\nRough Endoplasmic Reticulum (RER): Rough endoplasmic reticulum refers to endoplasmic reticulum with ribosomes on its surfaces. RER is typically seen in cells that are actively producing and secreting proteins. They overlap the outer membrane of the nucleus and are thick and continuous.\n\nSmooth Endoplasmic Reticulum (SER): Smooth endoplasmic reticulum seems smooth surface when there are no ribosomes present. The principal location for lipid synthesis is the smooth endoplasmic reticulum. Steroid hormones that resemble lipids are produced in animal cells by the SER.\n\nRibosomes\n\nRibosomes are significant cytoplasmic organelles that are not membrane-bound and are found in close proximity to the endoplasmic reticulum. Either the endoplasmic reticulum encloses ribosomes or they are freely dispersed throughout the cytoplasm of the cell.\n\nThey are made of proteins and ribonucleic acid (RNA). Protein synthesis, which ensures the life of the cell, is the primary function of the ribosomes in all live cells.\n\n\u00a0\n\nGolgi Apparatus\n\nIt is a membrane-bound organelle made up primarily of cisternae, which are a series of flattened, stacked pouches. The number of cisternae in a Golgi complex varies. Transporting, altering, and packing proteins and lipids to specific locations are the main duties of this cell organelle.\n\nThe Golgi apparatus is a key location of glycoprotein and glycolipid synthesis.\n\nLysosomes\n\nThey are membrane-bound vesicular structures that are the result of the Golgi apparatus\u2019s packaging process. It has been discovered that the isolated lysosomal vesicles are extremely rich in nearly all hydrolytic enzyme types (hydrolases \u2013 lipases, proteases, and carbohydrates), which are most active at the acidic pH. These enzymes can break down lipids, proteins, carbohydrates, and nucleic acids.\n\nIt helps to digest dead and damaged cells, aids in digestion, and eliminates waste. As a result, it is also known as \u201csuicidal bags\u201d.\n\n\u00a0\n\nVacuoles\n\nThe membrane-bound area in the cytoplasm is known as the vacuole.\n\nIt contains water, sap, excretory product, and other components that are not beneficial to the cell. Vacuoles eventually dispose of the waste products. As a result, the rest of the cell is safe from contamination.\n\nTonoplast is the name of the solitary membrane that surrounds the vacuole.\nThe number and size of vacuoles differ between animal and plant cells.\n\nThe vacuoles in plant cells are larger than those in animal cells. In plant cells, vacuoles have the potential to occupy up to 90% of the total cell volume.\n\nPlastids\n\nEvery plant cell, including euglenoids, contains plastids. They may be seen clearly under a microscope due to their size. They carry particular pigments, which give the plants particular colors.\u00a0 Chloroplasts, chromoplasts, and leucoplasts are three different types of plastids.\n\nChloroplasts: Chlorophyll and carotenoids are pigments found in chloroplasts, which are in charge of absorbing light energy necessary for photosynthesis.\n\nMoreover, the chloroplasts are double membrane-bound. The inner chloroplast membrane is considerably less permeable than the outer membrane. The stroma is the area of the chloroplast that is constrained by its inner membrane.\n\nA group of organized flattened membrane sacs are called thylakoids.\n\nThylakoids are stacked like collections of coins, which are called grana, or intergranular thylakoids.\n\nMoreover, stroma lamellae are flat membranous tubules that connect the thylakoids of the various grana.\u00a0 A region known as the lumen is enclosed by the thylakoids\u2019 membrane. The stroma of the chloroplast includes enzymes essential for glucose and protein synthesis. Ribosomes and tiny, circular, double-stranded DNA molecules are also present in chloroplast. In the thylakoids, chlorophyll pigments are found.\n\nChromoplasts: The chromoplasts include fat-soluble carotenoid pigments like carotene, xanthophylls, and others. This imparts a yellow, orange, or red color to the plant portion.\n\nLeucoplasts: The leucoplasts are nutrient-stored, colorless plastids of various sizes and forms. Amyloplasts store carbs (starch), such as potatoes, whereas elaioplasts and aleuroplasts store oils and fats, and proteins, respectively.\n\nCilia and Flagella\n\nCilia and flagella are outgrowths of the cell membrane that resemble hair. The movement of the cell or the surrounding fluid is induced by cilia.\u00a0 Comparatively longer flagella are in charge of cell motility. Although prokaryotic bacteria have flagella, they differ structurally from eukaryotic flagella.\n\nThe axoneme, the core of the Cilia and flagella, has many microtubules that run parallel to the long axis.\n\nNine doublets of radially oriented peripheral microtubules and two centrally positioned microtubules typically make up an axoneme.\n\nThe peripheral doublets\u2019 tubules are connected to one another by radial spokes, and the central tubules are connected by bridges and surrounded by a central sheath.. The cilium and flagellum both emerge from basal bodies, which are centriole-like structures.\n\nCentrosome and Centrioles\n\nThe centrosome organelle is made up of two centrioles, which are mutually perpendicular structures. Each centriole is made up of nine tubulin protein peripheral fibrils that are evenly spaced apart and are made up of interconnected triplets.\n\nThe hub, or central portion of the centriole, is made of protein. The hub joins the peripheral fibrils via a protein-based radial spoke.\n\nDuring cell division, the centrioles from the basal bodies of the cilia and flagella give rise to spindle fibres.\n\nMicrobodies\n\nBoth plant and animal cells contain numerous membrane-bound tiny vesicles called microbodies that contain various enzymes.\n\nPlant Cells and Animal Cell\n\nPlants play the role of producers in an ecosystem, whereas animals play the role of consumers. As a result, both their cell structure and everyday tasks and roles are variable. Animals and plants have several cell organelles, which are usually categorized according to their functions. The distinction between plant and animal cells is due to the differences in the cell composition of each.\n\nWhile certain cell organelles are specific to either plant or animal cells, others are present in both types. The majority of higher species on earth, including all plants and animals, are eukaryotes. Hence, these cells have some characteristics that are usually found in eukaryotes.\n\nMembrane-bound organelles including the endoplasmic reticulum, mitochondria, the nucleus, the Golgi apparatus, and lysosomes are present in both plant and animal cells. Moreover, a plant cell may be bigger than an animal cell. Animal cells typically range in size from 10 to 30 micrometers, while plant cells typically range in size from 10 to 100 micrometers.\n\nPlant Cell\n\n\u00a0\n\nThe majority of the plant kingdom is made up of multicellular, autotrophic eukaryotes. Moreover. Plant cells can be distinguished from animal cells by their organelles, such as the chloroplast, cell wall, and vacuole.\n\nThe size of plant cells typically ranges from 10 to 100 m.\n\nThe process of photosynthesis is carried out by plant cells. Green plants are hence referred to as autotrophs. It is carried out as a result of chlorophyll being present in the chloroplast of plant cells. The cell wall, which gives the stability and stiffness of the cell, is made of cellulose.\n\nPlant cells serve as the basic building blocks of plant life and carry out all vital functions. The process of producing food through photosynthesis happens in the chloroplasts of the cell. Some examples of specialized plant cells include the following:\n\nCollenchyma cells: Elongated living cells with asymmetrical, thick primary walls make up collenchyma cells. Like plants, they have the ability to alter their shape and expand. The ability of collenchyma cells to stretch and hence respond to increased organ growth is a crucial characteristic.\n\nSclerenchyma cells: The sclerenchyma cells are more rigid. They serve as the main sources of support in plant locations that have ceased to grow. Sclerenchyma cells that have reached maturity are frequently dead cells with thicker secondary walls. They also have a high cellulose content (60\u201380%), which helps plants by providing support structurally.\n\nParenchyma cells: The majority of plant tissues, including the soft tissue found in leaves, fruit pulp, and other plant organs, are made up of simple permanent ground tissues known as parenchyma cells. They carry out metabolic functions, cellular respiration, and photosynthesis in leaves. Moreover, they help plants repair by storing substances like proteins and carbs.\nXylem cells: This tissue helps move water and chemically dissolved substances throughout the plant. Some xylem components include tracheids, vessels, xylem parenchyma, and xylem fibers. Water and dissolved minerals are transported by the plant\u2019s xylem from the roots to the leaves.\n\nPhloem cells: These cells transport nutrients made by photosynthesis to every part of the plant. Phloem carries amino acids and sugars that have been dissolved in water. Food is moved from the leaves to the roots through the phloem.\n\nAnimal Cell\n\nThe Kingdom Animalia contains three-fourths of all species on the planet. Animal cells are distinguished from plant cells primarily by the absence of the cell wall and chloroplast. Animal cells cannot make their own food, which is the main difference between them and plant cells. The three main parts of the majority of animal cells are the cytoplasm, cell membrane, and nucleus.\n\nMany kinds of animal cells include:\n\nSkin cells: The dermal and epidermal layers of the skin contain these cells. These cells are efficient in stopping water loss and acting as a barrier to the outside world.\n\nBone cells: The development of an animal\u2019s skeleton and bones is carried out by bone cells. In order to maintain balance and ultimately regulate the bone structure and function, bone cells communicate with one another. They aid in body movement as well.\n\nMuscle cells: These help to safeguard the body\u2019s sensory organs. When they are grouped together, they can assist in organizing the movement of your limbs and tissues.\n\nBlood cells: These cells transmit hormones and nutrients throughout the body. They use the bloodstream to carry oxygen around the body.\n\nNerve cells: Nerve cells are specialized cells that have been wired to carry information or impulses. Neurons are brain cells that transmit and receive signals. They are also referred to as nerve cells. Each nerve cell is made up of the cell body, which includes the nucleus, a main branching fiber (axon), and multiple smaller branching fibers (dendrites).\n\nDifference between Plant Cell and Animal Cell\nBasis of comparison\n\t\nPlant Cell\n\t\nAnimal Cell\n\n\nDefinition\n\t\nThese are eukaryotic cells with a real nucleus and specialized components called organelles that carry out particular tasks.\n\t\nIt is a form of a eukaryotic cell with a genuine, membrane-bound nucleus and other cellular components but no cell wall.\n\n\nSize\n\t\nFixed-size, which tends to be bigger.

Some cells function as independent entities, while others are a component of multicellular organisms. The same four major types of organic molecules\u2014nucleic acids, proteins, carbohydrates, and lipids\u2014make up every cell in the body.\n\nAs a result of early evolutionary processes, cells can also be divided into two main groups: prokaryotes, which have cytoplasmic genomes, and eukaryotes, which have nuclear-encased genomes and other membrane-bound organelles.\n\nCells have evolved into a huge diversity of forms and sizes despite their modest size. Together, they create the tissues that in turn create the organs and ultimately the entire organism.\n\nTo more such notes Click here\n\nArticle written by: Aryadevi E S",

Read further to know more.\n\nThe monetization of space technology has expanded with the involvement of the private sector in the space race.\n\nThe Indian Space Research Organization intends to create a unique spaceship that will transport people to and from space.\n\nA business named Blue Origin just finished the online auction for the first seat on the New Shephard rocket system, which is intended to transport visitors into space.\n\nTable of Contents\n\nWhat is Space Tourism?\nSignificance\nThe future of space tourism\nConcerns\nWhat is New Shephard?\nPrivate space tourism projects\nAdvantages of Space tourism missions\nIndian Efforts\nWhat is IN-Space?\nIndia and Global Space Tourism\nWay Forward\nWhat is Space Tourism?\n\nSpace tourism refers to the commercial activity of sending private individuals, often referred to as space tourists, into space for recreational, leisure, or adventure purposes.\n\nWhile space exploration has traditionally been the domain of government agencies like NASA and Roscosmos, the emerging space tourism industry aims to make space travel accessible to private citizens.\n\nSuborbital space tourism involves brief journeys beyond Earth\u2019s atmosphere, allowing passengers to experience a few minutes of weightlessness and see the curvature of the Earth.\nOrbital space tourism, on the other hand, entails longer journeys, potentially involving stays aboard space stations.\n\nPreparation for space tourists:\n\n\ud83d\udc49 Which year are YOU targeting for success in the IAS/IPS/IFS Exam? \ud83d\ude80\n\n(1) \u21d2 UPSC 2025: Prelims cum Mains\n\n(2) \u21d2 UPSC 2026: Prelims cum Mains\n\n(3) \u21d2 UPSC 2027 Prelims cum Mains\n\nTip: Know more about ClearIAS Courses (Online/Offline)\n\nDuring the flight and the landing, passengers must be cushioned and protected from strong acceleration. To handle weightlessness, the cabin needs to be pressurized, and all furniture needs to be fastened.\nTo shield the craft from heat produced by friction, insulation is needed.\n\nSpace tourism has generated significant public interest and media attention. Successful test flights and high-profile events, such as the suborbital flights of billionaires Jeff Bezos and Richard Branson, have contributed to raising awareness about the possibilities of commercial space travel.\n\nSignificance\n\nThe following are the significance of space tourism.\n\nHuge Market: The anticipated market size for these flights is 2.4 million people.\n\nThe base for Testing: By greatly reducing travel time, it can serve as a base for testing supersonic travel between various locations on Earth. Additionally, it signals the entrance of the private sector into this field.\n\nSeveral private companies have entered the space tourism industry, aiming to offer commercial spaceflights. Prominent examples include Blue Origin, founded by Amazon\u2019s Jeff Bezos, and Virgin Galactic, founded by Sir Richard Branson. These companies have developed spacecraft designed to carry paying customers on suborbital journeys.\n\nThe future of space tourism\n\nWealthy adventure travelers may soon have access to space tourism. For instance, Virgin Galactic has received over 500 early reservations for the VSS Unity for $250,000.\n\nTo put it into perspective, people pay $50,000 to climb Everest as part of package excursions with guides, trainers, and devoted Sherpa teams.\n\nThe future of space tourism holds the promise of increased competition, reduced costs, and expanded offerings. Companies are exploring advancements in technology, infrastructure, and customer experience to make space tourism a more commonplace and accessible activity.\n\nBeyond suborbital flights, there are visions for more ambitious space tourism endeavors, including orbital hotels, lunar tourism, and journeys to destinations beyond Earth\u2019s orbit. These concepts remain in the realm of future possibilities but highlight the potential evolution of the space tourism industry.\n\nConcerns\n\nThe environmental impact of space tourism, particularly in terms of rocket emissions, is a topic of discussion. As the industry grows, there is increasing emphasis on developing environmentally friendly propulsion technologies and sustainable practices.\n\nClimate Change: Unlike soot or black carbon found in the lower atmosphere, soot or black carbon resulting from rocket exhaust accumulates in the stratosphere (about 5 to 31 miles above the Earth). Black carbon may stay in the stratosphere for years as a result, accelerating climate change.\n\nHealth: There may be issues with passengers\u2019 health due to the possibility of motion sickness and disorientation, which can impair eyesight, cognition, balance, and motor control.\n\nChallenges with the entry of private players:\u00a0Private organizations frequently concentrate on relatively specialized technologies with immediate gratification. Publicly funded national space organizations that did not seek out quick gains have contributed to development in a wide range of fields, including contemporary communications, geolocation systems, renewable energy use, weather forecasting, etc.\n\nWhat is New Shephard?\nThe spaceport of New Shephard, which bears the name of the first American astronaut Alan Shephard, offers payload space and flights to orbits more than 100 kilometers above the planet.\nIt is a rocket system developed to carry people and scientific payloads past the Karman line.\nAccess to space for activities like academic research, business technology development, and entrepreneurial endeavors, among others, is intended to be made simpler and more affordable.\nBy launching them 100 kilometers above the Earth, it will also enable space visitors to experience microgravity.\nWhen anything or someone appears to be weightless, this is known as microgravity. Astronauts and things floating in space exhibit the effects of microgravity.\nPrivate space tourism projects\nVirgin Galactic, Blue Origin, and SpaceX\u2014three significant private companies\u2014made huge investments in space ventures.\nSix people on the VSS Unity spacecraft just departed from New Mexico, traveled 85 kilometers away from Earth, and then returned.\nThe online auction for the first seat on the New Shephard rocket system was recently finished by Blue Origin, the space business founded by the founder of Amazon.\nEven Mars is a goal for SpaceX. The International Space Station (ISS) is already stocked with SpaceX rockets, which also ferry astronauts there and back.\nAdvantages of Space tourism missions\nThe construction materials and design aspects could be applied to safety features in automobiles and high-speed trains.\nThe removal of space debris might provide another set of advantages. The current Artemis Accords and the 1976 Space Registration Convention both advocate for removing space junk. The presence of wealthy visitors will heighten the sense of urgency.\nIndian Efforts\n\nThe first Gaganyaan manned mission, primarily a research mission to show an indigenous capability to conduct human space flight missions, has not yet been launched, and space tourism in India has been long delayed.\n\nIf all test missions are successful, the human mission is planned to launch between 2024 and 2025.\n\nFor the time being, space tourism is a pipe dream that ISRO must first make a reality by completing the Gaganyaan program flawlessly and through many iterations, developing and successfully launching a reusable rocket designed for tourist transportation, and ensuring that all systems are reliable, affordable, and economically viable.\n\nAround 2028, it\u2019s expected that Indian space travel would be economically feasible. We will have to wait and see what happens till then.\n\nWhat is IN-Space?\n\nThe Department of Space of the Indian government is the single-window independent organization known as the Indian National Space Promotion and Authorization Center (IN-SPACe). The Center coordinates and manages India\u2019s space operations.\n\nIN-SPACe will work as a link between ISRO and private sector companies to establish \u201chow effectively to exploit India\u2019s space resources and enhance space-based activity.\u201d\n\nThe center will evaluate the demands of private sector companies, including educational institutions, in cooperation with ISRO, and attempt to suit those demands.\n\nAccording to Sivan, the decisions made by the center would apply to both ISRO and private-sector firms. Previously, ISRO oversaw the space sector, but it will now focus on its core mandate of research and development.\n\nIndia and Global Space Tourism\n\nThe space tourism market has boomed in recent years, with commercial aerospace companies dominating it. The Dragon space spacecraft from SpaceX, which was founded by billionaire Elon Musk, is the industry leader in space tourism because of its ability to transport visitors through zero gravity.\n\nAnother significant rival in the market is the New Shepard spacecraft from Jeff Bezos\u2019 Blue Origin, which launches from West Texas and takes people on quick joyrides to space. The flights give the visitors a view of Earth from above and last for around ten minutes.\n\nAlso, read about Space Internet.\n\nWay Forward\n\nConsiderations for health, comfort, and safety are essential. Before visitors travel to space, training, medical exams, and liability waivers will need to be reviewed.\n\nAlthough it will only represent a minor portion of the market, space tourism will benefit the entire New Space sector.\n\nWhen space travel does become commonplace, it will also have a favorable effect on many socioeconomic aspects of Earth\u2019s society, including the development of new solar-powered energy infrastructure and the creation of jobs.\n\nAlso read:\u00a0Space missions in 2024\n\nArticle Written by: Remya",

    "[CONTENT] #243": "What is the atomic theory? How have different atomic theories evolved over time? Read further to know more.\n\nAtomic theory is the scientific explanation of the structure and behavior of atoms, the basic building blocks of matter.\n\nThe modern atomic theory was developed over the course of several centuries by scientists from around the world, including John Dalton, J.J. Thomson, Ernest Rutherford, Niels Bohr, and many others.\n\nTable of Contents\n\nStructure of an Atom\nProton\nNeutron\nElectron\nApplications\nAtomic Theories\nThe Greek Philosophers (400-500 BC)\nJohn Dalton\u2019s Atomic Theory (1803)\nJ.

Atoms are made up of three types of subatomic particles: protons, neutrons, and electrons. The protons and neutrons are located in the nucleus at the center of the atom, while the electrons orbit around the nucleus in shells or energy levels.\n\nProton\n\nProtons are positively charged particles with a mass of approximately 1 atomic mass unit (amu). They are located in the nucleus of the atom and are responsible for giving the atom its positive charge. The number of protons in an atom\u2019s nucleus determines its atomic number, which defines the element.\n\nNeutron\n\nNeutrons are neutral particles with a mass of approximately 1 amu. Like protons, they are located in the nucleus of the atom. The number of neutrons in an atom\u2019s nucleus can vary, and atoms of the same element can have different numbers of neutrons. These different forms of the same element are called isotopes.\n\nElectron\n\nElectrons are negatively charged particles with a mass of approximately 0.0005 amu. They orbit around the nucleus in shells or energy levels. The electrons in the outermost shell, or valence shell, determine the chemical behavior of the atom. Atoms with incomplete valence shells tend to react with other atoms to complete their shells, resulting in the formation of chemical bonds.\n\n\ud83d\udc49 Which year are YOU targeting for success in the IAS/IPS/IFS Exam? \ud83d\ude80\n\n(1) \u21d2 UPSC 2025: Prelims cum Mains\n\n(2) \u21d2 UPSC 2026: Prelims cum Mains\n\n(3) \u21d2 UPSC 2027 Prelims cum Mains\n\nTip: Know more about ClearIAS Courses (Online/Offline)\n\nThe number of electrons in an atom is equal to the number of protons, giving the atom a neutral charge overall. Electrons are held in their orbits by the electrostatic attraction between their negative charge and the positive charge of the protons in the nucleus.\n\nApplications\n\nThe knowledge about atoms and atomic structure can be applied in many ways, from developing new materials with specific properties to designing more efficient energy systems.\n\nIn addition, the study of atomic structure has also led to the development of advanced technologies, such as nuclear power and medical imaging. Nuclear power plants harness the energy released by nuclear reactions, which involve the splitting of atoms into smaller particles.\n\nMedical imaging technologies, such as positron emission tomography (PET) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), use the behavior of atoms in the body to produce detailed images of internal structures.\n\nAtomic Theories\n\nThe atomic theory has evolved over time as new discoveries and advancements were made in the field of science.\n\nThe Greek Philosophers (400-500 BC)\n\nThe earliest atomic theory was proposed by the Greek philosophers Democritus and Leucippus. They suggested that all matter was made up of tiny, indivisible particles called atoms.\n\nJohn Dalton\u2019s Atomic Theory (1803)\n\nJohn Dalton\u2019s atomic theory, proposed in 1803, was a significant milestone in the development of atomic theory. Here are the main points of his theory:\n\nElements are composed of tiny, indivisible particles called atoms.\nAll atoms of a given element are identical in mass and properties, but atoms of different elements have different properties.\nChemical reactions involve the combination, separation, or rearrangement of atoms. In a chemical reaction, atoms are not created or destroyed, only rearranged.\nCompounds are formed when atoms of different elements combine in fixed ratios to form molecules.\nAtoms have a definite mass, and they combine in simple, whole-number ratios to form compounds.\n\nDalton\u2019s theory provided a scientific explanation for the observed patterns of chemical reactions and the behavior of matter. It also paved the way for further discoveries, such as the discovery of subatomic particles and the development of the periodic table.\n\nHowever, Dalton\u2019s theory was not entirely accurate. For example, it assumed that atoms were indivisible, which was later disproven by the discovery of subatomic particles such as protons, neutrons, and electrons. Nevertheless, his theory was a significant step in the development of atomic theory, and it laid the foundation for further advancements in the field.\n\nJ. Thomson\u2019s Discovery of Electrons (1897)\n\nIn 1897, J.J. Thomson discovered the electron, a subatomic particle with a negative charge. This discovery revolutionized our understanding of the atomic structure and laid the foundation for further advancements in atomic theory.\n\nThomson used a cathode ray tube to conduct his experiments. He observed that a cathode ray (a beam of electrons) would move from the negative electrode (cathode) to the positive electrode (anode) in the tube. He discovered that the cathode ray was composed of negatively charged particles, which he called electrons.\n\nThomson proposed the plum pudding model of the atom, which suggested that the atom was a positively charged sphere with negatively charged electrons embedded within it, much like raisins in a plum pudding. This model was the first to suggest that the atom was not indivisible and paved the way for further research into the atomic structure.\n\nThomson\u2019s discovery of the electron and his plum pudding model of the atom provided a significant contribution to the understanding of atomic structure. However, his model was later disproven by the results of Ernest Rutherford\u2019s gold foil experiment, which provided evidence for the existence of a positively charged nucleus at the center of the atom.\n\nErnest Rutherford\u2019s Gold Foil Experiment (1911)\n\nErnest Rutherford\u2019s Gold Foil Experiment, conducted in 1911, provided evidence for the existence of a positively charged nucleus at the center of the atom, which revolutionized our understanding of atomic structure.\n\nRutherford and his colleagues fired a beam of alpha particles (positively charged particles) at a thin sheet of gold foil. They expected the alpha particles to pass straight through the foil or to be slightly deflected due to the positive charge of the gold atoms.\n\nHowever, they observed that some alpha particles were deflected at large angles, and some even bounced back in the direction from which they had come. This unexpected result suggested that the gold atom was not a uniform sphere, as previously believed, but rather had a positively charged nucleus at its center, which deflected the alpha particles.\n\nRutherford\u2019s experiment provided the first experimental evidence for the existence of the atomic nucleus and confirmed the previous observations made by J.J. Thomson about the negatively charged electrons in the atom. He proposed a new atomic model, known as the Rutherford atomic model, which suggested that the atom was mostly empty space with electrons orbiting the positively charged nucleus.\n\nNiels Bohr\u2019s Model (1913)\n\nThe Bohr model is a simplified model of the atom that was proposed by Danish physicist Niels Bohr in 1913. The model is based on the idea that electrons orbit the nucleus of an atom in circular paths, or \u201cshells\u201d, at fixed energy levels.\n\nBohr proposed that electrons can only exist in certain allowed energy levels or \u201cshells\u201d, and that when an electron moves from a lower energy level to a higher energy level, it absorbs energy, and when it moves from a higher energy level to a lower energy level, it releases energy in the form of electromagnetic radiation.\n\nThe model also introduced the concept of quantization, meaning that energy can only be absorbed or emitted in discrete, quantized amounts. This was a major breakthrough in understanding the behavior of electrons in an atom, and it laid the foundation for the further development of atomic and quantum theory.\n\nWhile the Bohr model is no longer considered an accurate representation of the atom\u2019s behavior, it remains an important historical model in the development of atomic theory and helped pave the way for further advances in the field.\n\nQuantum Mechanics (1920s)\n\nModern Atomic Theory, also known as quantum mechanics, is the current scientific theory that describes the behavior of atoms and subatomic particles. It is a result of the combination of the contributions of several scientists, including Max Planck, Albert Einstein, Niels Bohr, Werner Heisenberg, Erwin Schr\u00f6dinger, and others.\n\nHere are some of the key points of modern atomic theory:\n\nAtoms consist of a positively charged nucleus, which contains protons and neutrons, surrounded by negatively charged electrons in energy levels.\nSubatomic particles, such as electrons, have wave-particle duality, meaning they exhibit both particle-like and wave-like behavior.\nThe behavior of subatomic particles can be described by probability functions, rather than exact positions and movements.\nEnergy is transferred between subatomic particles through the emission or absorption of photons.\nThe behavior of subatomic particles is subject to the Heisenberg uncertainty principle, which states that it is impossible to determine both the position and momentum of a particle simultaneously with certainty.\nThe arrangement of electrons in an atom determines its chemical properties.\nThe properties of elements can be predicted by their position on the periodic table.\n\nModern atomic theory has helped us to understand and explain the behavior of matter on a microscopic scale. It has led to technological advancements in fields such as electronics, materials science, and medicine.\n\nConclusion\n\nIn summation, the atomic theory has advanced significantly since it was first proposed more than 2,000 years ago. Our knowledge of the atomic world has been molded by centuries of observation, experimentation, and innovation, from the early Greek philosophers who hypothesized the existence of atoms to the modern scientists who have developed complex models of atomic structure.\n\nArticle Written By: Priti Raj",

Acute respiratory distress syndrome, meningitis, encephalitis, and the aggravation of pre-existing medical conditions including asthma and cardiovascular disease are further consequences of infection.\n\nTable of Contents\n\nInfluenza Virus\nH3N2 Influenza Virus\nWhat are the symptoms of H3N2?\nH3N2 vs Coronavirus\nVaccines for influenza\nWHO Global Influenza Surveillance network\nH3N2 influenza in India\nConclusion\nInfluenza Virus\n\nInfluenza viruses, which cause the infectious disease known as flu, are of four different types: A, B, C, and D.\n\nInfluenza B virus (IBV) and Influenza C virus (ICV) primarily infect humans.\nInfluenza D virus (IDV) is found in cattle and pigs.\n\nInfluenza A is further classified into different subtypes and one of them is H3N2.\n\nAquatic and wild birds are the major source of the influenza A virus.\nIt can spread to mammals too, including pigs and humans.\nOccasionally, it is transmitted from wild to domestic birds, and this may cause severe disease, outbreaks, or human influenza pandemics.\n\nInfluenza A is an RNA virus. It is categorized into subtypes based on the type of two proteins on the surface of the viral envelope-\n\n\ud83d\udc49 Which year are YOU targeting for success in the IAS/IPS/IFS Exam? \ud83d\ude80\n\n(1) \u21d2 UPSC 2025: Prelims cum Mains\n\n(2) \u21d2 UPSC 2026: Prelims cum Mains\n\n(3) \u21d2 UPSC 2027 Prelims cum Mains\n\nTip: Know more about ClearIAS Courses (Online/Offline)\n\nH for hemagglutinin, a protein that causes red blood cells to agglutinate.\nN for neuraminidase, an enzyme that cleaves the glycosidic bonds of the monosaccharide sialic acid (previously called neuraminic acid).\n\nVarious hemagglutinin and neuraminidase proteins are encoded by multiple influenza viruses.\n\nFor instance, the type 5 hemagglutinin (H) and type 1 neuraminidase (N) proteins of the H5N1 virus define an influenza A subtype.\nTheoretically, 198 distinct combinations of these proteins are feasible given that there are 11 different forms of neuraminidase and 18 different types of hemagglutinin.\nH3N2 Influenza Virus\n\nThe influenza-causing virus subtype H3N2 (A/H3N2) is a subtype of influenza viruses.\n\nBoth birds and mammals can contract H3N2 viruses.\nThe virus has evolved into several strains in pigs, humans, and birds.\nHospitalizations are higher in years where H3N2 is the prevalent strain.\n\nThis virus is extremely contagious and spreads through droplets released by an infected person when coughing, sneezing, or talking.\n\nAccording to the International Health Regulations (IHR), a human infection caused by a novel influenza A virus subtype is an event that has the potential for high public health impact.\n\nA novel influenza A virus is considered to have the potential to cause a pandemic if-\n\nthe virus has demonstrated the capacity to infect and transmit efficiently among humans;\ndiffers from currently-circulating seasonal human influenza viruses such that the hemagglutinin (HA) gene (or protein) is not a mutated form of those, i.e. A/H1 or A/H3, circulating widely in the human population;\nthe population has little to no immunity against it.\n\nHuman infections with variant viruses tend to result in mild clinical illness, although some cases have been hospitalized with more severe disease. Nevertheless, human infections with these viruses need to be monitored closely.\n\nWhat are the symptoms of H3N2?\n\nIts symptoms are similar to that of any other flu.\n\nThey include cough, fever, body ache and headache, sore throat, a runny or stuffy nose, and extreme fatigue.\nNausea, vomiting, and diarrhea have been seen in very few cases.\n\nAccording to the Indian Medical Association (IMA), an infection caused by H3N2 generally lasts for five to seven days and the fever starts going away after three days. However, the coughing can persist for up to three weeks.\n\nAccording to the IMA, this virus typically preys on those under the age of 15 or over the age of 50.\n\nRisk factors include being a child, having co-morbid illnesses including asthma, diabetes, heart disease, a weaker immune system, and neurological or neurodevelopmental disorders.\nH3N2 vs Coronavirus\n\nCovid-19 and H3N2 influenza are both caused by contagious viruses. They can spread through droplets and can also mutate significantly.\n\nEven though both these respiratory illnesses are highly transmissible, they both belong to a different family of viruses.\nWhile COVID-19 is caused by the SARs-CoV-2 virus, H3N2 is one of the Influenza A subtypes circulating in humans.\nReportedly, the latter can lead to more cases of hospitalizations compared to other strains.\nThe time between infection to illness for the SARs-CoV-2 virus is said to vary from person to person and therefore, can range from 2 to 14 days.\nFor seasonal influenza, the incubation period may be much shorter than the incubation period for COVID. The time from infection to illness is about 1-4 days.\nVaccines for influenza\n\nThe basis for developing flu vaccines is forecasting which H1N1, H3N2, H1N2, and influenza B \u201cmutants\u201d will spread throughout the upcoming season.\n\nIn advance of their yearly epidemics, separate vaccinations are created for the Northern and Southern Hemispheres.\nThe seasonality of influenza is unclear in the tropics.\nH3N2 has tended to outpace H1N1, H1N2, and influenza B in prevalence during the previous 10 years.\n\nSeasonal H3N2 flu is a strain of H3N2 that affects humans and differs somewhat from one of the strains that circulated during the previous flu season.\n\nIntermittent outbreaks in East Asia and Southeast Asia give rise to seasonal influenza viruses, which spread before dying off.\n\nWHO Global Influenza Surveillance network\n\nIn 1952, the WHO Global Influenza Surveillance Network was created.\n\nThe network consists of 112 institutions in 83 countries that are recognized by WHO as WHO National Influenza Centers, as well as 4 WHO Collaborating Centers (WHO CCs) (NICs).\nThese NICs gather samples within their nation, carry out viral isolation from the start, and characterize the antigenic in the early stages.\nEach year, they send newly isolated strains to WHO CCs for high-level antigenic and genetic research.\nThe results of this study serve as the foundation for WHO recommendations on the components of the influenza vaccine for the Northern and Southern Hemispheres.\nH3N2 influenza in India\n\nUnion Health Ministry is keeping a close watch on the Seasonal Influenza situation in various States/UTs through the Integrated Disease Surveillance Programme (IDSP) network on a real-time basis.\n\nThe Ministry is also tracking and keeping a close watch on morbidity and mortality due to the H3N2 subtype of Seasonal Influenza.\n\nYoung children and old age persons with co-morbidities are the most vulnerable groups in the context of seasonal influenza.\n\nIn India, integrated surveillance of Influenza-like Illness (ILI) and Severe Acute Respiratory Illness (SARI) for the detection of the human influenza virus and SARS-COV-2 virus is ongoing through a structured ILI/SARI surveillance network of 28 sites.\n\nThe surveillance network is comprised of 27 DHR-ICMR\u2019s Virus Research & Diagnostic Laboratories and the country\u2019s National Influenza Centre (WHO-NIC) housed at ICMR-National Institute of Virology Pune, also a WHO Collaborating Centre for Global Influenza Surveillance & Response System (GISRS).\nConclusion\n\nSeasonal influenza like the H3N2 virus is an acute respiratory infection caused by influenza viruses that circulate in all parts of the world, and the cases are seen to increase during certain months globally.\n\nEvery year, India witnesses two peaks of seasonal influenza: one from Jan to March and another in the post-monsoon season. The cases arising from seasonal influenza are expected to decline from March end. State surveillance officers are therefore fully geared to meet this public health challenge.\n\nDue to the evolution of influenza viruses, WHO continues to stress the importance of global surveillance to detect virologic, epidemiologic, and clinical changes associated with circulating influenza viruses that may affect human (or animal) health with timely sharing of such viruses and related information for further characterization and risk assessment.\n\n-Article written by Swathi Satish",

Because they can only be seen under a microscope, these are referred to as microbes. These can both be beneficial and detrimental. Pathogens are the dangerous ones.\n\n\ud83d\udc49 Which year are YOU targeting for success in the IAS/IPS/IFS Exam? \ud83d\ude80\n\n(1) \u21d2 UPSC 2025: Prelims cum Mains\n\n(2) \u21d2 UPSC 2026: Prelims cum Mains\n\n(3) \u21d2 UPSC 2027 Prelims cum Mains\n\nTip: Know more about ClearIAS Courses (Online/Offline)\n\nThey fall into one of five groups: bacteria, viruses, fungi, protozoa, and some types of algae. Microorganisms can be multicellular, like many algae and fungi, or single-celled, like bacteria, some algae, and protozoa.\n\nThey exist inside the bodies of animals, including humans, and can live in a variety of environments. While some can live independently, others must grow on other organisms to survive.\n\nDiseases Caused By Microorganisms\nInfectious diseases can infiltrate the body and be brought on by a few dangerous microorganisms. They can contaminate food, leather, and textiles. They are to blame for illnesses like the flu, measles, chicken pox, TB, and others. Additionally, there is evidence from scientific studies that suggests microbes may be involved in several chronic, non-infectious diseases, including some types of cancer and coronary heart disease.\nInfections are the result of pathogen infiltration and growth inside a person. The condition is referred to as a disease when the infection negatively affects the person\u2019s bodily processes. Microorganisms need to get into our bodies to create an infection.\nThe portal of entry is the location where these penetrate the body. The skin, urogenital system, gastrointestinal tract, and respiratory tract can all serve as entry points.\nWhen an individual with common cold sneezes or coughs, hundreds of virus-laden droplets are released into the atmosphere. While breathing, these viruses can spread to a fit person\u2019s body and infect them.\nA house fly is an illustration of an animal that acts as a pathogen carrier. Pathogens adhere to the bodies of the flies when they rest on the garbage and animal excrement. Following that, these flies come into touch with exposed food and spread the pathogens there, contaminating the food.\nA person may contract an illness if they consume contaminated food. The female Anopheles mosquito is another illustration of a transmitter. It transmits Plasmodium, the parasite that causes malaria. The dengue virus is also carried by the female Aedes insect.\n\nLet\u2019s examine the diseases brought on by various microorganisms:\n\nRead: Brain-eating amoeba\n\nDiseases caused by bacteria\nProkaryotes, tiny one-celled organisms that thrive in a variety of habitats, are what bacteria are. They can exist in the bowels of humans, in the water, and inside the soil.\nThey can be distinguished from one another based on their structure, the composition of their cell walls, and genetic variations. Binary fission is a mechanism used by bacteria to reproduce.\nNot all microbes are dangerous. Only a small minority of them can spread illness.\nA person becomes infected by bacteria when their body begins to produce poisons. Antibiotics can be used to eliminate these germs.\nThe primary causes of bacterial infections are contaminated food and water. Most bacterial illnesses are contagious.\nDiseases caused by fungi\nFungi develop on the bodies in moist and humid areas.\nIt is responsible for causing diseases such as ringworm and athlete\u2019s foot.\nDiseases caused by viruses\nOnly the living cells of other animals can support the virus\u2018s tiny infectious agent replication. These are different and can only be spread by biological vectors. They can also affect plants, animals, and microorganisms.\nIt consists of a capsid, a protein casing, and a DNA or RNA genome. Some viruses are protected by an interior or external membrane. Enzymes needed for the generation of energy are missing.\nThey can only be seen under an artificial microscope because they are so tiny.\nIf they infiltrate someone, they take over that person\u2019s entire cellular structure. Using medicines won\u2019t be able to kill viruses.\nViral diseases are contagious and typically propagate through the air and direct contact.\n\nRead: Chandipura virus\n\nDiseases caused by protozoa\nThe Protozoa are a diverse group of unicellular eukaryotic creatures that eat other organisms as well as bacteria as food.\nProtozoal diseases can be fatal and extremely risky.\nAn illustration of a protozoa genus is an amoeba. It might result in amoebic diarrhoea. Malaria and sleeping sickness are both illnesses that are brought on by protozoa.\nZoonotic Microorganism Diseases\nRudolf Virchow coined the term \u201czoonosis\u201d (plural: zoonoses) in 1880 to refer to all diseases that affect both humans and creatures in nature.\nZoonoses are those illnesses and infections that are naturally spread between vertebrate animals and people, according to a 1959 definition provided by the WHO.\nZoonotic diseases are illnesses that can spread from wildlife to people. Zoonotic illnesses can be brought on by bacteria, fungi, viruses, and parasites.\nExamples: Chikungunya, Malaria, Yellow Fever, Zika Virus Disease, Dengue Fever, Ebola, Hepatitis E, Rabies, Japanese Encephalitis, Filariasis, Lyme disease, Babesiosis, Ehrlichiosis, Ringworm, Swine flu, also known as H1N1 virus \u2013 caused by type A influenza virus and West Nile virus \u2013 causes a viral infection that is typically spread by mosquitoes and can cause neurological disease as well as death.\n\nDiseases caused by each of the above microbes are tabulated below for an easy read.\n\nAlso read: Fungal Diseases\n\nDetails of Diseases Caused By Microorganisms\n\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 Disease\t\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Details\n\n\n\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 Diseases Caused By Microorganisms- Bacteria\n\n\nAcne vulg anthrax (simply acne or pimples)\tA skin disease caused when hair follicles become clogged with dead skin cells and oil from the skin.

These prevent or slow down bacterial development. However, viral illnesses are not helped by these medications. Therefore, the best defence against illnesses brought on by microbes is prevention. The following measures can be taken to avoid the diseases:\n\nIsolate the infected patients and their belongings.\nVaccination should be taken at a suitable time.\nEat properly cooked food and drink boiled drinking water.\nMaintain personal hygiene and good sanitary habits.\nKeep the surroundings clean.\nDo not let water get collected in the surroundings to control the breeding of mosquitoes.\nUse mosquito nets and repellents.\nUse insecticide sprays.\n\nAlso read: Rare Diseases: Policy and Management\n\nVaccines for Diseases Caused by Microorganisms\nThe vaccine is a biological treatment that boosts resistance to a specific illness.\nA vaccine frequently uses weakened or killed versions of the disease-causing microbe or its toxins and typically includes an agent that mimics the microbe that causes the disease.\nThe agent prompts the immune system to identify the microorganism as foreign, eliminate it, and \u201cremember\u201d it so that it can more quickly identify and eliminate any subsequent interactions with these microorganisms.\nFor various diseases brought on by microorganisms, various kinds of vaccines are accessible. It\u2019s them,\nInactivated vaccines\nWhen inactivated vaccines are created, a chemical, typically formaldehyde, is used to fully kill the bacteria.\nThe vaccine contains dead fragments of pathogen-causing microbes, typically bacteria.\nSince these vaccines contain dead antigens, their potency tends to wane over time, providing less long-lasting protection.\nTherefore, for the greatest protection, multiple doses of inactivated vaccines are typically required.\nThe advantage of using inactivated vaccines is that there is no possibility of experiencing any symptoms associated with a disease; allergic reactions are possible but extremely uncommon.\nExamples of inactivated vaccines are hepatitis A, hepatitis B, poliovirus, hemophilic influenza type b, meningococcal, pneumococcal and the injected form of influenza.\nLive-attenuated vaccines\nLive-attenuated is simply a synonym for weak but still alive.\nThese vaccines are created when the virus is so weak that it can reproduce in the body only 20 times.\nWhen a vaccine is created, the virus or bacteria are weakened in a lab to the point where they can still reproduce and are living, but they can no longer cause severe disease.\nThe mere fact that it exists is sufficient to trigger the immune system to create antibodies to fend off the specific disease in the future.\nThey are usually favoured by healthy adults because they elicit longer-lasting immunological responses.\nExamples include the viral diseases yellow fever, measles, rubella, and mumps and the bacterial disease typhoid.\nRecombinant Vector vaccine\nImmunity against illnesses with intricate infection processes can be developed by fusing the physiology of one microorganism with the DNA of another.\nThere are presently four genetically modified vaccines on the market:\nA segment of the hepatitis B virus genome is inserted into the gene of a yeast cell to create hepatitis B vaccines. When the modified yeast cell multiplies, it releases only the purified hepatitis B surface antigen.\nThe genes for a viral capsid protein are inserted into insect cell lines or yeast (like the hepatitis B vaccines) to create human papillomavirus vaccines. Particles that resemble viruses are created, and their production indicates a strong immunological reaction.\nSalmonella typhi bugs used in the live typhoid vaccine (Ty21a) have undergone genetic modification to render them non-pathogenic.\nLive attenuated influenza vaccine (LAIV)\u00a0has been engineered to replicate effectively in the mucosa of the nasopharynx but not in the lungs.\nDNA vaccination\nA novel vaccine known as DNA vaccination has recently been developed from the DNA of an infectious pathogen.\nSince the DNA quality of the infection varies in complex diseases, no vaccine is effective against it.\nDNA vaccines function by inserting and expressing DNA into human or animal cells, which causes the immune system to recognise the virus or bacterial DNA.\nImmune system cells that are aware of the proteins expressed will launch an assault against the cells expressing the proteins and the proteins themselves.\nPolysaccharide vaccines\nThe exterior capsule of some bacteria is made up of long chains of sugar molecules, and polysaccharide vaccines are a special kind of inactivated subunit vaccine made from these chains.\nThere are pure polysaccharide immunisations for pneumococcal, meningococcal, and Salmonella typhi diseases.\nAnti-Idiotypic Vaccine\nAn antibody\u2019s antigen-binding site (paratope) is a representation of a portion of the antigen\u2019s three-dimensional structure (epitope).\nThe idiotype, or particular arrangement of amino acids in the antibody, can be thought of as a reflection of the antigen\u2019s epitope.\nInjecting the antibody into another mammal will cause the antibody to be raised against the idiotype.\nThis anti-idiotype antibody imitates a portion of the antigen\u2019s three-dimensional structure.\nThis is an immunisation that can be used. Antibodies (anti-anti-idiotype antibodies) that recognise a structure comparable to a part of the virus are created when the anti-idiotype antibody is injected into a vaccine. These antibodies may be able to neutralise the virus.\nConclusion\n\nThe pathogenic microorganisms- bacteria, viruses, fungi, and protozoa trigger infectious illnesses. Typhoid, cholera, TB, and anthrax are all caused by bacteria. The common cold, measles, polio, hepatitis A, smallpox, covid-19, etc. are all caused by viruses. The fungi that cause ringworm, athlete\u2019s foot, and malaria are different from the protozoa that cause malaria. To avoid diseases caused by microorganisms, good personal hygiene and a clean environment must be maintained.\n\nThe adage \u201cprevention is better than treatment\u201d is often used. Antibiotics and other medications are used to stop or slow the development of microorganisms. However, viral infections are not treatable with these medicines.

This system employs several strategies to protect the human body from intruding microorganisms. They operate using memory, some of which are innate and others of which are learned.\n\nThey, therefore, play a role in autoimmunity, allergies, and organ transplantation.

Immunity is the name given to this defense strategy.\nTypes of Immunity\n\nThere are two major types of immunity:\n\n\ud83d\udc49 Which year are YOU targeting for success in the IAS/IPS/IFS Exam? \ud83d\ude80\n\n(1) \u21d2 UPSC 2025: Prelims cum Mains\n\n(2) \u21d2 UPSC 2026: Prelims cum Mains\n\n(3) \u21d2 UPSC 2027 Prelims cum Mains\n\nTip: Know more about ClearIAS Courses (Online/Offline)\n\nInnate Immunity or Natural or Non-specific Immunity.\n\nAcquired Immunity or Adaptive Immunity.\nInnate Immunity\nAn organism has this form of immunity from birth. As soon as the pathogen hits, this is immediately activated.\nBarriers and defense systems that prevent foreign substances from entering the body are part of innate immunity.\nThe body\u2019s defense mechanism is referred to as innate immunity.\nThe inherent defense mechanisms that this immunity provides, such as salivary enzymes, natural killer cells, undamaged skin, neutrophils, etc., help us fight off diseases at birth before being exposed to pathogens or antigens.\nLong-lasting immunity occurs when our body creates the necessary antibodies on its own. There aren\u2019t many natural defenses in our bodies to keep germs out.\nCells Involved In Innate Immunity\nPhagocytes: They move around the body and scan for foreign objects. While the body is protecting itself against that pathogen, they engulf and kill it.\nMacrophages: They are capable of traversing the circulatory system\u2019s cellular barriers. To enlist more cells at the location of infections, they emit specific signals like cytokines.\nMast Cells: They are crucial for wound healing and infection defense.\nNeutrophils: They are made of poisonous granules that will destroy any pathogen that comes into contact with them.\nEosinophils: They have highly poisonous proteins that are lethal to any bacteria or parasite that comes in touch with them.\nBasophils: They target multicellular parasites. They also release histamine, just like mast cells do.\nNatural Killer Cells: By eradicating the contaminated host cells, these prevent the spread of diseases.\nDendritic Cells: They are found in the tissues that serve as the entry points for first infections. By presenting an antigen, these cells alert the rest of the immune system to the infection.\nAcquired Immunity\nThe immunity that our bodies develop through time is known as acquired immunity or adaptive immunity. This is not innate immunity, which is present from birth.\nAcquired immunity refers to the immune system\u2019s capacity to respond to illness and produce pathogen-specific immunity. It also goes by the name of adaptive immunity.\nThe term \u201cacquired immunity\u201d refers to immunity that a person develops after birth.\nIt is particular and is carried out by lymphocytes or antibodies that render the antigen harmless.\nAcquired immunity\u2019s primary purpose is to both treat the infectious disease\u2019s victim and shield others against it in the future.\nIt primarily comprises an enhanced lymphatic defense system that recognizes and ignores its bodily cells to function.\nOur body\u2019s immune system recognizes infections that it has already encountered. It is primarily brought on when a person is exposed to the virus or its antigen.\nTo envelop the infection and eliminate its antigen, our body begins to produce antibodies.\nIt is referred to as a primary response when it is encountered for the first time. Naturally acquired immunity is the ability of antibodies to target pathogens for the second time after the body becomes used to them.\nOur body\u2019s acquired immunity has a few unique characteristics.\nCells Involved in Acquired Immunity\n\nAcquired immunity involves two types of cells: B-cells and T-cells\n\nB-cells:\nIn the bone marrow, they grow.\nWhen these cells come into contact with external substances, they become active. These foreign-object signals are these particles.\nThe B-cells instantly undergo plasma cell differentiation and create antibodies that are specific to that foreign substance, or so-called antigen.\nThese antibodies adhere to the antigen\u2019s or foreign agent\u2019s surface.\nThese antibodies find every antigen the body contains and eliminate it.\nHumoral immunity is the name for immunity that is B-cell dependent.\nT-cells:\nThey grow in the thymus after beginning in the bone marrow.\nHelper, cytotoxic, and regulatory T-cell subtypes can be produced. The bloodstream receives the discharged cells.\nHelper T-cells release cytokines that serve as messengers when these cells are activated by an antigen.\nThese cytokines start the process of B-cells differentiating into plasma cells, which thereafter secrete antibodies against the antigens.\nThe cancer cells are destroyed by the cytotoxic T lymphocytes.\nImmune responses are regulated by regulatory T cells.\nTypes of Acquired Immune Response- Humoral Immune Response:\nThe blood cells carry and distribute the antibodies made by B-lymphocytes throughout the body. Because it includes an antibody made by lymphocytes, it is known as the humoral immune response.\nIt depends on how antibodies moving throughout the body are acting. Humoral immunity is activated when an antibody on a\nB-cell interacts with an antigen. The helper T cell is exposed to the antigen after the B cell has internalized it. The B-cell is triggered by this.\nThe B cells that have been stimulated develop into plasma cells.\nAntibodies are released into the bloodstream by these plasma cells. To stop any disease brought on by that pathogen shortly, the memory B cells store information about the pathogen.\nCell-mediated Immune Response:\nThe T helper cells start cell-mediated immunity.\nBy releasing toxins, the cytotoxic T cells destroy the infected cells from the body and encourage apoptosis, or programmed cell death.\nOther immune cells are stimulated by the T helper cells. In the case of transplant recipients, cell-mediated immunity is made obvious.\nIt is possible to transplant one of our sense organs to replace another when one stops working. With the immunological response, though, things are more complicated.\nIt indicates that T-lymphocytes can distinguish between tissue or organs that are from our body and those that are from foreign bodies.\nBecause our bodies could reject a transplanted organ, we cannot transplant or implant organs into our bodies, even if we discover a donor with the same blood group. The T-cells instantly identify the tissue or organ as alien and prevent it from assimilating into the body.\nBecause of this, immunosuppressant medicine is required for the rest of the recipient\u2019s life. The T-lymphocytes are in charge of regulating this reaction.\nImmune System in the Body\nThe lymphoid organs, tissues, cells, and soluble molecules like antibodies make up the human immune system. As you\u2019ve read, the immune system is distinct in that it can identify foreign antigens, react to them, and retain those responses. Moreover, organ transplants, autoimmune illnesses, and allergy reactions all depend heavily on the immune system.\nOrgans of Lymph: These are the locations of lymphocyte genesis, maturation, and/or proliferation.\nThe thymus and bone marrow are the main lymphoid organs, where immature lymphocytes develop into antigen-sensitive lymphocytes.\nThe lymphocytes move to secondary lymphoid organs like the appendix, spleen, lymph nodes, tonsils, and Peyer patches of the small intestine after maturation.\nThe places where lymphocytes engage with antigens and multiply to become effector cells are provided by the secondary lymphoid organs.\nThe primary lymphoid organ, the bone marrow, is where all blood cells, including lymphocytes, are made.\nThe thymus is a lobed organ that sits beneath the breastbone and closes to the heart. The thymus is relatively large at birth, but as people age, it gets smaller and smaller until it is very small by the time they reach adolescence.\nT-lymphocyte formation and maturation take place in the microenvironments provided by the thymus and bone marrow, respectively.\nThe spleen is a sizable organ with a bean shape. Mostly lymphocytes and phagocytes are present. It filters the blood by capturing microorganisms that are carried in the blood. Spleen also has a large reservoir of erythrocytes.\nLittle, solid structures known as lymph nodes are scattered throughout the lymphatic system. Microorganisms or other antigens that accidentally enter the lymph and tissue fluid are captured by lymph nodes.\nThe immunological response is brought on by antigens that become lodged in the lymph nodes and activate the lymphocytes there.\nMucosal-associated lymphoid tissue is another type of lymphoid tissue that can be found in the lining of the three main tracts (respiratory, digestive, and urogenital) (MALT). About 50% of the lymphoid tissue in the human body is made up of it.\nVaccines\nThe antigens of the pathogen that causes the disease are used to create vaccines. For instance, the smallpox vaccination contains the pathogen\u2019s antigens that cause the sickness.\nAntibody-producing cells that make smallpox antibodies are stimulated when a person receives the smallpox vaccination. The body is thus shielded from the sickness developing in the future.\nArtificially acquired immunity is the result of purposely introducing pathogenic bacteria into our bodies; it creates a comparable reaction.\nImmunization is a method that gives people resistance to infectious diseases and dangerous bacteria by administering a vaccine into their bodies. By vaccination, the body\u2019s immune system is stimulated to defend against upcoming infections or diseases.\nLymphoid Organs\nLymphoid organs are those parts of the immune system that protect the body from invaders that could potentially infect it or spread tumors. Bone marrow, blood vessels, lymphatic vessels, thymus, spleen, and several other collections of lymphoid tissue are all included in it.\nThe origin, maturation, and proliferation of lymphocytes occur in lymphoid organs. Depending on where they are in their growth and development, they might be classified as primary, secondary, or tertiary.\nThese organs are made up of fluid connective tissues and several leukocytes or white blood cells kinds. Leukocytes, or white blood cells, contain the highest concentration of lymphocytes.\nPrimary lymphoid organs\nLymphocytes are produced and allowed to mature by the principal lymphoid organs. Developing lymphocytes from immature progenitor cells also serves a purpose.\nAs a result, it is known as the core lymphoid organs.\nPrimary lymphoid organs include the thymus and bone marrow, for instance.\nSecondary lymphoid organs\nBecause they are engaged in encouraging the locations where lymphocytes interact with the antigen to become effector cells, the secondary lymphoid organs are also known as the peripheral lymphoid organs.\nThey start the immune system\u2019s adaptive response.\nThe extracellular lymphoid tissues Spleen, tonsils, lymph nodes, the appendix, and other organs are instances of secondary lymphoid organs.\nTertiary lymphoid organs\nThere are typically very few lymphocytes in the tertiary lymphoid organs.\nIt is significant in the process of inflammation.\nInnate and acquired immunity, B cells, T cells, cellular and humoral immunological responses, and the immune system are all discussed in this context.\nConclusion\nHealth is more than just being free from illness. It is a condition of whole bodily, mental, social, and psychological health.\nHumans are frequently distressed by illnesses like typhoid, cholera, pneumonia, fungal skin infections, malaria, and many more.\nIf left untreated, vector-borne illnesses like malaria, particularly the Plasmodium falciparum variety, can be lethal.\nWhen we are exposed to chemicals that cause disease, our immune system is crucial in preventing certain illnesses.\nOur body\u2019s natural defenses, including our skin, mucous membranes, saliva, tears, and phagocytic cells, assist in preventing the entry of infections into our bodies.\nCertain antibodies (humoral immune response) and cells (cell-mediated immune response) serve to kill infections if they manage to enter our body.\nThe immune system remembers. The immune response is quicker and more severe after a subsequent encounter with the same virus. This serves as the cornerstone of the defense provided by vaccination and immunization.\n\nArticle written by Aseem Muhammed",

Read further to know more.\n\nMicroorganisms or microbes are microscopic living organisms that cannot be seen with the naked eye. Because these can only be viewed under a microscope, they have been given the name microorganisms. Some microorganisms are single-celled, such as bacteria, algae, and protozoa, whereas others, such as many algae and fungi, are multicellular.\n\nMicrobes may exist in a wide range of settings, from icy cold to scorching hot, and from deserts to marshy areas. Microorganisms can be both dangerous and beneficial.\n\nSome microbes are helpful and contribute to human well-being. The role of microbes in human welfare is discussed below.\n\nTable of Contents\n\nMicrobes in human welfare\nVaccination and Antibiotics\nEnzymes, chemicals, and other bioactive molecules\nMilk to Curd\nFermentation\nFermented Drinks\nSewage treatment microbes\nMicrobes in biogas generation\nBiocontrol agents based on microbes\nMicrobes as biofertilisers\nPreservatives\nConclusion\nMicrobes in human welfare\n\nThey aid in the production of bread and curd, the commercial production of alcohol and vinegar, the production of antibiotic medicines for disease treatment, improving soil fertility and cleaning up the environment by decomposing dead plants and animals, and the production of vaccines against a variety of diseases.\n\nVaccination and Antibiotics\n\nWhen you become unwell, your doctor may prescribe antibiotic tablets, capsules, or injections, such as penicillin. Microorganisms are the source of these medicines.\n\nThese medications either destroy or inhibit the growth of disease-causing bacteria. These medications are known as Antibiotics.\nA variety of antibiotics are now manufactured from bacteria and fungi. Streptomycin, tetracycline, and erythromycin are examples of well-known antibiotics derived from fungi and bacteria.\n\n\ud83d\udc49 Which year are YOU targeting for success in the IAS/IPS/IFS Exam? \ud83d\ude80\n\n(1) \u21d2 UPSC 2025: Prelims cum Mains\n\n(2) \u21d2 UPSC 2026: Prelims cum Mains\n\n(3) \u21d2 UPSC 2027 Prelims cum Mains\n\nTip: Know more about ClearIAS Courses (Online/Offline)\n\nAlexander Fleming was working on a culture of pathogenic bacteria [Staphylococci] in 1929. In one of his culture plates, he discovered the spores of a little green mould [Penicillium notatum]. He discovered that the presence of mould inhibited bacterial development.\nIn fact, it also destroyed a large number of these germs. The mould penicillin was made from this.\nAntibiotics have substantially enhanced our ability to cure severe diseases like plague, whooping cough, diphtheria, and leprosy, which used to kill millions worldwide. We cannot envision a world without antibiotics now.\nAntibiotics used in excess may kill beneficial bacteria in the body.\nAntibiotics, on the other hand, are ineffective against colds and flu, which are caused by viruses.\nWhen disease-causing bacteria enter our bodies, the immune system generates antibodies to combat the intruder. The body also recalls how to combat the microorganism if it returns.\nWhen dead or weakened bacteria enter a healthy host, the body fights and kills them by creating appropriate antibodies. The antibodies remain in the body, protecting us from disease-causing microorganisms. This is how a vaccination function.\nVaccination can prevent several diseases, including cholera, tuberculosis, smallpox, and hepatitis. In 1798, Edward Jenner discovered the smallpox vaccine.\nEnzymes, chemicals, and other bioactive molecules\n\nMicrobes are also employed commercially and industrially to produce specific substances such as organic acids, alcohols, and enzymes. Acid manufacturers include:\n\nCitric acid fungus Aspergillus niger\nAcetobacter aceti (an acetic acid bacteria)\nClostridium butylicum (a butyric acid-producing bacterium)\nLactobacillus acidophilus (a bacterium).\nFor the commercial manufacturing of ethanol, yeast (Saccharomyces cerevisiae) is utilised.\n\nLipases are enzymes that are used in detergent formulas to assist remove greasy stains from laundry. You\u2019ve probably observed that bottled fruit juices from the store are clearer than those made at home. This is due to the employment of pectinases and proteases to clarify the bottled juices.\n\nStreptokinase, a clot buster produced by the bacterium Streptococcus and modified by genetic engineering, is used to remove clots from the blood arteries of patients who have had myocardial infarction leading to a heart attack.\nThe fungus Trichoderma polysporum also produces cyclosporin A, which is utilised as an immunosuppressive medication in organ transplant patients.\nStatins, which are produced by the yeast Monascus purpureus, have been commercialised as cholesterol-lowering medications. It works by competitively blocking the enzyme responsible for cholesterol production.\nMilk to Curd\nLactobacillus and other microorganisms known as lactic acid bacteria (LAB) thrive in milk and convert it to curd.\nThe LAB produces acids during growth that coagulate and partially break down the milk proteins.\nA tiny amount of curd added to fresh milk as an inoculum or starter contains millions of LAB that multiply at appropriate temperatures, converting milk to curd and improving its nutritional quality by boosting VITAMIN B12 [helps in the production of DNA and RBC] (red blood cells).\nAnaemia, severe neurological system damage, and other symptoms of vitamin B12 insufficiency].\nIn our stomach, the LAB also plays an important function in preventing disease-causing microorganisms.\nFermentation\n\nYeast converts sugar into alcohol. Fermentation is the process of converting sugar into alcohol. In 1857, Louis Pasteur discovered fermentation.\n\nBacteria ferment the dough, which is used to make dishes like dosa and idli. The puffed-up appearance of dough is caused by the emission of CO2 gas by the bacteria.\nSimilarly, baker\u2019s yeast is used to ferment the dough required to make bread (Saccharomyces cerevisiae).\nFermentation by bacteria is also used to make a variety of traditional drinks and dishes. \u2018Toddy,\u2019 a popular drink from southern India, is prepared by fermenting palm sap.\nMicrobes are also utilised to ferment foods such as fish, soya beans, and bamboo shoots.\nCheese is one of the first foods to incorporate microorganisms. The big holes in \u2018Swiss cheese\u2019 are caused by a bacterium called Propionibacterium sharmanii producing a huge amount of CO2.\nFermented Drinks\nMicrobes, particularly yeasts, have been employed for centuries to produce beverages such as wine, beer, whisky, brandy, and rum.\nThe same yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae, often known as brewer\u2019s yeast, is used for fermenting malted cereals and fruit juices to make ethanol for this purpose.\nSeveral varieties of alcoholic drinks are produced depending on the raw material used for fermentation and the style of processing (with or without distillation).\nWine and beer are not distilled, but whisky, brandy, and rum are made by distilling the fermented broth.\nSewage treatment microbes\n\nSewage comprises a high concentration of organic materials and microorganisms. A large number of them are pathogenic.\n\nThe primary sludge treats wastewater, and the supernatant is referred to as effluent. The primary settling tank effluent is collected for subsequent treatment.\nThe principal effluent is routed into enormous aeration tanks, which are mechanically agitated and pumped with air. This enables the rapid development of beneficial aerobic microorganisms into flocs (masses of bacteria associated with fungal filaments to form mesh-like structures).\nThese microorganisms devour the majority of the organic materials in the wastewater as they grow. This greatly reduces the effluent\u2019s BOD (biochemical oxygen demand).\nThe sewage water is treated till the BOD level is lower. The higher the BOD of wastewater, the more polluting it is.\nOnce the BOD of sewage or wastewater has been sufficiently decreased, the effluent is fed into a settling tank to allow the bacterial \u2018flocs\u2019 to settle. This material is referred to as activated sludge.\nTo serve as the inoculum or starter, a small portion of the activated sludge is fed back into the aeration tank.\nThe residual sludge is poured into enormous tanks known as anaerobic sludge digesters. Other bacteria, which thrive anaerobically, consume the bacteria and fungi in the sludge here.\nBacteria produce a combination of gases during digestion, including methane, hydrogen sulphide, and carbon dioxide. Because these gases are combustible, they combine to generate biogas, which can be used as a source of energy.\nThe secondary treatment plant\u2019s effluent is often discharged into natural water bodies such as rivers and streams.\n\nAlso Read : Bioremediation \u2013 ClearIAS\n\nMicrobes in biogas generation\n\nBiogas is a gas combination (predominantly methane) created by microbial activity that can be used as fuel.\n\nSome bacteria that grow anaerobically on cellulosic material create a significant amount of methane [greenhouse gas] in addition to CO2 and H2.\nMethanogens are bacteria that produce methane. Methanobacterium is one such frequent bacterium. During sewage treatment, these bacteria are typically discovered in anaerobic sludge.\nThese bacteria are also found in cattle rumen (a section of the stomach). A significant amount of cellulosic material found in cattle feed is also found in the rumen. These bacteria aid in the digestion of cellulose in the rumen and play a vital role in cattle nutrition.\nTherefore, cattle excreta (dung), often known as gobar, is high in these bacteria. Dung can be used to produce biogas, often known as gobar gas.\nBiocontrol agents based on microbes\n\nThe employment of biological approaches to control plant diseases and pests is referred to as biocontrol. Biological agents are preferable to weedicides and insecticides. There is a method of pest management in agriculture that depends on natural predation rather than added insecticides.\n\nBacillus thuringiensis is an example of a microbial biocontrol agent that can be introduced to control butterfly caterpillars (often written as Bt).\nThe fungus Trichoderma is being developed as a biological control for the treatment of plant disease. Trichoderma fungi are free-living fungi that are abundant in root habitats. They are effective biocontrol agents against a variety of plant diseases.\nPathogens called baculoviruses harm insects and other arthropods. It has been demonstrated that they don\u2019t harm non-target insects, fish, birds, mammals, or even plants.\nMicrobes as biofertilisers\n\nBiofertilizers are living things that improve the soil\u2019s nutrient content. Biofertilizers are mostly derived from cyanobacteria, fungi, and bacteria.\n\nYou might be aware of the nodules that the symbiotic relationship between Rhizobium and leguminous plants causes to grow on their roots. These microorganisms convert atmospheric nitrogen into organic forms that the plant can utilise as nutrition.\n\nAzospirillum and Azotobacter are two examples of other bacteria that can improve the soil\u2019s nitrogen content by fixing atmospheric nitrogen while growing freely in the soil.\nIt is also known that fungi and plants can coexist in harmony (mycorrhiza). The genus Glomus has numerous mycorrhizal species. In these partnerships, the fungal symbiont takes up phosphorus from the soil and gives it to the plant.\nFurther advantages include resistance to diseases carried by the roots, tolerance to salinity and drought, and an overall improvement in plant growth and development are all demonstrated by plants with these relationships.\nMany cyanobacteria, including Anabaena, Nostoc, Oscillatona, etc., are autotrophic microbes that can fix atmospheric nitrogen. They are found in both aquatic and terrestrial habitats.\nCyanobacteria are a significant biofertilizer in paddy fields. Also increasing the organic content and fertility of the soil are blue-green algae.\nPreservatives\n\nThe most frequent substances used to stop the growth of germs are salts and edible oils. They are therefore referred to as preservatives.\n\nTo pickles, we add salt or acid preservatives to ward off microbial invasion.\nCommon preservatives include sodium benzoate and sodium metabisulfite. They are also used to prevent spoiling in jams and squashes.\nFor centuries, common salt has been used to preserve meat and fish. To prevent microbial growth, meat and fish are sprinkled with dry salt.\nSalting is also used to preserve amla, raw mangoes, tamarind, and other fruits and vegetables.\nSugar is used to preserve jams, jellies, and squashes. Sugar lowers moisture content, preventing the formation of microorganisms that ruin food.\nSugar lowers moisture content, preventing the formation of microorganisms that ruin food.\nBecause bacteria cannot thrive in such an environment, the use of oil and vinegar avoids pickle deterioration. This method frequently preserves vegetables, fruits, seafood, and meat.\nBecause pasteurised milk is free of hazardous germs, it can be drunk without boiling. The milk is heated to around 700 degrees Celsius for 15 to 30 seconds before being quickly chilled and stored.\nIt suppresses microbial development in this way. Louis Pasteur discovered this method. It is known as pasteurisation.\nConclusion\n\nMicrobes are an essential part of life on Earth. Not all bacteria are harmful. Several bacteria are extremely beneficial to humans.\nWe virtually always use microorganisms and microbially generated goods.\n\nFrom making curd and alcohol to cleaning up the environment, the role of microbes in human welfare is very important.\nMicrobes have been utilised for more than a century to treat sewage (wastewater) through the process of activated sludge formation, which aids in the recycling of water in nature.\n\nRelated article: Microbiome\n\nArticle Written By: Atheena Fathima Riyas",

Read further to know.\n\nKyasanur Forest Disease (KFD) is a viral hemorrhagic fever that is transmitted through ticks and is consistently present in Karnataka State, India.\n\nIt is also referred to as monkey fever.\n\nThe virus responsible for this disease, known as Kyasanur forest disease Virus (KFDV), is part of the Flavivirus genus and the Flaviviridae family.\n\nTable of Contents\n\nAbout Kyasanur Forest Disease\nTransmission\nSymptoms\nOutbreak\nDiagnosis\nPoint-of-Care Testing for KFD\nBenefits of Point-of-Care Test\nPrevention\nGovernment\u2019s Approach to Curb Zoonotic Disease\nConclusion\nAbout Kyasanur Forest Disease\n\nIn 1957, KFDV was discovered when monkeys in the Kyasanur Forest region of Shimoga district, Karnataka State, fell ill with a febrile illness. A few deaths were reported in nearby human beings populations. The disease has since spread to other parts of India, including Maharashtra, Goa, Kerala, and Tamil Nadu.\n\nDuring 2012-2013, the disease was reported from new districts and new states in India, like districts of Karnataka, Kerala, and Tamilnadu.\n\nTransmission\n\nA tick bite or contact with an infected animal, most particularly a sick or recently deceased monkey, may result in transmission to humans. No transfer from one person to another has been observed.\n\n\ud83d\udc49 Which year are YOU targeting for success in the IAS/IPS/IFS Exam? \ud83d\ude80\n\n(1) \u21d2 UPSC 2025: Prelims cum Mains\n\n(2) \u21d2 UPSC 2026: Prelims cum Mains\n\n(3) \u21d2 UPSC 2027 Prelims cum Mains\n\nTip: Know more about ClearIAS Courses (Online/Offline)\n\nDespite having a small impact on the disease\u2019s transmission, large animals including cows, sheep, and goats may transmit KFD.\n\nSymptoms\n\nChills, fever, and headache are the first signs of KFD to appear after an incubation period of 3 to 8 days. 3\u20134 days after the start of the initial symptom, severe muscle pain with vomiting, gastrointestinal complaints, and bleeding issues may appear. Low platelet, red blood cell, and white blood cell counts, as well as abnormally low blood pressure, can occur in patients.\n\nSome patients may recover without complications after one to two weeks. However, for a subset of patients (10-20%), the illness has a biphasic nature, with a second wave of symptoms occurring at the beginning of the third week. These symptoms can include fever, as well as neurological manifestations such as severe headaches, mental disturbances, tremors, and vision deficits.\n\nFor KFD, the case-fatality rate is reportedly between 3 and 5%.\n\nOutbreak\n\nOutbreaks of KFD usually occur during the winter and spring months, when tick activity is at its peak. The disease is most commonly found in rural and forested areas, where people come into contact with ticks through activities such as farming, forestry, and hunting. However, there have been cases of KFD occurring in urban areas as well.\n\nDiagnosis\n\nDiagnosis of KFD can be challenging, as the disease can mimic other illnesses such as dengue fever and malaria. Laboratory testing is required to confirm a diagnosis, but this can be difficult in remote areas where laboratory facilities are lacking. Point-of-care testing could be useful in these situations, as it allows for on-site sample processing.\n\nPoint-of-Care Testing for KFD\n\nPoint-of-Care Testing is developed by The\u00a0Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR)- National Institute of Virology.\n\nThe kit comprises a battery-powered Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR) analyzer, which is a lightweight, portable device that uses universal cartridges for sample pre-treatment and nucleic acid extraction. This aids in on-site sample processing.\n\nBenefits of Point-of-Care Test\n\nPoint-of-care tests would be advantageous in diagnosing KFD, given that outbreaks typically occur in remote areas where adequate sample handling and laboratory testing facilities are lacking.\n\nThe point-of-care test would also be useful in quick patient management and controlling the further spread of the virus.\n\nPrevention\n\nPrevention of KFD relies on avoiding tick bites through measures such as wearing long-sleeved clothing, using insect repellent, and avoiding tick-infested areas. A vaccine is also available for people at high risk of exposure, such as forest workers and farmers.\n\nGovernment\u2019s Approach to Curb Zoonotic Disease\n\nZoonotic diseases are those that can be transmitted from animals to humans, and they pose a significant threat to public health. In response to this, governments around the world have implemented various initiatives to help prevent and control the spread of zoonotic diseases.\n\nOne example of a government initiative is the One Health approach, which is a collaborative effort between human, animal, and environmental health sectors to prevent and control zoonotic diseases. This approach recognizes that human health, animal health, and environmental health are interconnected, and it seeks to address the underlying factors that contribute to the emergence and spread of zoonotic diseases.\n\nAnother initiative is the establishment of disease surveillance and reporting systems, which are critical for early detection and rapid response to zoonotic disease outbreaks. This involves monitoring and reporting of animal and human disease cases, as well as the identification of high-risk areas and populations.\n\nGovernments also invest in the research and development of vaccines, diagnostics, and therapeutics for zoonotic diseases. This helps to improve disease prevention and control measures and to develop effective treatments for infected individuals.\n\nIn addition, public awareness campaigns and education initiatives are implemented to educate people on zoonotic diseases and how to prevent them.

Genetic engineering is the term used to refer to recombinant DNA technologies.\nIn 1968, Swiss microbiologist Werner Arber made the discovery of restriction enzymes, which led to the development of the recombinant DNA technology.\nIt\u2019s harder than it sounds to splice the desired gene into the host\u2019s genome. It entails choosing the ideal vector with which to integrate the intended gene and create recombinant DNA after choosing the appropriate gene to be administered into the host.\nAs a result, the host must be given the recombinant DNA. Finally, it needs to be kept alive in the host and passed on to the progeny.\nRecombinant DNA multiplies and is expressed in the form of the created protein under ideal conditions following insertion into the host cell.\nThe recombinant gene is passed down to the progeny by the successfully transformed cells or organisms.\nScience, medicine, agriculture, and industry can benefit from the unique genetic combinations that the recombinant DNA molecule creates.\nTwo findings made while dealing with bacteria gave rise to recombinant DNA technology: the existence of plasmids or additional chromosomal DNA pieces that can carry foreign DNA and proliferate alongside bacterial DNA in a bacterial cell.\nAvailability of particular restriction enzymes that attack and cleave DNA at particular places.\nA lot of agriculture uses recombinant DNA technologies to create genetically engineered species.\nIt is employed in the manufacturing of medications like insulin.\nTools Of Recombinant DNA Technology\n\nRestrictions enzymes, polymerases, and ligases are among the enzymes that aid in cutting, synthesis, and binding.\u00a0The position at which the desired gene is inserted into the vector genome is greatly influenced by the restriction enzymes utilised in recombinant DNA technology. Endonucleases and exonucleases are the two types.\n\nEndonucleases and Exonucleases:\n\nThe exonucleases remove the nucleotides off the ends of the strands, whereas the endonucleases cut within the DNA strand. The restriction endonucleases are sequence-specific and cut the DNA at predetermined locations. These sequences are typically palindrome sequences. They check the DNA\u2019s length and make the cut at a certain location known as the restriction site.\n\nIn the sequence, this results in sticky ends. The same restriction enzymes are used to cut both the vectors and the desired genes, resulting in complementary sticky notes. This makes it simple for the ligases to link the desired gene to the vector.\n\n\ud83d\udc49 Which year are YOU targeting for success in the IAS/IPS/IFS Exam? \ud83d\ude80\n\n(1) \u21d2 UPSC 2025: Prelims cum Mains\n\n(2) \u21d2 UPSC 2026: Prelims cum Mains\n\n(3) \u21d2 UPSC 2027 Prelims cum Mains\n\nTip: Know more about ClearIAS Courses (Online/Offline)\n\nThe vectors:\n\nThe required gene may be carried by and integrated into the vectors. They are a crucial component of the recombinant DNA technology\u2019s tools since they are the ultimate carriers of the desired gene into the host organism. The most popular vectors employed in recombinant DNA technology are bacteriophages and plasmids because of their high copy numbers.\n\nThe components of the vectors are the origin of replication, which is a sequence of nucleotides from which the replication begins, a selectable marker, which are genes that exhibit resistance to specific antibiotics like ampicillin, and cloning sites, which are the locations where desired DNAs are inserted and are recognised by restriction enzymes.\n\nHost organism:\n\nThe organism that serves as the host for the recombinant DNA. The host, which accepts the vector created with the required DNA with the aid of enzymes, is the ultimate tool of recombinant DNA technology.\n\nProcess involved in Recombinant DNA Technology\n\nThese recombinant DNAs can be introduced into the host in a variety of ways, including microinjection, biolistics or gene gun, alternate cooling and heating, usage of calcium ions, etc.\n\nRecombinant DNA technology involves a number of stages kept in a particular order to produce the desired output.\n\nStep-1 Isolation of Genetic Material.\nIsolating the desired DNA in its pure state, that is, free of extraneous macromolecules, is the first and most important step in the recombinant DNA technology process.\nStep-2 Cutting the gene at the recognition sites.\nThe restriction enzymes are important in deciding where to introduce the desired gene into the vector genome.\nRestrictions enzyme digestions are the name given to these processes.\nStep-3 Amplifying the gene copies through Polymerase chain reaction (PCR).\nOnce the correct gene of interest has been cut using restriction enzymes, a procedure called DNA amplification is used to multiply a single copy of DNA into thousands to millions of copies.\nStep-4 Ligation of DNA Molecules.\nWith the aid of the enzyme DNA ligase, the two pieces\u2014a cut fragment of DNA and the vector\u2014are joined at this stage of ligation.\nStep-5 Insertion of Recombinant DNA Into Host.\nThe recombinant DNA is now inserted into a recipient host cell in this stage.

The most important studies involving modified DNA have been those where the method is fundamental to the majority of current work in the biological and biomedical sciences.\n\nRecombinant DNA has been used to identify, map, analyse the sequence of, and establish the functionality of genes. Recombinant proteins have frequently been used in laboratory research as reagents as well as to create antibody markers for analysing protein synthesis in tissues and animals.\n\nRecombinant DNA is also used in industry, agricultural production, human and veterinary medicine, farming, and bioengineering, among other useful applications.\n\nArticle written by Aseem Muhammed",

He found that mercury\u2019s resistance fell sharply at 4.2 Kelvin (\u2212268.95 \u00b0C), a temperature that is only slightly above absolute zero. This discovery marked the birth of the field of superconductivity.\n\nAlso read: Steel Industry in India\n\nTypes of Superconductors\n\nSuperconductors can be classified into two main types:\n\nType I superconductors: These superconductors have a single critical magnetic field (Hc), above which they cease to be superconducting. They exhibit perfect diamagnetism below the critical field and show a sudden loss of superconductivity when the field is exceeded. Examples of Type I superconductors include Mercury (Hg), Lead (Pb), and Tin (Sn).\nType II superconductors: These superconductors have two critical magnetic fields: Hc1 and Hc2. They can exist in two different states, a mixed state and a Meissner state. The mixed state is characterized by a flux lattice, in which the superconductivity coexists with magnetic flux lines. In contrast, the Meissner state is a pure diamagnetic state in which the magnetic field is completely expelled from the material. Type II superconductors are more technologically significant than Type I because they can carry a much larger current density. Examples of Type II superconductors include Niobium-titanium (NbTi), Niobium-tin (Nb3Sn), and Yttrium-barium-copper-oxide (YBCO).\nSuperconductivity Applications\n\nSuperconductivity is a phenomenon where certain materials exhibit zero electrical resistance and the expulsion of magnetic fields when cooled below a critical temperature.

The debate around genetic information and privacy has been on for a while now. Read here to understand the aspects related to genetic privacy.\n\nRecently, the Supreme Court of India ruled that children have the right to protect their genetic information from DNA tests. Genetic privacy has been considered an essential attribute of the right to privacy.

We must avoid discrimination and uphold \u201cfair justice under the law\u201d in this age of widespread genetic testing.\n\nGenetic discernment is a breach of Article 14, which guarantees that everyone is treated fairly under the law.\n\nThe Supreme Court of India unanimously stated that the Right to Privacy is a Fundamental Right under Article 21 in Justice KS Puttaswamy (Retd.) & Anr. v. Union of India.\n\nSince everyone\u2019s genome is a private matter, genetic discrimination must be placed under the privacy umbrella.\n\nThe recent ruling of 2023, where the Supreme Court has ruled that children have the right to protect their genetic information from DNA tests, paves the way to form a concrete foundation for the debate on genetic privacy in India.\n\nWay forward\n\nNearly every government outlaws genetic discrimination. The Genetic Information Non-discrimination Act (GINA), a federal law that shields persons against genetic discrimination in employment and health care, was approved in the United States in 2008.\n\nAlso, the Rights of privacy, autonomy, and identity are recognized under the United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child.\n\nThe Convention acknowledges the control that individuals, including children, have over their boundaries and how they define who they are about other people.\nChildren are not to be deprived of this entitlement to influence and understand their sense of self simply by being children.\n\nMore thorough privacy laws and rules that are geared especially toward genetic information are required from a legal viewpoint.\n\nSanctions for improper access or use of genetic information are needed, including stronger guidelines for gaining informed permission for genetic testing and data exchange.\n\nWith improvements in encryption, safe storage, and data transfer protocols, there may be potential to improve privacy protections technologically.\n\nFrom an ethical standpoint, it will be crucial to keep educating the public about the benefits and dangers of genetic testing and data sharing.\n\nIt may entail activities to provide fair access to genetic testing and benefits as well as efforts to support transparency, openness, and accountability around the collection, use, and sharing of genetic data.\n\n-Article written by Swathi Satish",

The gene or other target DNA fragment is initially placed into a circular piece of DNA called a plasmid in a standard DNA cloning procedure. Restriction enzymes that \u201ccut and paste\u201d the DNA are used for this. A molecule of recombinant DNA is created.\n\nSubsequently, a bacterial cell is given the recombinant plasmid. The plasmid-carrying bacteria are chosen and raised. Making copies of the rDNA, or recombinant DNA, the plasmid carries is replicated by them during reproduction and passed on to their progeny.\n\n\ud83d\udc49 Which year are YOU targeting for success in the IAS/IPS/IFS Exam? \ud83d\ude80\n\n(1) \u21d2 UPSC 2025: Prelims cum Mains\n\n(2) \u21d2 UPSC 2026: Prelims cum Mains\n\n(3) \u21d2 UPSC 2027 Prelims cum Mains\n\nTip: Know more about ClearIAS Courses (Online/Offline)\n\nWe occasionally require many DNA copies to carry out studies or create new plasmids. In other instances, the DNA fragment encodes a helpful protein, and the bacteria are utilised to create Recombinant clone detection: The protein was synthesised by the many colonies. To produce the insulin used by diabetics, for instance, the human insulin gene is produced in the E. coli bacterium.\n\nDNA Cloning techniques\n\nThere are four main methods of gene cloning, which are summarised below:\n\n\u00a0Isolation of Target DNA: The target DNA can be synthetic, complementary, or genomic DNA. If a certain restriction fragment can be recovered from the gel after electrophoresis, it may contain the genomic DNA of interest. If not, an mRNA template is used to immediately produce a complementary DNA or cDNA fragment. Affinity column chromatography is used to separate the polyadenylated mRNAs from other RNA types. Reverse transcriptase is subsequently used to copy these mRNAs into cDNAs. The unbroken coding sequence of a gene must be present in the cDNA since it is produced from mRNA in this instance, and the rDNA molecule will synthesise the eukaryotic gene product in a prokaryotic cell.\nInsertion of a Foreign DNA Segment into a Vector: The isolated cDNA is fragmented using a particular restriction enzyme in order to produce particular cohesive ends. The cohesive ends produced are similar to the cDNA since the cloning vector is also subjected to the same restriction enzyme treatment. In order to insert a double-stranded cDNA into a cloning vector, single-stranded or ss-DNA sequences that are complementary to a tract of DNA at the termini of a linearized vector must be added to both termini. Sticky ends must be added to both termini in order for rDNA molecules to form effectively.\nTransfer of rDNA into Bacterial Cell: Before the rDNA can be multiplied by cloning, it must be taken up by an appropriate bacterial host cell, which is then transformed. To put it another way, a host bacterial cell must accept the plasmid containing the foreign gene and begin transcription of that gene. \u201cTransformation\u201d refers to the process of introducing a plasmid containing foreign DNA into a cell. The mixture is subjected to a gentle heat shock, which causes the uptake of the DNA to occur more frequently. By allowing the bacteria to proliferate in the antibiotic selection medium, the selection of altered cells is accomplished.\nRecombinant Clone Detection: The next step is to choose or screen out the few colonies that have the recombinant plasmid; using antibiotics is one of the simplest and most effective ways to do this. The altered bacterial cells are plated on a medium with a variety of antibiotics. As the antibiotic resistance gene of the plasmid permits the bacteria to multiply, the colonies that proliferate can be said to have a plasmid. For instance, the plasmid pBR 322 carries genes for tetracycline resistance and ampicillin resistance (ampr) (tetr). As a result, the ability of the trans-formants to grow on media containing one (or both) of these antibiotics can be used to identify them.\n\nAlso read: Genome India Project (GIP) \u2013 ClearIAS\n\nDNA cloning procedures\n\nThere are numerous uses for DNA cloning. Let\u2019s look at how DNA cloning can be utilised to get bacteria to produce a protein, like human insulin. Basic actions include:\n\nRip the plasmid open, then \u201cpaste\u201d the gene inside. DNA ligase and restriction enzymes, which cleave DNA, are both necessary for this process (which joins DNA).\nInfect bacteria with the plasmid. Antibiotic selection can be used to determine which bacteria incorporated the plasmid.\nPlasmid-carrying bacteria should be multiplied and used as \u201cfactories\u201d to produce the protein. Purify the protein that was extracted from the bacteria.\n\nRead also: Virus \u2013 Definition, Structure, and Types \u2013 ClearIAS\n\nCloning Techniques\n\nApplication areas for DNA cloning are numerous. Let\u2019s look at how DNA cloning is used, for instance, to get bacteria to produce a protein (like human insulin). Basic gene cloning procedures include:\n\n1. Cutting and Pasting DNA\nAt or near a specific target sequence of DNA recognised by a restriction enzyme, DNA is cut into two pieces.\nThe cut ends produced by many restriction enzymes have brief, single-stranded overhangs.\nTwo molecules can base pair with one another if their overhangs match.\nThe molecular glue, also known as DNA ligase, is used to link them if they can\u2019t come together to form an intact DNA molecule.\nGaps in the DNA backbone are filled by DNA ligase.\n\nAlso Read: Gene Editing \u2013 What is CRISPR-Cas9? \u2013 Clear IAS\n\nUsing a carefully chosen restriction enzyme, the DNA is digested which gives a:\n\nThe plasmid with a single-cut site\nThe target gene fragment with a cut site near each end\nThen, the fragments are combined with DNA ligase, which links them to make a recombinant plasmid containing the gene.\n2. Bacterial Transformation and Selection\nPlasmids and other DNA fragments can be introduced into bacteria, such as the E. coli used, in a process called transformation.\nDuring this process, specially prepared bacterial cells are given a shock (such as high temperature) that encourages them to take up foreign DNA.\nAn antibiotic resistance gene, which enables bacteria to endure in the presence of a particular antibiotic, is typically found in plasmids.\nHence, on nutrient plates containing the antibiotic, it is possible to choose bacteria that take up the plasmid.\nBacteria lacking the plasmid gene will perish, whereas those with the plasmid gene can survive and procreate.\nNot every colony has the appropriate plasmid.\nThis is due to the fact that during ligation, the DNA fragments do not always adhere exactly as anticipated.\nTherefore, a number of colonies are examined. Plasmids are frequently examined using techniques like polymerase chain reactions and restriction enzyme digestion.\n3. Manufacture of Protein\nAfter finding a bacterial colony containing the appropriate plasmid, it is possible to expand it into a vast culture of plasmid-carrying bacteria.\nLarge quantities of protein are produced by the bacteria, which act as factories.\nFor instance, if the human insulin gene is present on the plasmid, the bacteria would begin to transcribe the gene and translate the mRNA to make many molecules of human insulin protein.\nThe bacterial cells can be lysed to release the protein once it has been created. In addition to the target protein, there are numerous additional proteins and macromolecules floating around in bacteria (e.g., insulin).\nThis necessitates the use of several biochemical procedures to purify or separate the target protein from the other components of the cells.\nApplications of gene cloning\n\nGene cloning has several applications in the fields of medicine and science. Examples of some of these include:\n\nBiopharmaceuticals: Human proteins with biomedical uses are created using DNA cloning. E. coli-based insulin synthesis is one instance. Additional examples are tissue plasminogen activator, which is used to treat strokes, and human growth hormones, which are used to treat people who cannot naturally make this hormone.\nGene Therapy: A specific gene that is missing from a patient\u2019s body as a result of a genetic condition is provided by gene therapy. It was possible to create plasmids with a normal copy of the cystic fibrosis gene via DNA cloning. The lung function deterioration rate was reduced in cystic fibrosis patients after plasmids were administered to their lungs.\nGene Analysis: To better understand the function of a particular gene and how it works in an organism, biologists frequently utilise DNA cloning to produce artificial, recombinant copies of genes.\n\nArticle Written By: Atheena Fathima Riyas",

For example, butter contains about 3% trans fatty acid.\n\nArtificial trans fats are heavily controlled or outlawed in many countries due to the harmful effects of trans fat intake.\n\nThe industrially-produced trans fatty acid is formed in an industrial process that adds hydrogen to vegetable oil converting the liquid into a solid, resulting in \u201cpartially hydrogenated\u201d oil (PHO).\n\nPartially hydrogenated oils (PHO) are solid at room temperature and prolong the shelf life of products.\nThey are primarily used for deep frying and as an ingredient in baked goods.\nPHOs were first introduced into the food supply in the early 20th century as a replacement for butter and lard; they are not a natural part of the human diet and are fully replaceable\n\nIndustrially produced trans-fatty acids are commonly found in packaged foods, baked goods, cooking oils, and spreads.\n\nPHO is an ingredient in many foods, including margarine, vegetable shortening, and Vanaspati ghee; fried foods and doughnuts; baked goods such as crackers, biscuits, and pies; and pre-mixed products such as the pancake and hot chocolate mix.\nBaked and fried street and restaurant foods often contain industrially-produced trans fat.\n\nAll of these products can be made without industrially produced trans fatty acid.\n\nAlso read: Diabetes: Symptoms, Types, and Care\n\nTypes and components of fats in food\nSaturated fat\nUnsaturated fat- Monounsaturated fat, Polyunsaturated fat\n\nComponents of fat\n\nFatty acid- Omega-3, Omega-6, Omega-7, Omega-9\nTriglyceride\nCholesterol\n\nManufactured fats\n\nFat hydrogenation- Trans fat\nFat interesterification\nHealth impact of trans fat\n\nTrans fatty acid intake is responsible for up to 500 000 premature deaths from coronary heart disease each year around the world.\n\nHigh trans fatty acid intake increases the risk of death from any cause by 34%, coronary heart disease deaths by 28%, and coronary heart disease by 21%.\n\nThis is likely due to the effect on lipid levels: trans fatty acid increases LDL (\u201cbad\u201d) cholesterol levels while lowering HDL (\u201cgood\u201d) cholesterol levels.\n\nTrans fatty acid has no known health benefits.\n\nIt is also associated with a higher risk of developing obesity, type 2 diabetes, metabolic syndrome, insulin resistance, infertility, and certain types of cancers and can also lead to compromised fetal development.\n\nCurrently, 9 of the 16 countries with the highest estimated proportion of coronary heart disease deaths caused by trans fatty acid intake do not have a best-practice policy.\n\nThey are Australia, Azerbaijan, Bhutan, Ecuador, Egypt, Iran (Islamic Republic), Nepal, Pakistan, and the Republic of Korea.\nGlobal trans fat Elimination\n\nWHO launched a REPLACE campaign in 2018 for the global-level elimination of trans-fats in industrially produced edible oils by 2023.\n\nREPLACE is an action package developed by the WHO that supports governments to ensure the prompt, complete, and sustained elimination of industrially-produced trans fatty acids from the food supply.\nThe practical, 6-step package calls for the promotion of the use and consumption of healthier fats and oils, and the elimination of industrially-produced trans fatty acids, to be achieved through regulatory actions while establishing solid monitoring systems and creating awareness among policy-makers, producers, suppliers, and the public.\n\nForty-three countries have now implemented best-practice policies for tackling trans fatty acids in food, with 2.8 billion people protected globally.\n\nBest practices in trans fat elimination policies follow specific criteria established by WHO and limit industrially produced trans fatty acid in all settings. There are two best-practice policy alternatives:\n\nmandatory national limit of 2 grams of industrially produced trans fat per 100 grams of total fat in all foods;\nmandatory national ban on the production or use of partially hydrogenated oils (a major source of trans fat) as an ingredient in all foods.\n\nWhile most trans fatty acid elimination policies to date have been implemented in higher-income countries (largely in the Americas and in Europe).\n\nAn increasing number of middle-income countries are implementing or adopting these policies, including Argentina, Bangladesh, India, Paraguay, the Philippines, and Ukraine.\n\nIn 2023, WHO recommends that countries focus on these four areas:\n\nadopting best-practice policy\nmonitoring and surveillance\nhealthy oil replacements\nadvocacy\n\nWHO guidance has been developed to help countries make rapid advances in these areas.\n\nWHO also encourages food manufacturers to eliminate industrially produced trans fatty acids from their products, aligning with the commitment made by the International Food and Beverage Alliance (IFBA).\n\nMajor suppliers of oils and fats are asked to remove industrially produced trans fatty acids from the products sold to food manufacturers globally.\n\nIndian efforts for trans fat elimination\n\nRecognizing the health hazards associated with the consumption of industrial trans fats, FSSAI intended to eliminate trans fatty acids from the diet in a phased manner by 2022.\n\nTherefore, FSSAI employed two-pronged strategies to achieve its goal of \u201cFreedom from Trans Fat @75.\u201d\n\nOn the supply side, FSSAI has notified several crucial regulations to regulate trans fat in industrial products, and encouraged the edible oil industry and food business operators to eliminate trans fatty acids from their products.\nOn the demand side, FSSAI has launched a mass media campaign \u201cHeart Attack Rewind\u201d- a 30-second Public Service Announcement (PSA) with the aim to create awareness about the harmful effects of trans fatty acid.\n\nFSSAI capped the amount of trans fatty acids (TFA) in oils and fats to 3% for 2021 and 2% by 2022 from the current permissible limit of 5% through an amendment to the Food Safety and Standards (Prohibition and Restriction on Sales) Regulations.\n\nAs part of the \u2018Eat Right India\u2019 movement\u2019, edible oil associations, bakery associations, individual bakeries, and chefs have voluntarily committed to eliminating/reducing industrial TFA from their products by signing pledges.\n\nWay forward\n\nChange can be initiated by increasing knowledge about the negative effects of trans fatty acids and the necessity of lowering their use among the general public and the food industry.\n\nGovernments can set up monitoring and enforcement mechanisms to make sure food producers follow laws and labeling specifications.\n\nIncluding saturated fatty acid (SFA) and trans fat content on packaged food nutrition labels allows monitoring of compliance with mandatory trans fat limits and concomitant changes in SFA.\nLabelling provides a foundation for either voluntary programs to limit trans fat or local/national laws or regulation.\n\nReplacing trans fatty acids with healthier oils/fats in the food supply is a low-cost way for governments to save the lives of their citizens.\n\nExperiences in several countries demonstrate that industrially-produced trans fatty acids can be replaced by healthier oils.\nCosts to implement best practice interventions (i.e. regulatory limits on trans fat) are likely well under the commonly accepted thresholds of cost-effectiveness.\nWHO recommends trans fatty acid elimination as a cost-effective intervention for low- and middle-income countries.\nGovernments can eliminate the cause of 7% of cardiovascular diseases globally with a low-cost investment.\n\nInvesting in the study and creation of fresh methods and components that can take the place of trans fats in food by the R&D sector will be another way forward toward the elimination of trans fats.\n\n-Article written by Swathi Satish",

Maternal-fetal cell transfer occurs at or close to term to strengthen both the mother\u2019s and the foetus\u2019 immune systems in advance of labour. As a result, cord blood at the time of birth is a great source of immune system cells and stem cells.\n\nA System that preserves umbilical cord blood for use in the future is known as a Cord Blood Bank.\n\nPrivate and public cord blood banks have emerged in response to the prospect of using cord blood to treat immunological and blood-related illnesses.\n\n\ud83d\udc49 Which year are YOU targeting for success in the IAS/IPS/IFS Exam? \ud83d\ude80\n\n(1) \u21d2 UPSC 2025: Prelims cum Mains\n\n(2) \u21d2 UPSC 2026: Prelims cum Mains\n\n(3) \u21d2 UPSC 2027 Prelims cum Mains\n\nTip: Know more about ClearIAS Courses (Online/Offline)\n\nPublic cord blood banks operate similarly to public blood banks in that they accept donations to be utilised for anybody in need. Historically, the medical establishment has been more open to the idea of public cord blood banking. Private cord blood banks only keep cord blood for the donor or the donor\u2019s family to potentially use.\n\nHowever, the Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR) asserts that there is no scientific support for cord blood storage for future self-use, posing moral and social concerns.\n\nThe ICMR does not advocate using stem cells for commercial purposes and Commercial cord blood banking also.\n\nWhen the mother is expecting the next child and there is an older child in the family with a problem that can be treated with these cells, private cord blood preservation is advised.\n\nIn other cases, parents should be made aware of the current restrictions on banking.\n\nAlso read: Sickle Cell Disease\n\nCord Blood\n\nThe blood from the newborn that is still present in the placenta and umbilical cord after birth is known as cord blood. Umbilical cord blood is a rich source of stem cells; cord blood banking is the process of conserving it for use in the future.\n\nHematopoietic stem cells, which are unique cells, are present in them and can be employed to cure certain disorders.\n\nIn the body, hematopoietic stem cells can develop into many types of blood cells.\n\nWorldwide, cord blood banking is advised as a source of hematopoietic stem cells for transplantation for haematological malignancies and illnesses where its usage is advised (derived from bone marrow, peripheral blood, or umbilical cord blood).\n\nThe utility of cord blood as a source of stem cells for any other ailments has not yet been shown.\n\nCollection and Cryopreservation of Cord Blood\n\nAfter the umbilical cord has been severed, cord blood is collected from the foetal end of the cord, taking up to 75 +/- 23 mL from the newborn. Usually, it is completed ten minutes after delivering delivery.\n\nThe placenta may be used to obtain more stem cells. The placenta is transported to the stem cell lab, where it is processed for extra stem cells after the healthcare professional takes cord blood from the placental end of the umbilical cord. In order to guarantee that there will be enough cells for a transplant, sufficient cord blood collection requires at least 75mL.\n\nBefore the cord blood is kept for future use, it is tested for viruses, such as HIV and Hepatitis B and C, and tissue typing is done to ascertain the kind of human leukocyte antigen.\n\nAdditionally, it will be checked for bacterial and fungal growth as well as nucleated cell count, cell viability, blood group antigen ABO & Rh blood group system, molecular cluster, and blood group antigen.\n\nThe cord blood unit is collected, sent to the lab for processing, and then frozen. There are numerous methods for processing a cord blood unit, and opinions on the optimum method vary.\n\nRed blood cells can be removed using some processing techniques while being retained using others. For the cord blood to survive the cryogenic process, a cryopreserved is added regardless of how the unit is processed. The cord blood unit can be placed in a liquid nitrogen tank to maintain freezing at 196 \u00b0C after being gradually cooled to 90 \u00b0C.\n\nTo keep the cells alive while they are being frozen, the slow freezing procedure is crucial. Even though many cryopreservation protocols include employing dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO), gradual or controlled rate cooling, and quick thawing, there isn\u2019t currently agreement on the best practices for these cord blood cells.\n\nUses of Cord Blood\n\nDespite primarily coming from donors, cord blood stem cells are now being used to treat a number of deadly diseases, most notably malignancies, blood disorders, and genetic diseases of the blood and immune system.\n\nIn 1988, a six-year-old boy with Fanconi anaemia received the first successful treatment using cord blood stem cells that had been clinically studied. Since that time, cord blood has gained more and more acceptance as a source of stem cells for use in stem cell therapy.\n\nRecent research has revealed that cord blood transplants have special benefits over conventional bone marrow transplants, especially for children.\n\nIn rare circumstances where a suitable bone marrow donor cannot be found, cord blood transplants can even save a patient\u2019s life. Siblings and other family members with the same tissue type as you can also receive cord blood stem cells. There is a 25% probability that siblings will match, and there is a 50% chance that grandparents and parents will match using cord blood.\n\nAdvantages of Cord Blood Banking\nCompared to bone marrow, more people can obtain stem cells from cord blood. This is due to the fact that, unlike a bone marrow transplant, cord blood does not need to closely match the recipient\u2019s own blood.\nThe probability that a person\u2019s body will reject stem cells from cord blood is lower than that of bone marrow.\nDuring cancer therapies, cord blood stem cells may help the immune system. This is not a method of using bone marrow stem cells.\nCompared to collecting bone marrow, collecting cord blood is less difficult, uncomfortable, and dangerous for the donor.\nThe newborn or the person giving birth is not in danger from the cord blood harvest.\nDonating cord blood to public banks could help save other people\u2019s lives.\nPublic Bank of Cord Blood\n\nSimilar to public blood banks, public cord blood banks accept contributions from anyone, discard donations that don\u2019t pass certain quality control standards and use national registries to identify recipients for their samples.\n\nPublic banks frequently blended many samples together when preparing the therapy for a single patient since patients who need cord blood frequently require more cells than a single harvest would have provided.\n\nSince cord blood transplants don\u2019t require an exact genetic match as bone marrow transplants do, it\u2019s simpler to give patients samples from unrelated donors.\n\nIt\u2019s common to hear that between 60 and 80% of gifts to public banks are eliminated because they contain medical waste. The majority of this is due to the fact that most cord blood collections fail to capture enough viable cells. Some of this is due to contamination that occasionally happens during collection or difficulties arising from shipment.\n\nPublic cord blood banking has been more widely accepted by the medical community because matches are almost always likely to be better there than in a private bank, and because it doesn\u2019t have the same problems that cord blood from private banks does (such as potential lower quality control and lower medical usefulness of using a patient\u2019s own potentially diseased cord blood).\n\nPrivate Bank of Cord Blood\n\nParents generally pay a high price for private banking, which is not covered by insurance. The utilisation of cord blood may also be influenced by the enterprise\u2019s long-term profitability. Therefore, whether the expecting parent should spend on cord blood banking depends in part on whether the expense is justified by the likelihood of using cord blood in the future and the benefits of doing so.\n\nVerifying a possible private bank\u2019s credentials is crucial.\n\nThe \u201cHuman Cells, Tissues, and Cellular and Tissue Based-Products\u201d category of the Food and Drug Administration in the US governs the use of cord blood.\n\nPrivate banks are subject to less strict regulatory requirements since the FDA classifies cord blood stored at public banks as \u201cdrugs\u201d but does not classify cord blood stored at private banks for use by the donor as a drug.\n\nOwnership of Cord Blood\n\nHuman umbilical cord blood carries the baby\u2019s DNA and cells. However, the approval of the mother alone is typically required for the collection, and the father\u2019s assent is very infrequently taken into account.\n\nAs of 2007, the contracts of the biggest cord blood banks do not expressly indicate that the cord blood belongs to the donors and the child with all the rights and privileges one would reasonably expect from ownership. The ambiguity opens for future uses that are not permitted by the donors or the child. Most privately run cord blood banks give mothers complete ownership of the cord blood they bank up until the minor from whom the cord blood was drawn turns 18 years old. At that point, the minor has full ownership rights to any stored cord blood.\n\nConcerns Related to Cord Blood Banking\n\nIt may not be wise or effective to use one\u2019s own cord blood cells, particularly in situations of leukaemia and cancer in children. Because the blood also carries the same genetic abnormality, children who develop immunological disorders frequently cannot receive a transplant using their own cord blood.\n\nAdditional problems include the potential for the cord blood unit to be contaminated with same cancer that was discovered later in life. For instance, abnormal cells have been found in filters containing newborn blood of children whose acute leukaemia was not discovered until they were between the ages of 2 and 6 years old.\n\nConclusion\n\nCommercial cord blood banking involves storing a newborn\u2019s umbilical cord blood stem cells for potential future medical use. The decision to bank cord blood is personal and should be based on individual circumstances and considerations such as the family history of genetic disorders and the likelihood of using the stored cells. It is important to carefully research and compare different cord blood banking options and consider the cost, storage options, and reputation of the facility before making a decision.\n\nArticle written by:\u00a0 Aryadevi E S",

The limited solar atmosphere can suddenly and violently expel bubbles of gas and magnetic fields known as coronal mass ejections where these fields are closed, frequently over sunspot groupings.\nSolar flares are powerful radiation bursts caused by the release of magnetic energy linked to sunspots.\n\n(Sunspots: Dark patches on the solar surface are home to intense magnetic fields continually moving. They are the size of the entire Earth. Over the course of days or weeks, sunspots form and disappear.)\n\nAlso read Parker Solar Probe: Explore the Sun \u2013 ClearIAS\n\nSolar storm history\n\nThe history of a solar storm on earth moves back to 1859.\n\nIn 1859, the first solar storm ever observed made it to Earth in just under 17 hours.\nThe telegraph network was damaged, and several operators received electric shocks.\nA solar storm that struck in 1921 affected the telegraph and train networks in New York, and a 1989 small-scale storm in Quebec, Canada, brought down the electricity infrastructure.\nAccording to a 2013 assessment, if a solar storm like the one in 1859 struck the US now, 20\u201340 million people might go without power for a year or two, and the overall economic damage would be between $0.6 and $2.6 trillion.\nTypes of Solar Storms\n\nSolar storms arise in the following varieties:\n\nSolar flares: A solar flare is an abrupt increase in brightness on the Sun that is typically seen close to its surface or near a group of sunspots. A coronal mass ejection frequently, but not always, occurs together with strong flares. In total solar irradiation, often known as the \u201csolar constant,\u201d even the strongest flares are hardly noticeable.\nCoronal Mass Ejection (CME): The solar corona releases a considerable amount of plasma together with a magnetic field. They frequently appear after solar flares and are typically seen during an eruption of a solar prominence.\nGeomagnetic Storm: A geomagnetic storm, also known as a solar storm, is a brief disruption of the Earth\u2019s magnetosphere brought on by an interaction between the magnetic fields of the Sun and the Earth.\nSolar Particle Events: A solar particle event, also known as a solar proton event (SPE), or prompt proton event, occurs when particles (mostly protons) emitted by the Sun are accelerated either by coronal mass ejection shocks in interplanetary space or by flares that occur close to the Sun during the event.\n\u00a0Effects on Earth\n\nThe following effects of solar storms could be felt by Earth:\n\nSolar storms and flares that are close enough to Earth can affect the upper atmosphere and the space weather in the vicinity of the planet.\nGlobal positioning systems (GPS), radio, and satellite communications operations may be impacted by solar storms.\nGPS navigation systems and high-frequency radio communications are both affected by geomagnetic storms.\nPrograms for space research, electricity networks, and aircraft operations are all at risk.\nThis can result in a variety of issues for pipeline engineers.\nErroneous flow information can be transmitted by pipeline flow metres, which can also significantly speed up pipeline corrosion. Geomagnetically induced currents in pipes can be created by geomagnetic fields that fluctuate quickly.\nHumans and other mammals are susceptible to radiation sickness from extremely high-energy particles like those transported by coronal mass ejections.\nThe Earth\u2019s magnetic field is momentarily perturbed when a coronal mass ejection hits the atmosphere.\nMany urban centres are at risk because it can veer satellites off course and make them fall to the earth\u2019s surface.\nAccording to some scientists, migratory creatures like birds and bees that use magneto reception for navigation may also be impacted.\n\nAlso Read: Augmented Reality \u2013 ClearIAS\n\nConclusion\n\nThe ability of scientists to predict solar storms is continuously developing. Clearly, scientists can warn of greater solar activity after anything explodes from the Sun. However, it\u2019s still very challenging to anticipate when an outburst may happen. Scientists keep an eye on sunspot activity and issue alerts when one is headed directly for Earth.

Stay updated with our latest content and enhance your exam readiness.\n\nCAR T-cell treatments represent a significant advance in the fight against cancer. CAR T-cell therapies use the patient\u2019s cells, as opposed to chemotherapy and immunotherapy, which both involve taking medications. They are altered in the lab to stimulate T-cells and specifically target tumour cells.\nIt consists of two components: CAR and T. T is short for cytotoxic. A patient\u2019s T cells are isolated from a blood sample as part of the CAR-T cell treatment process. T cells are a specific type of white blood cell (WBC).\nTo create a chimeric antigen receptor or CAR, these T cells underwent genetic engineering in a laboratory.\nCARs are artificial receptors created especially to steer T cells away from their regular targets and help them identify and focus on tumour cells.\nA binder on the exterior of a CAR enables the T cell to adhere to tumour cells.\nThe modified T cell is activated by binding to a tumour cell and produces inflammatory cytokines, which promote T cell development and activity and increase their capacity to fight cancer.\nAfter being encouraged to multiply in huge numbers over seven to ten days, these CAR-T cells are subsequently infused back into the patient.\nThe infusion procedure typically takes place in a hospital so medical professionals can keep an eye out for any symptoms of an excessive immune reaction to tumours, which could be fatal to the patient.\nThe cells directly trigger the patient\u2019s immune system against cancer, making the treatment more clinically successful and even more specific than targeted drugs. That is why they are referred to as \u201cliving medications.\u201d\nLeukemias (cancers developing from cells that make white blood cells) and lymphomas have been approved for CAR T-cell treatment (arising from the lymphatic system).\nA new era in the treatment of tumours that are resistant to conventional therapies has begun with the development of CAR-T cells.\nPatients with certain forms of blood and lymph node malignancies receive CAR T cell therapy as a third or second-line treatment. Those in India who are interested in receiving this treatment must fly to other nations, primarily the US.\nIn industrialised countries, the T-cell receptor is frequently employed in immunotherapy during the treatment of cancer. However, the technology had not yet become widely used in India.\nThe procedure of CAR T-cell Therapy\nT cells from a patient\u2019s blood are collected, and in a lab, the gene for a unique receptor that attaches to a certain protein on the patient\u2019s cancer cells is added.\nThe chimeric antigen receptor is the name of the unique receptor (CAR).\nThe CAR T cells are expanded in a lab and administered to the patient by infusion in large numbers.\nLentiviral technology is used. This is a technique used in gene therapy to insert, change, or delete genes in organisms using lentiviruses, a family of viruses that cause diseases like AIDS (acquired immunodeficiency syndrome).\nTo locate and eliminate cancer cells, a particular type of white blood cell known as T cell is modified in the lab as part of the treatment.\nBecause it involves changing the genes in T cells to enable them to attack malignant cells, it is also frequently referred to as a form of cell-based gene therapy.\nIn CAR T-cell treatment, blood is collected from the patient to collect T-cells, which are immune cells important in the destruction of tumour cells.\nThese cells are altered in the lab to express particular proteins known as chimeric antigen receptors on their surface (CAR).\nThey are drawn to certain proteins found on the outer layer of tumour cells.\nBecause of this alteration in the cellular structure, CAR T-cells can efficiently bind to and kill tumours.\nThe patient\u2019s immune system has to clear the tumour as the last step in the destruction process.\nWhere is CAR T-cell therapy is used?\nCAR T-cell treatment has been authorised as of right now for leukaemias and lymphomas (cancers originating from the cells that create white blood cells) (arising from the lymphatic system).\nThese malignancies develop when a single cell clone reproduces uncontrollably; after a cell type undergoes malignant transformation, it multiplies into millions of identical clones.\nThe target for CAR T-cells is hence dependable and consistent.\nPatients who have tumours that have reappeared following an initially successful treatment or that haven\u2019t responded to prior chemotherapy or immunotherapy combinations can also benefit from CAR T-cell therapy.\nIt responds at varying rates. The efficacy can reach 90% in some leukaemias and lymphomas, although it is much lower in other malignancies.\nHow widespread is CAR T-cell therapy\u2019s use?\nA significant obstacle to the utilisation of CAR T-cells has been the difficulty of their preparation. Only in 2022 was the first indigenously designed medicine in India effectively carried out, even though the first clinical trial demonstrating their efficacy was published about a decade earlier.\nThis therapy also requires a significant amount of technical and human resources. More than a million dollars is spent on treatments in the US. Trials are already being conducted in India by businesses trying to produce CAR T-cells locally for a much lower price. The initial findings are favourable.\nWhy CAR T-cell therapy be expensive in India?\nAny novel therapy introduced in India must overcome the twin obstacles of cost and benefit. Critics claim that building facilities in India may be unnecessary or inappropriate because, even when it becomes more accessible, most Indians will not be able to afford CAR T-cell therapy. Wealthy patients who need the therapy are already getting it elsewhere.\nEvery patient has the right to get the care that meets a high level of practice; the next step may be to find ways to make it more affordable.\nThe objective behind investments in the development of these technologies in India is that, like other originally pricey medical procedures like robotic surgery, we would be able to offer economies of scale.\nIn India, the sheer number of patients has the potential to lower treatment costs.\nTo make CAR T cell therapy available in India, two startups\u2014ImmunoACT and Immuneel Therapeutics\u2014are actively at work.\nBoth of these businesses claim that the therapy will be less expensive in India than it is in wealthy nations like the US, where it may run as high as Rs 2-3 crore.\nSignificance of CAR T-cell Therapy\n\nGreater clinical success is achieved with CAR T-cell therapies because they are even more targeted than targeted drugs and directly activate the patient\u2019s immune system to combat cancer. They are referred to as \u201cliving medications\u201d because of this.\n\n\ud83d\udc49 Which year are YOU targeting for success in the IAS/IPS/IFS Exam? \ud83d\ude80\n\n(1) \u21d2 UPSC 2025: Prelims cum Mains\n\n(2) \u21d2 UPSC 2026: Prelims cum Mains\n\n(3) \u21d2 UPSC 2027 Prelims cum Mains\n\nTip: Know more about ClearIAS Courses (Online/Offline)\n\nCompared to conventional forms of treatment, the novel CAR T-cell immunotherapy shows promise for patients with ovarian cancer.\n\nHCAR19 therapy\nThe individuals underwent autologous HCAR19 therapy (humanised CAR19 therapy created by IIT Bombay), and it was shown that only low-grade Cytokine Release Syndrome (CRS) was reported in 40% of subjects. There were no dose-limiting toxicities.\nNo neurotoxicity syndrome\nImmune effector cell-associated neurotoxicity syndrome wasn\u2019t present in any of the subjects.\nSafer version\nOverall, the novel humanised HCAR19 tested in adult lymphoma phase one clinical trial was proven to be safe and has displayed encouraging early signals of efficacy.\nNo deaths\nNone of the individuals required ICU admission following CAR-T cell therapy, and there were no CAR-T treatment-related fatalities.\nWhat are T Cells?\nWhite blood cells called T lymphocytes sometimes referred to as T cells, are a key component of the immune response.\nThey may aid in the fight against cancer and protect the body from infection. also known as a thymocyte and a T lymphocyte.\nAs part of cell-mediated immunity, T cells assist the body in identifying and reacting to foreign substances such as viruses, bacteria, and aberrant cells such as cancer cells.\nThe helper T cell and the cytotoxic T cell are the two main subtypes of T cells.\nHelper T cells, as their names imply, \u201cassist\u201d other immune system cells, whereas cytotoxic T cells \u201ckill\u201d virally-infected cells and malignancies.\nChallenges of CAR T-cell Therapy\n\nIt responds at varying rates. The efficacy can reach 90% in some leukaemias and lymphomas, but it is much lower in other types of cancer.\n\nPreparation:\nCAR T-cell therapy utilisation has been severely constrained by how challenging it is to create them.\nA decade ago, the first successful clinical trial was published, and the first Indian-developed medicine was used in 2021.\nSide Effects:\nThe efficacy can reach 90% in some leukaemias and lymphomas, although it is much lower in other malignancies.\nThe possible negative effects are potentially significant, linked to neurological symptoms and cytokine release syndrome (widespread immune system activity and collateral harm to healthy cells in the body) (severe confusion, seizures, and speech impairment).\nAffordability:\nThe introduction of CAR T-cell treatment in India may run into financial difficulties.\nCritics contend that because most people will still not be able to afford it, developing CAR T-cell treatment in India may not be cost-effective.\nConclusion\n\nCAR T-cell therapy is a promising and innovative approach to treating cancer. It involves the genetic modification of a patient\u2019s T cells to create chimeric antigen receptors (CARs) that target specific cancer cells. This treatment has shown great promise in clinical trials and has already been approved for the treatment of certain types of leukaemia and lymphoma.\n\nHowever, there are still some challenges that need to be addressed, including the cost and availability of the therapy, as well as the potential side effects and long-term consequences. In addition, more research is needed to determine the best approach for using CAR T-cell therapy in different types of cancer, as well as the optimal combination with other treatments.\n\nIn conclusion, CAR T-cell therapy holds significant promise as a cancer treatment and has already demonstrated remarkable results in some patients. However, it is important to continue to study and understand its benefits and limitations so that it can be used effectively and safely in the future.\n\nUPSC Civil Services Examination, Previous Year Question (PYQ)\n\n1.

How are they different from each other? Read the article to know more about major telescopes in India and the world.\n\nA telescope is a device used to observe distant things by gathering electromagnetic radiation (such as visible light).\n\nThe term \u201ctelescope\u201d today describes a broad range of devices that can detect various parts of the electromagnetic spectrum, as well as in some circumstances, other kinds of detectors.\n\nAlso read: SARAS Radio Telescope\n\nTable of Contents\n\nOperation of a telescope\nTypes of telescopes\nGamma-ray\nX-ray\u00a0telescopes\nUltra-violet\nVisible light\nMicrowave telescopes\nRadio\u00a0telescopes\nSquare Kilometre Array\nSpitzer Space Telescope\nHubble Space Telescope\nThe James Webb Space Telescope\nFermi Gamma-ray Space Telescope\nThe Kepler Space Telescope\nARIES telescope\nIndian telescopes\nAstrosat\nThirty Meter Telescope\nSARAS Telescope\nLiquid-Mirror Telescope\nOperation of a telescope\n\nSubscribe to the ClearIAS YouTube Channel for more informative videos on UPSC preparation, tips, and strategies.

However, the size of the objective lens, sometimes referred to as the aperture, determines a telescope\u2019s performance almost entirely.\nTo study objects in space, astronomers use a variety of telescopes sensitive to various regions of the electromagnetic spectrum.\nDifferent light wavelengths are detected by various detectors differently.\n\n\u00a0Need of telescopes\n\n\ud83d\udc49 Which year are YOU targeting for success in the IAS/IPS/IFS Exam? \ud83d\ude80\n\n(1) \u21d2 UPSC 2025: Prelims cum Mains\n\n(2) \u21d2 UPSC 2026: Prelims cum Mains\n\n(3) \u21d2 UPSC 2027 Prelims cum Mains\n\nTip: Know more about ClearIAS Courses (Online/Offline)\n\nWe need a larger eye so that we can collect more light coming from an object in order to see distant objects.\nWith more light, we can make brighter and larger images to occupy more area on our retinas.\nThe telescopes step in at this point; the telescope lens functions as a large eye to gather more light coming from an object.\nThe large lens in the telescope, known as the objective lens, gathers considerably more light from a far-off object than the eye can handle and concentrates it onto a single point inside the telescope, known as the focal point.\nTypes of telescopes\n\nDifferent types of telescopes are discussed below.\n\nGamma-ray\n\nHigh-energy individual gamma rays are gathered and measured by gamma-ray telescopes from astronomical sources. These must be observed via high-altitude balloons or space missions because they are absorbed by the atmosphere. Supernovae, neutron stars, pulsars, and black holes can all produce gamma rays. Extremely energetic gamma-ray bursts have also been seen, although their identities have not yet been established.\n\nX-ray\u00a0telescopes\n\nX-ray telescopes use high-energy photons known as X-rays for measurement. These can only be seen high in the atmosphere or in space because they cannot go very far through the atmosphere. Black holes in active galactic nuclei, galaxy clusters, stars, supernova remnants, and binary stars with a white dwarf (cataclysmic variable stars), neutron star, or black hole are only a few examples of astronomical objects that generate X-rays (X-ray binaries).\n\nThe Moon is the most notable body in the Solar System that emits X-rays, albeit most of its X-ray brightness comes from reflected solar X-rays. The observed X-ray background is assumed to be the result of a concatenation of numerous unresolved X-ray sources.\n\nUltra-violet\n\nUltraviolet telescopes collect data at wavelengths between 10 to 320 nm, or ultraviolet wavelengths. These wavelengths require observations to be made from the high atmosphere or from space since the light at these wavelengths is absorbed by the Earth\u2019s atmosphere. The Sun, other stars, and galaxies all emit UV radiation.\n\nVisible light\n\nThe earliest branch of astronomy, known as optical or visible-light astronomy, studies light with wavelengths between 400 and 700 nm. Higher resolution images are produced when an optical telescope is placed in space since the distortions and restrictions that are present on the earth are removed.\n\nAmong many other things, optical telescopes are used to observe planets, stars, galaxies, planetary nebulae, and protoplanetary discs.\n\nSince infrared light has lesser energy than visible light, it is typically given off by sources that are either cooler or rapidly moving away from the observer (in this case, Earth). As a result, cold stars (including brown dwarves), nebulae, and redshifted galaxies can all be seen in the infrared.\n\nMicrowave telescopes\n\nIn order to detect cosmological parameters from the Cosmic Microwave Background, microwave space telescopes have mostly been used. Additionally, they use the Sunyaev-Zeldovich effect to assess synchrotron radiation, free-free emission, spinning dust, extragalactic compact sources, and galaxy clusters.\n\nRadio\u00a0telescopes\n\nSince the atmosphere is transparent to radio waves, very long baseline interferometry\u2014which involves simultaneously observing a source with a satellite and a ground-based telescope and correlating their signals to simulate a radio telescope the size of the separation between the two telescopes\u2014makes use of radio telescopes in space. Supernova remnants, masers, gravitational lenses, starburst galaxies, and a variety of other objects can all be observed.\n\nSquare Kilometre Array\n\nA global effort is underway to construct the Square Kilometre Array (SKA), which will eventually have a collecting area larger than one square kilometre (one million square metres).\n\nThe size of the SKA reflects a significant advancement in engineering and research & development toward creating and delivering a special instrument, with the specific design and planning already well along.\n\nImportance of the SKA telescope:\n\nThe telescope, which is expected to be the biggest radio telescope in the world, will be built and operated by SKAO and will be situated in Australia and Africa.\nThe birth of the cosmos, how and when the first stars were born, and the galactic life cycle are a few of the topics that scientists want to answer using this telescope.\nIt would investigate the potential for finding highly advanced civilizations outside of our galaxy and figuring out where gravitational waves originate.\nIn order to precisely time the signals from pulsars in the Milky Way, the telescope will measure neutral hydrogen over cosmic time, according to NASA, and achieve its scientific objectives.\nSpitzer Space Telescope\n\nAs observed by the Spitzer Space Telescope, infrared light is represented by red hues. These regions exhibit the heat that the galaxy\u2019s dusty star-forming lanes release.\n\nThe infrared radiation from cosmic objects, including as distant galaxies, black holes, and even comets in our solar system, is collected by the Spitzer telescope. The first telescope to detect light from an exoplanet was Spitzer.\n\nHubble Space Telescope\n\nThe first significant optical telescope to be installed in space was Hubble, the observatory. Visible light, as seen by the Hubble Space Telescope, is the component that appears yellow. The majority of this light is emitted by stars, which follow the same spiral pattern as the dust lanes visible in infrared.\n\nHubble has provided insight into the size of the universe, the evolution of black holes and galaxies, and the life cycles of stars. Black holes, which swallow up everything in their vicinity, including light, have been discovered by Hubble. The discovery of dark energy, a puzzling component that propels the universe\u2019s expansion at an accelerating rate as time passes, was made possible in large part by the telescope.\n\nAnd it has provided information about gamma-ray bursts, which are intense energy explosions that happen when huge stars collapse. Planets, stars, and galaxies are just a few of the sky objects that Hubble captures in clear images. More than one million observations have been made by Hubble. Hubble has aided in the understanding of galaxies and planet formation. The furthest galaxies ever observed are depicted in an image dubbed \u201cHubble Ultra Deep Field.\u201d\n\nThe James Webb Space Telescope\n\nIt will investigate every stage of the evolution of our Solar System, from the earliest bright glimmers after the Big Bang to the formation of solar systems capable of supporting life on Earth-like planets. Webb is a global partnership involving the Canadian Space Agency, NASA, and the European Space Agency (ESA) (CSA).\n\nFermi Gamma-ray Space Telescope\n\nDark matter, black holes, and spinning pulsars are just a few of the energetic and enigmatic phenomena that gamma rays can illuminate.It quickly obtained an all-sky map of gamma rays from several sources, including our own sun, after entering orbit.\n\nThe Kepler Space Telescope\n\nAlthough this is the first Earth-sized planet found by TESS, additional Earth-sized exoplanets have been found in the past, mostly by NASA\u2019s Kepler Space Telescope, which has since been retired and watched over 530,000 stars. In the end, the Kepler mission found 2,662 planets, many of which were Earth-sized. A small number of these were determined to be in their star\u2019s habitable zone, where a variety of factors may be favourable for supporting life.\n\nARIES telescope\n\nScientists from India, Russia, and Belgium worked together to create the ARIES telescope.The telescope is situated at a height of 2,500 metres near Devasthal, Nainital. The telescope uses cutting-edge technology that allows it to be controlled remotely from any location in the world. The telescope will be used to investigate astronomical debris, magnetic fields, planets, and stars.The scientists will contribute to the study of star structures and magnetic field structures.\n\nIndian telescopes\n\nThe type of telescopes developed by India is discussed here.\n\nAstrosat\n\nOn September 28, 2016, AstroSat, India\u2019s first specialised astronomy satellite, successfully completed its first year of service.The Chandra observatory can only observe in the X-ray spectrum, whereas NASA\u2019s Hubble Telescope gives data in the visible range. Astrosat, on the other hand, would be a multi-wavelength space telescope.\n\nUnlike other space telescopes, ASTROSAT can observe wavelengths across the entire spectrum.In order to avoid having to undergo repairs as HUBBLE did, ASTROSAT was only designed to last for five years.\n\nThe scientific goal of Astrosat:\n\nTo comprehend the high-energy processes occurring in binary star systems that contain neutron stars, black holes, and stars.\nTo calculate the neutron star\u2019s magnetic field.\nTo investigate the high-energy star-forming regions and stellar systems outside of our galaxy.\nTo find new, momentarily brilliant X-ray sources\nThirty Meter Telescope\nOne of the largest visible-light telescopes in the world, with a 30 m prime mirror diameter, would be created as a result of this project. It would be three times broader and nine times larger than the greatest telescope now in existence.\nThe telescope will provide more opportunities for those who are studying and conducting astrophysical research.\nTo oversee the building, upkeep, and management of the telescope, TMT International Observatory LLC (TIO) was founded as a non-profit organisation.\nCompared to the Hubble Space Telescope, which is now the biggest and most versatile telescope in the world, it will capture images that are 12 times sharper.\nSARAS Telescope\nThe SARAS radio telescope in India was built to investigate the galaxy and to deliver many astronomical discoveries as a result.\nThe SARAS 3 radio telescope developed and constructed by astronomers at RRI is the first telescope to do so globally.\nProf. Ravi Subrahmanyan and Prof. N. Udaya Shankar are the creators and principal investigators of SARAS, a specialised high-risk, high-gain experimental effort of RRI.\nTo detect incredibly faint radio wave signals from the depths of time, from our \u201cCosmic Dawn,\u201d when the first stars and galaxies formed in the early Universe, SARAS plans to design, build, and deploy in India a precise radio telescope.\nThe Cosmic Dawn signal is anticipated to reach Earth with a wavelength of several metres and a frequency in the radio frequency range of 50\u2013200 MHz due to the universe\u2019s expansion.\n\nAlso Read: ISRO\u2019s World Record PSLV C37 Launch: Top 10 Facts You Should Know \u2013 Clear IAS\n\nLiquid-Mirror Telescope\nThe liquid-Mirror Telescope (LMT), the first of its kind to be operational anywhere in the world, will be commissioned for astronomy.\nThe ILMT will be used to observe asteroids, supernovae, space debris, and all other astronomical objects from a height of 2,450 metres in the Himalayas.\nPreviously constructed telescopes were either used for military operations or to track satellites.\nThe third telescope facility to be built at Devasthal will be ILMT.\nOne of the first locations in the globe to collect astronomical observations is Devasthal.\nThe LMT will begin full-scale scientific operations in October 2022.\nAlongside India\u2019s largest operational Devasthal Optical Telescope, it will be in operation (DOT).\nIndia, Belgium, Canada, Poland, and Uzbekistan are among the nations contributing to the development of ILMT.\n\nArticle Written By: Atheena Fathima Riyas",

an Earth-observation satellite, is being jointly developed by the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) and the Indian Space Research Organisation (ISRO).\n\nNASA-ISRO SAR (NISAR) is a Low Earth Orbit (LEO) observatory.\n\nNISAR will map the entire globe in 12 days and provide spatially and temporally consistent data for understanding changes in Earth\u2019s ecosystems, ice mass, vegetation biomass, sea level rise, groundwater, and natural hazards including earthquakes, tsunamis, volcanoes, and landslides.\n\nIt carries L and S dual band Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR), which operates with the Sweep SAR technique to achieve large swaths with high-resolution data.\nThe SAR payloads mounted on Integrated Radar Instrument Structure (IRIS) and the spacecraft bus are together called an observatory.\n\nJet Propulsion Laboratories and ISRO are realizing the observatory which shall not only meet the respective national needs but also will feed the science community with data encouraging studies related to surface deformation measurements through the repeat-pass InSAR technique.\n\nThis flagship partnership would have major contributions from both agencies.\n\nNASA is responsible for providing the L-Band SAR payload system in which the ISRO supplied S-Band SAR payload and both these SAR systems will make use of a large size (about 12m diameter) common unfurl able reflector antenna.\nIn addition, NASA would provide engineering payloads for the mission, including a Payload Data Subsystem, High-rate Science Downlink System, GPS receivers, and a Solid State Recorder.\n\nThis would be the first dual-frequency radar imaging mission in L-Band & S-Band using an advanced Sweep SAR technique to provide L & S band space-borne SAR data with high repeat cycle, high resolution, and larger swath, with the capability of full-polar metric and interferometric modes of operation.\n\nThe NISAR Observatory will be launched from Satish Dhawan Space Centre (SDSC) SHAR, Sriharikota on the southeast coast of the Indian peninsula, on the GSLV expendable launch vehicle contributed by ISRO.\n\nThe target launch readiness date is January 2024.\nL-Band\n\nThe radio frequency range between 1 and 2 gigahertz is known as the L band according to the Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers (IEEE) (GHz).\n\nThis is at the lower end of the microwave spectrum, and the upper end of the ultra-high frequency (UHF) band.\nS-Band\n\nThe microwave band, which spans frequencies between 2 and 4 gigahertz, is known as the \u201cS-band\u201d by the Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers (IEEE) (GHz).\n\nAs a result, at 3.0 GHz, it crosses the typical dividing line between the UHF and SHF bands.\nWeather radar, surface ship radar, airport surveillance radar for air traffic control, and some communications satellites, particularly those used by NASA to connect with the Space Shuttle and the International Space Station, all use the S-band.\nApplications of NISAR\n\nGeosciences:\n\nIt will provide a means of unraveling complex phenomena, ranging from ecosystem disturbances to ice sheet collapse and natural hazards including earthquakes, tsunamis, volcanoes, and landslides.\nThis is expected to provide impetus to the fast-maturing microwave remote sensing applications in geosciences.\nThe precision interferometric orbits of the mission will enable the mapping of a few millimeters of deformations in the land surface.\n\nCarbon emission:\n\nThe selection of lower frequency bands will cater to the need for better characterization of vegetation, which is vital for global carbon stock estimation and monitoring of carbon fluxes from vegetation.\n\nEarth change:\n\necosystems (vegetation and the carbon cycle)\ndeformation (solid Earth studies)\ncryosphere sciences (primarily as related to climatic drivers and effects on sea level)\n\nCoastal data:\n\nNISAR will acquire data over the Indian Coasts and monitor annual changes in the bathymetry along the deltaic regions.\n\nThe shoreline and erosion accretion also will be monitored.\n\nSea monitoring:\n\nThe NISAR mission will observe sea ice characteristics over the seas surrounding India\u2019s Antarctic polar stations.\nIt can be used to detect marine oil spills and disseminate the spill location during accidental oil seepage for preventive measures.\n\nAlso read: Artemis Accords\n\nSignificance of NISAR\n\nHuman populations are increasing in high-risk areas vulnerable to sea level change, land subsidence, tsunamis, volcanoes, earthquakes, and landslides.\n\nThese hazards already cause thousands of deaths and billions of dollars in damage every year.\nImproved forecasting and mitigation necessitate understanding these natural hazards, with measurements throughout the hazard cycle.\nMany natural disasters deform the land surface subtly before a catastrophic event, and tracking these subtle changes will provide greater insight into hazards such as earthquakes, landslides, and volcanic eruptions.\n\nNISAR\u2019s global and rapid coverage will provide unprecedented opportunities for disaster response, providing data to assist in mitigating and assessing damage, with observations before and after disasters in short time frames.\n\nNISAR maps will allow initial damage estimates to guide ground inspections for damage assessment after any natural disaster as well.\nBecause NISAR\u2019s data will be open access, more policymakers worldwide will be able to use them to meet scientific, societal, and commercial goals than can use other data that are not as accessible.\nConclusion\n\nNISAR is a three-year mission that is expected to be launched in 2024 from Satish Dhawan Space Centre.\n\nISRO will use NISAR for a variety of purposes including agricultural mapping, and monitoring of glaciers in the Himalayas, landslide-prone areas, and changes in the coastline.\n\nISRO will utilize the S-band radar for a minimum of five years.\n\nNASA requires the L-band radar for its global science operations for at least three years.\n\nOur society and economy must mitigate losses from disasters. We need informed decisions to carry out effective mitigation and make the most of our resources sustainably and economically.\n\nBy measuring motions and other changes on the Earth\u2019s surface, we can understand processes occurring at depth and unscramble other impacts.\nThe help of data from NISAR and science-based management and storage of freshwater and energy sources will allow the use of resources more efficiently and sustainably.\n\nNISAR\u2019s data can help people worldwide better manage natural resources and hazards, as well as provide information for scientists to better understand the effects and pace of climate change.\n\n-Article written by Swathi Satish",

NASA\n\nLagrange points are positions in space where objects sent there tend to stay put.\n\nAt Lagrange points, the gravitational pull of two large masses precisely equals the centripetal force required for a small object to move with them.\nThese points in space can be used by spacecraft to reduce fuel consumption needed to remain in position.\n\nLagrange Points are positioned in space where the gravitational forces of a two-body system like the Sun and the Earth produce enhanced regions of attraction and repulsion.\n\nThese can be used by spacecraft to reduce fuel consumption needed to remain in position.\n\nLagrange points are named in honor of Italian-French mathematician Josephy-Louis Lagrange.\n\nThere are five special points where a small mass can orbit in a constant

How is meat produced in a lab? Read the article to know more about cultured meat.\n\nFor the first time, lab-grown meat has received safety clearance from the US Food and Drug Administration. Singapore was the only nation up until this point to permit the sale of items made from domesticated meat.\n\nThe UN Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) predicted that the global meat output would decline to 333 million tonnes in 2020, 1.7% less than in 2019, in its June 2020 Food Outlook Report.\n\nCovid-19 is mostly to blame for the disruption, but it has also increased broad concerns about zoonotic infections, mainly African swine fever and highly dangerous avian influenza. The market for substitute meat will benefit from this.\n\nTable of Contents\n\nCultured\u00a0 Meat\nGlobal Scenario\nBackground of Cultured meat\nDifference between plant-based meat and Cultured meat\nDistinction between traditional beef and cultured meat\nHow is meat produced in a lab?\nBenefits of Cultured meat\nAdvantages of Cultured meat\nIssues with Cultured meat\nChallenges\nConclusion\nCultured\u00a0 Meat\n\nCultured\u00a0 Meat is actual meat that is produced from animal cells. It is also known as cultivated meat, cell-based meat or\u00a0 Lab-grown meat. Without the need to raise and kill animals, this meat can be produced. Instead of using meat from dead animals, cultured meat is created by growing animal cells in a lab. Instead of being raised inside the body of an animal, this meat is generated in cell culture. It tastes, smells, looks, and feels the same as traditional animal flesh and is nutritionally similar.\n\nGlobal Scenario\n\nGovernment funding for cultured meat businesses is considerable worldwide. The governments of Israel, Japan, and the Netherlands, among others, have invested in clean meat businesses. Furthermore, the regulatory bodies in nations like the US are deciding how to promote these products. These initiatives highlight how the clean meat industry has the ability to sustainably feed future generations.\n\n\ud83d\udc49 Which year are YOU targeting for success in the IAS/IPS/IFS Exam? \ud83d\ude80\n\n(1) \u21d2 UPSC 2025: Prelims cum Mains\n\n(2) \u21d2 UPSC 2026: Prelims cum Mains\n\n(3) \u21d2 UPSC 2027 Prelims cum Mains\n\nTip: Know more about ClearIAS Courses (Online/Offline)\n\nBackground of Cultured meat\n\nJason Matheny, who co-authored a groundbreaking article on cultured meat production and founded New Harvest, the first non-profit organisation in the world devoted to advancing in vitro meat research, is credited with popularising the idea of cultured meat in the early 2000s.\n\nAlso Read: Virus \u2013 Definition, Structure, and Types \u2013 ClearIAS\n\nDifference between plant-based meat and Cultured meat\nThe plant-based meat is created using plant sources like soy or pea protein, whereas cultured meat is created by growing cells in a lab.\nThe goal of both is to provide meat substitutes that could feed a lot more people, lessen the risk of zoonotic illnesses, and lessen the environmental impact of meat consumption.\n\nAlso Read:Genetically Modified Crops and Regulations in India \u2013 Clear IAS\n\nDistinction between traditional beef and cultured meat\nCultured or cultivated meat is identical to traditional meat in terms of cellular structure, with the exception that cultured meat is not derived directly from animals.\nCultivated beef might cut land use by more than 95%, emissions that contribute to climate change by 74\u201387%, and nutrient pollution by 94% compared to traditional beef.\nThe likelihood of cultured meat being contaminated by pathogens like salmonella and E Coli is greatly decreased because it is produced in sanitary facilities.\nIt doesn\u2019t need antibiotics either, unlike animals grown for meat, lessening the threat that rising antibiotic resistance poses to public health.\n\nAlso read: Lab-Grown Diamonds\n\nHow is meat produced in a lab?\n\nThe more than the 100-year-old method of in vitro muscle tissue growth is used to produce lab-grown beef.\n\nThe first step in the procedure is to isolate a few cells from premium livestock animals, such as a cow or chicken, and determine which of those cells have the capacity to proliferate and produce mouthwatering meat food products.\nAfter that, we place the cells in a sterile, controlled environment and provide them with the vital nutrients they require to develop normally.\nIn essence, the conditions that naturally occur inside an animal\u2019s body can be recreated to allow for cell growth.\nWhen the meat is ready, we harvest it, go through the normal meat processing steps, and then package, cook, or otherwise make the meat suitable for consumption.\nBenefits of Cultured meat\n\nSustainability, environmental friendliness, animal welfare, food safety, and innovative cuisine are a few advantages of clean meat that could be realised. Additionally, cell-based beef asserts that it is better for the environment.\n\nIt might eliminate the need for contemporary factory farming and problems like animal abuse, e. Coli and salmonella illnesses, and meat tainted with antibiotics.\n\nSalmonella: A group of bacteria by the name of Salmonella. It is the most typical source of foodborne illness in the US. Salmonella can be found on unwashed fruit and vegetables, raw beef, raw eggs, and raw poultry.\nE.coli (Escherichia coli):\u00a0E. coli is typically not harmful. E. coli infections can be acquired through consumption of the bacteria-containing foods. Handle food carefully to help prevent infection and food poisoning. Avoid unpasteurized milk and juices, thoroughly prepare meat, wash produce before eating or preparing it, and wash fruits and vegetables.\nAdvantages of Cultured meat\nLess contamination: Proponents of cultured meat claim that it has a significantly lower risk of contracting the E. coli bacteria, which is found in animal faeces, and other contaminants that you could encounter at a meat processing facility.\nLess use of antibiotics: In the past, animals were frequently treated with antibiotics to keep them healthy. Antibiotic resistance is a condition where the medications no longer effectively treat infections.\nLess environmental impact: More wooded land is being turned into ranches and crop fields as the demand for meat increases worldwide. Meat that has been cultured requires substantially less land, water, and pollutants.\nNo animal slaughter is necessary for cultured meat, even though a small amount of tissue is needed.\nIssues with Cultured meat\nLab-grown meat is not regarded as a vegan because it contains animal cells.\nThe cost is very high. In 2012, researchers created the first hamburger made from cultured meat. Its creation cost $325,000. However, the price of cultured meat should decrease as technology develops. However, the cost will remain high.\nChallenges\nThe market is still dominated by conventional meat, and industry lobby groups have been working to maintain their market share, including by opposing the entire concept of alternative meats.\nAgriculture and husbandry organisations are leading the battle against lab-grown meat, arguing that since it didn\u2019t come from an animal, it isn\u2019t actually meat.\nFor instance, the US Cattlemen\u2019s Association was successful in persuading Missouri to establish a law declaring that cultured meat and plant-based meats cannot be considered meats.\nSince 2018, the Cattle Council of Australia has been applying similar pressure on the government of the nation.\nConclusion\n\nBefore cultured meat becomes generally accessible, there are still several obstacles to be addressed including affordability, addressing consumer mistrust and conventional meat producers\u2019 opposition. When meat produced in laboratories hits the market, it might be better for you than meat raised from animals. \u201cThis is due to the power of the technology to adjust the profile of important amino acids and lipids and to be richer in vitamins, minerals, and bioactive substances,\u201d write researchers in the Journal of Scientific Research.\n\nArticle Written By : Atheena Fathima Riyas",

Users of Augmented Reality encounter a real-world environment with created perceptual information superimposed on top of it, as opposed to Virtual Reality (VR), which produces a completely artificial environment.\n\nUsing Augmented Reality, users can receive more information or have natural environments aesthetically altered in some way.\n\nThe main advantage of Augmented Reality is that it successfully combines digital and three-dimensional (3D) elements with how people perceive the real world.\n\nAR has several applications, from entertainment to aid in decision-making.\n\nThrough a device like a smartphone or glasses, Augmented Reality provides the user with visual elements, sound, and other sensory information.\n\nIn order to provide a seamless experience where digital information modifies the user\u2019s view of the actual environment, this information is layered onto the device. A part of the natural world might be hidden or added to by the superimposed information.\n\n\ud83d\udc49 Which year are YOU targeting for success in the IAS/IPS/IFS Exam? \ud83d\ude80\n\n(1) \u21d2 UPSC 2025: Prelims cum Mains\n\n(2) \u21d2 UPSC 2026: Prelims cum Mains\n\n(3) \u21d2 UPSC 2027 Prelims cum Mains\n\nTip: Know more about ClearIAS Courses (Online/Offline)\n\nThe most well-known consumer Augmented Reality (AR) devices right now include Google Glass, smartphone games, and heads-up displays (HUDs) on automobile windscreens.\n\nBut a lot of other businesses, like healthcare, public safety, gas and oil, travel, and marketing, also use this technology.\n\nAlso read: Extended Reality\n\nHow does Augmented Reality Work?\n\nThere are many ways to provide augmented reality, including through smartphones, tablets, and eyewear.\n\nAdditionally, contact lens-delivered AR is being developed.\n\nHardware elements like a processor, sensors, a display, and input devices are needed for the technology. This hardware is often already present in mobile devices, including sensors like cameras, accelerometers, GPS, and solid-state compasses.\n\nThis makes AR more approachable for regular people. For instance, a GPS can be used to determine the user\u2019s location and its compass can be used to determine the direction of the device.\n\nMachine vision, object identification, and gesture recognition are potentially possible features of sophisticated augmented reality training programmes utilised by the military.\n\nBecause AR can be computationally demanding, data processing can be offloaded to another machine if a device is underpowered.\n\nIn order to connect animation or contextual digital information in the computer programme to an augmented reality marker in the actual world, augmented reality apps are created in specialised 3D programmes.\n\nWhen an AR app or browser plugin on a computing device receives digital data from a recognised marker, it starts to run the marker\u2019s code and layer the appropriate image or images.\n\nDifferences Between AR and VR\n\nVirtual Reality (VR) is a virtual environment made using software and presented to users in a way that causes their brains to temporarily suspend disbelief so they can accept the virtual environment as the actual world.\n\nThe main way to enjoy Virtual Reality is via a headset that includes both sight and sound.\n\nThe main distinction between Augmented Reality (AR) and Virtual Reality (VR) is that while VR totally immerses users in a virtual environment, AR takes the existing real-world environment and overlays virtual information on top of it. AR inserts the user in a kind of mixed reality, whereas VR immerses them in a brand-new, virtual experience.\n\nThis is also accomplished using various tools. Virtual reality (VR) uses head-mounted displays (HMDs) to show users simulated visual and aural information. Less constrained AR devices often include smartphones, eyewear, projections, and HUDs in automobiles.\n\nPeople are placed into a 3D environment in Virtual Reality (VR), where they may move around and interact with the environment that is being built. However, AR keeps users rooted in the physical environment by superimposing virtual data as a visual layer on top of it.\n\nTechnology Used for Augmented Reality\nHardware\n\nA CPU, display, sensors, and input devices are examples of hardware for Augmented Reality. These components, which frequently include a camera and MEMS sensors like an accelerometer, GPS, and solid-state compass, are present in contemporary mobile computing devices like smartphones and tablet PCs, making them excellent AR platforms.\n\nThe technologies diffractive waveguides and reflective waveguides are both employed in Augmented Reality.\n\nDisplay\n\nThe representation of Augmented\u00a0Reality employs a variety of technologies, including optical projection systems, displays, handheld devices, and display systems that are worn on the human body.\n\nA head-mounted display (HMD) is a display gadget that is strapped to the forehead or put on a helmet. HMDs, overlay the user\u2019s field of vision with images of the real environment and virtual things.\n\nIn order to match virtual information with the real environment and adapt to the user\u2019s head motions, modern HMDs frequently include sensors for six degrees of freedom tracking.\n\nProjection-Mapping\n\nWithout the aid of specialised displays like monitors, head-mounted displays, or handheld gadgets, projection mapping enhances real-world objects and settings.\n\nDigital projectors are used in projection mapping to project graphics onto real-world objects.\n\nThe main distinction in projection mapping is the separation of the display from the system\u2019s users. Projection mapping scales up to groups of people organically because displays are not connected to individual users, enabling collocated collaboration between users.\n\nTracking\n\nMotion Tracking technologies used by contemporary mobile augmented reality systems include radio-frequency identification, accelerometers, GPS, gyroscopes, solid-state compasses, digital cameras, and/or other optical sensors (RFID).\n\nThese technologies provide various degrees of precision and accuracy.\n\nNetworking\n\nThe widespread use of mobile devices, particularly wearable ones, has increased the appeal of mobile augmented reality applications. They do, however, frequently rely on computer vision techniques that are computationally demanding and have strict latency requirements. Data processing is frequently wanted to be offloaded to a distant machine to make up for the lack of computing resources.\n\nInput Devices\n\nTechniques include speech recognition systems, which turn a user\u2019s spoken words into computer instructions, and gesture recognition systems, which analyse a user\u2019s physical movements using either visual detection or sensors built into a peripheral device like a wand, stylus, pointer, glove, or other body wear.\n\nComputer\n\nIn order to synthesise and position augmentations, the computer analyses the perceived visual and other data. The graphics that go with augmented reality are created by computers.\nA computer-generated image is used in augmented reality, which dramatically changes how the real world is displayed.\n\nAugmented reality will drastically alter people\u2019s perspectives of the real world as technology and computers advance.\n\nProjector\n\nAR content can also be shown on projectors. On a projection screen, a virtual item can be thrown by the projector, and the viewer can interact with it. Various things, including walls and glass windows, can serve as projection surfaces.\n\nApplications of Augmented Reality\nArchaeology\n\nThe usage of AR has aided archaeological study. AR enables archaeologists to generate potential site configurations from existing structures by overlaying archaeological characteristics onto the contemporary landscape.\n\nEarly archaeological augmented reality applications have reused computer-produced representations of ruins, structures, landscapes, or even ancient individuals. Implementing a system like VITA (Visual Interaction Tool for Archaeology), for instance, will enable users to visualise and explore real-time excavation data from the comfort of their homes.\n\nEach user can work together by \u201cnavigating, searching, and examining data\u201d for each other.\n\nArchitecture\n\nAR can help with project visualisation.\n\nBefore a building is physically built on a site, computer-generated images of that building can be superimposed on a local view of that location.\n\nAdditionally, AR can be used at an architect\u2019s office to produce animated 3D visualisations of their 2D designs.\n\nAR apps can improve architectural sightseeing by enabling people to virtually look through a building\u2019s walls to observe its inside furnishings and layout.\n\nEducation\n\nAR has been utilised in educational contexts to supplement a regular curriculum. It is possible to overlay text, graphics, video, and music on top of a student\u2019s actual environment.\n\nTextbooks, flashcards, and other reading materials for school may have \u201cmarkers\u201d or triggers built in that, when scanned by an augmented reality device, provide the student with additional information presented in a multimedia manner.\n\nIndustrial Manufacturing\n\nAR is utilised to replace paper manuals with digital instructions that are superimposed on the field of vision of the manufacturing operator, hence requiring less mental effort to operate.\n\nBecause operators have direct access to a machine\u2019s maintenance history, AR facilitates efficient machine maintenance.\n\nSince digital instructions can be modified and distributed more easily than physical manuals, virtual manuals aid manufacturers in adapting to constantly evolving product designs.\n\nRetail\n\nBefore making a purchase, customers can utilise a store\u2019s internet app to see items like furniture in their homes.\n\nEntertainment and Gaming\n\nWith the use of Augmented Reality, users can animate their faces in fun and imaginative ways on social media or overlay a virtual game in a real environment.\n\nNavigation\n\nA route to the user\u2019s destination can be added using augmented reality to a real-time view of a road. When utilised for navigation, Augmented Reality can also show details about nearby businesses.\n\nMilitary\n\nData that shows destination directions, travel times, weather information, and road conditions can be shown on a car\u2019s windscreen.\n\nExamples of Augmented Reality\nTarget App\n\nA Target retail app feature, allows users to take a photo of a space in their home and digitally view an object, such as a picture on the wall or a chair, to see how it will look there.\n\nApple Measure app\n\nThe Measure app for Apple iOS functions similarly to a tape measure, allowing users to select two or more points in their environment and measure the distance between them.\n\nSnapchat\n\nSnapchat filters use augmented reality to apply a filter or mask to the user\u2019s Snap or picture.\n\nPokemon Go\n\nPokemon Go is a popular mobile augmented reality game that uses the player\u2019s GPS to detect where Pokemon creatures appear in the user\u2019s surroundings for them to catch.\n\nGoogle Glass\n\nGoogle Glass is the company\u2019s first commercial attempt at a glasses-based augmented reality system. Users can work hands-free with this small wearable computer.\n\nGoogle is also developing another pair of glasses for 2022 that will overlay a live transcription or translation of what someone else says in the text.\n\nU.S. Army\n\nThe United States Army employs augmented reality in an eyepiece known as Tactical Augmented Reality (TAR). TAR attaches to the soldier\u2019s helmet and assists in locating the position of another soldier.\n\nConclusion\n\nAs the popularity and familiarity of apps and games like Pokemon Go or retail store AR apps grows, so does AR technology. The expansion of 5G networks, for example, may make it easier to support cloud-based augmented reality experiences by providing higher data speeds and lower latency to AR applications. Modern advancements in development, such as Google\u2019s smart glasses that can live translate audio to text, will change the way people who speak different languages communicate. Because AR employs immersive technology, more opportunities and experiences across various platforms and media types are on the way.\n\nTo get more such notes Click Here\n\nArticle written by: Aryadevi E S",

It operates under the tenet of complete inward reflections.\nImplementing QKD involves communication between authorized users. It is necessary to authenticate these interactions. This can accomplish using a variety of cryptographic techniques.\nQKD enables two remote users to generate a shared, random string of secret bits, known as a secret key, even if they do not initially share a lengthy secret key.\nConsequently, QKD can use an authenticated communication channel and convert it into a secure communication channel.\nThe qubits, which are encoded on photons, are designed in such a way that if an unauthorized entity tries to read the transmission, it will disturb them.\nTransmission issues will result from this, and legitimate end users will be alerted right away.\nWhat are the Main Categories of QKD?\n\nThere are two main categories of QKD. They are,\n\nPrepare-and-Measure Protocols:\nIt concentrates on detecting unobserved quantum states This kind of protocol can be used to identify espionage (eavesdropping) and determine how much data may have been intercepted.\nEntanglement-based Protocols:\nIt focuses on coupled quantum states, which are formed when two objects are connected in some way.\nEntanglement refers to the idea that measuring one object has an impact on another.\nWith this approach, the other parties will be informed if an eavesdropper gains access to a previously trusted node and makes changes.\nApplications of Quantum Cryptography\nQKD networks are solely responsible for transferring keys between parties seeking to interact securely.\nTo address the threat that quantum computing\u2019s quick development poses to the security of the data being conveyed by many crucial industries across the existing communication networks, QKD is crucial.\nThere will be applications where QKD is perfect, such as replacing dependable couriers, and others where the benefits are less obvious, such as CNP and online banking, which require substantial quantum ATM infrastructure to function but gain additional security as a result. Business choices are seldom simple.\nIt excels at generating lengthy random keys from brief input keys, a feature that could be crucial for OTPs.\nA variety of start-ups and small and medium-sized businesses in the field of quantum information could be enabled by the technology.\nSecurity agencies will be able to design an appropriate quantum communication network with an indigenous technology backbone thanks to it.\nThe principal applications of quantum cryptography are in quantum key distribution (QKD), but it also has uses in quantum commitment, quantum coin tossing, and untrustworthy quantum cryptography.\nA variety of start-ups and small and medium-sized businesses in the field of quantum information could be enabled by the technology.\nIt is anticipated that it will define standards and draught laws about cryptography.\nWhy is Quantum Cryptography Needed?\nTo address the threat that quantum computing\u2019s quick development poses to the security of the data being conveyed by many crucial industries across the existing communication networks, QKD is crucial.\nA variety of start-ups and small and medium-sized businesses in the field of quantum information could be enabled by the technology.\nSecurity agencies will be able to design an appropriate quantum communication network with an indigenous technology backbone thanks to it.\nThe fact that data is transmitted by the photon makes the encryption uncrackable. Any attempt to measure a photon will upset it since a photon cannot be properly reproduced. As a result, anyone attempting to intercept the data will be detected.\nQKD enables two remote users to generate a shared, random string of secret bits, known as a secret key, even if they do not initially share a lengthy secret key.\nThis key is secure for both encrypting and decrypting messages using one-time pad encryption, which allows for transmission across a common communication channel.\nWhat is the Significance of Quantum Cryptography?\nBecause it can identify any attempt at such activity, it enables the identification of data leaks or hacking.\nThe method of adjusting the error level between the intercepted data is also made possible.\nThe fact that data is transmitted by the photon makes the encryption uncrackable. Any attempt to measure a photon will upset it since a photon cannot be properly reproduced.

It incorporates technologies like big data, neural networks, self-algorithms, pattern recognition, and machine learning, among others.\n\nAlthough the concept has its roots in Greek mythology, it was not until modern times that stored programme electrical computers were created.\n\nAI entails complex tasks like feeding a machine a certain set of data and programming it to respond differently depending on the situation. It simply involves developing self-learning patterns so that the computer can respond to queries that have never been answered in the same way that a human would.\n\n\ud83d\udc49 Which year are YOU targeting for success in the IAS/IPS/IFS Exam? \ud83d\ude80\n\n(1) \u21d2 UPSC 2025: Prelims cum Mains\n\n(2) \u21d2 UPSC 2026: Prelims cum Mains\n\n(3) \u21d2 UPSC 2027 Prelims cum Mains\n\nTip: Know more about ClearIAS Courses (Online/Offline)\n\nFor Example:\n\nTo comprehend human orders and carry out jobs that resemble human activity, millions of algorithms and codes exist around humans.\nArtificial intelligence is responsible for Facebook\u2019s list of suggested friends for its users and the pop-up page that appears while browsing the internet and suggests an approaching sale of the user\u2019s preferred brand of shoes and clothing.\nHow AI and Ethics are related?\n\nIn essence, ethics and AI involve continually asking questions, doing research, and not taking for granted the technology that is fast encroaching on human existence.\n\nThe volume of data and its utilisation make the need to challenge AI even more essential. Regarding the amount of data they use and the amount of computational power needed, AI systems are becoming enormous.\n\nIn terms of the scope of their deployment and the degree of responsibility they take on, their pervasiveness in society surpasses that of computing in the PC and Internet eras.\n\nIncreasing scale also implies that some parts of the technology, particularly in its deep learning capabilities, are beyond the comprehension of even the most seasoned practitioners.\n\nWhat are the Ethical Concerns related to Artificial Intelligence?\n\nSometimes the development of new technologies leads to errors and miscalculations that have unintended negative effects. This brings the ethical concerns related to AI.\n\nRisk of Unemployment in AI Ethics\nAutomation is the main worry of the hierarchy of labour. Companies that specialise in robotics and artificial intelligence are creating clever machines that can replace low-wage workers in jobs like fruit picking and cashiering.\nAdditionally, the day will soon come when many desk positions, including those of accountants, traders, and middle managers, will be replaced by AI.\nExacerbating Inequalities of AI Ethics\nWith the use of artificial intelligence, a business can significantly reduce its reliance on human labour, which will result in fewer individuals receiving income.\nAs a result, the only people who will profit from AI-driven businesses are the proprietors of those businesses. AI may also exacerbate digital exclusion.\nAdditionally, funding is likely to move to nations where Ethical AI-related activity is already well-established, resulting in wider inequalities between and within nations.\nTech Addiction\nTechnology addiction is the latest form of dependency on people. AI is already proficient at focusing human attention and initiating certain activities.\nIf handled properly, this could develop into a chance to encourage society to adopt better practices. However, it may be harmful if it falls into the wrong hands.\nMass surveillance backlash\nThe use of mass surveillance, made possible by tools like facial recognition, is coming under increasing criticism.\nAccording to Human Rights Watch, given the pushback against surveillance, including the monitoring of religious Uyghurs in China\u2019s Xinjiang province and the military takeover in February in Myanmar, human rights are in jeopardy.\nThere are worries that AI tools will become the primary weapons used for mass monitoring and individual freedom in future conflicts.\nDiscriminating Robots/ Societal biases\nWe must not lose sight of the fact that humans, who are prone to prejudice and bias, design AI systems.\nIt may result in the discrimination of surveillance and AI facial recognition systems against minorities and persons of colour.\nThis covers, for instance, algorithms that categorise human faces as being \u201cbeautiful\u201d or \u201cunattractive\u201d in some way. supposedly generative algorithms, like GANs. It can be employed to continually duplicate a specific aesthetic to the exclusion of all others to overwhelm the world with that particular aesthetic.\nData Privacy Concerns\nAI also raises important questions about data privacy. Our digital footprints are being captured and sold without our awareness or informed consent as a result of the algorithm\u2019s never-ending search for data.\nThe Cambridge Analytica case, in which such algorithms and huge data were exploited to influence voting decisions, should act as a strong cautionary tale about the potential risks that existing AI business models pose to both individuals and society.\nAI Turning against Humans\nWhat if artificial intelligence itself turned against humans?\nImagine requesting an AI system to end cancer globally. After much computation, it produces a formula that ends cancer by exterminating everyone on the earth. Which will be a huge blown for AI Ethics\nThe rise of the fake AI Ethics\nThe fact that neural networks are becoming more and more \u201cgenerative\u201d raises ethical concerns about bias.\nIt implies that they are not just tools for making decisions, like a traditional machine learning programme for linear regression. The world is being overrun by their inventions.\nRealistic faces can be created with the programme, ushering in a time of artificial likenesses.\nFor some confined uses of the technology, AI systems can currently construct text, music, and visuals to such a high degree that people find it difficult to distinguish between synthetic and non-synthetic outputs.\n\nRead:\u00a0AI in Elections\n\nWhat are the Global Standards for Artificial Intelligence AI Ethics?\nThe General Conference of UNESCO endorsed the Recommendation on the Ethics of Artificial Intelligence at its 41st session in 2021.\nIt intends to significantly alter the distribution of power between people, businesses, and governments engaged in AI development.\nAffirmative action will be used by UNESCO members to ensure that minorities and women are fairly represented in AI design teams.\nThe guideline also emphasises the significance of adequate data management, privacy, and information access.\nMember states are urged to make sure that suitable protections are developed for the processing of sensitive data and that efficient accountability and redress mechanisms are offered.\nThe recommendation strongly suggests against using AI systems for mass monitoring or social scoring.\nThe psychological and cognitive effects that these systems may have on children must be taken into consideration. Not only should member states invest in and foster information literacy, but also socioemotional and AI ethics abilities.\nAdditionally, UNESCO is working on establishing methods to measure how well the guidelines are being implemented.\nConclusion\n\nSince the launch of the #AIForAll campaign by the NITI Aayog and the several business strategies that have been taken to ensure that AI is created with shared, humanistic values at its heart, India has achieved significant progress in the creation of ethical and responsible AI governance.\n\nThe development and execution of artificial intelligence systems must be held accountable. In general, AI could develop into moral beings with moral responsibility. AI Ethics. AI engineers and designers should be held accountable for the conception, design, and implementation of the system.\n\nSuch a \u201cwhole of society\u201d strategy must be based on a \u201cwhole of globe\u201d approach given the worldwide reach of AI.\n\nA good place to start is with the UN Secretary-Roadmap Generals on Digital Cooperation. For AI to be deployed in a way that is \u201ctrustworthy, human rights-based, safe and sustainable, and promotes peace,\u201d it lays out the necessity for multi-stakeholder activities on international cooperation.\n\nAlso Read:\u00a0IndiaAI Mission;International AI Treaty\n\nPrevious Year Question (PYQ)\n\nQ. \u201cThe emergence of the Fourth Industrial Revolution (Digital Revolution) has initiated e-Governance as an integral part of the government\u201d.

The mission will focus on three of Jupiter\u2019s Galilean moons: Ganymede, Callisto, and Europa. Read here to know more about the mission.\n\nLong-standing theories among scientists suggest that Jupiter\u2019s frozen moons may harbor life. In order to investigate whether there is life on Jupiter\u2019s moons, conjecture is predicated on the idea that there is liquid water beneath the kilometers of ice sheets.\n\nThese moons are all thought to have sizable liquid water bodies beneath their surfaces, making them potentially habitable environments.\n\nTable of Contents\n\nJUICE (Jupiter Icy Moons Explorer)\nWhat will JUICE explore?\nJupiter and its moons\nMoons\nMissions to explore Jupiter\nPast missions\nActive missions\nFuture missions\nChallenges for the JUICE mission\nSignificance of JUICE mission\nJUICE (Jupiter Icy Moons Explorer)\n\nESA\u2019s Jupiter Icy Moons Explorer, Juice, will make detailed observations of the giant gas planet and its three large ocean-bearing moons \u2013 Ganymede, Callisto, and Europa \u2013 with a suite of remote sensing, geophysical and in situ instruments.\n\nThe mission will characterize these moons as both planetary objects and possible habitats, explore Jupiter\u2019s complex environment in-depth and study the wider Jupiter system as an archetype for gas giants across the Universe.\n\nFew other nations\u2019 space agencies have partnered with ESA on various levels for the JUICE mission:\n\n\ud83d\udc49 Which year are YOU targeting for success in the IAS/IPS/IFS Exam? \ud83d\ude80\n\n(1) \u21d2 UPSC 2025: Prelims cum Mains\n\n(2) \u21d2 UPSC 2026: Prelims cum Mains\n\n(3) \u21d2 UPSC 2027 Prelims cum Mains\n\nTip: Know more about ClearIAS Courses (Online/Offline)\n\nNASA has contributed one instrument (UVS) and hardware for two European-provided instruments (RIME and PEP).\nJAXA has contributed hardware for various European-provided instruments (SWI, PEP, GALA, RPWI).\n\nThe mission will consider two key themes of ESA\u2019s Cosmic Vision 2015-2025:\n\nWhat are the conditions for planet formation and the emergence of life?\nHow does the Solar System work?\n\nUnder these themes, Juice will explore-\n\nthe habitable zone \u2013 namely characterizing the oceans, icy shells, compositions, surfaces, environments, and activity of Ganymede, Europa, and Callisto\nthe wider Jupiter system, characterizing Jupiter\u2019s atmosphere, magnetic environment, ring system, and other satellites (including Io).\n\nLaunch\n\nForeseen to launch from Europe\u2019s Spaceport in Kourou, French Guiana, on an Ariane 5 launcher during a launch window in April 2023.\n\nJourney and orbit\n\nJUICE will spend approximately eight years cruising to Jupiter, during which it will complete fly-bys of Venus, Earth, and the Earth-Moon system.\nIt will reach Jupiter in July 2031; six months before entering orbit around Jupiter, Juice will begin its nominal science phase.\nThe spacecraft will go on to spend many months orbiting Jupiter, completing fly-bys of Europa, Ganymede, and Callisto, and finally conducting an orbital tour of Ganymede\n\nJUICE builds on the previously proposed Europa Jupiter System Mission (EJSM-Laplace), a planned collaborative mission between ESA and NASA that would have carried out an in-depth study of the Jovian system and its icy moons.\n\nIt is now foreseen that the Juice and NASA Europa Clipper spacecraft will be exploring the Jovian system simultaneously.\n\nJUICE builds on scientific and technological heritage from previous space missions \u2013 including ESA\u2019s Mars Express, Venus Express, Rosetta, and BepiColombo.\n\nIt will pave the way for future extensive exploration of the diverse extreme environments in the distant outer Solar System.\n\nJUICE will push significantly beyond the capabilities of previous missions like NASA\u2019s Galileo (1989-2003), and directly complement the results of NASA\u2019s Juno mission (2011\u2013).\n\nWhat will JUICE explore?\n\nJUICE will explore the secrets of Jupiter and tackle five key mysteries:\n\nWhat are Jupiter\u2019s Ocean worlds like?\nWhy is Ganymede so unique?\nCould there be or ever have been life on the Jupiter system?\nHow has Jupiter\u2019s complex environment shaped its moons and vice versa?\nWhat is a typical gas giant planet like, how did it form, and does it work?\n\nJUICE will be the first spacecraft to ever orbit a moon in the outer Solar System (Ganymede).\n\nJupiter and its moons\n\nJupiter is the fifth planet from our Sun and is, by far, the largest planet in the solar system which is more than twice as massive as all the other planets combined.\n\nJupiter\u2019s stripes and swirls are actually cold, windy clouds of ammonia and water, floating in an atmosphere of hydrogen and helium.\n\nJupiter\u2019s iconic Great Red Spot is a giant storm bigger than Earth that has raged for hundreds of years.\n\nJupiter is surrounded by dozens of moons. Jupiter also has several rings, but unlike the famous rings of Saturn, Jupiter\u2019s rings are very faint and made of dust, not ice.\n\nJupiter\u2019s rings were first discovered by NASA\u2019s Voyager 1 spacecraft in 1979.\n\nJupiter has the shortest day in the solar system. One day on Jupiter takes only about 10 hours (the time it takes for Jupiter to rotate or spin around once), and Jupiter makes a complete orbit around the Sun (a year in Jovian time) in about 12 Earth years (4,333 Earth days).\n\nIts equator is tilted with respect to its orbital path around the Sun by just 3 degrees. This means Jupiter spins nearly upright and does not have seasons as extreme as other planets do.\n\nMoons\n\nJupiter forms a kind of miniature solar system with four large moons and many smaller moons.\n\nJupiter has 80 moons.\nFifty-seven moons have been given official names by the International Astronomical Union (IAU).\nAnother 23 moons are awaiting names.\n\nJupiter\u2019s four largest moons \u2013 Io, Europa, Ganymede, and Callisto \u2013 were first observed by the astronomer Galileo Galilei in 1610 using an early version of the telescope.\n\nThese four moons are known today as the Galilean satellites, and they\u2019re some of the most fascinating destinations in our solar system.\nIo is the most volcanically active body in the solar system.\nGanymede is the largest moon in the solar system (even bigger than the planet Mercury).\nCallisto\u2019s very few small craters indicate a small degree of current surface activity.\nA liquid-water ocean with the ingredients for life may lie beneath the frozen crust of Europa, making it a tempting place to explore.\n\nWhile planet Jupiter is an unlikely place for living things to take hold, the same is not true of some of its many moons.\n\nEuropa is one of the likeliest places to find life elsewhere in our solar system. There is evidence of a vast ocean just beneath its icy crust, where life could possibly be supported.\nThe JUICE mission aims to explore this possibility.\nMissions to explore Jupiter\n\nJupiter is not only an interesting scientific destination but also an important waypoint for spacecraft heading further into the Solar System. The gas giant\u2019s immense gravity field can provide a boost and trajectory change for spacecraft heading to even further destinations.\n\nPast missions\nNASA\u2019s New Horizons spacecraft was the first mission to fly past the Kuiper Belt worlds Pluto and Arrokoth.\nNASA\u2019s Cassini mission orbited Saturn from 2004 to 2017, circling the planet 294 times and teaching us almost everything we know about our ringed neighbor.\nNASA\u2019s Galileo was the first spacecraft to orbit Jupiter. It revealed the structure of the planet\u2019s magnetic field and intense radiation belts, made the first detailed maps of Jupiter\u2019s major moons, hinted at a possible underground ocean on Europa, sent the first probe to sample a gas planet\u2019s atmosphere, and more.\nVoyager 1 and Voyager 2 launched in 1977 and each made a grand tour of the solar system before heading out of it.\nNASA\u2019s Pioneer 10 and 11 are twin probes that helped illuminate the outer stretches of our solar neighborhood.\nActive missions\nJuno, NASA\u2019s Jupiter Probe is searching for answers about Jupiter\u2019s origins and how has the gas giant changed over time.\nFuture missions\nNASA\u2019s Europa Clipper will help us determine if Jupiter\u2019s icy moon Europa could support life.\nThe European Space Agency (ESA) is launching the JUICE spacecraft to study Jupiter and its three largest icy moons.\nChallenges for the JUICE mission\n\nJUICE will build on the scientific and technological advancements made by earlier NASA and ESA planetary missions.\n\nThe most difficult engineering issues are:\n\nthe performance of the solar array in a cold and intense radiation environment\nprotection of electronics against Jupiter\u2019s harsh radiation environment\nelectro\u00admagnetic cleanliness on the spacecraft so as not to interfere with the sensitive measurements to be taken.\n\nThese issues are in addition to the programmatic challenges to maintain cost and schedule.\n\nOn the operation side, the mission controllers will need to perform complex satellite navigation in both the inner solar system and the Jupiter system.\n\nSignificance of JUICE mission\n\nBy studying Jupiter and its moons, JUICE will help astrobiologists understand how habitable worlds might emerge around gas giant planets.\n\nThe largest natural satellite in the solar system, Ganymede, is highlighted in particular as a planetary body and prospective habitat.\nIt offers a favorable setting for the study of potentially habitable planets and displays unusual magnetic and plasma interactions with its surroundings.\nFor Europa, the focus is on the chemistry essential to life, including organic molecules, and on understanding the formation of surface features and the composition of the non-water-ice material.\n\nJUICE will provide the first subsurface sounding of the moon, including the first determination of the minimal thickness of the icy crust over the most recently active regions.\n\nThe JUICE mission will also characterize the diversity of processes in the Jovian system that may provide a stable environment on the icy moons at geologic time scales, including gravitational coupling between the Galilean moons and their long-term tidal influence on the system as a whole.\n\nJUICE and Europa Clipper will provide ground-breaking information, through their monitoring of the Jovian system elements, about the planet\u2019s atmosphere, magnetosphere, and plasma environment, and about the exospheres of the icy moons.\n\nUnderstanding of the development and dynamics of the Jovian system will be improved by JUICE\u2019s broad new observations of Jupiter\u2019s atmosphere, magnetosphere, and interaction with the satellites.\n\nJUICE is an extremely intriguing project that follows in the footsteps of the Cassini-Huygens mission since it allows international involvement of a significant number of individuals interested in a variety of significant science issues.\n\n-Article written by Swathi Satish",

Nearly every aspect of our lives is impacted by technology on a daily basis, from how we communicate to how businesses are managed.\n\nThe effects of digitization may also be seen in the sphere of education, where they have had a significant impact on how education is provided and consumed.\n\nTable of Contents\n\nDefinition of Virtual Reality\nApplications\nAdvantages of Virtual Reality\nDisadvantages of Virtual Reality\nCAVE\nANIC-ARISE\nMeitY Startup Hub (MSH)\nConclusion\nDefinition of Virtual Reality\n\nA three-dimensional, computer-generated environment that can be examined and interacted with by a human is referred to as virtual reality. This person gets immersed in or becomes a part of the virtual world, and while there, they have the ability to manipulate objects or carry out a series of actions.\n\nIn short, a\u00a0simulated 3D environment called virtual reality allows users to explore and interact with a virtual environment in a way that simulates reality as it is experienced by the users\u2019 senses.\n\nApplications\n\nThere are a wide variety of applications for virtual reality that include:\n\nArchitecture\nSport\nMedicine\nThe Arts\nEntertainment\nAdvantages of Virtual Reality\n\nVirtual reality is often associated with gaming because the industry has been at the forefront of the VR effort. Even so, there has been a growing interest in the potential of VR across a number of other areas:\n\n\ud83d\udc49 Which year are YOU targeting for success in the IAS/IPS/IFS Exam? \ud83d\ude80\n\n(1) \u21d2 UPSC 2025: Prelims cum Mains\n\n(2) \u21d2 UPSC 2026: Prelims cum Mains\n\n(3) \u21d2 UPSC 2027 Prelims cum Mains\n\nTip: Know more about ClearIAS Courses (Online/Offline)\n\nTraining Programmes: VR makes it feasible to train staff members in a safe, effective, and economical manner. People in high-risk or highly specialized occupations, such as firefighters, EMTs, police officers, soldiers, surgeons, or other medical staff, can particularly benefit from it.\n\nEducational Advancement: VR provides educational institutions with innovative teaching and learning techniques. While retaining their interest in the subject matter, it can give students close access to settings that are generally inaccessible. For instance, a history teacher could utilize virtual reality to take students back in time to ancient India or China.\n\nHealthcare Facility Enhancement: Virtual Reality has the ability to help people working in the healthcare sector, such as patients, practitioners, and researchers. VR, for instance, has the potential to cure conditions like anorexia, anxiety, or post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD). On the other side, medical professionals might be able to use VR to communicate diagnoses or available treatments to patients. People with certain physical limitations may potentially benefit from VR.\n\nEntertainment Business:\u00a0 Although VR has already had an impact on gaming, it also holds the potential to completely change the film and television industries by giving viewers an immersive experience that immerses them in the action. Virtual reality (VR) has the potential to create a whole business dedicated to tourism, allowing people to visit locations they might never be able to visit in person.\n\nRetail Sector:\u00a0 Although VR has already had considerable success in the retail sector, there is still much room for growth. Customers will be able to try on clothes, design their houses, experiment with hairstyles, test eyeglasses, and generally make better selections of goods and services with the help of the appropriate apps.\n\nReal Estate Industry:\u00a0 Virtual Reality has many advantages for the real estate industry. For instance, building experts can virtually tour HVAC systems, homeowners can see what their remodels will look like, and architects can display precise drawings in 3D.\n\nAlso read: Extended Reality\n\nDisadvantages of Virtual Reality\n\nThe disadvantages of virtual reality are:\n\nExpensive Implementation: Virtual reality implementation is a costly process. Virtual reality requires expensive equipment and technology, therefore only a select few could afford it. Therefore, the initial installation of this kind of equipment is expensive.\n\nOnly Develop Technical skills Without Real Interaction: VR experiences are based on pre-recorded environments; as a result, interaction with an instructor is not possible, even when technical skill is obtained. As a result, the learner\u2019s uncertainties persist until any other knowledgeable individual shares their knowledge of the subject.\n\nComplex Technology: Virtual reality technology must be studied in order to acquire abilities, and because it is difficult for everyone to grasp how to use it, training is necessary in order to learn the complex technology.\n\nAddiction to Virtual Reality: Teenagers and a few adults have frequently been observed developing a virtual reality addiction and experiencing physiological side effects. Addiction thus causes a variety of problems, and youths will also neglect their regular work in favor of playing video games all the time.\n\nImpact on Human Body: Many people who use virtual reality have physical concerns such as eye strain, vertigo, and nausea. This is due to the illusion created by VR.\n\nCutoff from the Real World: People who become dependent on virtual reality don\u2019t want to interact with the actual world. They no longer want to interact with the real world because the virtual world has become their actual world.\n\nPsychological Damages:\u00a0 It is advised that people avoid using virtual reality for extended periods of time since, when they become addicted to it, they also suffer psychological effects.\n\nAlso read: Augmented Reality\n\nCAVE\n\nIndian Institute of Technology Madras has launched the country\u2019s first Consortium for Virtual Reality called \u2018Consortium for VR/AR/MR Engineering Mission in India\u2019 (CAVE).\n\nThis consortium\u2019s major goal is to give its members the capabilities they need to jointly develop new cutting-edge technologies and applications in VR, Augmented Reality, Mixed Reality (XR), and Haptics.

They have the potential to interfere with the body\u2019s hormones. EDCs have become a menace to the environment with their array of harmful effects. Read here to learn all about EDCs and their impact on the environment.\n\nUNEP and WHO released a report almost a decade ago \u201cState of the Science of Endocrine-Disrupting Chemicals \u2013 2012\u201d which identifies concerns, including evidence in humans, laboratory animals, and wildlife that exposure to endocrine-disrupting chemicals can result in adverse effects and highlighted that an important focus should be on reducing exposure.\n\nEven though the harmful consequences of EDCs have been exposed a long time ago, the use and subsequent impact of these chemicals are still rampant globally.\n\nAlso read: Endocrine Glands and Hormones\n\nTable of Contents\n\nWhat are Endocrine-Disrupting Chemicals (EDCs)?\nThe endocrine system\nCommon endocrine-disrupting chemicals\nHow do people encounter endocrine-disrupting chemicals?\nHow do animals encounter EDCs?\nWhy Endocrine-Disrupting Chemicals are a cause of concern?\nIndian scenario in controlling EDCs\nWay forward\nWhat are Endocrine-Disrupting Chemicals (EDCs)?\n\nThe endocrine system, which regulates the body\u2019s hormones, may be mimicked or interfered with by a variety of chemicals, both natural and man-made.\n\nThese substances, often known as endocrine disruptors, have been associated with developmental, reproductive, brain, immunological, and other issues.\n\n\ud83d\udc49 Which year are YOU targeting for success in the IAS/IPS/IFS Exam? \ud83d\ude80\n\n(1) \u21d2 UPSC 2025: Prelims cum Mains\n\n(2) \u21d2 UPSC 2026: Prelims cum Mains\n\n(3) \u21d2 UPSC 2027 Prelims cum Mains\n\nTip: Know more about ClearIAS Courses (Online/Offline)\n\nHuman and wildlife health depends on the ability to reproduce and develop normally. This is not possible without a healthy endocrine system.\n\nEndocrine-Disrupting Chemicals can obstruct the steps involved in hormone signaling.\nBy imitating a hormone, they can deceive a receptor, activating an incorrect hormonal response and hormonal processes.\nThe appropriate hormonal processes cannot occur if they bind to a hormone\u2019s receptor and impede activation.\n\nSome endocrine disruptors take a long time to degrade in the environment. They are possibly dangerous as a result of that trait.\n\nAnimals experience negative effects from endocrine-disrupting substances.\nHowever, there is little scientific data on potential human health issues. It is challenging to evaluate the consequences on public health since people are frequently exposed to many endocrine disruptors at once.\nThe endocrine system\n\nThe endocrine system is a complex network of glands and organs. It uses hormones to control and coordinate your body\u2019s metabolism, energy level, reproduction, growth and development, and response to injury, stress, and mood.\n\nThe following are integral parts of the endocrine system:\n\nHypothalamus: The hypothalamus is located at the base of the brain, near the optic chiasm where the optic nerves behind each eye cross and meet. The hypothalamus secretes hormones that stimulate or suppress the release of hormones in the pituitary gland, in addition to controlling water balance, sleep, temperature, appetite, and blood pressure.\nPineal body:\u00a0The pineal body is located below the corpus callosum, in the middle of the brain. It produces the hormone melatonin, which helps the body know when it\u2019s time to sleep.\nPituitary: The pituitary gland is located below the brain. Usually no larger than a pea, the gland controls many functions of the other endocrine glands.\nThyroid and parathyroid:\u00a0The thyroid gland and parathyroid glands are located in front of the neck, below the larynx (voice box). The thyroid plays an important role in the body\u2019s metabolism. The parathyroid glands play an important role in the regulation of the body\u2019s calcium balance.\nThymus: The thymus is located in the upper part of the chest and produces white blood cells that fight infections and destroy abnormal cells.\nAdrenal gland: An adrenal gland is located on top of each kidney. Like many glands, the adrenal glands work hand-in-hand with the hypothalamus and pituitary gland. The adrenal glands make and release corticosteroid hormones and epinephrine that maintain blood pressure and regulate metabolism.\nPancreas: The pancreas is located across the back of the abdomen, behind the stomach. The pancreas plays a role in digestion, as well as hormone production. Hormones produced by the pancreas include insulin and glucagon, which regulate levels of blood sugar.\nOvary:\u00a0A woman\u2019s ovaries are located on both sides of the uterus, below the opening of the fallopian tubes (tubes that extend from the uterus to the ovaries). In addition to containing the egg cells necessary for reproduction, the ovaries also produce estrogen and progesterone.\nTestis:\u00a0A man\u2019s testes are located in a pouch that hangs suspended outside the male body. The testes produce testosterone and sperm.\nCommon endocrine-disrupting chemicals\nBisphenol A (BPA) is used to make polycarbonate plastics and epoxy resins, which are found in many plastic products including food storage containers\nDioxins are produced as a byproduct in herbicide production and paper bleaching, they are also released into the environment during waste burning and wildfires\nPerchlorate is a by-product of aerospace, weapon, and pharmaceutical industries found in drinking water and fireworks\nPerfluoroalkyl and Polyfluoroalkyl Substances (PFAS) are used widely in industrial applications, such as firefighting foams and a non-stick pan, paper, and textile coatings\nPhthalates are used to make plastics more flexible, they are also found in some food packaging, cosmetics, children\u2019s toys, and medical devices\nPhytoestrogens are naturally occurring substances in plants that have hormone-like activity, such as genistein and daidzein that are in soy products, like tofu or soy milk\nPolybrominated diphenyl ethers (PBDE) are used to make flame retardants for household products such as furniture foam and carpets\nPolychlorinated biphenyls (PCB) are used to make electrical equipment like transformers, and in hydraulic fluids, heat transfer fluids, lubricants, and plasticizers\nTriclosan may be found in some anti-microbial and personal care products like liquid body wash.\nHow do people encounter endocrine-disrupting chemicals?\n\nEndocrine disruptors can be ingested through food and beverages, applied through pesticides, and utilized topically through cosmetics. In essence, your cuisine, air, skin, and water may expose you to these substances.\n\nEndocrine-disrupting substances may be dangerous even in small quantities.\nIt is known that even very tiny variations in hormone levels can have substantial developmental and biological implications as part of the body\u2019s normal endocrine functioning.\nAccording to this observation, endocrine-disrupting chemical exposures, even in little doses, might affect the body\u2019s delicate systems and result in health issues.\nHow do animals encounter EDCs?\n\nThese chemicals can leach into our soil and water. They can move through the animal kingdom as animals eat plants and bigger animals eat smaller ones.\n\nNumerous potent effects of exposure to EDCs have been observed in the environment by scientists:\n\nThe reproductive and immune systems of mammals have been adversely affected.\nEggshell thinning and altered sex organ development have been observed in birds of prey exposed to the pesticide DDT, resulting in severe population declines.\nBirth defects, the especially neural defect is pronounced in aquatic animals exposed to EDCs.\nPopulation declines in amphibians, such as frogs, have been seen in both unpolluted and polluted habitats worldwide.\nWhy Endocrine-Disrupting Chemicals are a cause of concern?\n\nMany endocrine-related diseases and disorders are on the rise:\n\nLarge proportions (up to 40%) of young men in some countries have low semen quality, which reduces their ability to father children.\nThe incidence of genital malformations, such as non-descending testes (cryptorchidisms) and penile malformations (hypospadias), in baby boys, has increased over time or leveled off at unfavorably high rates.\nThe incidence of adverse pregnancy outcomes, such as preterm birth and low birth weight, has increased in many countries.\nNeurobehavioural disorders associated with thyroid disruption affect a high proportion of children in some countries and have increased over the past decades.\nGlobal rates of endocrine-related cancers (breast, endometrial, ovarian, prostate, testicular, and thyroid) have been increasing over the past 40\u201350 years.\nThere is a trend towards the earlier onset of breast development in young girls in all countries where this has been studied. This is a risk factor for breast cancer.\nThe prevalence of obesity and type 2 diabetes has dramatically increased worldwide over the last 40 years.\nWHO estimates that 1.5 billion adults worldwide are overweight or obese and that the number with type 2 diabetes increased from 153 million to 347 million between 1980 and 2008.\n\nDespite substantial advances in our understanding of EDCs, uncertainties and knowledge gaps still exist that are too important to ignore.\n\nThese knowledge gaps hamper progress toward better protection of the public and wildlife. An integrated, coordinated international effort is needed to define the role of Endocrine-Disrupting Chemicals in current declines in human and wildlife health and wildlife populations.\n\nIndian scenario in controlling EDCs\nEDC exposure pathways\n\nIndia\u2019s economy has grown tremendously in recent times and with a heavy toll on the environment. In the last two decades, the cost of damage done by pollution and natural disasters in India has risen.\n\nMoreover, poverty, malnutrition, illiteracy, poor living conditions, and limited access to healthcare by a substantial fraction of the population are likely to make India more susceptible to the severe social and health impacts of EDCs.\n\nA review of data on prioritized EDCs like DDT, lindane, PCBs, etc. reported elevated concentrations in the Indian environment and human population compared to the international context including emerging economies like China.\nSimilarly, a recent global survey measuring selected EDCs (in particular DDT) in breastmilk, carried out by WHO and UNEP, highlighted that Indian women and infants are among the most exposed in the world.\nFurthermore, recent studies have also linked elevated EDC burden in the Indian population to adverse health effects such as childhood obesity, which is a major risk factor for other health issues including type 2 diabetes in later life stages.\n\nCurrently, India is updating its regulatory approach toward managing chemicals by drafting a new regulation, the Chemical (Management and Safety) Rules (CMSR).\n\nThese rules are intended to replace two existing regulations- the Manufacture, Storage, and Import of Hazardous Chemical Rules and the Chemical Accidents (Emergency Planning, Preparedness, and Response) Rules.\n\nIndia has numerous regulations and ad hoc acts that indirectly and loosely check the EDCs like:\n\nThe Insecticides Act 1968 and Rules 197\nThe Pesticides Management Act 2020\nThe Indian Drugs and Cosmetic Act of 1940\nCentral Insecticide Board and Registration Committee\u2019s guidelines for biocides\nThe Food Safety and Standards (Packaging) Regulations 2006\n\nThere are several institutions currently engaged in actions for chemical management in India.\n\nThe CSIR-National Environmental Engineering Institute (NEERI) in India conducts research and development (R&D) studies for solving environmental pollution problems, including those involving some of the EDCs.\nOther laboratories, institutions like the Food Safety and Standards Authority of India (FSSAI), Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB), State Pollution Control Boards (SPCBs), and university centers produce independent research on the occurrence, effects, and impacts of EDCs.\n\nBut there is no comprehensive approach in place specifically targeting the regulation of Endocrine-disrupting chemicals.\n\nEstablishing a comprehensive and nationwide monitoring and control system for EDCs in environmental (including food) and human samples is the key to addressing baseline exposure, evaluating the effectiveness of chemical management, and addressing early-stage possible emergencies such as those caused by new pollution hotspots.\nPromotion of organic farming in India (National Mission for Sustainable Agriculture) has been started which is the right step in the direction of reducing EDCs load from harmful farming practices.\nIn addition to the farming processes, food-contact materials (packing) also contribute to EDC content in the food. It would be crucial in that regard to regularly check food products for EDCs and other harmful substances, and to make these results available to consumers.\nNGOs, in addition to research and legislative institutions, play a significant role in several areas in the development and promotion of health-preserving consuming habits and the reduction of health risks from exposure to Endocrine-Disrupting Chemicals.\nIn particular, it is anticipated that NGOs would play a significant role in raising awareness of the issue of EDCs among the general public, particularly among those residing in disadvantaged megacities and rural and semi-urban areas.\n\nAlso, India can take advantage of developed countries\u2019 experience in managing Endocrine-Disrupting Chemicals and set an example for developing countries.\n\nWay forward\n\nMany organizations like the OECD, WHO and European Commission have regulations in place for the control of endocrine-disrupting chemicals.\n\nIn the late 1990s, OECD countries decided to take action to develop tools to identify endocrine-disrupting chemicals. Based on scientific works and research efforts, OECD started to investigate test methods that could be standardized and used in chemical regulations to detect and characterize hazards posed by endocrine-disrupting chemicals.\nWHO has identified the role of EDCs in children\u2019s environmental health and has put in place various resolutions in this regard.\nThrough the International Programme on Chemical Safety (IPCS), WHO works to establish the scientific basis for the sound management of chemicals, and to strengthen national capabilities and capacities for chemical safety.\nThe EU has introduced specific legislative obligations aimed at phasing out endocrine disruptors in water, industrial chemicals, plant protection products, and biocides.\nIn the EU, the regulation on Registration, Evaluation, Authorisation, and Restriction of Chemicals (REACH) and the General Food Law (focused on the risk posed by plant protection product residues, artificial food additives, and contaminants in food) are regulations that centralize risk analysis relevant also for EDCs and human health.\n\nEndocrine-Disrupting Chemicals pollution in India and several other developing countries is a prime concern in managing EDCs and attaining the SDGs globally. Reducing EDC exposure and minimizing health consequences across the globe is paramount for achieving the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs).\n\nAlso Read: Forever Chemicals: What are PFAS?\n\n-Article written by Swathi Satish",

Read further to know more.\n\nThe report on the global Artificial Neural Network (ANN) Market was recently released. It is an information bank that provides thorough data about the market, from its inception to its expected growth trend.\n\nAccording to the latest report, from 2021 to 2028, the ANN market will experience phenomenal growth.\n\nAn ANN\u2019s concept is to define inputs and outputs, then feed pieces of input to computer programmes that function like neurons and make inferences or calculations.\n\nTable of Contents\n\nWhat is an artificial neural network?\nWhat are the applications?\nWhat are the Developments aiding the development of ANNs?\nIn news\nWhat are the limitations of artificial neural networks?\nWay forward\nWhat is an artificial neural network?\n\nAn Artificial Neural Network (ANN) is a type of machine learning model inspired by the structure and function of the human brain. It is a network of interconnected nodes, called artificial neurons, that are designed to process and analyze information.\n\nThe basic building block of an ANN is the artificial neuron, which receives input from other neurons and performs computations on those inputs to produce an output. These neurons are organized into layers, with the input layer receiving raw data, the hidden layers performing computations on that data, and the output layer providing the final result.\n\nThe connections between the neurons, called edges, have weights associated with them. These weights are adjusted during training, allowing the neural network to learn how to produce the correct output for a given input. This process is done through backpropagation.\n\n\ud83d\udc49 Which year are YOU targeting for success in the IAS/IPS/IFS Exam? \ud83d\ude80\n\n(1) \u21d2 UPSC 2025: Prelims cum Mains\n\n(2) \u21d2 UPSC 2026: Prelims cum Mains\n\n(3) \u21d2 UPSC 2027 Prelims cum Mains\n\nTip: Know more about ClearIAS Courses (Online/Offline)\n\nThe network uses the input, performs computations on it, and produces an output. But, the output is compared with the desired output and the error is calculated. This error is then propagated back through the network and the weights are adjusted accordingly. This process is repeated multiple times until the error is minimized.\n\nThere are many different types of neural networks, including feedforward neural networks, recurrent neural networks, and convolutional neural networks, each with its own unique properties and applications.\n\nANNs are widely used in various applications such as image recognition, natural language processing, speech recognition, and control systems. These models are very powerful and flexible, able to learn and generalize from examples and adapt to new situations.\n\nWhat are the applications?\n\nArtificial Neural Networks (ANNs) have a wide range of applications due to their ability to learn and generalize from examples and adapt to new situations. Some of the most common applications of ANNs include:\n\nImage recognition: Artificial Neural Networks can be trained to recognize images, such as identifying objects in photographs or videos. This technology is widely used in self-driving cars, security cameras, and medical imaging.\nNatural Language Processing (NLP): It can be used to understand and generate natural languages, such as in language translation, text summarization, and sentiment analysis.\nSpeech recognition: ANNs can be used to recognize and transcribe speech, which is used in virtual assistants, voice-controlled devices, and automatic speech recognition systems.\nRecommender Systems: These are widely used in recommendation systems, to suggest products, videos, music, and more, based on users\u2019 preferences, search history, and behaviour.\nFinancial Forecasting: ANNs are used in finance to predict stock prices, currency values, and other financial data.\nGaming: ANNs are also used in gaming to train computer players and also used in virtual reality applications.\nMedical Diagnosis: It can be used to analyze medical images and assist in the diagnosis of diseases.\nRobotics and Control Systems: These are used in robotics for tasks such as object recognition, motion planning, and control.\nFraud Detection: ANNs are used to detect fraudulent transactions in areas such as credit card payments, insurance claims and tax filings.\n\nThese are just a few examples of the many applications of ANNs. Due to their flexibility and ability to learn, Artificial Neural Networks have the potential to revolutionize a wide range of industries and make our lives easier.\n\nAlso, read Artificial Intelligence.\n\nWhat are the Developments aiding the development of ANNs?\n\nThere have been several key developments that have helped to advance the field of Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs) in recent years:\n\nBig Data: The availability of large amounts of data has allowed researchers to train larger and more complex ANNs.\nCloud Computing: Cloud computing services have made it possible to train ANNs on powerful remote servers with high computational power.\nGPUs: The use of Graphics Processing Units (GPUs) has greatly accelerated the training time of ANNs by providing parallel processing capabilities.\nAutoML: Automated Machine Learning (AutoML) techniques have made it easier to tune the hyperparameters of ANNs, which can improve their performance.\nTransfer learning: pre-trained models on massive datasets have been made available, this enables fine-tuning on specific datasets which can greatly improve the performance of the model.\nBetter Activation functions: Research in activation functions has led to the development of new functions that allow ANNs to perform better on certain tasks, such as rectified linear units (ReLU) and softmax.\nBetter Optimization Algorithms: Optimization Algorithms like Adam, Adagrad, RMSprop etc have greatly improved the performance of the network by reducing the computational time, faster convergence and providing better results.\nMulti-Modal Representations: Multi-modal representation learning, involves combining data from multiple sources, such as text, images, and audio, to improve the performance of ANNs.\n\nAll these developments have greatly improved the performance of ANNs and have made them a powerful tool for solving a wide range of problems. However, there is still much room for improvement and many open research questions in the field.\n\nIn news\n\nScientists have integrated brain-like tissue with electronics to create\u00a0Brainoware, an\u00a0\u2018organoid\u00a0neural network (ONN)\u2019 capable of recognizing voices and solving complex mathematical problems.\n\nAlthough the chip\u2019s output is not as accurate as that of an AI chatbot, this research highlights the potential of combining bio tissues and computer hardware to produce intelligent results.\nHowever, the scientists emphasize the need for robust ethical considerations, as this research involves using a part of an individual\u2019s body to construct a machine.\nWhat are the limitations of artificial neural networks?\n\nArtificial Neural Networks (ANNs) are powerful and flexible tools, but they do have some limitations. Some of the main limitations of ANNs include:\n\nBlack Box Problem: ANNs are often considered to be a \u201cblack box\u201d because it can be difficult to understand how they arrived at a particular decision or conclusion. This can make it difficult to trust the results or explain them to others.\nOverfitting: ANNs have the tendency to memorize the training data, and not generalize well to new data, a problem known as overfitting. This can lead to poor performance on unseen data. Regularization techniques and early stopping can be used to mitigate this issue\nData Quality: The performance of ANNs heavily depends on the quality and quantity of data available for training. The presence of missing data, outliers or biased data can greatly affect the performance of the network.\nComputational Complexity: ANNs can be computationally intensive and require a lot of computational resources to train and run. This can be a limitation for some applications, particularly for those requiring real-time processing or for systems with limited computational resources.\nLimited interpretability: ANNs can be difficult to interpret, as it\u2019s not always clear how the model arrived at a certain decision. This can make it difficult to understand the underlying relationships in the data or to identify specific factors that are causing the model to make a certain prediction.\nLimited to supervised learning: Most ANNs are limited to supervised learning, which means they need to have labelled data to learn from. This makes it difficult to use them in unsupervised or reinforcement learning scenarios\n\nDespite these limitations, ANNs have proven to be a powerful tool for solving many complex problems and are widely used in various applications. Researchers and developers are constantly working to improve the capabilities and overcome the limitations of ANNs.\n\nWay forward\n\nSeveral areas of research could help to further advance the field of Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs) and improve their capabilities:\n\nExplainable AI: Developing techniques that can provide more insight into the inner workings of ANNs and make them more interpretable to humans. This would make it easier to understand how the model arrived at a particular decision, making it more trustworthy.\nUnsupervised and Reinforcement Learning: Developing ANNs that can learn from unstructured and unlabelled data, as well as through trial-and-error interactions with the environment, as in reinforcement learning, would greatly expand the capabilities of ANNs to solve more complex and realistic problems\nNeuromorphic Computing: Developing hardware that is inspired by the structure and function of the human brain, and can more efficiently perform the computations required by ANNs. This could lead to more powerful and energy-efficient AI systems.\nMulti-modal Learning: Developing ANNs that can effectively combine and process data from multiple sources, such as text, images, and audio, which would enable ANNs to solve more complex and nuanced problems.\nAdversarial Learning: Developing techniques for training ANNs to better handle adversarial examples and improve their robustness to malicious attacks.\nAttention Mechanisms: Improving the ability of ANNs to focus on specific parts of the input, would enable them to perform better on tasks such as natural language processing and image recognition.\nGenerative Models: Advancements in the generative models and their ability to generate new examples of data that look similar to the examples they were trained on, like Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) and Variational Autoencoder (VAE).\n\nResearch in these areas could help to improve the performance and capabilities of ANNs and make them more useful for a wide range of applications.\n\nIt\u2019s important to note that developments in Artificial Neural Networks are interdisciplinary and require collaboration across different fields such as computer science, mathematics, neuroscience, cognitive science, and many more.\n\nAlso read: Brain-Computer Interface\n\nArticle written by: Remya",

    "[CONTENT] #318": "Eclipse is an astronomical event that occurs frequently and makes headlines. There are different types of eclipses and sub-types as well which will be discussed in detail here. Eclipse is derived from the ancient Greek words meaning \u2018abandonment\u2019 or \u2018darkening of a heavenly body\u2019. Read here to learn all about the eclipse event.\n\nSolar and lunar eclipses have long captivated both experts and the general public. Ancient cultures created myths and stories to explain the momentary darkening of the Sun or the Moon because eclipses were regarded as phenomena to be feared.\n\nRecent centuries have seen an increase in the study and examination of our natural environment by astronomers and scientists who track eclipses.\n\nThe last total lunar eclipse that occurred on November 8, 2022, thrilled skywatchers worldwide, the next total lunar eclipse, also known as a blood moon lunar eclipse won\u2019t happen until March 13/14, 2025.\n\nThe last solar eclipse occurred on October 25 which was a partial one, and the subsequent partial solar event will take place on august 2 2027.\n\nTable of Contents\n\nWhat is an eclipse?\nSolar eclipse\nTotal Solar\nAnnular Solar\nPartial Solar\nHybrid Solar Eclipse\nLunar eclipse\nTotal Lunar\nPartial Lunar\nPenumbral Lunar\nPlanet Transits\nHistorical records\nWhat is an eclipse?\n\n\ud83d\udc49 Which year are YOU targeting for success in the IAS/IPS/IFS Exam? \ud83d\ude80\n\n(1) \u21d2 UPSC 2025: Prelims cum Mains\n\n(2) \u21d2 UPSC 2026: Prelims cum Mains\n\n(3) \u21d2 UPSC 2027 Prelims cum Mains\n\nTip: Know more about ClearIAS Courses (Online/Offline)\n\nA temporary obstruction of an astronomical object or spacecraft by passing into the shadow of another body or having another body move in front of it causes an eclipse, which is an astronomical event.\n\nSyzygy is an alignment of three heavenly bodies. Syzygy is derived from the ancient Greek word syzygia, meaning to be yoked together or conjoined.\n\nIn addition to syzygy, the term eclipse is also used when a spacecraft is in a position to see two celestial bodies aligned in this way.\n\nA transit or an occultation (totally concealed) causes an eclipse (partially hidden).\n\nFrom Earth, we can see two types of eclipses:\n\nsolar eclipses- occultation of Sun\nlunar eclipses- occultations of the Moon\n\nThese occur when the Sun, Earth, and the Moon align in a straight or almost straight configuration.\n\nSolar eclipse\n\nSolar eclipses occur when the Sun, the Moon, and Earth line up, either fully or partially. Depending on how they align, eclipses provide a unique, exciting view of either the Sun or the Moon.\n\nA solar eclipse happens when the Moon passes between the Sun and Earth, casting a shadow on Earth that either fully or partially blocks the Sun\u2019s light in some areas.\n\nThis only happens occasionally, because the Moon doesn\u2019t orbit in the same plane as the Sun and Earth do. The time when they are aligned is known as eclipse season, which happens twice a year.\n\nDuring the solar event, the Moon casts two shadows on Earth.\n\nThe umbra: This shadow gets smaller as it reaches Earth. It is the dark center of the Moon\u2019s shadow. People standing in the umbra will see a total eclipse.\nThe penumbra: The penumbra gets larger as it reaches Earth. People standing in the penumbra will see a partial eclipse.\n\nSolar eclipses happen every 18 months somewhere on Earth. Unlike lunar, solar occultations last only a few minutes.\n\nTotal Solar\n\nA total solar eclipse happens when the Moon passes between the Sun and Earth, completely blocking the face of the Sun.\n\nPeople located in the center of the Moon\u2019s shadow when it hits Earth will experience a total occultation. The sky will darken as if it were dawn or dusk.\n\nWeather permitting, people in the path of a total solar eclipse can see the Sun\u2019s corona, the outer atmosphere, which is otherwise usually obscured by the bright face of the Sun.\n\nA total solar occultation is the only type of solar eclipse where viewers can momentarily remove their eclipse glasses for a brief period when the Moon is completely blocking the Sun.\n\nAnnular Solar\n\nAn annular solar eclipse happens when the Moon passes between the Sun and Earth, but when it is at or near its farthest point from Earth.\n\nBecause the Moon is farther away from Earth, it appears smaller than the Sun and does not completely cover the Sun.\n\nAs a result, the Moon appears as a dark disk on top of a larger, bright disk, creating what looks like a ring around the Moon.\n\nPartial Solar\n\nA partial solar eclipse happens when the Moon passes between the Sun and Earth but the Sun, Moon, and Earth are not perfectly lined up.\n\nOnly a part of the Sun will appear to be covered, giving it a crescent shape.\n\nDuring a total or annular solar occultation, people outside the area covered by the Moon\u2019s inner shadow see a partial solar eclipse.\n\nHybrid Solar Eclipse\n\nBecause Earth\u2019s surface is curved, sometimes an eclipse can shift between annular and total as the Moon\u2019s shadow moves across the globe. This is called a hybrid solar eclipse.\n\nLunar eclipse\n\nWhen the Moon moves through the Earth\u2019s shadow, a lunar eclipse takes place. The Moon does not have its light. It shines because its surface reflects the Sun\u2019s rays.\n\nEarth\u2019s shadow can be divided into three parts:\n\nUmbra\u00a0\u2013 the darker, central part.\nPenumbra\u00a0\u2013 the outer part.\nAntumbra\u00a0\u2013 the partly shaded area beyond the umbra.\n\nOnly during a full moon, when the Moon is on the opposite side of the Earth from the Sun, does this occur.\n\nAn eclipse of the Moon can be seen from almost the entire hemisphere, unlike a solar eclipse.\n\nThis makes viewing a lunar eclipse from a specific point far more common. A lunar eclipse lasts longer, lasting many hours, with totality itself typically lasting between 30 minutes and over an hour on average.\n\nTotal Lunar\n\nA total lunar eclipse occurs when Earth\u2019s umbra, the central, dark part of its shadow, covers the Moon\u2019s surface.\n\nBut even during a total lunar eclipse, there are still some light reflections from the Moon, hence is not fully dark. Sunlight that has been refracted by the Earth\u2019s atmosphere enters the umbra and casts a dim light.\n\nSunlight is refracted toward the surface of the Earth as it travels through the atmosphere, with some of the colors with shorter wavelengths scattered and filtered out while the remainder, such as the hues orange and red, travels into the atmosphere. The surface of the fully eclipsed Moon is illuminated in a reddish-orange glow as a result of this light being refracted once more in its direction. For this reason, depictions of such lunar phenomena dating back to the earliest eclipses sometimes use the term \u201cBlood Moon.\u201d\n\nPartial Lunar\n\nWhen Earth\u2019s umbra obscures only part of the Moon\u2019s surface, we see a partial lunar occultation. When that happens, a small part of the Moon\u2019s surface is covered by the darkest, the central part of the Earth\u2019s shadow, called the umbra. The rest of the Moon is covered by the outer part of the Earth\u2019s shadow called the\u00a0penumbra.\n\nPenumbral Lunar\n\nA penumbral lunar occultation happens when the Moon travels through the faint penumbral portion of Earth\u2019s shadow.\n\nWhen this happens, the Earth blocks some of the Sun\u2019s light from directly reaching the Moon\u2019s surface and covers all or part of the Moon with the outer part of its shadow, also known as the\u00a0penumbra. Since the penumbra is much fainter than the dark core of the Earth\u2019s shadow, the\u00a0umbra, a penumbral eclipse of the Moon is often difficult to tell apart from a normal\u00a0Full Moon.\n\nPlanet Transits\n\nWhen a planet comes between Earth and the Sun, it is called a transit. Mercury and Venus are the only two planets that can be seen transiting the Sun from Earth. This is because they are the only planets in the solar system whose orbit is inside Earth\u2019s orbit.\n\nHistorical records\n\nSince ancient times, records of solar and lunar occultations have been preserved. Historical records can be chronologically dated using eclipse dates.\n\nThere have been recordings of the event in a Syrian clay table in 1223 BCE, Ireland in 3340 BCE, Babylonian records of the 13th century BCE, and Greek and Chinese records as well.\n\nIn the 5th century CE, solar and lunar eclipses were scientifically explained by Aryabhata, in his treatise Aryabhatiya. Aryabhata stated that the Moon and planets shine by reflected sunlight and explained eclipses in terms of shadows cast by and falling on Earth. Aryabhata provides the accurate computation and the size of the eclipsed part during an eclipse.\n\n-Article written by Swathi Satish",

Any sort of artificial intelligence that uses unsupervised learning techniques to generate fresh digital images, video, audio, text, or code is referred to as generative AI. Read here to learn more.\n\nBasically, \u201cgenerative AI\u201d refers to any instance in which an Artificial Intelligence technology creates its content, whether that information is written, visual, or multimodal.\n\nThis contains tools for drawing and painting pictures as well as tools for using data acquired from the internet to produce press releases, white papers, company brochures, website articles, and article summaries.\n\nDespite the current downturn and layoffs in the tech sector, generative AI companies continue to receive huge interest from investors.\n\nBy 2025, generative AI is expected to produce 10 percent of all data (now less than 1 percent) with 20 percent of all test data for consumer-facing use cases.\nIt will be sided by 50 percent of drug discovery and development initiatives.\nThirty percent of manufacturers will use it to enhance their product development effectiveness.\n\nTable of Contents\n\nWhat is Generative AI?\nHow is generative AI governed?\nApplications of Generative AI\nConcerns about Generative AI\nWay forward\nPrevious year question\nWhat is Generative AI?\n\nGenerative AI is a cutting-edge technological development that uses Artificial Intelligence and machine learning to produce new types of media, including text, audio, video, and animation.\n\nIt is now possible to produce original and creative short and long-form content, synthetic media, and even deepfakes with simple text, also known as prompts, thanks to the development of advanced machine learning capabilities like large language models, neural translation, information understanding, and reinforcement learning.\n\n\ud83d\udc49 Which year are YOU targeting for success in the IAS/IPS/IFS Exam? \ud83d\ude80\n\n(1) \u21d2 UPSC 2025: Prelims cum Mains\n\n(2) \u21d2 UPSC 2026: Prelims cum Mains\n\n(3) \u21d2 UPSC 2027 Prelims cum Mains\n\nTip: Know more about ClearIAS Courses (Online/Offline)\n\nTo speed up these AI advances, leading technology companies like Microsoft, Google, Facebook, and others have commercial AI laboratories that do research and publish academic papers.\n\nInvesting in GANs (Generative Adversarial Networks), LLMs (Large Language Models), GPT (Generative Pre-trained Transformers), and Image Generation in recent years has allowed researchers to experiment and, in some cases, develop commercial products like DALL-E for image generation and ChatGPT for text generation.\n\nFor instance, ChatGPT is capable of writing blogs, computer code, marketing copy, and even producing search query results.\n\nA Generative Pretrained Transformer (GPT) is a type of large language model (LLM) that uses deep learning to generate human-like text.\n\nThey are called \u201cgenerative\u201d. They can generate new text based on the input they receive, and \u201cpretrained\u201d because they are trained on a large corpus of text data before being fine-tuned for specific tasks.\nAnd \u201ctransformers\u201d because they use a transformer-based neural network architecture to process input text and generate output text.\nHow is generative AI governed?\n\nIn the private sector, two approaches to the governance of generative AI models are currently emerging.\n\nIn one camp, companies such as OpenAI are self-governing the space through limited release strategies, monitored use of models, and controlled access via API for their commercial products like DALL-E2.\nIn the other camp, newer organizations, such as Stability AI, believe that these models should be openly released to democratize access and create the greatest possible impact on society and the economy.\n\nIn the public sector, little or no regulation governs the rapidly evolving landscape of generative AI.\n\nOther issues surround intellectual property and copyright. The datasets behind generative AI models are generally scraped from the internet without seeking consent from living artists or work still under copyright.\n\nApplications of Generative AI\nRealistic visuals and animations can be made with generative AI. To animate virtual characters in real time, researchers have employed generative models to produce photorealistic representations of faces and animals.\nMusic and art can be produced with generative AI. For instance, academics have utilized generative models to produce new musical compositions that are stylistically similar to those of a certain artist.\nText written in natural language can be produced using generative AI. For instance, scientists are employing ChatGPT to produce poetry, news stories, and even computer code.\nDrug discovery could be greatly sped up with the help of artificial intelligence. This will be a boost to the healthcare sector.\nRobotic system design and control can be done using generative AI. A robot\u2019s behavior can be simulated using generative models, which can also produce control signals that let the robot carry out specified tasks.\n\nText-to-image programs such as Midjourney, DALL-E, and Stable Diffusion have the potential to change how art, animation, gaming, movies, and architecture, education among others, are being rendered.\n\nRead:\u00a0AI in Elections\n\nConcerns about Generative AI\n\nWhile generative AI has the potential to boost productivity and efficiency across a variety of fields and applications, abuse of the technology could have a negative influence on society by encouraging prejudice, exclusion, and discrimination.\n\nIt will have a profound effect on jobs as automation will replace humans, especially in the creative industry.\nLarge parts of the creative workforce, including commercial artists working in entertainment, video games, advertising, and publishing, could lose their jobs because of generative AI models.\nArtists are worried that the internet will be flooded with artwork that is indistinguishable from their own, simply by telling the system to reproduce the artwork in a unique style.\nOne of the problems with large language models is their ability to generate false and misleading content.\nSuch capabilities can be misused to generate fake news and disinformation across platforms and ecosystems.\nThere is also the worry that once generative AI becomes popular, the creation and use of these models will be centralized in a small number of big businesses and nations, leading to a concentration of power and the possibility of abuse.\nWay forward\n\nEven while generative AI has the potential to revolutionize a variety of industries and tasks, there is a clear need to control the spread of these models and their effects on society and the economy.\n\nIn the upcoming years, the generative AI community will need to pay close attention to the debate that is currently taking place between centralized, regulated adoption with clear ethical boundaries and quicker innovation and decentralized distribution.\n\nNot only are private firms responsible for completing this task; but civil society and policymakers must also weigh in. This includes the potential for labor markets to be disrupted, the validity of data that has been scraped, licensing, copyright, and the possibility of inaccurate or otherwise harmful content.\n\nGenerative AI requires a considerable amount of training data required to generate outputs, else the output may turn out to be subpar or not good. But an enormous amount of work needs to go into securing the data to avoid any privacy concerns.\n\nThe development of generative AI technology and solutions can only proceed with greater consideration and benefit when reliable checks and balances are in place.\n\nAlso Read:\u00a0IndiaAI Mission;\u00a0IRIS: Kerala introduces India\u2019s first AI Teacher Robot;\u00a0International AI Treaty\n\nPrevious year question\n\nQ.

With cloud computing, users can access database resources via the internet from anywhere, for as long as they need, without worrying about any maintenance or management of actual resources.\n\nIt is the distribution of computer services such as servers, storage, databases, networking, software, analytics, and intelligence through the Internet (\u201cthe cloud\u201d) to enable quicker innovation, more flexible resource allocation, and cost savings. Clouds may be private to a single business (private or internal clouds) or public to several companies (public clouds)\n\nWhat are the salient features of Cloud Computing?\n\nThe following are the salient features of cloud computing.\n\nAttributes\nOn-demand \u2013 It is sold on demand generally by the minute or the hour.\nElastic \u2013 a user can have as much or as little of a service as they want at any given time.\nFully managed by the provider \u2013 The consumer requires nothing but a personal computer and internet connection.\nData-intensive \u2013 The focus is on data rather than computation.\nScalability \u2013 Cloud computing has the ability to continue to function well when it is changed in size or volume in order to meet a user\u2019s need.\nDeployment Models\n\nA cloud service works in 4 deployment models Public cloud, Private cloud, Community cloud, and Hybrid cloud.\n\nService Models\n\nCloud Computing services are divided into 3 categories\n\nInfrastructure as a Service (IaaS)\nPlatform as a Service (PaaS)\nSoftware as a Service (SaaS)\nWhat are the advantages of cloud computing?\nSeamless Connectivity\n\u00a0Cloud-based software offers companies from all sectors a number of benefits, including the ability to use software from any device either via a native app or a browser. As a result, users can carry their files and settings over to other devices in a completely seamless manner.\nLess capital expenditure\nCloud computing services minimize IT requirements and physical storage, which helps small businesses, cut significant business costs.\nMost cloud services are paid on a subscription basis, so capital expenditure is reduced.\nCloud computing is also much faster and easier to deploy, so there are fewer start-up costs.\nCompanies can swap costly server centers and IT departments for fast Internet connections, where employees interact with the cloud online to complete their tasks\nImproved disaster recovery\nCloud computing services also make it possible for users to back up their music, files, and photos, ensuring those files are immediately available in the event of a hard drive crash.\nMoving the business data to the cloud can make disaster recovery possible i.e., retrieving data in case of a hardware compromise.\nIncreased Collaboration and flexibility\nFor many businesses, moving to the cloud enhances opportunities for collaboration between employees.\nColleagues can sync and work on documents with ease, often simultaneously, receiving updates in real time.\nIt allows team members to work from anywhere.\nFurthermore, the cloud centralizes the data = owner, employees and clients can access the company data from any location with internet access.\nEnvironmentally friendly\nCloud computing reduces a company\u2019s carbon footprint by minimizing energy consumption and carbon emissions by more than 30%.\nFor small businesses, the decreased energy usage can reach up to 90% = A huge money saver.\nGlobal Scale\nOne of the advantages of cloud computing is its capacity to scale elastically. It enables the cloud to supply the appropriate IT resources, such as computing power, storage, and bandwidth in the proper time and from the appropriate geographic location\nProductivity\non-premise data centers usually need extensive hardware configuration, software patching, and other time-consuming IT maintenance tasks. IT teams can put their efforts into achieving more important business objectives\nPerformance\nThe largest cloud computing services are delivered via a global network of secure data centers routinely updated to the current generation of fast and efficient computer gear. It has various advantages over a single corporate data center, including lower application network latency and increased economies of scale\nSecurity\nNumerous cloud providers provide a comprehensive set of rules, technologies, and controls. It improves your entire security posture by assisting in the protection of your data, applications, and infrastructure from possible attacks\nWhat is Cloud Computing trend in India?\nCloud computing has found its applications in India in recent years as they are used in everyday activities of people such as social networking, mail, online purchases, and large-scale operations of MNCs including big data, Internet of Things (IoT), etc.\nCloud Computing offers huge potential for Indian firms to grow and is opening up new windows of opportunities. Sectors like retail, railways, manufacturing, banking, education, and healthcare have started switching to cloud services.\nWhat is the regulatory and legal framework for cloud computing in India?\nCloud computing needs careful scrutiny by regulators due to its multi-dimensional nature.\nLegal frameworks should be mandated due to concerns regarding cloud services like data privacy, data protection, data ownership, multi-jurisdiction issues, and disclosure and cross-border movement of data.\nWhile the Indian Telegraph Act, of 1885, the Civil Procedure Code of 1908, and the Telecom Regulatory Authority of India Act, 1997 deal with this sector in an indirect manner, the Information Technology (IT) Act of 2000 is of more relevance for regulating this sector.\nIT Act, 2000 \u2013 provides for provisions regarding penalties for the breach of data and privacy. The Act targets e-commerce and cybercrime in general and data protection and data privacy are covered under it.\nWhile the above-mentioned laws do cover some legal issues regarding cloud computing, however, they don\u2019t cover the scope of cloud computing services and the issues arising from it.\nCloud computing in Indian Governance:\n\nCloud computing has been used in the following ways in India.\n\nE-Gram Panchayat\n\nThe majority of the Indian population lives in villages, and the Panchayats represent the face of governance for these villagers. To improve the quality of governance, the Indian government initiated an e-governance scheme known as ePanchayat to simplify and enhance internal government operations. The module was constructed in 4 phases of e-governance.\n\nIndian Railways on Cloud\n\nGoverned by the Central Railway Ministry of India, the Indian railway network is the largest rail network in Asia and the second-largest rail network in the world. Research carried by the railway ministry says out of 17 million passengers every day, only 1 million passengers carry confirmed rail tickets. This results in substantial monetary loss. To avoid loss, the Indian government decided to implement cloud technology for Indian railways. Today, the central government maintains railway data on the cloud.\n\nRailCloud \u2013 The Indian railways have launched RailCloud, a cloud-based service that will enable faster connectivity at a minimal cost.\n\nNivaran-Grievance portal \u2013 It is the first IT application on RailCloud. It is a platform for the resolution of service-related grievances of both serving and former railway employees.\n\nKisan Suvidha\n\nThe Indian government came up with the portal Kisan Suvidha to help farmers with the relevant information instantly. It delivers farmers with detailed knowledge on weather, market prices, seeds, fertilizers, pesticides, agriculture machinery, dealers, agro advisories, plant protection and IPM practices. It notifies them with extreme weather conditions and the changing market price.\n\nDigiLocker\n\nDigiLocker is the public cloud-based storage introduced by the Indian government for the citizens of India. It is much more than an online drive where you upload your documents to be accessed depending on your convenience. The documents are digitally verified and signed by the government of India in a few seconds with an authentic DigiLocker verification seal. With more than 57.13 million users and 4.27 billion issued documents, DigiLocker has proved to be one of the biggest success stories of cloud in the government.\n\neHospital\n\neHospital is a cloud-based healthcare project implemented by the government of India to ease the process of healthcare management. The system was designed to speed up services like online registration, payment of fees and appointments, online diagnostic reports, checking on the availability of blood online, etc. This hospital model assigns a unique identification number to every patient at the time of registration. The medical history of a particular patient can be accessed using the number.\n\nGovernment e-Marketplace (GeM)\n\nOne of India\u2019s most landmark initiatives, the Government e-Marketplace (GeM) uses a multi-cloud architecture to ensure scalability. Today, the GeM serves over 50,000 buyer organizations and has a listing of over 19 lakh products and more than 80,000 services.\n\nNational Highway Authority of India (NHAI)\n\nThe National Highway Authority of India (NHAI),\u00a0announced last year that it had gone fully digital with the launch of a unique cloud-based and AI-powered big analytics platform. All project documents and correspondences related to NHAI will be stored in a cloud-based data lake, which is linked with GIS tagging and a unique project ID, so that project data can be retrieved easily from any location.\n\nHospital Management Information System\n\nThe Indian Railways has been given the responsibility of deploying open source Hospital Management Information System (HMIS), an integrated clinical information system, for its 125 health facilities and 650 polyclinics across the country for improved hospital administration and patient healthcare, using a cloud platform.\n\nThe E-health vision of the government aims at incorporating the Health Information Exchange (HIE) mechanism through a cloud platform. An electronic HIE enables stakeholders to correctly assess and securely share a patient\u2019s medical information electronically.\n\nMeghRaj\n\nThe Government of India is embracing cloud computing technology for expanding its e-governance initiatives throughout the country. In India, the focus of e-governance is to reduce corruption and ensure the government schemes are reaching people living in rural areas of the country. Further, e-governance services ensure quicker service delivery and eliminate the involvement of middlemen who tend to capitalize on loopholes for quick money by means of exploiting people.\n\nIn order to utilize and harness the benefits of Cloud Computing, the Government of India has embarked upon an ambitious initiative \u2013 \u201cGI Cloud\u201d which has been named as \u2018MeghRaj\u2019. This initiative is to implement various components including governance mechanisms to ensure the proliferation of Cloud in the government. The focus of this initiative is to accelerate the delivery of e-services in the country while optimizing the ICT spending of the Government.\n\nMeghRaj will ensure optimum utilization of the infrastructure and speed up the development and deployment of eGov applications. The architectural vision of GI Cloud encompasses a set of discrete cloud computing environments spread across multiple locations, built on existing or new (augmented) infrastructure, following a set of common protocols, guidelines, and standards issued by the Government of India.\n\nInfrastructure sector:\n\nSmart city\u2019s mission facilitates local development by utilizing technology such as cloud computing.\n\nMoreover, the government has also recognized the importance of cloud-based service delivery for Digital India since it integrates smart devices and infrastructure and processes a large amount of data from different sources in real-time.\n\nBanking sector:\n\nReserve Bank of India (RBI) has been working towards achieving 100% financial inclusion with the help of technology. The RBI has been utilizing cloud-based solutions, especially for cooperative banks to extend banking services across India via core banking solutions.\n\nThe use of cloud computing in the Banking sector will result in reduced timelines, moving the cost from capital expenditure to operational expenditure = banks could concentrate on core banking business.\n\nIndian Banking Community Cloud (IBCC) is the first community cloud initiative for the banking sector in India.\n\nManufacturing sector:\n\nWith the Make in India initiative in full motion, the adoption of cloud computing became even more relevant for the Indian manufacturing sector.\n\nSome common applications of Cloud Computing in the manufacturing sector are CRM (Customer Relationships Management), supply chain applications, data warehousing, information security, green IT, Human Machine Interface (HMI), and so on.\n\nTelecom sector:\n\nDeploying operations and business support systems over cloud platforms is a highly effective method for resolving different business and technical challenges faced by the telecom sector.\n\nCloud platforms provide an effective way to facilitate resource sharing, automation, monitoring, managing software upgrades and improving operations of telecom companies.\n\nStart-ups and SMEs:\n\nThe low capital investment and quick marketing time through cloud services encourage entrepreneurship in the country facilitating start-ups and small-medium businesses to start small and expand their business according to the demand.\n\nDigital MSME Scheme \u2013 It provides cloud-based services for MSMEs to reduce their cost by avoiding the building of in-house IT infrastructure.\n\nIn India, cloud computing has ensured the success of national initiatives and schemes such as\u00a0Swachh Bharat Mission, e-Hospital, National Scholarship, My-Gov and e-Transport.\n\nNIC\u2019s SaaS-based service,\u00a0S3WaaS,\u00a0has empowered district administrators to create, configure and deploy scalable and accessible websites without much effort and technical knowledge.\n\nWhat are the challenges in the adoption of cloud computing in India?\nInfrastructure: Lack of effective infrastructure for data centers in India.\nEnergy resource management: The cost of powering and cooling amounts to 53% of the total operational expenditure of data centers. The challenge is not only to reduce energy costs in data centers, but also to meet government regulations and environmental standards.\nConsolidation of servers: Achieving effective server consolidation (i.e., utilizing the remote servers to the maximum level to reduce energy usage) without affecting application performance is a primary challenge.\nPlatform management: Challenges in providing middleware capabilities for building, deploying, integrating and managing applications in a multi-tenant, elastic and scalable environment.\nMaintaining security architecture: The right cloud security architecture is needed for responding to security threats effectively and instantly and reducing risks associated with the business or government services.\nConclusion\n\nCloud computing can further the motive\u00a0of e-governance (service delivery, transparency, citizen awareness and grievance redressal)\u00a0by providing a faster, easier, and cost-effective platform that can be used by multiple government agencies. Way ahead lies in taking due care of security, interoperability, and licensing.\n\nTo sum up it can be said that the cloud is the storage of applications, services, and data on the internet. These service providers rely on giant server farms and massive storage devices that are connected via internet protocols and cloud computing is the use of these services by individuals and organizations.\n\nCloud computing is both a combination of software and hardware-based computing resources delivered as a networked service. This model of IT-enabled services enables anytime access to a shared pool of applications and resources. Cloud computing provides the facility to access shared resources and common infrastructure offering services on-demand over networks to perform operations that meet changing business needs.\n\nArticle written by: Aseem Muahmmed",

With the aid of synthetic biology, researchers can create brand-new DNA sequences from scratch.\n\nThe term was used to describe the synthesis of\u00a0unnatural organic molecules that function in living systems.\n\n\ud83d\udc49 Which year are YOU targeting for success in the IAS/IPS/IFS Exam? \ud83d\ude80\n\n(1) \u21d2 UPSC 2025: Prelims cum Mains\n\n(2) \u21d2 UPSC 2026: Prelims cum Mains\n\n(3) \u21d2 UPSC 2027 Prelims cum Mains\n\nTip: Know more about ClearIAS Courses (Online/Offline)\n\nMore broadly in this sense, the term has been used with reference to efforts to\u00a0\u2018redesign life\u2019.\nWhat are the Applications of Synthetic Biology?\n\nThere are many potential applications for this, including the following:\n\nProduction of biofuels: Could be used to design microorganisms that are capable of efficiently producing biofuels from renewable feedstocks such as plant material or waste products.\nNatural Product Synthesis: Engineers microbes to produce all of the necessary enzymes and biological functions to perform complex multistep production of natural products.\nFor e.g, Microorganisms harnessed for\u00a0bioremediation\u00a0(use of living microorganisms to degrade environmental contaminants into less toxic forms) to clean pollutants from water, soil and air.\nMedicine: Synthetic biology could be used to design and produce new drugs and therapies, such as vaccines or cancer treatments.\nIndustrial chemicals: Could be used to produce industrial chemicals such as plastics or detergents in a more sustainable and cost-effective way.\nApplied Protein Design:\u00a0redesign existing biological parts and expand the set of natural protein functions for new processes.\nFor e.g, Modified rice produces beta-carotene (a nutrient usually associated with carrots), which prevents\u00a0Vitamin A deficiency.\nEnvironmental cleanup: This could be used to design microorganisms that can clean up pollution or restore damaged ecosystems.\nAgriculture: Synthetic biology could be used to improve crop yields, create drought-resistant crops, or develop crops that are more resistant to pests and diseases.\nSynthetic Genomics:\u00a0design and construct a \u2018simple\u2019 genome for a natural bacterium.\nFor e.g, Yeast is engineered to produce rose oil as an eco-friendly and sustainable substitute for real roses that perfumers use to make luxury scents.\nResearch and development: Synthetic biology can be used as a tool to understand fundamental biological processes, which can lead to new insights and innovations in a variety of fields.\nStandardised Biological Parts:\u00a0identify and categorise standardised genomic parts that can be used (and synthesised quickly) to build new biological systems.\n\nAlso read: DNA Cloning\n\nWhat are the challenges associated with Synthetic biology?\n\nThere are several challenges associated with synthetic biology:\n\nTechnical challenges: This involves the design and construction of complex biological systems, which can be technically challenging. There is a need for improved tools and technologies to enable the precise and reliable design and construction of synthetic biological systems.\nRegulatory challenges: There is a lack of clear and consistent regulation for synthetic biology, which can make it difficult for researchers and companies to navigate the field.\nEthical challenges: This will raise a number of ethical concerns, such as the potential for negative impacts on the environment or concerns about the ethical implications of creating genetically modified organisms.\nSocietal challenges: There is a lack of public understanding and acceptance of synthetic biology, which could hinder its development and implementation. There is also the potential for synthetic biology to have negative impacts on industries or job markets, as well as to exacerbate existing socio-economic inequalities.\nFunding challenges: This research can be expensive and time-consuming, and securing funding can be a challenge.\nIntellectual property challenges: The field of synthetic biology is rapidly evolving, and there is an ongoing debate about intellectual property rights and who should have access to the technologies and tools developed in the field.\nWhat are the negative impacts?\n\nThere are potential negative impacts of synthetic biology that need to be carefully considered. These include:\n\nSafety: There is the potential for synthetic biological systems to behave in unexpected ways, which could have negative consequences. For example, genetically modified organisms (GMOs) used in agriculture could have unintended effects on the environment or other organisms.\nNegative Environmental Health: The intentional or\u00a0accidental release of genetically engineered organisms\u00a0into the environment could have significant negative impacts on both human and environmental health.\nMisuse of these technologies and a failure to account for unintended consequences\u00a0could cause irreversible environmental damage.\nSecurity: Synthetic biology could potentially be used for malicious purposes, such as the development of bioweapons.\nEthical concerns: There are ethical concerns surrounding the use of synthetic biologies, such as the possibility of creating genetically modified organisms that could have negative impacts on biodiversity or the fear that it could lead to \u201cdesigner babies.\u201d\nDo-It-Yourself Biology: It\u2019s a movement of \u201ccitizen scientists\u201d interested in synthetic biology experiments that have become an international phenomenon over the last decade.\nOften with little prior knowledge of the field, enthusiasts meet in makeshift labs to take crash courses\u00a0in biotechnology and conduct hands-on experiments.\nSocioeconomic impacts: There is the potential for synthetic biology to have negative impacts on industries or job markets, as well as to exacerbate existing socioeconomic inequalities.\nEthical Concerns:\u00a0Many of the ethical questions relevant to synthetic biology are similar toethical discussions related to genome editing\u00a0like:\nAre humans crossing moral boundaries by redesigning organisms with synthetic biology techniques?\nIf synthetic biology yields new treatments and cures for diseases, who in our society will have access to them?\nPublic acceptance: There is a lack of public understanding and acceptance of synthetic biology, which could hinder its development and implementation.\nWay Forward\n\nThe way forward will likely involve a combination of research, development, regulation, and engagement with stakeholders. Some specific steps that could help to advance the field include:\n\nInvestment in research and development: Continued investment in research and development is needed to improve the tools and technologies used in synthetic biology and to address technical challenges.\nDevelopment of clear and consistent regulation: Establishing clear and consistent regulation for synthetic biology will be important for ensuring the safety and ethical use of the technology.\nGuidance for the private sector for future research and all considerations will be undertaken related to relevant policy frameworks, including those in intellectual property rights. How India will regulate the development and use of this technology, considering issues related to environment and socio-economics. While making a national strategy India should consider the Principles of International Law which are:\nThe precautionary principle\nState sovereignty and prevention of transboundary harm.\nState responsibility and Environment Impact Assessment\nPrinciples of access to information, public participation and access to justice\nPeople\u2019s right to self-determination and free prior informed consent\nSustainable development and inter-generational equity\nEngagement with stakeholders: It will be important to engage with a wide range of stakeholders, including the public, industry, and policymakers, to ensure that the potential benefits and risks of synthetic biology are carefully considered and addressed.\nEducation and public outreach: Efforts to educate the public about synthetic biology and address misconceptions will be important for building public acceptance and support for the field.\nInternational collaboration: International collaboration will be important for advancing the field of synthetic biology and addressing global challenges such as climate change and food security.\n\nArticle written by: Remya",

The PSLV is a four-stage launch vehicle with solid and liquid propulsion stages. It is capable of launching satellites into a variety of orbits, including polar and geostationary orbits.\n\nThe SDSC, also known as the Sriharikota Range (SHAR), is a rocket launching station operated by the Indian Space Research Organisation (ISRO). It is located on the island of Sriharikota, about 80 km north of Chennai, India. The centre has two launch pads, designated as the First Launch Pad (FLP) and the Second Launch Pad (SLP). The Mangalyaan mission was launched from the FLP.\n\nMars Orbiter Mission was launched with the help of the Polar Satellite Launch Vehicle (PSLV) C-25.\nPSLV C-25 is an XL version of the PSLV launch vehicle.\nThis mission was launched from Satish Dhawan Space Centre, Sriharikota, located in Nellore District of Andhra Pradesh.\nThis mission was launched by ISRO on November 5, 2013.\n\nThe Mangalyaan mission carried 5 different scientific payloads which are listed below\n\nMars Color Camera (MCC)\nMethane Sensor for Mars (MSM)\nLyman\u00a0Alpha Photometer (LAP)\nThermal Infrared Imaging Spectrometer (TIS)\nMars Exospheric Neutral Composition Analyser (MENCA)\nMars Mission- Challenges\n\nThere are many challenges that space agencies and scientists must overcome in order to successfully send a mission to Mars and achieve its objectives. Some of the main challenges of Mars missions include:\n\nDistance: Mars is much farther away from Earth than the Moon, so it takes longer to get there and requires more fuel.\nCommunication: The distance between Earth and Mars means that it takes time for signals to be transmitted between the two planets, which can make communication and data transmission difficult.\nPropelling the spacecraft with sufficient velocity to escape Earth\u2019s gravitational grasp, guiding it along the proper trajectory over vast distances, and then slowing it down sufficiently to go\u00a0into orbit around the planet MARS.\nThe spacecraft had to be capable of operating autonomously as communication signals to and from ground stations could take minutes to reach it.\nSince 1960, there have been 51 global missions to Mars and the overall success rate stands at 42% which shows that it was quite a difficult mission.\nTime: Mars missions typically take several months to complete, so spacecraft and their instruments must be able to function for long periods of time without maintenance or repair.\nAutonomy: Because of the distance between Earth and Mars, it is not possible for mission controllers to directly control the spacecraft in real time. Instead, the spacecraft must be able to make decisions and take actions on its own using onboard computers and software.\nEnvironmental conditions: Mars has a thin atmosphere, low air pressure, extreme temperature variations, and high levels of radiation, which can all be challenging for spacecraft and their instruments to survive.\nLandings: Landing a spacecraft on the surface of Mars is particularly challenging because the planet has a thin atmosphere, which makes it difficult to slow down the spacecraft and achieve a soft landing.\nHuman factors: Sending humans to Mars would pose additional challenges, such as the need to provide them with a habitable habitat, life support systems, and other resources they would need to survive on the planet.\n\nDespite these challenges, the Mangalyaan mission was successfully launched and achieved its objectives, making it an important milestone for ISRO and India\u2019s space program.\n\nAlso, read Space debris.\n\nMars Orbiter Mission \u2013 Achievements\n\nSome of the key achievements of the Mangalyaan mission include:\n\nDemonstrating India\u2019s capabilities in space technology: The Mangalyaan mission was the first time that India had sent a spacecraft to another planet, and its success has helped to increase the country\u2019s international standing in the field of space exploration.\nStudying the surface and atmosphere of Mars: The Mangalyaan spacecraft has been collecting data on the surface features and mineralogy of Mars, as well as the atmospheric processes and trace gases on the planet. This data will help scientists to better understand the geological and climatological history of Mars.\nStudying the surface radiation environment on Mars: The Mangalyaan spacecraft has also been studying the surface radiation environment on Mars, which will help scientists to understand the effects of radiation on the planet\u2019s surface and atmosphere.\nStudying the interplanetary medium and the solar wind-Mars interaction: The Mangalyaan spacecraft has been studying the interaction between the solar wind and the Martian atmosphere, which will help scientists to understand the processes that shape the Martian environment.\nProviding valuable data for future missions: The data collected by the Mangalyaan spacecraft will be used to inform the design and planning of future Mars missions, including both unmanned and manned missions.\nIndia is the 1st country in the world to achieve Mars Orbit Insertion in the very 1st attempt. The cost of this mission was $ 74 million, it cost less than a famous Hollywood movie named Gravity.\nMOM is the cheapest Interplanetary Space Mission in the World.\nIt is the 1st Indian spacecraft to survive the Van Allen Belt, by crossing it 39 times.\n\nOverall, the Mangalyaan mission has been a successful and important step in the exploration of Mars and the understanding of the planet\u2019s environment and history.\n\nWhat is the need to explore Mars?\n\nThere are many scientific and technological reasons why humans are interested in exploring Mars. Some of the main reasons include:\n\nUnderstanding the history and evolution of the solar system: Mars is considered to be a \u201csister planet\u201d to Earth, and studying it can help scientists to understand the early history and evolution of the solar system as a whole.\nSearching for signs of past or present life: Mars may have once had conditions that were suitable for life, and there is evidence that liquid water may still exist on or below the surface of the planet. Studying Mars could help scientists to understand the conditions that are necessary for life to arise and evolve, and to search for signs of past or present life on the planet.\nDeveloping new technologies: The challenges of exploring Mars, such as the distance from Earth and the extreme environmental conditions on the planet, requires the development of new technologies and systems for space exploration. These technologies can have many practical applications here on Earth, such as in the fields of medicine, energy, and transportation.\nInspiring the public: Space exploration has the ability to capture the imagination of the public and inspire people to pursue careers in science, technology, engineering, and math.\nEstablishing a human presence beyond Earth: Some people believe that it is important for humanity to establish a permanent presence beyond Earth in order to ensure the survival and prosperity of our species over the long term. Exploring and potentially colonizing Mars could be an important step in this direction.\nWhy this Mars mission is important for India and the world?\n\nSome of the reasons why this mission is important to include:\n\nDemonstrating India\u2019s capabilities in space technology: The Mangalyaan mission was the first time that India had sent a spacecraft to another planet, and its success has helped to increase the country\u2019s international standing in the field of space exploration.\nProviding valuable scientific data: The Mangalyaan spacecraft has been collecting data on the surface and atmosphere of Mars, as well as the surface radiation environment and the interaction between the solar wind and the Martian atmosphere. This data will be used to inform the design and planning of future Mars missions, including both unmanned and manned missions.\nMars experiences seasons just like Earth, so exploring Mars will help answer important questions about the development of our solar system and our place in the cosmos.\nThe investigations will aid in understanding why and how Mars lost liquid water. For humans to survive on Earth in the long run, this is a crucial question.\nWe might learn more about the existence of microbial life on Mars as a result of exploring it. Days on Mars last 24 hours. The tilt that causes the seasons, as well as the rotational period and seasonal cycles, are all similar to those of Earth.\nPromoting international cooperation: The Mangalyaan mission has involved collaboration between scientists and engineers from around the world and has helped to strengthen ties between India and other countries in the field of space exploration.\nMars is a terrestrial planet with a small atmosphere that shares similarities with Earth\u2019s volcanoes, valleys, deserts, and polar ice caps as well as the Moon\u2019s impact craters.\nVenus is 900 degrees Fahrenheit and would melt or vaporise the majority of objects you sent to its surface due to a runaway greenhouse effect. Due to its proximity to the Sun, Mercury is also very hot. Mars, therefore, appears perfect when compared to the nearby terrestrial planets, despite the difficulties.\nInspiring the public: The success of the Mangalyaan mission has captured the imagination of the public and has inspired people, particularly young people, to pursue careers in science, technology, engineering, and math.\n\nOverall, the Mangalyaan mission has been an important achievement for India and the world and has contributed to our understanding of Mars and the solar system as a whole.\n\nArticle written by: Remya",

Widespread metastases are the primary cause of death from cancer.\n\nCancer begins when genetic changes interfere with this orderly process causing cells to start to grow uncontrollably.\n\nThese cells may form a mass called a tumor. A tumor can be cancerous or benign.\nA cancerous tumor is malignant, meaning it can grow and spread to other parts of the body.\nA benign tumor means the tumor can grow but will not spread.\nSome types of cancer do not form a tumor. These include leukemias, most types of lymphoma, and myeloma.\nTypes of cancer\n\nDoctors divide cancer into types based on where it begins. Four main types of cancer are:\n\nCarcinomas: A carcinoma begins in the skin or the tissue that covers the surface of internal organs and glands. Carcinomas usually form solid tumors. They are the most common type of cancer. Examples of carcinomas include prostate, breast, lung, and colorectal.\nSarcomas: A sarcoma begins in the tissues that support and connect the body. A sarcoma can develop in fat, muscles, nerves, tendons, joints, blood vessels, lymph vessels, cartilage, or bone.\nLeukemias: Leukemia is a cancer of the blood. Leukemia begins when healthy blood cells change and grow uncontrollably. The 4 main types of leukemia are acute lymphocytic leukemia, chronic lymphocytic leukemia, acute myeloid leukemia, and chronic myeloid leukemia.\nLymphomas: Lymphoma is cancer that begins in the lymphatic system. The lymphatic system is a network of vessels and glands that help fight infection. There are 2 main types of lymphomas: Hodgkin lymphoma and non-Hodgkin lymphoma.\n\nThere are many other types as well which do not fall under the above categories like the ones affecting the central nervous system.\n\nAlso read: Sickle Cell Disease\n\nHow cancer spreads?\n\nAs a cancerous tumor grows, the bloodstream or lymphatic system may carry cancer cells to other parts of the body.\n\nDuring this process, the cancer cells grow and may develop into new tumors.\nThis is known as metastasis.\n\nOne of the first places cancerous tumor often spreads is to the lymph nodes.\n\nLymph nodes are tiny, bean-shaped organs that help fight infection.\nThey are located in clusters in different parts of the body, such as the neck, groin area, and under the arms.\n\nIt may also spread through the bloodstream to distant parts of the body.\n\nThese parts may include the bones, liver, lungs, or brain.\nEven if it spreads, it is still named for the area where it began.\nFor example, if breast cancer spreads to the lungs, it is called metastatic breast cancer, not lung cancer.\n\nAlso read: Stem Cells: Therapy, Banking, and Regulations\n\nWhat causes cancer?\n\nCancer arises from the transformation of normal cells into tumor cells in a multi-stage process that generally progresses from a pre-cancerous lesion to a malignant tumor.\n\nThese changes are the result of the interaction between a person\u2019s genetic factors and three categories of external agents, including:\n\nphysical carcinogens, such as ultraviolet and ionizing radiation;\nchemical carcinogens, such as asbestos, components of tobacco smoke, alcohol, aflatoxin (a food contaminant), and arsenic (a drinking water contaminant); and\nbiological carcinogens, such as infections from certain viruses, bacteria, or parasites.\n\nTobacco use, alcohol consumption, unhealthy diet, physical inactivity, and air pollution are risk factors for the disease and other non-communicable diseases.\n\nAlso read: Cervical Cancer\n\nPrevention\n\nThe risk of cancerous tumor can be reduced by:\n\nnot using tobacco;\nmaintaining a healthy body weight;\neating a healthy diet, including fruit and vegetables;\ndoing physical activity regularly;\navoiding or reducing consumption of alcohol;\ngetting vaccinated against HPV and hepatitis B if you belong to a group for which vaccination is recommended;\navoiding ultraviolet radiation exposure (which primarily results from exposure to the sun and artificial tanning devices) and/or using sun protection measures;\nensuring safe and appropriate use of radiation in health care (for diagnostic and therapeutic purposes);\nminimizing occupational exposure to ionizing radiation; and\nreducing exposure to outdoor air pollution and indoor air pollution, including radon (a radioactive gas produced from the natural decay of uranium, which can accumulate in buildings \u2014 homes, schools, and workplaces).\nTreatment\n\nA correct cancer diagnosis is essential for appropriate and effective treatment because every cancer type requires a specific treatment regimen.\n\nTreatment usually includes surgery, radiotherapy, and/or systemic therapy (chemotherapy, hormonal treatments, targeted biological therapies).\n\nSome of the most common cancer types, such as breast cancer, cervical cancer, oral cancer, and colorectal cancer, have high cure probabilities when detected early and treated according to best practices.\nSome cancer types, such as testicular seminoma and different types of leukemia and lymphoma in children, also have high cure rates if appropriate treatment is provided, even when cancerous cells are present in other areas of the body.\n\nThere is a significant variation in treatment availability between countries of different income levels; comprehensive treatment is reportedly available in more than 90% of high-income countries but less than 15% of low-income countries.\n\nLatest news\n\nIndia is expected to roll out the indigenously developed CERVAVAC vaccine for the prevention of cervical cancer among girls aged 9-14 years through their schools by mid-2023.\n\nThe decision was based on the National Technical Advisory Group for Immunisation (NTAGI) recommendation to introduce the Human Papillomavirus (HPV) Vaccine in the Universal Immunisation Programme.\nIt is India\u2019s first indigenously developed quadrivalent human papillomavirus (qHPV) vaccine that is said to be effective against four strains of the virus \u2013 Type 6, Type 11, Type 16, and Type 18.\n\nCervical cancer is the 4th most common type of cancer among women, globally and 2nd most common among women in India.\n\nBut when diagnosed, cervical cancer is one of the most successfully treatable forms of cancer, as long as it is detected early and managed effectively.\n\nThe burden of cancers in India\n\nCancer cases in India increased at an average annual rate of 1.1-2 percent from 2010-2019.\n\nAccording to a report by the Indian Council for Medical Research on the \u2018Burden of cancers in India\u2019, seven cancers accounted for more than 40% of the total disease burden: lung (10.6%), breast (10.5%), esophagus (5.8%), mouth (5.7%), stomach (5.2%), liver (4.6%) and cervix uteri (4.3%).\n\nThe National Cancer Grid (NCG) is an initiative of the Government of India through the Department of Atomic Energy and its grant-in-aid institution, the Tata Memorial Centre.\n\nIt started to create a network of cancer centers, research institutes, patient groups, and charitable institutions across India.\nThe main objectives are: developing uniform standards of patient care for the prevention, diagnosis, and treatment of cancer; providing specialized training and education in oncology and facilitating collaborative basic, translational and clinical research in cancer.\n\nNCG today has over 270 hospitals in its network across India.\n\nTo tackle the challenge of Non-Communicable Diseases (NCD), including cancer, 599 NCD Clinics at the District level and 3,274 NCD Clinics at the Community Health Centre level have been set up under National Programme for Prevention and Control of Cancer, Diabetes, Cardiovascular Diseases, and Stroke (NPCDCS).\n\nRead:\u00a0Cancer care in India\n\n-Article written by Swathi Satish",

Some genomes are incredibly small, such as those found in viruses and bacteria, whereas other genomes can be almost unexplainably large, such as those found in some plants.\n\nThe human genome contains about 3 billion nucleotides.\nThe rare Japanese flower called Paris japonica has a genome size of roughly 150 billion nucleotides, making it 50 times the size of the human genome.\nInteresting facts about genome\n\nIf printed out the 3.2 billion letters in the human genome would:\n\nFill a stack of paperback books 200 feet (61 m) high\nFill 200 500-page telephone directories\nTake a century to recite, if we recited one letter per second for 24 hours a day\nExtend 3,000 km (1,864 miles), that\u2019s about the distance from London to the Canary Islands, Washington to Guatemala, or from New Delhi to Hanoi.\nGenome vs gene\nA gene is a part of the DNA while a genome is the total DNA in a cell.\nGene is the hereditary element of genetic information while the genome is the complete set of nuclear DNA.\nGene encodes protein synthesis, whereas genome encodes both protein and regulatory elements of protein synthesis.\nThe length of the gene is about a few hundred bases while the genome of a higher organism has about a billion base pairs.\nVariations in genes are naturally selected, while horizontal gene transfer and duplication cause variations in the genome.\nWhat is whole genome sequencing (WGS)?\n\nAll organisms (microorganisms, plants, mammals) have a unique genetic code, or genome, that is composed of nucleotide bases- adenine, thymine, cytosine, guanine (A, T, C, and G).\n\nIf you know the sequence of the bases in an organism, you have identified its unique DNA fingerprint or pattern, and determining the order of bases is called sequencing.\n\nWhole genome sequencing is a laboratory procedure that determines the order of bases in the genome of an organism at a single time.\n\nThis includes sequencing all of an organism\u2019s chromosomal DNA as well as DNA contained in the mitochondria and, for plants, in the chloroplast.\n\nWhole genome sequencing should not be confused with DNA profiling, which only establishes the probability that genetic material originated from a specific person or group and does not provide details on genetic relationships, the origin of the genetic material, or a person\u2019s susceptibility to particular diseases.\n\nWhole genome sequencing has primarily been utilized as a tool for research, but it was first made available to clinics in 2014.\n\nWhole genome sequence data may be a crucial tool in the future of personalized medicine to direct therapeutic intervention.\n\nHow does whole genome sequencing work?\n\n\u00a0\n\nScientists conduct whole genome sequencing by following these four main steps:\n\nDNA shearing: Scientists begin by using molecular scissors to cut the DNA, which is composed of millions of bases (A, C, T, and G), into pieces that are small enough for the sequencing machine to read.\nDNA barcoding: Scientists add small pieces of DNA tags, or bar codes, to identify which piece of sheared DNA belongs to which bacteria. This is similar to how a bar code identifies a product at a grocery store.\nDNA sequencing: The bar-coded DNA from multiple bacteria is combined and put in a DNA sequencer. The sequencer identifies the A, C, T, and G, or bases, that make up each bacterial sequence. The sequencer uses the bar code to keep track of which bases belong to which bacteria.\nData analysis: Scientists use computer analysis tools to compare sequences from multiple bacteria and identify differences. The number of differences can tell the scientists how closely related the bacteria are, and how likely it is that they are part of the same outbreak.\nAdvantages of Whole-Genome Sequencing\nHuman whole genome sequencing (WGS) is starting to usher in a new era of personalized medicine to improve public health. By allowing the entire genome of a person to be sequenced, every gene can be turned into digital data for analysis.\nIdentifies probable causal variants for additional follow-up investigations of gene expression and regulation mechanisms by providing a high-resolution.\nProvides a base-by-base scan of the genome by capturing both large and small variants that targeted techniques would overlook.\nDelivers substantial amounts of data quickly to facilitate the assembly of novel genomes\nThe ability to learn about the effectiveness of medications or the negative effects of drug use is another benefit of genome sequencing. Pharmacogenomics is the study of how medications interact with the genome.\nWith advances in\u00a0bioinformatics,\u00a0next-generation sequencing\u00a0findings are starting to guide treatments for common\u00a0genetic conditions\u00a0such as cancers (colorectal cancer and melanoma) and are also being used to determine which medications are safe (and which are not) on a person-by-person\u00a0basis.\nWGS provides 3,000 times more genetic information because it provides data on all six billion base pairs of the human genome.\nWGS also offers a better determination of copy number variations, rearrangements, and other structural variations due to it taking advantage of reads longer than 2\u00d7100 paired. The result of all of this is a much more thorough genotype and phenotype analysis that can offer the significantly more predictive potential for rare diseases and genomic medicine.\nLimitations of genome sequencing\nMutations that lead to diseases may be mistaken for normal genes giving false negative results.\nConversely, a gene could be misread as a mutation that is expected to lead to an adverse condition, whereas in reality, the person is not harboring such a mutation in their genome (a false positive).\nThe majority of the technologies currently in use have limited capabilities for identifying so-called structural variations, even though DNA sequencing technologies are quite accurate in deciphering the sequence.\nDuplications, deletions, and inversions are examples of changes that have an impact on vast DNA sequences at once. Such structural variants can still have a significant impact on health, but due to the current sequencing technologies\u2019 limitations in detecting such structural genomic rearrangements, such biological occurrences may not be interpretable to a client\u2019s advantage.\nGenome sequencing has the potential to lower morbidity and mortality by allowing for the early detection of risk factors for a variety of medical problems and by assisting in the selection of an appropriate treatment plan, but it is not a complete screening for all diseases that might exist.\nCurrently, there is no gold standard against which the performance of population genomic screening can be judged. Whether the application of next-generation sequencing will reduce mortality and morbidity in the population the way it has been demonstrated in individual studies is yet to be established.\nWhile many countries have implemented laws that ban discrimination based on genetic information, often such laws do not protect an individual in the case of a life insurance policy. It is natural for new technology to be accepted slowly, and the accurate interpretation of new laws can take time.\n\nAlso read: Genome India Project (GIP)\n\nPrevious year question\n\nQ1.

This is a DNA fingerprint.\n\nLalji Singh is the father of DNA fingerprinting in India.\n\nHe developed DNA fingerprinting for crime investigations at the Centre for Cellular and Molecular Biology (CCMB) in Hyderabad in 1988.\nIn 1989, DNA fingerprinting was first used in a case by Kerala Police.\nWhat is DNA?\n\nDNA is short for deoxyribonucleic acid, which is inside of every cell in your body. It\u2019s a chain of chemical compounds that join together to form permanent blueprints for life.\n\nThese compounds are called bases, and there are 4 of them- adenine (A), thymine (T), guanine (G), and cytosine (C).\nThey pair up with one another to form what are called base pairs (A-T and C-G). Your DNA has about 3 billion of these couples. The way they\u2019re strung together tells your cells how to make copies of each other.\n\nThe complete set of your compounds is known as a genome.\n\nMore than 99.9 % of everyone\u2019s genome is exactly alike (100% if you are identical twins).\nBut the tiny bit that\u2019s not is what makes you physically and mentally different from someone else.\nMinisatellites\nMinisatellites are short sequences (10-60 base pairs long) of repetitive DNA that show greater variation from one person to the next than other parts of the genome.\nThis variation is exhibited in the number of repeated units or \u2018stutters\u2019 in the minisatellite sequence.\nThe first minisatellite was discovered in 1980.\nDNA Profiling\nModern-day DNA profiling is also called STR analysis and relies on microsatellites rather than the minisatellites used in DNA fingerprinting.\nMicrosatellites, or short tandem repeats (STRs), are the shorter relatives of minisatellites usually two to five base pairs long.\nLike minisatellites, they are repeated many times throughout the human genome, for example, \u2018TATATATATATA\u2019.\nYou get half of your DNA from your mother and a half from your father, hence STRs are passed down from parents to their children.\nHow is DNA fingerprinting done?\nImage credit: Genome Research Limited\n\nDNA fingerprinting uses chemicals to separate strands of DNA and reveal the unique parts of your genome.\n\nThe results show up as a pattern of stripes that can be matched against other samples.\n\nTo get your DNA fingerprint, you would give a sample of cells from your body.\n\nThis can come from a swab inside your mouth, from your skin, the roots of your hair, or your saliva, sweat, or other body fluids.\nBlood is usually the easiest way.\nLab technicians treat the sample with chemicals to separate the DNA, which is then dissolved in water.\nApplications of DNA Fingerprinting\n\nIt is mostly used in court cases and legal matters related to crime or disputes. It can be used to:\n\nPhysically connect a piece of evidence to a person or rule out someone as a suspect.\nShow who your parents, siblings, and other relatives may be.\nIdentify a dead body that\u2019s too decomposed to be recognizable.\nMatch tissues of organ donors with those of people who need transplants.\nIdentify diseases that are passed down through your family.\nHelp find cures for those diseases, called hereditary conditions.\n\nDNA profiles are very useful in forensics because only a tiny sample of human material left behind after a crime may be sufficient to identify someone.\n\nThe UK was the first country to set up a national database of DNA profiles in 1995.\n\nDNA fingerprinting in agriculture\nThe DNA fingerprinting technique is used with traditional genetic analysis of family pedigrees and breeding data to identify DNA markers that are inherited along with important traits. This process is sometimes referred to as marker-assisted selection.\nRecombinant DNA has improved plant growth by increasing nitrogen fixation efficiencies, cloning bacterial genes, and inserting them into plant cells.\nOther plants have been engineered to be resistant to caterpillars, pests, and viruses by inserting resistant genes into plant genomes.\nDNA Fingerprinting in India\n\nThe Centre for DNA Fingerprinting and Diagnostics (CDFD) is an Indian biotechnology research center, located in Hyderabad, India, operated by the Department of Biotechnology, Ministry of Science and Technology, Government of India.\n\nThe Constitution under Article 51A(h) and (j) casts a duty upon the citizens to develop scientific temper, humanism, and the spirit of Inquiry and reform to strive towards excellence in individual and collective activity, and thereby the parliament can legitimately undertake and promote technical and scientific methods to expedite the criminal justice system as provided under the union list.\n\nSection 9 of the Indian Evidence Act, of 1872 act deals with \u2018facts necessary to explain or introduce a fact in issue or relevant fact\u2019.\n\nIn special cases, such as Rape, the CrPC vide Section 53-A has provided that an accused of rape can be examined by a medical practitioner, which may include the collection of bodily substances from the accused for DNA fingerprinting.\n\nRead:\u00a0National Forensic Infrastructure Enhancement Scheme (NFIES)\n\n\u00ad-Article written by Swathi Satish",

Slight global warming would raise the temperature of the hydrate above the equilibrium point, resulting in dissociation and the release of a large amount of methane.\nEconomical Challenges\nHigh shipping cost: Gas hydrates are expensive to ship because 6.5 tonnes of water are shipped along with every tonne of natural gas, even though the water has no economic value.\nCommercial viability: Only when the cost of conventional hydrocarbon and other fuels increases significantly will the extraction of methane hydrates be economically feasible.\nEconomic competitiveness: The ability of gas hydrates to compete economically with conventional resources could be a problem.\nNeed for huge capital investment: Massive investments are required in technology, transportation, and gas hydrate research to produce gas hydrates.\nTechnological Challenges\nNon-compatibility of existing technologies: The formation itself and its surroundings would be affected if natural gas were to be extracted from hydrate formations using currently used methods.\nIdentification and quantification of reserves: Seismic techniques, the primary tool used by the oil industry, are difficult to use in the detection of natural gas hydrates.\nDrilling and completion (stimulation) technology development: Because of the hydrates\u2019 characteristics, particularly their tendency to be brittle, drilling for methane recovery from them is a difficult task. Drilling could cause hydrates to separate, which could lead to an uncontrolled gas release and cause the site to sink.\nMeasures were taken by the Government\nNational Gas Hydrate Programme (NGHP): Given India\u2019s phenomenally increasing energy demand, the National Gas Hydrate Programme (NGHP) is significant on a national level.\nA steering committee and a technical committee of NGHP were established to implement the program when it was first launched in 1997. Based on the Technical Committee\u2019s review of seismic data, two areas in Indian waters, one along the East Coast and the other along the West Coast, have been designated as \u201cModel Laboratory Areas\u201d for additional R&D work.\nDedicated gas hydrate research centre at Panvel: On July 6, 2016, ONGC established the Gas Hydrate Research & Technology Centre (GHRTC) at the ONGC Complex in Panvel.\nAgreement with the USA, Canada, and Japan: India had agreed to work with the United States, Canada, and Japan to investigate gas hydrates.\nInitiatives of GAIL and IIT Madras: IIT Madras, in collaboration with GAIL, is working to recover methane from methane hydrate in the Krishna-Godavari basin while also sequestering CO2.\nWay forward\nResearch and Modeling: Before drilling, India must come up with creative ways to identify where and how much methane hydrate is subsurface. The government is also carrying out research to comprehend the physical characteristics of strata that contain gas hydrates and to model this understanding at the reservoir scale to forecast future behaviour and production.\nSustainable production and use: Gas hydrates must be produced and used in a sustainable manner while protecting the marine environment.\nInternational Collaboration: Due to the fact that gas hydrates present both research challenges and resource potential that are significant on a global scale, international collaboration is still an essential component of the program.\nStudy of Production Feasibility: Large amounts of methane hydrates can be found offshore and beneath the permafrost. It is necessary to conduct a study to evaluate the potential effects on the environment of producing natural gas from hydrates.\nGreater need for academic institution efforts to explore gas hydrates: In order to step up efforts in the exploration of gas hydrate horizons, there should be greater involvement of academic researchers.\n\nIn the far future, natural gas hydrates present a reliable energy source. The difficulties in producing these resources have been acknowledged.\n\nHowever, given that the population is expanding and conventional energy sources are depleting, there will also be a need for these energy sources.\n\nEnergy politics and policies will undoubtedly change as a result of the production of these resources, possibly even turning nations that currently import gas into exporters.\n\nArticle Written by: Remya",

The technology possibly enables private messaging for those participating and makes it more difficult for service providers to provide useful information from their services to authorities.\n\nHow does end-to-end encryption work?\n\nThe endpoints hold the cryptographic keys that are used to encrypt and decrypt the messages. In this method, public key encryption is used.\n\nA private key and a shared public key are used in public key encryption, also known as asymmetric encryption.\nWhen the public key is made available, anyone can use it to encrypt a message and send it to the public key\u2019s owner.\nOnly the associated private key, also known as the decryption key, can be used to decrypt the communication.\n\nOnline conversations nearly always include a third party passing messages back and forth between the persons participating in an exchange.\n\nThis middleman is typically a server owned by an ISP, a telecommunications provider, or several other businesses.\nThe public key infrastructure that E2EE utilizes prevents middlemen from intercepting messages in transit.\n\nIncorporating a public key into a certificate that has been digitally signed by a reputable certificate authority is the best way to ensure a public key is a genuine key generated by the intended receiver (CA).\n\nA certificate signed with the CA\u2019s public key can be trusted because it is extensively used and understood, and because of this, its authenticity can be assumed.\nThe CA would probably refuse to certify a certificate that linked a different public key to the same name because the certificate links the recipient\u2019s name and public key.\nHow is E2EE used?\nWhen data security is required, such as in the financial, medical, and communications sectors, end-to-end encryption is used.\nIt is frequently employed to assist businesses in adhering to data privacy and security rules and legislation.\nTo protect sensitive data, such as consumer credit card information, a vendor of electronic point-of-sale (POS) systems might offer E2EE.\nThe Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard (PCI DSS), which prohibits the storage of card numbers, magnetic stripe information, and security codes on client devices, can be complied with by retailers by using E2EE.\nE2EE defends against these two dangers\nPrying eyes: Only the sender and intended recipient know the keys to decrypt the message, so E2EE prevents anybody else from accessing the communication\u2019s contents in transit. The message won\u2019t be readable, even though a server acting as an intermediary server and facilitating its transmission may be able to see it.\nTampering: E2EE additionally guards against the alteration of encrypted messages. Any attempts to change a message encrypted in this fashion would be obvious because there is no way to predictably change it.\nE2EE does not defend against\n\nEven though the E2EE key exchange is thought to be impenetrable with current processing power and known methods, there have been numerous documented possible vulnerabilities of the encryption technique, including the following three:\n\nMetadata: While E2EE protects the information inside a message, it does not conceal information about the message, such as the date and time it was sent or the participants in the exchange. This metadata could give malicious actors with an interest in the encrypted information clues as to where they may be able to intercept the information once it has been unencrypted.\nCompromised endpoints: If either endpoint has been compromised, an attacker may be able to see a message before it is encrypted or after it is decrypted. Attackers could also retrieve keys from compromised endpoints and execute a\u00a0man-in-the-middle attack\u00a0with a stolen public key.\nVulnerable intermediaries: Sometimes, providers claim to offer end-to-end encryption when what they offer is closer to encryption in transit. The data may be stored on an intermediary server where it can be accessed.\nAdvantages of end-to-end encryption\n\nThe main advantage of end-to-end encryption is a high level of data privacy due to the following features:\n\nSecurity in transit: End-to-end encryption uses public key cryptography, which stores private keys on endpoint devices. Messages can only be decrypted using these keys, so only people with access to the endpoint devices can read the message.\nTamper-proof: With E2EE, the decryption key does not have to be transmitted; the recipient will already have it. If a message encrypted with a public key gets altered or tampered with in transit, the recipient will not be able to decrypt it, so the tampered contents will not be viewable.\nCompliance: Many industries are bound by regulatory compliance laws that require encryption-level data security. End-to-end encryption can help organizations protect that data by making it unreadable.\n\nAlso read: Virtual Private Network\n\nDisadvantages of end-to-end encryption\n\nAlthough E2EE generally does a good job of securing digital communications, it does not guarantee data security.\n\nComplexity: Some E2EE implementations allow the encrypted data to be decrypted and re-encrypted at certain points during transmission. This makes it important to clearly define and distinguish the endpoints of the communication circuit.\nExcessive privacy: Government and law enforcement agencies expressed concern that end-to-end encryption can protect people sharing illicit content because service providers are unable to provide law enforcement with access to the content.\nVisible metadata: Although messages in transit are encrypted and impossible to read, information about the message \u2014 date sent and recipient, for instance \u2014 is still visible, which may provide useful information to an interloper.\nEndpoint security: If endpoints are compromised, encrypted data may be revealed.\nNot future-proof: Although end-to-end encryption is a strong technology now, there is speculation that eventually quantum computing will render cryptography obsolete.\nEncryption in India\n\nThere is no explicit encryption law in India. However, a number of industry regulations, including those controlling the banking, finance, and telecommunications sectors, include demands for the use of minimal encryption standards to secure transactions.\n\nAccording to the licensing agreement between the ISP and the DoT, users are not permitted to use encryption standards larger than 40 bits utilizing symmetric key algorithms or comparable methods without prior clearance and deposition of decryption keys.\n\nNews about end-to-end encryption\nApple has announced it will be increasing the number of data points protected by End-to-End Encryption (E2EE) on iCloud from 14 to 23 categories.\nIn 2019, Facebook announced that all three messaging services would begin using E2EE. However, law enforcement and intelligence agencies argue that encryption limits Facebook\u2019s ability to police illegal activity on its platforms. The debate often focuses on how E2EE can make it more difficult to identify and disrupt child abuse on private messaging platforms.\n\n-Article written by Swathi Satish",

Read further to know more.\n\nFrom high-end automobiles to washing machines, every device possible on the market is powered by semiconductor chips or computers.\n\nHowever, there has been a sudden and escalating shortage of semiconductors globally, and because of the quick proliferation of COVID-19 globally, experts have issued a warning about the ongoing shortage of semiconductor chips.\n\nTable of Contents\n\nWhat are Semiconductors?\nSemiconductor chips are widely used for?\nLeading Producers of Semiconductor Chips\nReasons behind the current global shortage\nImpact of Semiconductor Shortage:\nInitiatives to resolve semiconductor shortage:\nGlobal Initiatives\nIndian Initiatives\nWay Forward\nWhat are Semiconductors?\nSemiconductors are substances that exhibit conductivity intermediate between that of conductors (often metals) and that of non-conductors or insulators (such as most ceramics).\nIn addition to pure components like silicon or germanium, semiconductors can also be mixtures like gallium arsenide or cadmium selenide. Conductivity is the measure of the ease at which an electric charge or heat can pass through a material.\nIt is an electrical circuit made up of several transistors and wire that has been fabricated on a semiconductor wafer.\nComputers, smartphones, appliances, gaming hardware, and medical equipment all contain integrated circuits (ICs), which are electronic devices made up of many of these parts. These devices find widespread use in almost all industries, especially in the automobile industry.\nChips, or integrated circuits as they are more widely known, are maybe the smallest but most demanding product ever produced on a global scale.\nCompared to 20 years ago, electronic parts and components now make up approximately 40% of the price of a new internal combustion engine vehicle. Semiconductor Chips account for the bulk of this increase.\nSemiconductor chips are widely used for?\nThey are used to power a variety of gadgets, including game consoles, laptops, smartphones, and household appliances.\nDespite their small size, they carry out a variety of tasks including data transport and power screens.\nThe fundamental components that act as the brain and heart of all contemporary electronics and information and communications technology goods are semiconductor chips.\nThe shortage of these chips affects sales of products like vehicles, refrigerators, computers, TVs, and other electronic devices because they are now a necessary component of modern autos, household appliances, and vital medical equipment.\nLeading Producers of Semiconductor Chips\nTaiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company (TSMC) in Taiwan and Samsung Electronics in South Korea are the industry leaders in semiconductor production.\nAmerican semiconductor manufacturer Intel recently announced plans to erect two new chip facilities in Chandler, Arizona.\nDeveloping semiconductor chips requires accuracy. It takes longer than three months to produce and uses massive factories, dust-free spaces, expensive machinery, molten tin, and lasers.\nReasons behind the current global shortage\nAs a result of the pandemic, the car industry nearly went out of business in 2020. The demand for the medium-level chips used in the manufacturing of cars, as opposed to the tiny chips used in smartphones or laptops, increased as a result of inaccurate forecasts made by the automakers that underestimated the recovery in car sales late in 2020.\nCovid-19 Pandemic \u2013\u00a0The effect of the pandemic was two-fold:\nManufacturing came to a\u00a0standstill\u00a0during the pandemic, which impacted the supply chains of products that needed one or more of these chips.\nLockdowns\u00a0increased the growth in sales of laptops,\u00a0tablets, and mobile phones to the highest in a decade, as everything from school to the office became online.\nDisasters:\u00a0Production plants in the US were affected by the cold and in japan by wildfire.\nChina-US Trade War: Chinese smartphone manufacturers started hoarding semiconductor chips and increasing their inventories to prepare for US penalties that would cut them off from their main suppliers.\nAn expensive and long process of manufacturing\u2013 Fabricating advanced logic chips requires extraordinary precision, along with huge long-term bets in a field subject to rapid change.\nImpact of Semiconductor Shortage:\nDue to the worldwide supply chain disruption, prices of commonplace electronics and appliances, such as TVs and smartphones, have skyrocketed, which has a direct impact on consumers.\nThe supply chain will be significantly disrupted by the lack of semiconductors, and the production of many different types of electronic equipment would be limited.\nNumerous businesses have been impacted as a result of the ongoing global shortage of semiconductor chips.\nThe loss of 7.7 million vehicles from production is anticipated to cost carmakers USD 210 billion in sales this year.\nInitiatives to resolve semiconductor shortage:\n\nThere are multiple initiatives are present at the global and national levels. Which are mentioned below.\n\nGlobal Initiatives\nBy introducing packages to encourage increased chip manufacture, various nations are attempting to protect their interests.\nIn Arizona, TSMC, which has a 24% stake in the semiconductor industry\u2019s supply chain, is building a $12 billion complex.\nGermany and Japan have persuaded TSMC to open fabs for specialized technology in their nations.\nIndian Initiatives\nThe Design Linked Incentive (DLI) Scheme has been introduced to support at least 20 domestic semiconductor design companies and help them reach a revenue of more than Rs. 1500 crores during the next five years (2022-27).\nThe goal of the Chips to Startup (C2S) Program is to teach 85,000 highly competent engineers in the fields of Very-large-scale integration (VLSI) and Embedded System Design.\nA $10 billion package of incentives to promote semiconductor production in India has been authorized.\nThe Production-Linked Incentive (PLI) program was established for the manufacturing of semiconductors and display boards.\nWay Forward\nDevelop raw material supply capabilities: In addition to enhancing chances for the semiconductor equipment, replacement parts, and service industries, this will benefit the Indian gas, materials, and mining industries.\nFab manufacturing\u00a0(semiconductor fabrication plant is commonly called \u201cfab\u201d)- Locking down the market for domestically produced semiconductors is crucial for developing the ecosystem needed for fab manufacturing.\nFab clustering-To ensure that semiconductor supply chains and related businesses are in one place to create linkages.\nEncourage manufacturers and start-ups in India to engage in and master complicated R&D.\n\nClick here to read more such articles\n\nArticle Written by Remya",

But unlike Chandrayaan-2, this orbiter won\u2019t be equipped with a research payload.\n\nIts only duties will be to launch the lander to the moon, monitor the landing from orbit, and maintain communication with the earth station.\n\nThis spacecraft was designed by ISRO to showcase India\u2019s expertise in soft landings on stellar bodies.\n\nAccording to ISRO, the Chandrayaan-3 mission will cost more than Rs 600 crores in total. In contrast, the Chandrayaan-2 mission cost a total of Rs 960 crores.\n\nThis expansive purpose includes integration, cognition, and a number of permutations. In addition, the spacecraft still needs to undergo a number of other thorough tests.\n\nFeatures of Chandrayaan 3 Spacecraft\nA rover and lander will be aboard Chandrayaan 3 as it launches into space. There won\u2019t be any orbiters like Chandrayaan 2 in it.\nIndia wants to look at the Moon\u2019s surface, particularly in regions that haven\u2019t seen sunlight in a few billion years. These darker regions of the lunar surface may contain ice and rich mineral deposits, according to scientists and astronomers.\nAdditionally, this exploration will try to examine the exosphere and subsurface as well as the surface.\nThis spacecraft\u2019s rover will interact with Earth through an orbiter salvaged from Chandrayaan 2.\nAt a distance of 100 km from the lunar orbit, it will take pictures of the surface in order to analyse it.\nThe lander of ISRO\u2019s Chandrayaan 3\u00a0will be powered by 4 throttle-able engines. In addition, it will be endowed with a Laser Doppler Velocimeter (LDV).\nWhat was the Chandrayaan-2 Mission?\nAn orbiter, a lander, and a rover were made up of Chandrayaan-2, and were all outfitted with tools for studying the moon.\nWhile the Lander and Rover modules were to be separated to make a soft landing on the moon\u2019s surface, the Orbiter would observe the moon from a 100-km orbit.\nThe Lander and Rover modules were given the names Vikram and Pragyaan, respectively, by ISRO in honour of Vikram Sarabhai, the father of India\u2019s space programme.\nIt was launched on the GSLV-Mk3, the nation\u2019s most potent geosynchronous launch vehicle.\nHowever, lander Vikram crashed-landed rather than making a controlled landing, which prevented rover Pragyaan from successfully exploring the moon\u2019s surface.\nThe Orbiter, Lander, and Rover components of the Mission were assembled with the intention of investigating the Moon\u2019s south pole.\nIt sought to explore the Moon\u2019s exosphere, surface, and subsurface as a whole in a single mission, rather than just one particular location.\nWhat happened to Chandrayaan-2?\nThe Chandrayaan-2 mission, which was aborted in 2019 after making a rough landing on the Moon\u2019s dark side, is still operational thanks to its orbiter that is still in place.\nIn the last seconds, the lander and rover developed a problem, crashed, and were completely destroyed.\nChandrayaan 2\u2019s main goal was to show off its capacity to soft-land on the moon\u2019s surface and control a robotic rover there.\nBut in the past two years, the Chandrayaan-2 mission\u2019s Orbiter and other instruments have gathered a wealth of new data that has expanded our understanding of the Moon and its surroundings.\n\nRead about\u00a0Chandrayaan 2 Mission\u00a0in the linked article.\n\nWhat is the information gathered?\nMolecules of water are present on the moon:\n\nThe mission has provided the most accurate data to date on the existence of H2O molecules on the Moon.\n\nPresence of Minor elements:\n\nThrough remote sensing, the elements chromium, manganese, and sodium have all been discovered for the first time. The discovery may open up new avenues for research into planetary differentiation, nebular conditions, and lunar magmatic evolution.\n\nInformation about solar flares:\n\nThe first widespread observation of microflares outside the active area, according to ISRO, \u201chas enormous consequences on the understanding of the mechanism driving heating of the solar corona,\u201d a long-standing unanswered question.\n\nExploration of the areas that are always in shadow, as well as the craters and boulders that are hidden beneath the regolith, the loose deposit that makes up the top surface and extends down to a depth of 3 to 4 metres. This should enable scientists to pinpoint potential locations for future drilling and landing operations, including those involving people.\n\nWhy are we interested in studying the moon?\nThe Moon is the closest cosmic body at which space discovery can be attempted and documented.\nIt is also a promising test bed to demonstrate technologies required for deep-space missions.\nThe Moon provides the best linkage to Earth\u2019s early history.\nIt offers an undisturbed historical record of the inner Solar system environment.\nWhy was\u00a0the Lunar South Pole\u00a0targeted for exploration?\nThe shadow-covered portion of the lunar surface at the South Pole is significantly bigger than at the North Pole, which makes it particularly interesting.\nThere might be a chance that regions nearby that are always in darkness contain water.\nA fossil record of the early Solar System can also be found in cold trap craters near the South Pole.\nThe craters found at the southern pole are likewise of great interest to scientists. They think the mysterious fossil records of the early planetary system may be present in these cold traps.\nWhat is GSLV-Mk 3?\nGeosynchronous Satellite Launch Vehicle Mark-III was developed by the Indian Space Research Organisation (ISRO), is a three-stage vehicle, designed to launch communication satellites into geostationary orbit.\nIt has a mass of 640 tonnes that can accommodate up to 8,000 kg payload to Low Earth Orbit (LEO) and 4000 kg payload to GTO (Geo-Synchronous Transfer Orbit).\nImportance of Exploring the Moon for Scientists\nThe Moon is the celestial body closest to Earth that can be used to test advanced space technology for lengthy space voyages.\nIt also serves as a promising cosmic body for the exploration and comprehension of extraterrestrial regions.\nAs a result, future scientists are motivated to pursue scientific research, and international cooperation is encouraged.\nAdditionally, it establishes a link between the early earth and the history of the solar system..\n\nThe COVID-19 pandemic and several phases of lockdown hindered multiple scientific projects of the Indian Space Research Organisation (ISRO). Along with\u00a0Chandrayaan 3,\u00a0the\u00a0Gaganyaan, India\u2019s 1st\u00a0manned space mission has been delayed.

It consists of a single chain of DNA that has been coiled and supercoiled to form thick thread-like sections. Read here to understand more about chromosomes and chromosomal disorders in humans.\n\nChromosomes are thread-like structures located inside the nucleus of animal and plant cells.\n\nEach chromosome is made of protein and a single molecule of deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA). Passed from parents to offspring, DNA contains the specific instructions that make each type of living creature unique.\n\nThe term chromosome comes from the Greek words for colour (chroma) and body (soma). Scientists gave this name to them because they are cell structures, or bodies, that are strongly stained by some colourful dyes used in research.\n\nTheir unique structure keeps DNA tightly wound around spool-like proteins, called histones.\n\nWithout such packaging, DNA molecules would be too long to fit inside cells!\n\nFor example, if all of the DNA molecules in a single human cell were unwound from their histones and placed end-to-end, they would stretch 6 feet.\n\n\ud83d\udc49 Which year are YOU targeting for success in the IAS/IPS/IFS Exam? \ud83d\ude80\n\n(1) \u21d2 UPSC 2025: Prelims cum Mains\n\n(2) \u21d2 UPSC 2026: Prelims cum Mains\n\n(3) \u21d2 UPSC 2027 Prelims cum Mains\n\nTip: Know more about ClearIAS Courses (Online/Offline)\n\nThe nuclei of eukaryotic cells contain proteins called histones, which are very basic and rich in lysine and arginine residues. They serve as spools around which DNA is wound to form what is known as nucleosomes.\nThe fundamental structural component of DNA packing in eukaryotes is a nucleosome. A nucleosome\u2019s structure, which resembles a thread looped around a spool, is made up of a piece of DNA wound around eight histone proteins. The core component of chromatin is the nucleosome.\n\nTable of Contents\n\nWhat is a chromosome?\nWhat do chromosomes do?\nHow are chromosomes inherited?\nChromosomal disorders in humans\nNumerical abnormalities:\nStructural abnormalities:\nWhat is a chromosome?\n\nChromosomes are threadlike structures made of protein and a single molecule of DNA that serve to carry the genomic information from cell to cell.\n\nIn plants and animals (including humans), these reside in the nucleus of cells.\n\nHumans have 22 pairs of numbered chromosomes (autosomes) and one pair of sex chromosomes (XX or XY), for a total of 46.\n\nEach pair contains two chromosomes, one coming from each parent, which means that children inherit half of their chromosomes from their mother and a half from their father.\n\nThey can be seen through a microscope when the nucleus dissolves during cell division.\n\nThey vary in number and shape among living organisms.\n\nMost bacteria have one or two circular chromosomes.\nHumans, along with other animals and plants, have linear chromosomes.\n\nEach species of plant and animal has a set number of chromosomes.\n\nA fruit fly has four pairs of chromosomes, while a rice plant has 12, and a dog has 39.\n\nIn humans, the twenty-third pair is the sex chromosomes, while the first 22 pairs are called autosomes.\n\nBiologically female individuals have two X chromosomes (XX) while those who are biologically male have one X and one Y chromosome (XY). However, there are exceptions to these rules.\n\nThese are also different in size.\n\nThe human X chromosome is about three times larger than the human Y chromosome, containing about 900 genes, while the Y chromosome has about 55 genes.\n\nThe only human cells that do not contain pairs of chromosomes are reproductive cells, or gametes, which carry just one copy of each chromosome.\n\nWhen two reproductive cells unite, they become a single cell that contains two copies of each chromosome.\nThis cell then divides and its successors divide numerous times, eventually producing a mature individual with a full set of paired chromosomes in virtually all of its cells.\n\nBesides the linear chromosomes found in the nucleus, the cells of humans and other complex organisms carry a much smaller type of chromosome similar to those seen in bacteria.\n\nThis circular chromosome is found in mitochondria, which are structures located outside the nucleus that serves as the cell\u2019s powerhouses.\nScientists think that, in the past, mitochondria were free-living bacteria with the ability to convert oxygen into energy.\nWhen these bacteria invaded cells lacking the power to tap into oxygen\u2019s power, the cells retained them, and, over time, the bacteria evolved into modern-day mitochondria.\nWhat do chromosomes do?\n\nCells must continuously divide to make new cells and replace damaged or old ones for an organism to grow and function normally.\n\nDNA must be intact and distributed equally among cells during cell division.\n\nIn the vast majority of cell divisions, DNA is accurately copied and distributed thanks in large part to chromosomes. Nevertheless, mistakes do happen from time to time.\n\nSerious issues could arise if the number or structure of chromosomes in new cells changes. One type of leukemia and a few other cancers, for instance, are brought on by faulty ones, which are made up of linked fragments of damaged chromosomes in humans.\n\nFurthermore, it is essential that reproductive cells, such as eggs and sperm, have the appropriate amount of chromosomes and the right kind of structure. If not, it\u2019s possible that the offspring won\u2019t grow up properly.\n\nHow are chromosomes inherited?\n\nOne copy of each chromosome is inherited from the female parent and the other from the male parent in humans and the majority of other sophisticated creatures. This explains why some traits are passed down through the mother and others through the father.\n\nThe tiny circular chromosome found in mitochondria has a distinct inheritance pattern.\n\nDuring fertilization, only egg cells retain their mitochondria; sperm cells do not.\nAs a result, the female parent is always the source of mitochondrial DNA.\nDNA discovered in the mitochondria has been linked to a few human diseases, such as diabetes and several types of hearing loss.\nChromosomal disorders in humans\n\nChromosomal disorders result from structural changes or numerical changes. Chromosomal aberrations are disruptions in the normal chromosomal content of a cell and are a major cause of genetic conditions or disorders in humans.\n\nAbnormalities of development occur because of the unusual genetic signals transmitted by the chromosomes. One of these imbalances occurs in 0.5 percent of all births.\n\nAn abnormality may be numerical or structural and examples are described below:\n\nNumerical abnormalities:\n\nNormally humans have 23 pairs, giving a total of 46 chromosomes in each cell, called diploid cells. A normal sperm or egg cell contains only one-half of these pairs and therefore 23 chromosomes. These cells are called haploid.\n\nThe euploid state describes when the number of chromosomes in each cell is some multiple of n, which may be 2n (46, diploid), 3n (69, triploid) 4n (92, tetraploid), and so on.\nWhen they are present in multiples beyond 4n, the term polyploid is used.\n\nAneuploidy refers to the presence of an extra or a missing chromosome and is the most common form of abnormality.\n\nTrisomy:\u00a0The cell has one extra chromosome (2n+1)\nMonosomy:\u00a0The cell has one chromosome less (2n-1)\nIn the case of Down\u2019s syndrome or Trisomy 21, there is an additional copy of chromosome 21, and a total of 47.\nTurner\u2019s syndrome on the other hand arises from the absence of an X chromosome, meaning only 45 are present.\nStructural abnormalities:\n\nStructural abnormalities occur when the chromosomal morphology is altered due to an unusual location of the centromere and therefore abnormal lengths of the chromosomal short (p) and long arm (q).\n\nDeletion:\u00a0A portion of the chromosome is lost during cell division. The resulting chromosome lacks certain genes, that get inherited by offspring. This condition is usually lethal due to missing genes.\n\nDuplication:\u00a0The presence of part of a chromosome in excess is known as duplication. If the duplication is present only in one of the homologous pairs, the duplicated part makes a loop to maximize the juxtaposition of homologous regions during pairing.\n\nInversion: Inversion results from the breakage and reunion of a part of the chromosome rotating by 180\u00b0 on its axis. So there occurs a rearrangement of genes. Its effects are not as severe as in other structural defects.\n\nTranslocation:\u00a0The shifting or transfer of a set of genes or part of a chromosome to a non-homologous one is known as translocation. There is no addition or loss of genes, only the rearrangement occurs.\n\n-Article written by Swathi Satish",

A genetic disorder may be caused by a mutation in a single gene or multiple genes. It can also be due to changes in the number or structure of chromosomes.\n\nFirst, we need to know about the genes before discussing genetic disorders.\n\nSo, genes are the unit of heredity. It contains genetic information in the DNA. It helps us carry out life processes by translating them into useful protein genes which are the basic unit of heredity. DNA or many times RNA is the genetic material in almost all living organisms. RNA is more unstable than DNA which is why DNA is the genetic component in all organisms except some.\n\nSometimes, under some faulty conditions, the genes undergo mutation causing falter the genetic code. Faulty genes produce faulty proteins that do not work properly.

The most common genetic disorders are mendelian disorders and chromosomal disorders. Let\u2019s know about them.\n\n1. Mendelian Disorder\nMendelian disorders are either autosomal dominant, autosomal recessive, sex-linked dominant, sex-linked recessive, or mitochondrial and occur due to mutations in a single gene.\nThese disorders can be detected by pedigree analysis.\nThe genetic locus at which the mutation occurs may be a sex chromosome or an autosome and may be in a recessive or dominant mode.\nAn autosomal recessive disease is articulated when the mutant gene is present in the homozygous state.

This method\u00a0 allows users to access the software through a web browser from multiple locations\n\nExamples for SaaS\n\nSaaS products may be primarily marketed to B2B, B2C markets, or both. Examples of popular SaaS products include:\n\nSalesforce\nGoogle Workspace apps\nMicrosoft 365\nHubSpot\nTrello\nNetflix\nZoom\nZendesk\nDocuSign\nSaaS architecture\n\nSaaS applications and services use a multi-tenant model. All customers, use the same version and configuration of the program.\n\nThe data from various clients will be separated even though they will run on the same cloud instance with a common platform and architecture.\n\nThe standard multi-tenant architecture of SaaS applications allows the cloud service provider to manage upgrades, bug fixes, and maintenance more quickly, simply, and effectively. By keeping the single, engineers also can make necessary changes for all customers by maintaining the one, shared instance.\n\nAdvantages\nNo need for organizations: SaaS eliminates the need for organizations to install and run apps on their computers or in their own data centres\nCost-effective: This removes the cost of purchasing, procuring, and maintaining hardware as well as purchasing, installing, and supporting software.\nFlexible payments: Customers can buy software in a subscription manner, there is no need to pay the entire cost upfront.\nScalable usage: High scalability is a property of cloud services like SaaS that allows users to access more or fewer features or services as needed.\nAutomatic updates: Customers can rely on a SaaS provider to automatically carry out updates rather than buying new software.\nAccessibility and persistence: Users can access SaaS apps from any internet-enabled device and location because SaaS companies deliver their products via the internet.\nCustomizable: SaaS applications are customizable and can be integrated with other business applications\n\u00a0Challenges and Risks\n\nSaaS also poses certain potential risks, because companies completely rely on outside software providers to deliver the software, maintain it, and manage it.

It is one of the most rapidly spreading viral tropical diseases. Dengue is found in tropical and sub-tropical climates worldwide, mostly in urban and semi-urban areas. Read here to know the causes, symptoms, and preventive measures for dengue.\n\nDengue is a mosquito-borne viral disease that has rapidly spread to all tropical regions.\n\nDengue virus is transmitted by female mosquitoes mainly of the species\u00a0Aedes aegypti\u00a0and, to a lesser extent,\u00a0Ae. albopictus.\n\nDengue is widespread throughout the tropics, with local variations in risk influenced by\u00a0climate parameters as well as social and environmental factors.\n\nA recent study published in 2022 projected how\u00a0the distribution of these mosquitoes will evolve with climate change.\n\nCurrently,\u00a0Aedes Aegyptus is prevalent in the southern peninsula, eastern coastline, north-eastern states, and the northern plains.\nAedes albopictus dominates the eastern and western coastlines, north-eastern states, and the lower Himalayas.\nThe study projected the expansion of Aedes aegypti in the hot arid regions of the Thar Desert and Aedes albopictus in the cold upper Himalayas as a result of future climatic changes.\n\nTable of Contents\n\nHistorical reference of dengue\nCauses and symptoms of Dengue\nTransmission of the virus\nTransmission through the mosquito bite\nHuman-to-mosquito transmission\nMaternal transmission\nTreatment and Vaccination\nGlobal burden of dengue\nPrevention and Control of Dengue\nHistorical reference of dengue\n\nIn a Chinese medical encyclopedia from the Jin Dynasty published in 992, dengue disease was initially described as \u201cwater poison\u201d related to flying insects (265-420 AD).\n\n\ud83d\udc49 Which year are YOU targeting for success in the IAS/IPS/IFS Exam? \ud83d\ude80\n\n(1) \u21d2 UPSC 2025: Prelims cum Mains\n\n(2) \u21d2 UPSC 2026: Prelims cum Mains\n\n(3) \u21d2 UPSC 2027 Prelims cum Mains\n\nTip: Know more about ClearIAS Courses (Online/Offline)\n\nThe Swahili word Ka-dinga pepo, which translates to \u201ccramp-like seizure,\u201d is where the English word \u201cdengue\u201d originates.\n\nIn the 1780s, the first dengue outbreaks to be clinically identified occurred practically concurrently in Asia, Africa, and North America.\n\nBecause of the symptoms of myalgia and arthralgia, Benjamin Rush, who popularised the term \u201cbreak-bone fever,\u201d wrote the first clinical case report of the 1780 pandemic in Philadelphia in 1789.\n\nThe term dengue fever came into general use only after 1828.\n\nCauses and symptoms of Dengue\n\nDengue virus belongs to the family Flaviviridae, having four serotypes that are spread by the bite of infected Aedes mosquitoes.\n\nThere are four dengue virus serotypes and it is possible to be infected four times.\nThese mosquitoes are also vectors of chikungunya, yellow fever, and Zika viruses.\nThe ideal conditions for this species of mosquitos are usually between the latitudes of 35\u00b0 North and 35\u00b0 South with an elevation of 1000 meters (3300 ft).\nThey usually bite during the early morning and in the evening, though it does not mean that they will specifically bite at these hours.\nA single bite is more than enough to be a cause for infection.\nA female mosquito that bites an infected person with dengue becomes infected during the initial 2-10-day febrile period.\nAfter 8-10 days, the virus spreads to other tissues including the mosquito\u2019s salivary glands and is subsequently released into its saliva.\n\nIt causes a wide spectrum of illnesses from mild asymptomatic illness to severe fatal dengue hemorrhagic fever/dengue shock syndrome.\n\nSevere dengue is a leading cause of serious illness and death in some Asian and Latin American countries. Severe dengue was first recognized in the 1950s during dengue epidemics in the Philippines and Thailand.\n\nThere is no specific treatment for dengue/severe dengue. Early detection of disease progression associated with severe dengue, and access to proper medical care lowers fatality rates of severe dengue to below 1%.\n\nDengue should be suspected when a high fever (40\u00b0C/104\u00b0F) is accompanied by two of the following symptoms during the febrile phase (2-7 days):\n\nsevere headache\npain behind the eyes\nmuscle and joint pains\nnausea\nvomiting\nswollen glands\nrash\nTransmission of the virus\n\nThere are several routes of transmission of the dengue virus-\n\nTransmission through the mosquito bite\n\nThe virus is transmitted to humans through the bites of infected female mosquitoes, primarily the\u00a0Aedes aegypti\u00a0mosquito.\n\nAfter feeding on a Virus-infected person, the virus replicates in the mosquito midgut, before it disseminates to secondary tissues, including the salivary glands.\nThe time it takes from ingesting the virus to actual transmission to a new host is termed the extrinsic incubation period (EIP).\nThe EIP takes about 8-12 days when the ambient temperature is between 25-28\u00b0C.\nHuman-to-mosquito transmission\nMosquitoes can become infected by people who are viraemic with the virus.\nThis can be someone who has a symptomatic dengue infection, someone who is yet to have a symptomatic infection (they are pre-symptomatic), but also people who show no signs of illness as well (they are asymptomatic).\nHuman-to-mosquito transmission can occur up to 2 days before someone shows symptoms of the illness, up to 2 days after the fever has resolved.\nMaternal transmission\nThe primary mode of transmission of Viruses between humans involves mosquito vectors.\nThere is evidence, however, of the possibility of maternal transmission (from a pregnant mother to her baby).\nWhile vertical transmission rates appear low, the risk of vertical transmission is seemingly linked to the timing of the dengue infection during pregnancy.\nWhen a mother does have a DENV infection when she is pregnant, babies may suffer from pre-term birth, low birth weight, and fetal distress.\nTreatment and Vaccination\n\nThere is no specific treatment for viral fever. Patients should rest, stay hydrated and seek medical advice.\n\nSupportive care such as fever reducers and painkillers can be taken to control the symptoms of muscle aches and pains, and fever.\n\nThe first dengue vaccine, Dengvaxia\u00ae (CYD-TDV) developed by Sanofi Pasteur was licensed in December 2015 and has now been approved by regulatory authorities in ~20 countries.\n\nGlobal burden of dengue\n\nThe incidence of dengue has grown dramatically around the world in recent decades. A vast majority of cases are asymptomatic or mild and self-managed, and hence the actual numbers of dengue cases are under-reported. Many cases are also misdiagnosed as other febrile illnesses.\n\nThe total number of cases seemingly decreased during the years 2020 and 2021, as well as for reported deaths. However, the data is not yet complete and the COVID-19 pandemic might have also hampered case reporting in several countries.\n\nBefore 1970, only 9 countries had experienced severe dengue epidemics.\n\nThe disease is now endemic in more than 100 countries in the regions of Africa, the Americas, the Eastern Mediterranean, South-East Asia, and the Western Pacific.\nThe Americas, South-East Asia, and Western Pacific regions are the most seriously affected, with Asia representing ~70% of the global burden of disease.\nLocal transmission was reported for the first time in France and Croatia in 2010 and imported cases were detected in three other European countries.\nPrevention and Control of Dengue\n\nThe proximity of mosquito vector breeding sites to human habitation is a significant risk factor for dengue.\n\nAt present, the main method to control or prevent the transmission of the dengue virus is to combat the mosquito vectors. This is achieved through:\n\nPrevention of mosquito breeding.\nPersonal protection from mosquito bites.\nEducating the community on the risks of mosquito-borne diseases.\nActive mosquito and virus surveillance.\nVector surveillance can be combined with clinical and environmental surveillance\n\nThe integration of vector management approaches is encouraged by the WHO to achieve sustainable, effective locally adapted vector control interventions.\n\nThe government of India has a National Centre for Vector Borne diseases under the Ministry of Health, which updates guidelines and preventive measures for numerous vector-borne diseases like dengue, chikungunya, and malaria.\n\n-Article written by Swathi Satish",

This plasmid is now genetically modified.\nThe genetically modified plasmid is introduced into a new bacteria or yeast cell.\nThis cell then divides rapidly and starts making insulin.\nTo create large amounts of the cells, the genetically modified bacteria or yeast are grown in large fermentation vessels that contain all the nutrients they need. The more the cells divide, the more insulin is produced.\nWhen fermentation is complete, the mixture is filtered to release the insulin.\nThe insulin is then purified and packaged into bottles and insulin pens for distribution to patients with diabetes.\nHistory of genetic engineering\nHerbert Boyer and Stanley Cohen created the first GMO in 1973 using a microbe.\nWhen Rudolf Jaenisch put foreign DNA into a mouse in 1974, he produced the first GM animal.\nGenentech, the first business to concentrate on genetic engineering, was established in 1976 and began producing human proteins.\nHuman insulin that had been genetically modified was created in 1978, and microorganisms that generate insulin were commercialized in 1982.\nSince the introduction of the Flavr Savr tomato in 1994, genetically modified food has been available for purchase.

As a result, it is uncertain if the organ will continue to function throughout time.\nAnimal rights advocates have criticized xenotransplantation for ethical reasons like how they have criticized animal testing.\nAnimals\u2019 genetic codes being permanently altered is likewise cause for concern.\n\nAlso read: Ethics of Euthanasia\n\nHistory of Xenotransplantation\n\nBetween the 17th and 20th centuries, blood was transfused from various animal species into patients with a variety of pathological conditions.\n\nSkin grafts were carried out in the 19th century on a variety of animals, with frogs being the most popular.\nIn 1838 the first corneal xenotransplantation (from a pig) was performed in a patient, whereas the first corneal allograft (human-to-human).\nIn 1963\u20131964, when human organs were not available and chronic dialysis was not yet in use, Reemtsma transplanted chimpanzee kidneys into 13 patients, one of whom returned to work for almost 9 months before suddenly dying from what was believed to be an electrolyte disturbance.\nThe first heart transplant in a human ever performed was by Hardy in 1964, using a chimpanzee heart, but the patient died within 2 hours.\nStarzl carried out the first chimpanzee-to-human liver transplantation in 1966; in 1992, he obtained patient survival for 70 days following a baboon liver transplant.\n\nAlexis Carrel working first in France and subsequently in North America, developed surgical techniques for anastomosing blood vessels, which enabled organ transplantation to be carried out successfully for the first time. For this work, he was awarded the Nobel Prize in 1912.\n\nWith the advent of genetic engineering and cloning technologies, pigs are currently available with several different manipulations that protect their tissues from the human immune response, resulting in increasing pig graft survival in nonhuman primate models.\n\nGenetically modified pigs offer hope of a limitless supply of organs and cells for those in need of a transplant.\n\nTransplantation in mythology:\n\nHumans have been interested in the possibility of merging physical features from various animal species for hundreds of years.\n\nThe chimera has been used to represent the\u00a0allotransplantation of organs and cells (transplantation between members of the same species).\nIn Hindu mythology, Ganesha is a god with an elephant head and the story also mentions that Ganesha was given a drink \u201celixir\u201d to Ganesha which could be extrapolated to modern-day induction immunosuppression medicine.\nSushrutha Samhita provides the first written evidence of forehead flap rhinoplasty, which is practiced today for the reconstruction of the nose.\nFuture of Xenotransplantation\n\nXenotransplantation promises that there would no longer be a need for a waiting list, because there would be a ready supply of appropriate organs available at all times, from a genetically modified and carefully overseen population of pigs.\n\nThe high cost and complex healthcare infrastructure required for xenotransplantation might limit its use in less affluent countries. This can be resolved in time as the research progresses with substantial success.\n\n-Article written by Swathi Satish",

    "[CONTENT] #378": "Do you know what exactly is eSIM? What are its advantages and disadvantages? Will eSIM replace physical SIM completely? To answer all these let us dive deep into the topic.\n\nThe eSIM (or embedded SIM) isn\u2019t exactly a new technology and has been around for years now. But it is quickly becoming mainstream.\n\nIndia has also got its first eSIM which will help simplify international travel.\n\nAs per the reports,\u00a0Sensorise, an M2M service provider, has introduced India\u2019s first-ever consumer travel eSIM, offering worldwide connectivity. Designed to cater to leisure travelers, corporate travelers, and students, this eSIM presents an affordable substitute for conventional international roaming telecom solutions.\n\nTable of Contents\n\nWhat is eSIM?\nAdvantages\nDisadvantages\nWill eSIM replace physical SIM?\nWhat is eSIM?\n\neSIM or an embedded SIM, is essentially the same hardware of a regular SIM card chip but is permanently embedded as part of the motherboard of a watch or smartphone. \u00a0It is also known as eUICC (Embedded Universal Circuit Card).\n\nKey features and aspects of eSIMs include:\n\nRemote Provisioning:\u00a0One of the primary advantages of eSIM technology is that it allows for remote provisioning of mobile network profiles. This means that users can remotely activate their devices on a mobile network without physically inserting a SIM card. This feature is particularly useful for Internet of Things (IoT) devices, wearables, and other connected devices.\nFlexible Carrier Switching:\u00a0Users with eSIM-enabled devices can switch between mobile carriers without needing to change physical SIM cards. They can download the necessary network profile for the desired carrier onto the eSIM, providing more flexibility and convenience.\nReduced Physical Space:\u00a0Since eSIMs are embedded directly into devices, they save physical space compared to traditional SIM cards. This is especially beneficial for smaller devices such as smartwatches, fitness trackers, and other IoT devices where space is limited.\nDevice Connectivity:\u00a0eSIMs enable a wide range of devices to connect to cellular networks, including smartphones, tablets, smartwatches, laptops, and IoT devices. This simplifies the process of adding cellular connectivity to various devices.\nSecurity:\u00a0eSIM technology incorporates security features to protect user information and prevent unauthorized access. It uses cryptographic mechanisms to secure communication between the device and the mobile network.\nGlobal Roaming:\u00a0For users who frequently travel internationally, eSIMs offer the convenience of easily connecting to local networks without the need for physical SIM card swaps. Users can download the profile of a local carrier, allowing for seamless global roaming.\nEnvironmental Impact:\u00a0eSIMs contribute to reducing the environmental impact associated with the production and disposal of physical SIM cards. The elimination of physical cards helps decrease electronic waste.\nSupport for Multiple Profiles:\u00a0Some eSIMs support the storage of multiple profiles, enabling users to switch between different mobile carriers or plans on the same device. This feature is particularly useful for those who maintain multiple subscriptions.\n\nAlso read: Cryptocurrency\n\n\ud83d\udc49 Which year are YOU targeting for success in the IAS/IPS/IFS Exam? \ud83d\ude80\n\n(1) \u21d2 UPSC 2025: Prelims cum Mains\n\n(2) \u21d2 UPSC 2026: Prelims cum Mains\n\n(3) \u21d2 UPSC 2027 Prelims cum Mains\n\nTip: Know more about ClearIAS Courses (Online/Offline)\n\nAdvantages\nIt enables a more seamless device setup experience, without the need to insert or replace a physical SIM card.\nThey are easier to activate than SIM cards: While physical SIM cards need to be inserted into the phone for them to be activated, an eSIM can be activated simply by scanning a QR code that registers the eSIM profile with the mobile network.\nUsing this feature, users can store multiple eSIM profiles on a device simultaneously and conveniently switch between them.\nWith an eSIM, devices will work like a dual SIM phone, a combination of a physical SIM and an eSIM. Dual SIMs give the convenience of having two phone numbers on a single device.\nThey take up less space inside smartphones: Nano SIMs are the cards currently in use in most modern smartphones. These tiny cards measure approximately 8.8mm, but eSIMS measure just 4mm. The smaller size means phone manufacturers have more space to add extra features, like more battery capacity or to enhance a phone\u2019s processing power with a faster CPU. It also allows them to improve a phone\u2019s IP rating against water and dust since the absence of a SIM card slot means there are fewer ingress points.\nDisadvantages\nIt takes longer to restore in a new phone: If the phone breaks, chances are that the tiny plastic SIM that was tucked away inside the phone will be relatively unscathed. It can simply be pulled out and inserted into a new handset \u2013 but this is not the case with an eSIM.\nIt needs to be retrieved and downloaded from the eSIM profile from the cloud, which is considerably more time-consuming to do.\nIt also takes longer than it would take to transfer into a new handset when you upgrade.\nUsers can be more easily tracked by network providers: Users worried about privacy can easily prevent their mobile network from tracking their location by removing their phone\u2019s physical SIM card. However, since it can\u2019t be removed and is hardwired into the device, eSIM users\u2019 phones will be constantly active on their carrier\u2019s network, and more easily traceable.\nWill eSIM replace physical SIM?\n\nThis is not likely to happen in the near future, given that most smartphones across the lower segments rely on the technology of physical SIM and the fact that there are advantages of physical SIM cards for which there isn\u2019t a workaround yet.\n\neSIM technology is becoming more prevalent in modern devices, and its adoption is expected to grow as more carriers and device manufacturers embrace this technology.\n\nIt provides greater flexibility, convenience, and efficiency in managing connectivity for a wide range of devices in our increasingly connected world.\n\nArticle written by: Caroline\u00a0",

    "[CONTENT] #384": "Did you hear about the Fractional Orbital Bombardment System? What are the concerns associated with it for India? Read the following article to know more about this.\n\nBetween the 1950s and 1960s, the US and USSR were racing each other in a global arms race and were actively searching for more efficient methods to knock down each other. Both are equipped with nuclear capabilities, nuclear submarines, aircraft capable of carrying heavier nuclear bombs, and also intercontinental ballistic missiles.\n\nIn the early 1960s, a revolutionary idea emerged in the Soviet Union to launch nuclear weapons into the low earth orbit and then deorbit \u00a0(to go out of orbit) at the right time towards its target destination (US cities). This system is known as the fractional orbital bombardment system (FOBS).\n\nFOBS \u00a0is the system that is used to launch nuclear warheads from space which uses low earth orbit for its target destination.\n\nTable of Contents\n\nSalient features of FOBS\nWhy did FOBS stay back even after the outer space treaty?\nSALT II agreement\nConcerns for India\nPrevious year question\nSalient features of FOBS\n\nThe Fractional Orbital Bombardment System (FOBS) was a concept related to space-based nuclear weapons delivery. It originated during the Cold War and was associated with the Soviet Union. The idea behind FOBS was to place nuclear warheads in orbit around the Earth and deorbit them to strike targets on the Earth\u2019s surface.\n\n\ud83d\udc49 Which year are YOU targeting for success in the IAS/IPS/IFS Exam? \ud83d\ude80\n\n(1) \u21d2 UPSC 2025: Prelims cum Mains\n\n(2) \u21d2 UPSC 2026: Prelims cum Mains\n\n(3) \u21d2 UPSC 2027 Prelims cum Mains\n\nTip: Know more about ClearIAS Courses (Online/Offline)\n\nUnlike traditional intercontinental ballistic missiles (ICBMs) that follow a predictable ballistic trajectory, FOBS weapons could approach their targets from unexpected directions, making them potentially more challenging to defend against.\n\nA most important feature is its capability to attack from any direction and hide the target destination till the payload is dropped.\nIt has no fixed trajectory as it can use thrusters to change This is a serious problem for the US as its defence system relies on the detection of an ICBM launch which follows an arcing trajectory. Also, most of \u00a0North America\u2019s early warning systems are pointed towards the North Pole but the FOBS targets the South Pole which will again make it the nation to early detection of FOBS missiles.\nIt has no range limit and can be targeted at any point on the earth.\n\nFrom the above fig, you can observe that an ICBM (Intercontinental ballistic missile) travels in a really big arc such that its top going from the Soviet Union to the US is about 1300km above the Earth whereas FOBS enters at a much lower orbit such that it can arrive the US about 10 minutes quicker.\n\nWhy did FOBS stay back even after the outer space treaty?\n\nFOBS was considered a destabilizing element of strategic arms control because it created difficulties in early warning systems and led to concerns about the potential for a surprise nuclear attack.\n\nThe Outer Space Treaty was signed in 1967, which prohibits signatories from putting nuclear weapons in the orbit around the earth.\n\nThe Soviet Union claimed that FOBS took a partial orbit and didn\u2019t make a full orbit. So Soviets named the system \u201cfractional orbital bombardment system\u201d.\n\nThere is a claim from space lawyers that, since the orbit is a condition and not an altitude, fractional orbits are still orbits and hence if the Soviet Union launched it with a real nuclear weapon they would have violated the treaty.\n\nSALT II agreement\n\nStrategic Arms Limitation Talks (SALT II) agreement was signed between the Soviet Union and the US. This agreement prohibited the deployment of FOBS. However, the US did not ratify it in response to the invasion of Afghanistan by the Soviet Union. Soviet Union decommissioned FOBS in 1983.\n\nRecently China tested a new hypersonic weapon system i.e. an orbital bombardment system which comes out as unwelcome news as it may be yet another step for a dangerous arms race.\n\nConcerns for India\n\nEven though Chinese FOBS is not necessarily India-specific, its FOB capability is yet another challenge that India needs to be prepared for at the earliest.\n\nThings that can be done:\n\nIndia has to considerably enhance its nuclear capability.\nMore investment in underwater vehicles and long-range cruise missiles which use nuclear energy as their primary fuel.\nIndia needs to drastically increase the number of military satellites that it operates in LEO.\nIndia has to focus on developing space planes that can be used to deliver weapons from space.\n\nAgain the world is seen to be entering into a nuclear arms race as the US is panicked by China\u2019s new test which made the world more chaotic. Even though it is a potent weapon, FOBS can be seen as a \u2018first strike\u2019 weapon or a weapon intended to limit an opponent\u2019s ability to respond.\n\nPrevious year question\n\nQ. Which one of the following statements best reflects the idea behind the \u201cFractional Orbital Bombardment System\u201d often talked about in media?

Because of how slowly it has generally wandered like only 9 km each year, hence scientists can readily keep track of its location.\n\nHowever, after the turn of the century, this speed climbed to 50 kilometers each year.\n\nEarth\u2019s steady magnetic field is produced by many sources, both above and below the planet\u2019s surface.\n\nMagnetic and Geomagnetic poles\n\nEarth has two sets of poles, geographic poles, and magnetic poles. Earth\u2019s magnetic field can be visualized if you imagine a large bar magnet inside our planet, roughly aligned with Earth\u2019s axis.\n\nEach end of the magnet lies relatively close (about 10 degrees) to the geographic North and South poles.\nEarth\u2019s invisible magnetic field lines travel in a closed, continuous loop and are nearly vertical at each magnetic pole.\n\nWhen a magnet is suspended so it may rotate freely, its North pole is imagined to be the pole that is drawn to the Earth\u2019s North Magnetic Pole.\n\nThe North Magnetic Pole of the Earth is the South Magnetic Pole of its Magnetic Field because opposing poles attract.\nThe Earth\u2019s rotation axis and the magnetic dipole field are typically aligned fairly closely; in other words, the magnetic poles are typically fairly close to the geographic poles (the earth\u2019s axis passes through these poles), which is why a compass works.\nThe north and south magnetic poles flip places, though, when the dipole component of the field reverses after a few thousand years.\nEarth\u2019s magnetic North Pole is quickly moving from the Canadian Arctic towards Russia.\n\nThe intersections of the Earth\u2019s surface and the axis of a bar magnet that is hypothetically positioned at the planet\u2019s center are known as the geomagnetic poles (dipole poles).\n\nThe poles are known as \u201cthe geomagnetic north pole\u201d and \u201cthe geomagnetic south pole,\u201d respectively, and one exists in each hemisphere.\nThe geomagnetic dipole is currently inclined at an angle to the Earth\u2019s rotating axis of approximately 11 degrees.\nOn the other hand, magnetic needles turn vertically at the magnetic poles (the magnetic north pole and the magnetic south pole).\nThe uneven and complicated distribution of the earth\u2019s magnetic field is what causes the discrepancy between the positions of the magnetic and geomagnetic poles.\n\nA geomagnetic reversal or a reversal in earth\u2019s magnetic field is a change in a planet\u2019s magnetic field such that the positions of magnetic north and magnetic south are interchanged.\n\nWhat causes geomagnetism?\n\nEarth\u2019s magnetic field is generated by what is known as the geodynamo process. For a planet to generate its magnetic field by the geodynamo process, it must have the following characteristics:\n\nThe planet rotates fast enough\nIts interior must have a fluid medium\nThe interior fluid must have the ability to conduct electricity\nThe core must have an internal source of energy that propels convection currents in the liquid interior.\n\nThe generation of Earth\u2019s magnetic field occurs deep within the Earth\u2019s interior, in a layer known as the outer core to be precise.\n\nGeomagnetism on other planets\n\nEarth is not the only planet in the solar system to possess a magnetic field.\n\nJupiter, Saturn, Uranus, and Neptune all exhibit magnetic fields far stronger than Earth\u2019s.\n\nThough the underlying mechanisms driving these magnetic fields are not yet completely understood.\n\nMars\u00a0does not have enough inner heat nor does it possess the liquid interior required to generate a magnetic field.\n\nVenus, on the other hand, has a liquid core but does not spin fast enough to generate a magnetic field.\n\n-Article written by Swathi Satish",

The phenomenon is totally lacking in classical physics.\n\nHow does Quantum computing make use of entanglement?\n\nIn quantum computers, if the state of an entangled qubit is changed, the associated qubit\u2019s state will also be changed instantly. Entanglement increases the processing efficiency of quantum computers.\n\nAs processing one qubit reveals information about numerous qubits, doubling the number of qubits won\u2019t always double the number of processes (i.e. the entangled qubits).\n\nAccording to studies, a quantum algorithm cannot deliver an exponential speedup over classical computations without quantum entanglement.\n\nQuantum Entanglement Production\n\nParticles can be entangled in several ways.\n\nThe major ways\u00a0 are :\n\nDependence on a dynamic process, such as nuclear decay and particle creation, is one approach.\nNumerous investigations show that splitting a single photon can form entangled photon pairs (produces entangled pairs of photons).\nPhoton pairs can also be mixed together in an optical fibre line to create entanglement.\n\nWho developed the idea of Quantum Entanglement?\n\nAlbert Einstein, Nathan Rosen, and Boris Podolsky examined the potential interactions between highly coupled quantum states in 1935.\n\nThey came to the conclusion that numerous particles will lose their discrete quantum states and share a single, common state when they are strongly linked.\n\nPhysicist Erwin Schr\u00f6dinger, one of the pioneers of quantum mechanics initially used the term \u201centanglement\u201d. According to him, it is an essential aspect of quantum mechanics.\n\nImportance of Quantum Entanglement\nEntangled states are essential resources for many quantum information processing jobs and quantum cryptography protocols, which is why they are so important.\nIt is safe to employ the entangled electron pair resources to speed up quantum information processing activities.\nChallenges\nEntanglement is readily lost when photons travel through the environment due to their fragility. Therefore, in order to exploit a pair of photons as resources, it is crucial to know whether they are entangled.\nSafety is an issue. Measurement devices are needed to verify entanglement, but they can be hacked and cannot be entirely trusted.\nApplications in Quantum Computing\n\nThe most well-known uses include quantum teleportation and superdense coding. Along with those it also has many other applications which are discussed below.\n\nThe majority of scientists think that entanglement is essential for the development of quantum computing.\nSuperdense coding: Superdense coding is the transmission of two conventional bits of data using a single entangled qubit. Delivering half of the information over the high-latency channel to support the information coming over the low-latency channel makes it possible to transform high-latency bandwidth into low-latency bandwidth.\nQuantum cryptography: Cryptography is the exchange of information between two parties utilising an encrypted code and a decryption key. Quantum entanglement makes it possible to establish a secure channel between two parties without the involvement of a third party. When two systems are purely entangled, they are correlated with one another, which means that when one changes, the other does too.\nQuantum teleportation: The method of exchanging quantum information, such as photons, atoms, electrons, and superconducting circuits, between two parties is known as quantum teleportation.\nInterferometry requires entanglement to overcome the conventional quantum limit and reach the Heisenberg limit.\n\nRead: Quantum Science and Technology\n\nArticle Written By: Atheena Fathima Riyas",

Read more about carbon and its allotropes.\n\nDiamond\n\nOne large carbon atom molecule makes up a diamond. Diamonds are clear and without colour. They are called lustrous because they sparkle and reflect light. They are desirable in jewellery because of these qualities.\n\nDiamond has a high melting point and is extremely hard. This makes it an excellent material for cutting tools. Diamond tips are utilised on the cutting edges of discs used to cut concrete and masonry. Diamonds are used to make heavy-duty drill bits so that they can be made to drill through rocks and remain sharp for a longer period of time.\n\nDiamond is not soluble in water.\u00a0 Electricity cannot flow through it. Four powerful covalent bonds connect every atom in a diamond to its neighbours, leaving no free electrons or ions. This is the reason why diamond does not conduct electricity.\n\nThe bonding also explains diamond\u2019s high melting temperature and hardness. Atoms that are that tightly bound together would require a significant amount of energy to separate.\n\nGraphite\n\nCarbon atoms are arranged in layers in graphite.\n\nBlack, glossy, and opaque characterize graphite. It lacks transparency. Additionally, it is a very slippery substance. Layers easily slip onto the paper, producing a black imprint, hence it is utilised in pencil leads. It is a part of various lubricants, such as chain oil for bicycles.\n\nWater does not dissolve graphite. It is a good conductor of electricity and has a high melting point, making it a desirable material for the electrodes required in electrolysis.\n\nThree powerful covalent connections hold each carbon atom to its layer. Each atom now has an extra electron, and these extra electrons combine to produce a delocalized \u201csea\u201d of electrons that loosely holds the layers together. Graphite is a strong electrical conductor because these delocalized electrons can\u00a0travel together.\n\nBut melting graphite is a difficult task. The strong covalent connections must be broken with a lot of energy in order to separate the carbon atoms.\n\nAlso read: Carbon trading and Carbon cycle\n\nFullerene\n\nThe third crystalline form of carbon is called fullerene. Despite their recent discovery, they have been found to occur in interplanetary dust as well as in the earth\u2019s geological formations. Some typical \u00a0fullerenes are\u00a0C-32, C-50, C-70, and C-76.\n\nThe molecular-scale tubes of carbon that make up nanotubes, a kind of fullerene, are stacked in layers similar to those seen in graphite.\n\nDue to the strong covalent connections that connect each carbon atom to three others, carbon nanotubes have an extremely high melting point. Additionally, each carbon atom now has an extra electron, resulting in a sea of delocalized electrons inside the tube, which allows nanotubes to conduct electricity.\n\nAmorphous Carbon\n\nAmorphous carbon lacks a well-defined crystal structure and may contain a disordered arrangement of carbon atoms.\n\nAmorphous carbon can take various forms, such as coal, charcoal, or soot. It is often used in applications like water filtration and as a black pigment.\n\nLonsdaleite\n\nLonsdaleite is a hexagonal allotrope of carbon, closely related to graphite and diamond. It is believed to form during the impact of meteorites on Earth.\n\nLonsdaleite is exceptionally hard and has properties similar to both diamond and graphite.\n\nArticle written by: Krishnapriya JR",

The vehicle has a cryogenic upper stage, a core liquid booster, and two solid strap-ons.\n\nThe GSLV Mk III is intended to deliver satellites in the 4-tonne class into Geosynchronous Transfer Orbit (GTO) or about 10 tonnes into Low Earth Orbit (LEO), which is rough twice as much as the GSLV Mk II\u2019s capacity.\nThe GSAT-19 satellite was successfully launched into orbit on June 5, 2017, from SDSC SHAR, Sriharikota, using the GSLV-Mk III-D1, the first developmental flight of the rocket.\nOn November 14, 2018, Satish Dhawan Space Centre SHAR, Sriharikota, launched GSAT-29, a high throughput communication satellite, in GSLV MkIII-D2, the second developmental flight of the GSLV MkIII.\nIndia\u2019s second lunar mission, Chandrayaan-2, was successfully launched into Earth parking orbit on July 22, 2019, from Satish Dhawan Space Centre SHAR, Sriharikota, by GSLV MkIII-M1.\n\nGSLV-Mk II is the largest launch vehicle developed by India.

Earth-observation or \u201cremote-sensing\u201d satellites are to be launched by PSLV into Sun-Synchronous circular polar orbits at altitudes ranging from 600 to 900 kilometres.\nRemote sensing satellites travel in a pole-to-pole orbit around the Earth (at about 98 deg orbital-plane inclination). When there is no change in the angle between the satellite\u2019s centre and the Sun throughout the orbit, the orbit is said to be sun-synchronous.\nDue to their sun-synchronism characteristics, which enable the satellite\u2019s onboard camera to take pictures of the planet under the same sun-illumination conditions during each of its repeated passes over the same place on the ground, these orbits are frequently referred to as \u201cLow Earth Orbits (LEO)\u201d. The satellite can therefore be used to keep an eye on the planet\u2019s resources.\nThe PSLV is used to launch remote sensing satellites into Sun-synchronous polar orbits as well as spacecraft with lower lift-off masses, up to around 1400 kg, into the elliptical Geosynchronous Transfer Orbit (GTO).\nThe first and third stages of the PSLV\u2019s four-stage launch vehicle are propelled by solid rocket motors, and the second and fourth stages are propelled by liquid rocket engines. Additionally, strap-on motors are employed to increase the thrust that the first stage produces. The PSLV is available in a number of variations, including the core-alone version (PSLV-CA), PSLV-G, and PSLV-XL, depending on how many strap-on boosters are utilised.\nLaunching communication satellites into geosynchronous transfer orbit, which is normally 250 x 36,000 km elliptical, is the primary task of the GSLV (GTO). By starting its internal onboard engines, the satellite in GTO is lifted to its ultimate destination, Geo-synchronous Earth orbit (GEO), which is approximately 36,000 km in altitude (and zero degrees inclination on the equatorial plane).\n\nSummary:\n\nThe PSLV is older than the GSLV.\nThe GSLV has a much greater load capacity than the PSLV.\nThe GSLV use cryogenic fuel while the PSLV doesn\u2019t.\nThe GSLV has three stages while the PSLV has four stages.\nThe GSLV has 4 liquid boosters while the PSLV has 6 solid boosters.\nThe PSLV is more reliable than the GSLV.\n\nArticle Written by: Remya",

Plants typically produce it through synthesis.\n\n\ud83d\udc49 Which year are YOU targeting for success in the IAS/IPS/IFS Exam? \ud83d\ude80\n\n(1) \u21d2 UPSC 2025: Prelims cum Mains\n\n(2) \u21d2 UPSC 2026: Prelims cum Mains\n\n(3) \u21d2 UPSC 2027 Prelims cum Mains\n\nTip: Know more about ClearIAS Courses (Online/Offline)\n\nThe primary characteristics of this polysaccharide are biodegradability and hydrolysis resistance. Most plants contain this biopolymer, primarily in the leaves and stalks.\n\nIt is the most abundant carbon input in soil. To access the glucose monomer, it must be cleaved by extracellular enzymes.\nThese pieces are then transported into the cell for energy generation (catabolism) or production of biomass (anabolism).\nIt is a biodegradable, chiral, tasteless compound without any odor.\nCellulose is used by a diverse group of soil organisms including fungi such as Penicillium and\u00a0Aspergillus\u00a0and bacteria such as\u00a0Streptomyces\u00a0and\u00a0Pseudomonas.\nFungi and bacteria are important participants in the extracellular cleavage of the polysaccharide.\nCotton fiber and wood are the principal industrial sources of polymer for industrial applications.\n\nHemicellulose is the next most common carbohydrate in plants. It is a branched polymer with varied sugar monomers (glucose, mannose, and galactose) and bonds.\n\nThe decomposition of hemicellulose is similar to that of cellulose in that the initial cleavage step takes place outside of the cell, and the sugars produced are then transported into the cell for catabolism or anabolism.\n\n(Catabolism involves breaking down complex molecules and releasing energy for the body to use. The anabolic process is the complete opposite of catabolism as it involves creating bigger, complex molecules from smaller, simpler molecules.)\n\nEven though hemicellulose decomposition is much quicker than cellulose decomposition, cells will utilize simple sugars as substrates before hemicellulose.\nPhotosynthesis and cellulose\n\nWhen plants perform photosynthesis, carbon is primarily converted to cellulose, the form of carbohydrate that is one of the main building blocks for growing plants.\n\nIn plants, cellulose is synthesized at the plasma membrane by Rosette Terminal Complexes (RTCs). The RTCs contain the cellulose synthase enzymes that synthesize the individual cellulose chains.\nThe polysaccharide is synthesized by cellulose synthase complexes that are assembled in the Golgi apparatus and then delivered to the plasma membrane, where they actively synthesize cellulose.\nCellulolysis is essentially the hydrolysis of cellulose. Cellulase is the enzyme that catalyzes the process of the breakdown of the polysaccharide into monosaccharides like \u03b2-glucose.\nDigestion of cellulose\nBy Animals\n\nCattle are made to digest cellulose. They can consume grasses and other plants that are high in cellulose and, through enteric fermentation, digest the carbon that is stored in the polysaccharide.\n\nCattle can use that carbon, upcycling the cellulose, for growth, milk production, and other metabolic processes.\n\nAs a by-product of consuming cellulose, cattle belch out methane, thereby returning that carbon sequestered by plants back into the atmosphere.\nAfter about ten years, that\u00a0methane is broken down\u00a0and converted back to CO2.\nOnce converted to CO2, plants can again perform photosynthesis and fix that carbon back into cellulose.\nFrom here, cattle can eat the plants and the cycle begins once again.\n\nIn essence, the methane belched from cattle is not adding new carbon to the atmosphere. Rather it is part of the natural cycling of carbon through the biogenic carbon cycle.\n\nBy Humans\n\nCellulose is an indigestible plant fiber that is thought to be difficult for humans to use as energy.\n\nBecause of the lack of the right enzymes to dissolve the beta-acetal connections, cellulose cannot be broken down in the human body.\n\nThe digestive system of the human body is unable to dissociate the cellulose\u2019s monosaccharide linkages.\nDespite being indigestible, this polysaccharide aids in the smooth operation of the intestinal tract.\nBut because it is a good source of fiber, it has a crucial function in the human body.\nThe digestive enzymes produced by the human mouth, liver, and stomach can break down all types of sugar except cellulose.\nSome foods, such as fermented foods, cereals, and vegetables, are indigestible or difficult to digest.\n\nFruits and vegetables contain cellulose in small amounts which are easily digestible. Fibers contain cellulose which acts as roughage, adding bulk to consumed food and helping in the smooth passage of the food efficiently and at a much faster pace. A high-fiber diet reduces the risk of colon cancer as fiber in the diet helps reduce the time the feces stay in the colon wall.\n\nUses of cellulose in industry\n\nThis natural polymer has versatile uses in many industries such as veterinary foods, wood and paper, fibers and clothes, and cosmetic and pharmaceutical industries as excipients.\n\nThe polymer has very semi-synthetic derivatives which are extensively used in pharmaceutical and cosmetic industries.\n\nPaper and paperboard are the two main products made from polymer. Smaller amounts are transformed into a wide range of derivative goods, including rayon and cellophane.\n\nAs a renewable fuel source, cellulosic ethanol and other biofuels made from cellulose from energy crops are currently being developed.\n\nPrevious year questions\nEach year a large amount of plant material, cellulose is deposited on the surface of Planet Earth. What are the natural processes this cellulose undergoes before yielding carbon dioxide, water, and other end products?

A Small Satellite Launch Vehicle (SSLV) is a three-stage Launch Vehicle configured with three solid propulsion stages and a liquid propulsion-based velocity trimming module as a terminal stage.\n\nSSLV has a diameter of 2m and a length of 34m, with a lift-off weight of around 120 tonnes. From Satish Dhawan Space Centre, SSLV can launch 500kg satellites into 500km planar orbit (SDSC).ISRO\u2019s SSLV can transport satellites weighing less than or equal to 500 kg.\n\nThe launch vehicle will carry the small satellites into 500 km LEO (Low Earth Orbit). SSLV production is the responsibility of ISRO\u2019s commercial arm, NSIL (New Space India Limited).

SSLV needs only 6 people to integrate it. SSLV of ISRO is a three-stage launch vehicle. The vehicle also features both vented and closed interstage.\n\nSignificance of SSLV:\nThe Era of small satellites: Initially, the larger satellite payloads were prioritised, but as the industry evolved, more actors arose, including businesses, governments, colleges, and laboratories, all of which started to deploy satellites. Mostly all of them fall in the category of small satellites.\nThe Rise in Demand: Small satellite launches have been increasingly popular during the last eight to ten years as a result of the expanding need for space-based data, communication, surveillance, and commerce.\nSaves cost: Manufacturers and operators of satellites do not have the luxury of paying expensive travel costs or waiting months for space on a rocket. As a result, organisations are building satellite constellations in orbit. One Web and SpaceX\u2019s Starlink are two initiatives building a constellation of several satellites.\nBusiness opportunity: Since the majority of the demand comes from businesses that are launching satellites for commercial purposes, there is an economic opportunity for space organisations like ISRO to capitalise on the sector\u2019s potential as a result of the increase in demand for rocket launches.\nDrastic reduction of the turnaround time.\nLaunch on Demand fulfilment.\nRealisation and operating cost optimisation.\nMultiple satellites can be accommodated with ease.\nLeast amount of launch infrastructure requirements.\nHeritage of proven design practises\nRecent Developments\nThe United States has given ISRO permission to launch small satellites on the SSLV\u2019s second developmental flight.\nIt is reported to have its first developmental flight in April 2022.\nSSLV-D1 Micro SAT\u00a0will be launched by this SSLV on its maiden developmental flight.\nWhat is the SSLV-D1/EOS-02 Mission?\nIt was designed to capture a larger share of the small launch vehicle market since it could transport satellites into Low Earth Orbit.\nIt was carrying the two satellites on board the rocket \u2013\nThe primary EOS-2 Earth-observing satellite\u2013 ISRO designed and built the EOS-02 earth observation satellite.

Pt. Jawaharlal Nehru, India\u2019s first Prime Minister, who considered scientific advancement as an important component of India\u2019s future, placed space research under the jurisdiction of the Department of Atomic Energy in 1961.\nHomi Bhabha, the father of India\u2019s atomic programme, then founded the Indian National Committee for Space Research (INCOSPAR) in 1962, with Dr. Sarabhai as Chairman.\nThe Indian space programme began establishing itself with the launch of sounding rockets in 1962, which was aided by India\u2019s geographical proximity to the equator.\nThumba Equatorial Rocket Launching Station (TERLS) was built near Thiruvananthapuram in south Kerala.\nIndia developed an indigenous technology of sounding rockets called the Rohini Family of sounding rockets.\nThe India Space Research Organisation (ISRO) was established in 1969, and the Department of Space was established in 1972.\n\nPhase II: 1970-80\n\nSarabhai had participated in an early NASA study on the viability of employing satellites for uses as diverse as direct television broadcasting.\nIndia began developing satellite technology in anticipation of future remote sensing and communication requirements.\nIndia\u2019s first venture into space occurred in 1975, with the launch of their satellite Aryabhata by a Soviet launcher.\nBy 1979, the SLV was ready to launch from the Sriharikota Rocket Launching Station, a newly created second launch site (SRLS).\nThe first launch in 1979 failed due to a control malfunction in the second stage. This problem had been solved by 1980.\nThe first indigenous satellite launched by India was called Rohini.\n\nPhase III: 1980-90\n\nFollowing the success of the SLV, ISRO was eager to begin work on a satellite launch vehicle capable of placing a truly useful satellite into polar orbit.\nIn 1987, the Augmented Satellite Launch Vehicle (ASLV) was tested, but the launch failed. After modest adjustments, another launch attempt was made in 1988, which also failed.\n\nPhase IV: 1990-2000\n\nIt was not until 1992 that the first successful launch of the ASLV took place.\nSince its first successful launch in 1994, the PSLV has become the workhorse launch vehicle, launching both remote sensing and communications satellites into orbit, establishing the world\u2019s largest cluster, and giving unique data to Indian industry and agriculture.\nDevelopments after 2000\nIn 2001, the first development flight of the GSLV took place.\nAs the first attempt at exploring the solar system, India pursued a mission to send unmanned probes to the moon in 2008 namely Chandrayaan.\nISRO has entered the lucrative industry of launching foreign payloads from Indian soil using its rockets.\nAfter 2010, ISRO embarked on the following programmes: Polar Satellite Launch Vehicle (PSLV), Geosynchronous Satellite Launch Vehicle (GSLV), and next-generation GSLV Mark-III launch vehicle missions are part of the launch vehicle development programme.\nThe Earth Observation programme includes cutting-edge Indian remote sensing (IRS) satellites such as Resourcesat, Cartosat, Oceansat, Radar Imaging Satellite, Geo-Imaging Satellite, and weather/climate satellites such as INSAT-3DR missions.\nThe satellite navigation programme consists of a constellation of seven Indian Regional Navigation Satellite System (IRNSS) satellites and an associated ground segment designed to deliver accurate positional and timing information.\n\nIndia\u2019s Manned Mission to Space\n\nGaganyaan is a mission by the ISRO scheduled to be launched in 2023.

After that, the steam powers a turbine to produce energy.\n\nBurning rubbish not only generates power but also lessens the quantity of waste that would otherwise be buried in landfills. MSW is reduced in volume by burning by 80%. resulting in a variety of difficult-to-quantify societal and economic benefits.\n\nWaste-to-Energy (WTE) technologies to recover the energy from the waste in the form of Electricity and Biogas/Syngas are:\n\nBiomethanation is the anaerobic digestion of organic materials which is converted into biogas. Anaerobic digestion is a bacterial fermentation process that operates without free oxygen and results in biogas containing mostly methane (~60%), carbon dioxide (~40%), and other gases. Biomethanation has dual benefits. It gives biogas as well as manure as the end product.\n\nThis technology can be conveniently employed in a decentralized manner for the biodegradation of segregated organic wet wastes such as wastes from kitchens, canteens, institutions, hotels, slaughterhouses, and vegetable markets.\n\nIncineration technology is the complete combustion of waste (Municipal Solid Waste or Refuse derived fuel) with the recovery of heat to produce steam that in turn produces power through steam turbines.\n\nThe flue gases produced in the boilers have to be treated by an elaborate air pollution control system.\nThe resultant ash from the incineration of solid waste can be used as construction material after necessary processing while the residue can be safely disposed of in a landfill.\nThis technology is well-established and has been deployed in many projects successfully at the commercial level in India to treat solid wastes like Municipal Solid Waste and Industrial solid Waste etc. and generate electricity.\n\nGasification is a process that uses high temperatures (500-1800 oC) in the presence of limited amounts of oxygen to decompose materials to produce synthetic gas (a mixture of carbon monoxide (CO) and hydrogen (H2)).\n\nBiomass, agro-residues, Segregated MSW, and RDF pellets are used in the gasifier to produce Syngas.\nThis gas can be used for thermal or power generation purposes\nThe purpose of gasification of waste is to generate power more efficiently at lower power levels and also to minimize emissions hence it is an attractive alternative for the thermal treatment of solid waste.\n\nPyrolysis uses heat to break down combustible materials in the absence of oxygen, producing a mixture of combustible gases (primarily methane, complex hydrocarbons, hydrogen, and carbon monoxide), liquids, and solid residues.\n\nThe products of the pyrolysis process are: (i) a gas mixture; (ii) a liquid (bio-oil/tar); and (iii) a solid residue (carbon black).\nThe gas generated by either of these processes can be\u00a0used in boilers to provide heat, or it can be cleaned up and used in combustion turbine\u00a0generators.\nThe purpose of the pyrolysis of waste is to minimize emissions and maximize the gain.\n\nAlso read: Waste to Wealth\n\nAdvantages of waste-to-energy\nWaste-to-energy reduces reliance on fossil fuels, whose burning is a major source of Greenhouse Gas (GHG) emissions, and produces clean, dependable electricity from a renewable fuel source.\nIt is a way to prevent waste from polluting the water bodies and air pollution.\nWaste-to-energy plants cause less\u00a0air pollution\u00a0than\u00a0coal\u00a0plants, but more than\u00a0natural gas\u00a0plants.\nIt is carbon-negative: processing waste into fuel releases considerably less carbon and methane into the air than having waste decay away in landfills or the lake.\nWaste-to-energy plants use pollution control techniques like baghouses, scrubbers, and electrostatic precipitators to reduce the emission of air pollutants like nitrogen oxides, sulfur oxides, and particulates from the flue gases released to the atmosphere and to eliminate pollutants already present in the waste.\nAir pollution emissions can be greatly decreased by using high temperatures, efficient combustion, effective scrubbing, and effective controls.\n\nAlso read: Landfill Fires: Causes, Mitigation and Management\n\nGlobal data on WTE\n\nGlobally, Waste-to-energy generation is being increasingly looked at as a potential energy diversification strategy.\n\nSweden has been a leader in waste-to-energy production over the past 20 years.\n\nMunicipal solid waste is expected to increase to approximately 2.2 billion metric tons by 2025.\n\nMSW generation rates are influenced by several key factors:\n\neconomic development\ndegree of industrialization\nurbanization\nclimate\n\nData collected by international organizations such as the World Bank and the United Nations suggest that the higher the degree of economic development and urbanization, the greater the amount of solid waste produced.\n\nIncome level (gross domestic product or GNP)

The role of waste-to-Energy plants in urban infrastructure is immense as they are substitutes for fossil fuels for generating electricity. Read here to understand more about them.\n\nA study back in 2019 reported that nearly half of the country\u2019s waste-to-energy plants were lying defunct. And the functioning plants were running at low capacity.\n\nThe government has now taken up the cause of waste-energy plants again to move towards garbage-free cities.\n\nThe Urban Development Policy is into three parts:\n\nThe Smart City Mission is to modernize cities, e-governance, integrated command and control systems, and a network of CCTV cameras.\nThe AMRUT mission is to modernize and rejuvenate physical infrastructure in cities, the RERA Act, setting up a metro network in more than 25 cities, and providing electric buses.\nTo make cities clean so that it will be beneficial for the health of people living in cities, especially slum dwellers.\n\nIn this direction, we are moving forward through the construction of toilets and preparing waste-to-clean energy plants, solar rooftops, and LED lights.\n\nAlong with this, encouragement is also being given to Pradhan Mantri Shahari Awas Yojana, PM Svanidhi Yojana, and digital transactions.\n\nMountains of garbage are gradually decreasing as many plants have been set up for waste disposal, the gutter system has been streamlined and a scientific network has also been established for the collection of waste across the country.\n\n\ud83d\udc49 Which year are YOU targeting for success in the IAS/IPS/IFS Exam? \ud83d\ude80\n\n(1) \u21d2 UPSC 2025: Prelims cum Mains\n\n(2) \u21d2 UPSC 2026: Prelims cum Mains\n\n(3) \u21d2 UPSC 2027 Prelims cum Mains\n\nTip: Know more about ClearIAS Courses (Online/Offline)\n\nTable of Contents\n\nWaste-to-Energy Plants\nAdvantages of waste-to-energy\nGlobal data on WTE\nWaste-to-energy in India\nProgram on Energy from Urban, Industrial, Agricultural Wastes/Residues, and Municipal Solid Waste\nWay forward\nWaste-to-Energy Plants\n\nMunicipal and industrial solid trash is converted into power and/or heat for industrial processing at waste-to-energy or energy-from-waste plants.\n\nThe trash is burned at a high temperature in the energy plant, and steam is created as a result of the heat. After that, the steam powers a turbine to produce energy.\n\nBurning rubbish not only generates power but also lessens the quantity of waste that would otherwise be buried in landfills. MSW is reduced in volume by burning by 80%. resulting in a variety of difficult-to-quantify societal and economic benefits.\n\nWaste-to-Energy (WTE) technologies to recover the energy from the waste in the form of Electricity and Biogas/Syngas are:\n\nBiomethanation is the anaerobic digestion of organic materials which is converted into biogas. Anaerobic digestion is a bacterial fermentation process that operates without free oxygen and results in biogas containing mostly methane (~60%), carbon dioxide (~40%), and other gases. Biomethanation has dual benefits. It gives biogas as well as manure as the end product.\n\nThis technology can be conveniently employed in a decentralized manner for the biodegradation of segregated organic wet wastes such as wastes from kitchens, canteens, institutions, hotels, slaughterhouses, and vegetable markets.\n\nIncineration technology is the complete combustion of waste (Municipal Solid Waste or Refuse derived fuel) with the recovery of heat to produce steam that in turn produces power through steam turbines.\n\nThe flue gases produced in the boilers have to be treated by an elaborate air pollution control system.\nThe resultant ash from the incineration of solid waste can be used as construction material after necessary processing while the residue can be safely disposed of in a landfill.\nThis technology is well-established and has been deployed in many projects successfully at the commercial level in India to treat solid wastes like Municipal Solid Waste and Industrial solid Waste etc. and generate electricity.\n\nGasification is a process that uses high temperatures (500-1800 oC) in the presence of limited amounts of oxygen to decompose materials to produce synthetic gas (a mixture of carbon monoxide (CO) and hydrogen (H2)).\n\nBiomass, agro-residues, Segregated MSW, and RDF pellets are used in the gasifier to produce Syngas.\nThis gas can be used for thermal or power generation purposes\nThe purpose of gasification of waste is to generate power more efficiently at lower power levels and also to minimize emissions hence it is an attractive alternative for the thermal treatment of solid waste.\n\nPyrolysis uses heat to break down combustible materials in the absence of oxygen, producing a mixture of combustible gases (primarily methane, complex hydrocarbons, hydrogen, and carbon monoxide), liquids, and solid residues.\n\nThe products of the pyrolysis process are: (i) a gas mixture; (ii) a liquid (bio-oil/tar); and (iii) a solid residue (carbon black).\nThe gas generated by either of these processes can be\u00a0used in boilers to provide heat, or it can be cleaned up and used in combustion turbine\u00a0generators.\nThe purpose of the pyrolysis of waste is to minimize emissions and maximize the gain.\n\nAlso read: Waste to Wealth\n\nAdvantages of waste-to-energy\nWaste-to-energy reduces reliance on fossil fuels, whose burning is a major source of Greenhouse Gas (GHG) emissions, and produces clean, dependable electricity from a renewable fuel source.\nIt is a way to prevent waste from polluting the water bodies and air pollution.\nWaste-to-energy plants cause less\u00a0air pollution\u00a0than\u00a0coal\u00a0plants, but more than\u00a0natural gas\u00a0plants.\nIt is carbon-negative: processing waste into fuel releases considerably less carbon and methane into the air than having waste decay away in landfills or the lake.\nWaste-to-energy plants use pollution control techniques like baghouses, scrubbers, and electrostatic precipitators to reduce the emission of air pollutants like nitrogen oxides, sulfur oxides, and particulates from the flue gases released to the atmosphere and to eliminate pollutants already present in the waste.\nAir pollution emissions can be greatly decreased by using high temperatures, efficient combustion, effective scrubbing, and effective controls.\n\nAlso read: Landfill Fires: Causes, Mitigation and Management\n\nGlobal data on WTE\n\nGlobally, Waste-to-energy generation is being increasingly looked at as a potential energy diversification strategy.\n\nSweden has been a leader in waste-to-energy production over the past 20 years.\n\nMunicipal solid waste is expected to increase to approximately 2.2 billion metric tons by 2025.\n\nMSW generation rates are influenced by several key factors:\n\neconomic development\ndegree of industrialization\nurbanization\nclimate\n\nData collected by international organizations such as the World Bank and the United Nations suggest that the higher the degree of economic development and urbanization, the greater the amount of solid waste produced.\n\nIncome level (gross domestic product or GNP)

Read here.\u00a0\n\nRecent advancements in artificial intelligence (AI) and cloud computing technologies have led to rapid development in the sophistication of audio, video, and image manipulation techniques.\n\nThis manipulated media content is commonly referred to as \u201cdeep fakes\u201d.\n\nRead more about Artificial intelligence (AI).\n\nTable of Contents\n\nWhat are Deep Fakes?\nHow did Deep Fakes work?\nBenefits of Deep Fakes technology\nChallenges with Deep Fake\nWay forward\nConclusion\nWhat are Deep Fakes?\n\nSubscribe to the ClearIAS YouTube Channel for more informative videos on UPSC preparation, tips, and strategies. Stay updated with our latest content and enhance your exam readiness.\n\nDeepfake is a type of synthetic media in which a person in an already-existing video or image is replaced with another person. It manipulates the audio/video, which has the propensity to deceive, using machine learning and artificial intelligence.\nDue to the ease with which bogus news, celebrity pornographic content, etc. get shared online, it has drawn attention.\nIt makes a fake version of original or real audio-visual content by superimposing new audio or image over an existing media file.\nIn September 2019, the AI company Deeptrace discovered 15,000 deep fakes videos online\u2014nearly tripling in just nine months. A startling 96% of them were pornographic, and 99% of them matched the faces of famous women to porn actors.\nHow did Deep Fakes work?\nDeepfake content is created by using two competing AI algorithms \u2013 one is called the generator and the other is called the discriminator.\nThe discriminator is tasked with determining if the fake multimedia content produced by the generator is real or manufactured.\nA generative adversarial network is created when the generator and discriminator work together (GAN). Every time the discriminator correctly recognises the content as being fake, it gives the generator important insights into how to make the next deep fakes better.\nThe first step in establishing a GAN is to identify the desired output and create a training dataset for the generator.\nVideo clips can be supplied to the discriminator after the generator starts producing output at a level that is acceptable.\nBenefits of Deep Fakes technology\nIn order to train disease detection algorithms for rare diseases and to allay patient privacy concerns, GANs can be employed to create fictitious medical images.\nDeepfake can accelerate the accessibility quest to improve equity.\nAs the discriminator becomes more adept at recognising phoney video clips, the generator becomes more proficient at producing them. The generator, on the other hand, improves at producing phoney videos as the discriminator does at recognising them.\nWith the development of Artificial General Intelligence (AGI), artificial intelligence will soon be able to reason more accurately.\nDeepfake movies can animate exhibits at museums and galleries.\nAI avatars can be produced using deep fakes technology and utilised in instructional videos.\nSince lockdowns and health concerns have made video productions involving actual people much more challenging to carry off, startups like London-based Synthesia have been drawing increased attention from the corporate sector.\nDeepfake technology can be utilised to build individual avatars in addition to being used for entertainment and instruction.\nEasy identity protection: For e.g: AI-generated avatars have been used to protect the identity of interviewees in news reports about the persecution of LGBTQ people in Russia.\nAs deep fakes technology increasingly advances, Disney has improved their visual effects using high-resolution deep fakes face swapping technology.\nChallenges with Deep Fake\nDeepfake causes financial fraud, which poses problems for the entire financial system.\nIn the era of the threat of fake news, it also poses a threat to the security of cyber systems and the validity of online information.\nDeepfakes in phishing efforts would make it more challenging for people to recognise a hoax.\nIn any nation, deep fakes can be used to sabotage democratic procedures like elections.\nThe potential for harm to people, organisations, and societies is enormous since it can be used to generate phoney pornographic videos and make politicians appear to say things they did not.\nAny genuine evidence of a crime can be easily discounted as false because the public is so distrustful due to the prevalence of deep fakes.\nFake movies are likely to become more popular outside the world of celebrities as new technology enables unskilled people to create deep fakes with just a few images. This will feed the growth of revenge porn.\nThe use of fake identities and impostor frauds in cybercrime is rising.\nCredibility and authenticity issue: The presence of deep fakes makes it more difficult to determine whether videos are real or not.\nWay forward\nWe must be able to interpret, comprehend, translate, and utilise the information we come across as media consumers.\nMeaningful rules developed in cooperation with the technology sector, civil society, and government can help deter the production and dissemination of malevolent deep fakes.\nPolicymakers need to be aware of the threats that deep fakes pose to the government, society, economy, culture, and local communities.\nImproving media literacy is a precursor to addressing the challenges presented by deep fakes.\nArtificial intelligence-backed technology solutions to identify and stop deep fakes are the best way to combat this threat.\nBlockchains can be used to digitally sign and verify the authenticity of a video or document because they are resilient to numerous security concerns.\nConclusion\n\nDeepfakes are produced by adversarial training (usually using GANs), so by trying to deceive an algorithmic detector and refining the findings, the deep fakes become more convincing.\n\n\ud83d\udc49 Which year are YOU targeting for success in the IAS/IPS/IFS Exam? \ud83d\ude80\n\n(1) \u21d2 UPSC 2025: Prelims cum Mains\n\n(2) \u21d2 UPSC 2026: Prelims cum Mains\n\n(3) \u21d2 UPSC 2027 Prelims cum Mains\n\nTip: Know more about ClearIAS Courses (Online/Offline)\n\nTo lessen the harm posed by malicious deep fakes, cooperative efforts and collective tactics across statutory restrictions, platform policies, technical intervention, and media literacy can offer efficient and moral responses.\n\nArticle Written by: Remya",

For older persons, Alzheimer\u2019s disease is the most typical cause of dementia.\n\nEarlier, researchers had discovered a drug named Lecanemab that\u00a0reduces cognitive\u00a0decline in patients with early Alzheimer\u2019s, making it one of the\u00a0first neuroprotective treatments for the disease.\nA recent study on dementia suggested the early onset of 9 years and the increased risk of multiple medications.\n\nTable of Contents\n\nWhat is Dementia?\nWhat is Alzheimer\u2019s disease?\nCure and treatment for Alzheimer\u2019s disease\nDementia and Alzheimer\u2019s disease in India\nWay forward\nWhat is Dementia?\n\nWhen thinking, memory, and reasoning skills are lost to the point where they interfere with day-to-day tasks, this condition is known as dementia.\n\nSome dementia patients have emotional instability and personality changes.\n\n\ud83d\udc49 Which year are YOU targeting for success in the IAS/IPS/IFS Exam? \ud83d\ude80\n\n(1) \u21d2 UPSC 2025: Prelims cum Mains\n\n(2) \u21d2 UPSC 2026: Prelims cum Mains\n\n(3) \u21d2 UPSC 2027 Prelims cum Mains\n\nTip: Know more about ClearIAS Courses (Online/Offline)\n\nThe intensity of dementia varies from the mildest stage, when it is just starting to interfere with a person\u2019s ability to function, to the most severe level, when the individual must fully rely on others for fundamental daily activities.\n\nAs people age, dementia becomes more prevalent (approximately one-third of all adults over the age of 85 may have some kind of dementia), yet it is not a specific aspect of aging. Many people reach their 90s and beyond without displaying any dementia symptoms.\n\nAlzheimer\u2019s disease is one of several different types of dementia. The type of a person\u2019s symptoms can change.\n\nWhen neurons, or nerve cells, in the brain that were once healthy cease functioning, lose their connections with other brain cells, and eventually die, dementia signs and symptoms develop.\n\nWhile everyone loses some neurons as they become older, dementia patients lose a lot more neurons.\nWhat is Alzheimer\u2019s disease?\n\nThe disease is named after Dr. Alois Alzheimer.\n\nDr. Alzheimer observed alterations in the brain tissue of a woman who had passed away from an uncommon mental disease in 1906.\n\nMemory loss, linguistic difficulties, and unpredictable conduct were some of her symptoms.\nHe examined her brain after she passed away and discovered several aberrant aggregates (now known as amyloid plaques) and twisted fiber bundles (now called neurofibrillary, or tau, tangles).\n\nThese plaques and tangles in the brain are still considered some of the main features of Alzheimer\u2019s disease.\n\nAnother feature is the loss of connections between nerve cells (neurons) in the brain. Neurons transmit messages between different parts of the brain, from the brain to muscles and organs in the body.\n\nMany other complex brain changes are thought to play a role in Alzheimer\u2019s, too.\n\nThis damage initially takes place in parts of the brain involved in memory, including the entorhinal cortex and hippocampus.\nIt later affects areas in the cerebral cortex, such as those responsible for language, reasoning, and social behavior.\nEventually, many other areas of the brain are damaged.\nCure and treatment for Alzheimer\u2019s disease\n\nCurrently, there is no cure for Alzheimer\u2019s disease, though there has been significant progress in recent years in developing and testing new treatments.\n\nOne treatment, aducanumab (Aduhelm\u2122) is the first therapy to demonstrate that removing amyloid, one of the hallmarks of Alzheimer\u2019s disease, from the brain is reasonably likely to reduce the cognitive and functional decline in people living with early Alzheimer\u2019s.\n\nOther treatments can temporarily slow the worsening of dementia symptoms and improve the quality of life for those with Alzheimer\u2019s and their caregivers.\n\nToday, there is a worldwide effort underway to find better ways to treat the disease, delay its onset and prevent it from developing.\n\nA new drug named Lecanemab that\u00a0reduces cognitive\u00a0decline in patients with early Alzheimer\u2019s has been discovered.\n\nIt is one of the\u00a0first neuroprotective treatments for the disease.\nDementia and Alzheimer\u2019s disease in India\n\nIn India, more than 4 million people have some form of dementia.\n\nWorldwide, at least 44 million people are living with dementia, making the disease a global health crisis that must be addressed.\n\nIn India, increasing lifespans and decreasing fertility rates have resulted in a growing number of older persons.\n\nBy 2050, people over 60 years of age are predicted to constitute 19.1% of the total population.\nThis aging of the population is expected to be accompanied by a dramatic increase in the prevalence of dementia.\n\nThe Indian population currently has a very high burden of vascular risk factors, such as diabetes, hypertension, and obesity, which can adversely impact the onset and progression of dementia and eventually Alzheimer\u2019s.\n\nThe following are some major factors that influence dementia prevalence in India:\n\nThe increasing burden of cardiovascular diseases\nRapidly changing demography\nMalnutrition\nRural-urban gap in urbanization\nGenetic diversity\nSocio-economic diversity\nThe stress of fast paced life\nWay forward\n\nOne of the most cost-effective methods to address the problem of dementia in India may be to reduce this vascular risk by implementing suitable public health intervention strategies at midlife or earlier. This is because risk factors for vascular dysfunction are becoming more prevalent in India.\n\nIt is important to distinguish between dementia that develops early (before age 60) and dementia that develops late (after age 60).\n\nSince community-based strategies have more impact than individualized clinic-based strategies, research needs to be focused on translation to public health initiatives.\n\nAlzheimer\u2019s & Related Disorders Society of India (ARDSI) has diligently followed up with the Ministry of Health and Family Welfare since we submitted the Dementia India Strategy Report.\n\nThis was by WHO\u2019s Global Action Plan calling for all countries to develop their dementia plans.\n\nDementia could be included immediately under the District Mental Health Programme as part of the Project Implementation Plan (PIP).\nThe Mission Directors and State Programme Officers of the National Health Mission (NHM) in each state may be advised to include dementia awareness, diagnosis, and care under each of their Project Implementation Plans as a part of targeted intervention.\n\n-Article written by Swathi Satish",

Read the article to know more about the available navigation systems in the world.\n\nYou can use your phone and come back to your place whenever you are stuck somewhere. This magic happens due to the presence of a tiny GPS chip in your phone.\n\nAnywhere on Earth, GPS (Global Positioning System) can offer position and time information.\n\nIs GPS the only navigation satellite system available globally?\n\nTable of Contents\n\nNavigation system\nGlobal Positioning System (GPS)\nGLObal Navigation Satellite System (GLONASS)\nGalileo\nBeiDou\nQuasi-Zenith Satellite System (QZSS)\nIRNSS (NAVIC)\nConclusion\nNavigation system\n\nThe science of navigation involves finding a craft\u2019s position, course, and distance travelled. Concerns about navigation include finding the route to the target location, avoiding crashes, saving fuel, and adhering to schedules.\n\nThe modern navigation is a globally connected transportation system in which each journey is concerned with four fundamental goals:\n\nMaintaining a course\nPreventing crashes\nReducing fuel consumption\nAdhering to a predetermined schedule\n\nThere are totally four Global Navigation Satellite Systems (GNSS) available. They are GPS (US), GLONASS (Russia), Galileo (EU), and BeiDou (China). Additionally, there are two regional systems \u2013 QZSS (Japan) and IRNSS or NavIC (India).\n\n\ud83d\udc49 Which year are YOU targeting for success in the IAS/IPS/IFS Exam? \ud83d\ude80\n\n(1) \u21d2 UPSC 2025: Prelims cum Mains\n\n(2) \u21d2 UPSC 2026: Prelims cum Mains\n\n(3) \u21d2 UPSC 2027 Prelims cum Mains\n\nTip: Know more about ClearIAS Courses (Online/Offline)\n\nGlobal Positioning System (GPS)\n\nNote: Subscribe to the ClearIAS YouTube Channel to learn more.\n\nGPS is the earliest GNSS system in the world. It began operating in 1978 and became accessible to everyone in 1994. The global positioning system (GPS) is a 24-satellite navigation system.\n\nIt uses multiple satellite signals to find a receiver\u2019s position on Earth. The U.S. Department of Defence created GPS (DoD). The technology was initially employed in the military.\n\nSince 1980, when GPS technology was made accessible to the general public, it has been embedded in a variety of products, including automobiles, boats, cell phones, portable electronics, and even personal heads-up display (HUD) goggles.\n\nGPS receivers use data from three or four satellite signals to determine their location. Depending on the number of signals received, the distribution of satellites in the sky, and the technologies utilised in the receiver, GPS technology may operate in practically any environment and has an accuracy range of 3 to 15 metres.\n\nGLObal Navigation Satellite System (GLONASS)\n\nIt is the global navigation satellite system of Russia. The second alternate navigational system in use is GLONASS with global coverage and comparable precision. It\u00a0is run by the Russian Aerospace Defence Forces.\n\nBecause GLONASS can transmit weather broadcasts, communications, navigation, and reconnaissance data, the Soviet Union realised after the Cold War that the system had commercial uses.\n\nThe GLONASS satellite constellation was originally launched in 1982, and it was made completely operational in 1993.\n\nFollowing a time in which GLONASS functionality suffered, Russia pledged to increase the system\u2019s minimum number of operating satellites to 18, as required. 24 satellites are fully deployed in the GLONASS constellation by\u00a0this time.\n\nGalileo\n\nThe European Space Agency is building the Galileo GNSS constellation for the European Union. It is run by the European GNSS Agency. Galileo is a commercially and civilian\u00a0accessible global navigation system. It has had a significant influence, with 26 satellites in orbit and more than two billion receivers in operation.\n\nBeiDou\n\nIt is a satellite navigation system of China. Like any other navigation satellite system, BeiDou is made up of 35 satellites that orbit the Earth and transmit precise data all the time. The signal from the satellite travels from the satellite to the Earth\u2019s ground stations and then to the receiver and vice versa.\n\nQuasi-Zenith Satellite System (QZSS)\n\nIt (also known as Michibiki) is the regional satellite navigation system from Japan. The purpose of QZSS is to deliver GPS-compatible, highly precise and stable location services throughout the Asia-Oceania region.\n\nIRNSS (NAVIC)\n\nThe regional satellite navigation system of India is known as the Indian Regional Navigation Satellite System (IRNSS), which was later given the operational title of NavIC or NAVigation with Indian Constellation. It is launched and operated by Indian Space Research Organisation (ISRO).\n\nNavIC seeks to provide more precise domestic navigation for Indian users. Seven satellites are now used in this navigation system, which is said to cover the entirety of India.\n\nThree of these seven satellites are geostationary satellites which are positioned in lower orbits. Four are geosynchronous satellites that are placed in far higher orbits and less likely to encounter impediments.\n\nFurthermore, the NavIC system includes two frequency bands\u2014L5-band and S-band\u2014making it significantly more accurate than GPS. In its main service region, the \u201cMade in India\u201d navigation system also asserts to provide better position accuracy (more than 20 metres).\n\nRead: Achievements of Indians in Science & Technology;\u00a0Satellite-Based Tolling System\n\nConclusion\n\nWith the projected igniting of a legislative push towards successful development, operation, and maintenance of such systems, India\u2019s satellite-based navigation and augmentation services sector appears destined for a higher growth trajectory.\n\nAdditionally, there is a need to strive toward the gradual evolution of navigation signals and an increase in coverage for better utilisation. The promotion of research and development efforts in the area of satellite navigation-based applications by Indian businesses and academics with a focus on societal benefits is another goal. Additionally, efforts must be made to make Indian satellite navigation and augmentation systems more widely usable.\n\nArticle written by: Krishnapriya JR",

Read here to know all the interesting facts about the universe.\n\nThe Universe includes all that we can see, hear, feel, detect, and measure. It consists of time, light, galaxies, dust clouds, stars, and planets. Matter, space, and time were non-existent before the creation of the universe.\n\nThere are countless millions of galaxies in the universe. There are millions of stars in each of these galaxies.\n\nWe still don\u2019t know how big the universe is, thus we can\u2019t see the edge. There is neither a center nor an edge to the universe.\n\nTable of Contents\n\nIts Origin\nWhat is Space?\nStructure of the Universe\nComposition\nConclusion\nIts Origin\n\nThe universe\u2019s creation is explained by the Big Bang Theory. A massive explosion occurred in the universe when it was only 10-34 of a second old or older, and it caused the universe to expand. Its expansion proceeded more quickly than the speed of light. The size of the universe doubled at least 90 times over this period.\n\nInitial Singularity: The universe began as an infinitely hot and dense singularity, a point with zero volume and infinite energy.\nThis singularity underwent a rapid expansion, often described as an explosion, causing the universe to expand and cool.\nAs the universe expanded and cooled, particles and matter formed. Initially, the universe was composed of elementary particles like protons, neutrons, and electrons.\nAs the universe continued to cool, atoms formed from these particles. This is an important phase because it allows for the formation of stable structures.\nGravity played a crucial role in the formation of galaxies, stars, and other cosmic structures. The gravitational attraction between particles led to the clumping of matter, ultimately forming galaxies and stars.\nThe universe has been expanding since the moment of the Big Bang and continues to do so. This expansion is supported by various observational evidence, including the redshift of galaxies and the cosmic microwave background radiation.\n\nThe light elements were created within the first three minutes after the Big Bang when the Big Bang nucleosynthesis took place. Our solar system was born roughly 9 billion years after the Big Bang. It took seven days to create the universe as we know it today.\n\nHowever, the theory does not address what caused the Big Bang or what, if anything, existed before it. These questions about the origin of the singularity and the nature of the pre-Big Bang state remain open and subject to ongoing scientific exploration and theoretical speculation.\n\n\ud83d\udc49 Which year are YOU targeting for success in the IAS/IPS/IFS Exam? \ud83d\ude80\n\n(1) \u21d2 UPSC 2025: Prelims cum Mains\n\n(2) \u21d2 UPSC 2026: Prelims cum Mains\n\n(3) \u21d2 UPSC 2027 Prelims cum Mains\n\nTip: Know more about ClearIAS Courses (Online/Offline)\n\nWhat is Space?\n\nNobody can hear your screams in outer space. This is because space is a vacuum and devoid of any air. A vacuum cannot be entered by sound waves.\n\nAbout 100 kilometers above the Earth, where the atmosphere that surrounds our planet vanishes, the term \u201couter space\u201d first arises. Space looks to be a black blanket with stars scattered across it because there is no air to reflect sunlight and create a blue sky.\n\nTypically, space is thought of as being empty. However, this is incorrect. Huge amounts of thinly distributed gas and dust occupy the immense spaces between the stars and planets. There are at least a few hundred atoms or molecules per cubic meter in even the most empty areas of space.\n\nAdditionally, other radiation types in space are harmful to astronauts. The Sun is primarily responsible for this infrared and ultraviolet energy. Cosmic rays, gamma rays, and high energy X-rays\u2014particles moving at nearly the speed of light\u2014arrive from far-off star systems.\n\nRelated Topics: Space Internet and Space Weaponization.\n\nStructure of the Universe\n\nThe universe has a hierarchical and interconnected structure that spans from the smallest scales to the largest. It can be described in the following way:\n\nCosmic Web: At the largest scales, the universe appears to have a cosmic web structure, characterized by vast filaments of galaxies separated by voids. This structure is the result of the gravitational interactions of dark matter and dark energy.\nGalaxies: Galaxies are the building blocks of the universe. They come in various shapes and sizes, from spiral galaxies like the Milky Way to elliptical and irregular galaxies. Galaxies contain stars, gas, dust, and dark matter.\nStar Systems: Within galaxies, stars form into systems like our solar system. Stars are the fundamental celestial objects that emit light and heat through nuclear fusion reactions in their cores.\nPlanets and Moons: Planets orbit stars, and some may have moons. Our solar system, for example, consists of the Sun, planets like Earth, and their respective moons.\nAsteroids, Comets, and Other Objects: The universe is also populated with smaller objects like asteroids, comets, and meteoroids, which can impact planets and moons.\nCosmic Dust and Gas: The interstellar medium contains cosmic dust and gas, which provide the raw materials for star formation and planetary systems.\nComposition\n\nAll the energy and matter are present\u00a0in the universe. As the simplest atomic element with simply a proton and an electron, hydrogen makes up a large portion of the universe\u2019s observable matter (if the atom also contains a neutron, it is instead called deuterium).\n\nA molecule is made up of two or more atoms sharing electrons. An aggregate of several trillions of atoms is a dust particle.\nAn asteroid is created by mixing a few tonnes of carbon, silica, oxygen, ice, and a few metals. Or create a Sun-like star by combining 333,000 Earth masses of hydrogen and helium.\n\nIn addition, there appears to be a lot of matter and energy in the universe that we cannot directly observe.\n\nLess than 5% of the universe\u2019s matter is made up of stars, planets, comets, sea otters, black holes, and dung beetles all combined.\nThe remaining substance is made up of around 68 percent dark energy and about 27 percent dark matter, neither of which is even vaguely known.\n\nDark matter and dark energy, which are referred to as \u201cdark\u201d because they are difficult for scientists to directly witness, are necessary for the functioning of the universe as we currently understand it. At least not yet.\n\nOrdinary Matter (Baryonic Matter): This is the matter we are most familiar with and can directly observe. It includes atoms, molecules, planets, stars, and galaxies. Ordinary matter constitutes a relatively small portion of the universe, estimated at around 5% of the total mass-energy content.\nDark Matter: Dark matter is a mysterious and invisible form of matter that does not emit, absorb, or interact with electromagnetic radiation (light). It exerts gravitational forces and is thought to make up about 27% of the universe\u2019s mass-energy content. Its nature is one of the major mysteries in astrophysics.\nDark Energy: Dark energy is an even more mysterious component that makes up about 68% of the universe. It is believed to be responsible for the observed accelerated expansion of the universe. The nature of dark energy is a topic of ongoing research and debate.\nRadiation: Various forms of radiation, such as cosmic microwave background radiation (CMB), X-rays, and gamma rays, exist throughout the universe. They play a crucial role in understanding its history and evolution.\n\nAlso read: Solstice and Equinox; Sun: Structure, Composition and Features\n\nConclusion\n\nThe size of the universe has changed over time. According to scientists, the Big Bang, which occurred almost 14 billion years ago, is where it all started. Since that time, the Universe has been rapidly expanding.\n\nTherefore, compared to when the Universe was extremely young, the amount of space that we can see today is billions of times larger. As the distance between them widens, the galaxies are also getting farther away.\n\nHumans continue to reveal the mysteries of the cosmos thanks to ever-improving technology, knowledge, and creativity. This endeavor is aided by and results in fresh insights and creative ideas.\n\nThere are billions upon billions of other stars in the galaxy, yet we haven\u2019t even sent a space probe to the nearest one yet. Even the planets in our solar system have not been fully discovered by humans. In other words, the majority of the cosmos is yet unknown.\n\nAlso Read: Fast Radio Bursts\n\nArticle written by: Krishnapriya JR",

According to the Annual Status of Education Report (ASER) 2020, smartphone ownership among households with students attending public schools went from 30% in 2018 to 56% in 2020, while it increased from 50% to 74% among those with students attending private schools.\n\nThe Covid-19 pandemic has pushed technological adoption in India\u2019s educational system.\n\nWhat are the advantages of Edtech for India?\n\nStudents who struggled with the strict timelines of the traditional school system can now receive a top-notch education from home.\n\nCandidates for competitive exams, in particular, frequently balance work and education at once.\n\nWith the aid of EdTech, educators can reach a sizable number of pupils. There is no longer a requirement for a physical location where instructors and students can assemble for class sessions.\n\nPeople of all ages can learn at their own pace, without restraints, and without sacrificing their other obligations thanks to online programs and courses that weren\u2019t available when they were younger thereby reducing the age barriers.\n\nGovernment Initiatives for boosting Digital Education\n\nMany initiatives have been undertaken in the last decade to strengthen India\u2019s digital ecosystem, thereby acting as a catalyst for the Edtech sector. Prominent of them are listed below.\n\nDIKSHA\n\nThe government launched DIKSHA (Digital Infrastructure for Knowledge Sharing), a nationwide platform for school education, in 2017 to provide students, instructors, and parents with curriculum-based engaging learning materials. The portal has been adopted by states and UTs and supports more than 18 Indian languages.\n\nPM eVIDYA\n\nIn order to promote and develop digital education in India, the PM eVIDYA program was launched in 2020 to make e-learning more accessible for Indian students and teachers. The scheme will reportedly help 25 crore pupils by bringing together all online and digital education-related activities.\n\nThe program will also include creating original digital content for students who are blind or deaf as well as providing radio/podcasts and QR-coded digital textbooks to students in classes one through twelve via the DIKSHA portal.\n\nThis relaxed the regulatory environment for distance/open/online education, allowing the top 100 universities to start offering online courses, giving 3.7 crores higher education students improved learning opportunities, and enhancing e-learning.\n\nSWAYAM\n\nIn order to provide all citizens, especially those from poor backgrounds, with an integrated platform for online courses at reasonable prices, the government developed Study Webs of Active Learning for Young Aspiring Minds (SWAYAM) in 2017.\nThe portal offers Massive Open Online Courses (MOOCs) to provide students (from Class 9\u201312 through Undergraduates and Postgraduates) with high-quality instruction in a variety of areas.\n\nSWAYAM PRABHA\n\nSWAYAM PRABHA, a collection of 34 DTH (Direct-to-Home) channels that broadcast educational content around-the-clock, was inaugurated in 2017.\n\nEvery day, the channels broadcast novel material for at least four hours, and this is done five times in one day so that students can choose a convenient time.\n\nE-Pathsala\n\nThe e-Pathshala portal was introduced by the government in 2015 as a way to create a resource hub for instructional flipbooks, audiobooks, films, etc.\n\nMobile devices including smartphones, laptops, desktop computers, and tablets can access the portal\u2019s resources, which are available in Indian languages like Hindi, English, and Urdu.\n\nNISHTHA\n\nIn order to create modules for online education, the National Initiative for School Heads and Teachers\u2019 Holistic Advancement (NISHTHA) \u2013 Phase II was introduced at the secondary level in FY21.\n\nAccording to the Union Budget 2021\u201322, in FY22, 5.6 million teachers would receive training through the NISHTHA program.\n\nNational Education Policy 2020\n\nIn addition to the use of technology in education, National Education Policy 2020 emphasizes digitization. Additionally, it emphasizes the use of EdTech to advance education, particularly in rural regions.\n\nThis was done primarily to bring high-quality education to all regions of the nation, particularly the Tier-2 and Tier-3 cities, and villages.\n\nThe National Digital Educational Architecture\n\nThe National Digital Educational Architecture (NDEAR) was established by the Indian government in the Union Budget 2021\u201322 to develop the digital infrastructure and support initiatives pertaining to educational planning.\n\nThe NDEAR seeks to provide a unique educational ecosystem architecture for the progress of the nation\u2019s digital infrastructure and to ensure the autonomy of all stakeholders, particularly states and UTs.\n\nNational Knowledge Network\n\nIn order to connect all knowledge-creating organizations, including IITs, IIMs, universities, research labs, and other e-governance institutions up to the district level, the NKN was built as a high-capacity, low latency network.\n\nIt was intended to promote cooperative learning and the creation of a comprehensive knowledge base.\nThis network is real and working properly.\n\nHowever, due to a lack of knowledge, available resources, finance, and technical know-how, only a few schools fully utilize it.\n\nConclusion\n\nOnline education offers numerous opportunities for both students and teachers, but it may also exacerbate social disparities in India. We must make sure that all of our policies and interventions are inclusive when it comes to online education. India, with its clear vision and honest efforts, will pave the path forward.\n\nSimply having the necessary tools, technology, and broadband connectivity available won\u2019t produce the desired outcomes. The most crucial element is to give professors and students adequate training on how to use online education and to acquaint them with the nuances of the available materials.\n\nIf you\u2019ve read this far, you have all the necessary qualifications to pass the UPSC Civil Services.

Up to 2,000 kilometres are covered by the LEO.\nReduced latency between a user seeking data and the server transmitting that data is the key benefit of placing satellites in LEO for space-based Internet.\nHowever, LEO has a significant drawback. They are less tall, therefore their signals only reach a small region. To send signals to every corner of the world, a lot more satellites are therefore required.\nSpaceX says it can start services on a small scale once 400 satellites join the network.\nOnce operational, space-based Internet networks are expected to change the face of the Internet.\nSignificance of Space Internet\nUninterrupted Internet: To guarantee that Internet services are dependable, unbroken, and capable of providing a wide range of public services to people all over the world that are globally accessible.\nAccess to the Internet: Due to existing methods of distributing the Internet via fibre optics and wireless networks, which cannot convey it everywhere on the earth, around half of the world\u2019s population lacks access to dependable Internet networks.\nGeographical barrier: In many remote areas, or places with difficult terrain, it is not feasible or viable to set up cables or mobile towers.\nIndustrial revolution: The Internet of Things (IoT) may be incorporated into practically any household, whether urban or rural and is predicted to revolutionise services like autonomous vehicle driving.\nHow will placing satellites in lower orbits help?\nOne big advantage of beaming signals from geostationary orbit is that the satellite can cover a very large part of the Earth. Signals from one satellite can cover roughly a third of the planet and three to four satellites would be enough to cover the entire Earth.\nAlso, because they appear to be stationary, it is easier to link to them.\nThese satellites are sent into orbit around 35,800 kilometres above the surface of the earth. They revolve in the same direction as the Earth, and one of these satellites\u2019 revolutions corresponds to one day on Earth (roughly 24 hours).\nSatellites in this orbit, which travel at speeds of about 11,000 km/h, complete one revolution of the planet as it turns once on its axis.\n\nMajor concerns:\n\nAstronomers are concerned that these constellations of space Internet satellites will make it impossible to see other space objects and to identify their signals due to increasing space debris, a higher danger of collisions.\n\nAlso read: Space weaponisation.\n\n\ud83d\udc49 Which year are YOU targeting for success in the IAS/IPS/IFS Exam? \ud83d\ude80\n\n(1) \u21d2 UPSC 2025: Prelims cum Mains\n\n(2) \u21d2 UPSC 2026: Prelims cum Mains\n\n(3) \u21d2 UPSC 2027 Prelims cum Mains\n\nTip: Know more about ClearIAS Courses (Online/Offline)\n\nSpace Internet with Geostationary Satellite\n\nThe following are the features of a Geostationary satellite:\n\nThe orbit is not circular.\nNot in the equatorial plane is the orbit. It is in an inclined orbit directly above the equator.\nThe satellite\u2019s angular velocity is equal to the earth\u2019s angular velocity.\nThe period of revolution is equal to the period of rotation of the earth.\nFinish one revolution around the earth in exactly one day i.e. 23 hours, 56 Minutes and 4.1 seconds.\nAdvantages\nSatellites appear to be stationary, it is easier to link to them.\nSatellites are proven, reliable and secure \u2013 with a lifespan of 10-15 years.\nThe geosynchronous satellites remain stationary over the same orbital location, users can point their satellite dishes in the right direction, without costly tracking activities, making communications reliable and secure.\nDisadvantages\nTime lag: On the Internet, data is transmitted in (almost) real-time. However, there is a delay in sending data from the server to the user known as latency.\nIssue of lower orbits: They are less tall, therefore their signals only reach a small region. To send signals to every region of the earth, a lot more satellites are therefore required.\nGreater latency period: The time lag or latency increases with the increasing distance that must be travelled. Data requests are sent from the user to the satellite, where they are then routed to ground-based data centres, resulting in a lag time of 20 to 30 milliseconds as compared to terrestrial systems.\nSpace Internet with Lower Earth Orbit\nA low Earth orbit (LEO) is an Earth-centered orbit with an eccentricity of less than 0.25 and an altitude of 2,000 km (1,200 mi) or less, or with at least 11.25 times per day (an orbital period of 128 minutes or fewer).\nLEO is high enough to cross all the mountains and also high enough that atmospheric drag won\u2019t bring satellites right back home again.\nIt is important to note that anything below 160 kilometres (99 miles) will lose altitude and experience very rapid orbital decay.\nAdvantages\nLEO is good for human experiments because of its low distance from the Earth.\nIt is convenient for fixing broken or damaged things, inspecting the damage installing new instruments etc.\nLEO is less time and money-consuming. The scientists can do the experiments; fix the problems and return in a short time.\nCommunication and Navigation Satellites in this orbit provide good services at a low cost.\nReduced Latency.\nDisadvantages\nThis orbit has some air pull since it is too close to the Earth. The orbits of objects in this orbit gradually decay over time as they slow down. This enables the object to be drawn towards the earth by the effect of gravity.\nIts signals only cover a relatively narrow area because of its lower height. To send signals to every region of the earth, a lot more satellites are therefore required.\nThere will be an increased risk of light pollution.\nIt will generate more space debris.\n\nArticle Written by: Remya",

    "[CONTENT] #441": "Can you imagine a day without bathing having food or wearing a dress? The materials we use like soaps, sprays, cosmetics, detergents, toothpaste, etc, are composed of several chemicals. Because of how much chemistry has impacted our lives, we are constantly exposed to chemicals without even realizing them. Read here to learn more about chemicals in everyday life.\n\nChemicals govern all of our behaviors, and we are amazing chemical creatures. Humanity has benefited from the usage of chemistry principles.\n\nIllness and disease make us think of medications, which are yet another chemical. Chemicals are used in everything from explosives to fuel to rocket propulsion to building and electronic materials.\n\nLet\u2019s see the various applications of chemicals in everyday life.\n\nRead:\u00a0Click chemistry\n\nTable of Contents\n\nFood\nCleansing Agents\nSoaps\nDetergents\nMedicines and Health Care\nClothing\nTechnology and Entertainment\nConstruction and Home Maintenance\nLet\u2019s see some of the chemicals in everyday life:\nEnvironmental and Health Considerations\nFood\n\nChemicals are the basic building blocks of everything. All food is made of chemical compounds, including carbohydrates, vitamins, fats, proteins, and fiber, all of which are safe and frequently seen as desirable.\n\nChemicals have a significant role in the production and storage of food. Chemicals used in food preservation have greatly benefited in keeping food fresher for longer. Meals can be made better and more filling by using cans of food additives, flavorings, and nutritional supplements.\n\n\ud83d\udc49 Which year are YOU targeting for success in the IAS/IPS/IFS Exam? \ud83d\ude80\n\n(1) \u21d2 UPSC 2025: Prelims cum Mains\n\n(2) \u21d2 UPSC 2026: Prelims cum Mains\n\n(3) \u21d2 UPSC 2027 Prelims cum Mains\n\nTip: Know more about ClearIAS Courses (Online/Offline)\n\nSome examples are as follows:\n\nArtificial Sweetening Agents \u2013 Since sucrose increases calorie consumption, many people choose to use artificial sweeteners instead. Saccharin, also known as ortho-sulphobenzimide, was the first widely used artificial sweetening ingredient. Since it was discovered in 1879, it has been employed as a sweetening agent. It has 550 times the sweetness of cane sugar. It is eliminated from the body unchanged through the urine. When consumed, it seems completely safe and inert. Its use is very beneficial for diabetics and others who must limit their calorie intake. Some other commonly marketed artificial sweeteners are Sucralose, Aspartame, and Alitame.\nFood preservatives \u2013 Food preservation agents stop microbial growth from causing food to spoil. The most often used preservatives are sodium benzoate (C6H5COONa), sugar, vegetable oils, and table salt. In small doses, sodium benzoate is used; it is also metabolised by the body. As preservatives, sorbic acid and propanoic acid salts are also employed.\nAntioxidants \u2013 These stop food from oxidising, which stops food from going bad. For example, butylated hydroxyl anisole and butylated hydroxyl tolerance (BHA).\nCleansing Agents\n\nCleaning agents are things we use to remove dirt, dust, bad odours, stains, and other things from surfaces. These are the substances we employ to lessen surface tension\u00a0so that water can function exactly as intended. Cleaning with just water is ineffective because the surface tension prevents cohesive forces from operating.\n\nSoaps and detergents are two chemicals in everyday life we use frequently.\n\nRelated topics: Agrochemicals\n\nSoaps\n\nThe process of making soap often involves combining a liquid alkali (such as sodium hydroxide) with naturally occurring fats or fatty acids derived from plants and animals. The action is referred to as saponification.\n\nSurfactants, or surface active agents, are present in soaps. They essentially lessen the water\u2019s surface tension. Surfactants enable the water to moisten the surface by attaching to the water molecules at one end. Surfactants attach to oils and dirt at the other end. Overall, they enable the water to clean the surface more effectively.\n\nDetergents\n\nSynthetic detergents are the other category of cleaning agents. These items have all the characteristics of soap, making them exactly like soap. However, they are completely unrelated to soaps chemically and do not contain any soap at all.\n\nDetergents have many advantages over soaps, one of which is their versatility. Both soft and hard water are compatible with them. In hard water, they don\u2019t produce any scum. Some detergents can even function in water that is ice cold.\n\nMedicines and Health Care\nPharmaceuticals: From aspirin (acetylsalicylic acid) to more complex molecules, chemicals in medicines treat, manage, and prevent diseases. The development of these compounds is a critical area of scientific research and has dramatically improved life expectancy and quality of life.\nVaccines: Chemical adjuvants in vaccines enhance the body\u2019s immune response to the vaccine, making them more effective in preventing diseases.\nClothing\nSynthetic Fibers: Chemicals are the building blocks of synthetic fibers like polyester, nylon, and acrylic, which are staples in the fashion industry due to their durability and versatility.\nDyes and Finishes: Chemical dyes give clothes their colors, while other chemical treatments can provide additional properties such as water resistance or reduced wrinkling.\nTechnology and Entertainment\nBatteries: Chemicals in batteries, such as lithium ions in lithium-ion batteries, provide the power for everything from smartphones to electric cars.\nPlastics: Derived from petrochemicals, plastics are found in countless products, including electronics, toys, and household items. While versatile and economical, the environmental impact of plastics is a significant concern.\nConstruction and Home Maintenance\nPaints and Coatings: Chemical compounds in paints and coatings protect surfaces and improve aesthetics. Innovations include low-VOC (volatile organic compounds) paints that reduce harmful emissions.\nInsulation: Chemical-based materials like polystyrene and polyurethane foam are widely used for thermal insulation in buildings.\nLet\u2019s see some of the chemicals in everyday life:\nCommon Name/Product\n\t\nChemical\n\t\nUse/Property of the Chemical\n\n\nFood Preservatives\n\t\nSulphites, Nitrites, Benzoates\n\t\nThese are the chemical classes that are most frequently employed as food preservatives. They prolong the shelf life of grains and food items and prevent the formation of microorganisms.\n\n\nDetergent\n\t\nSodium sulphate, Sodium hydroxide, and Phosphate compounds\n\t\nThese are cleansing surfactants that become active when they are diluted. They are surface-cleaning foaming agents that can combine with water to hold oil and debris.\n\n\nDyes and Cosmetics\n\t\nEsters\n\t\nIt belong to a group of organic substances that react with water to create alcohol and acids (organic or inorganic). These are utilised in medicinal, cosmetic, and colouring products .\n\n\nBaking Powder\n\t\nNaHCO3: Sodium bicarbonate (and one or more weak acid)\n\t\nIt is a leavening or raising agent used in cookery to give baked goods more volume and a lighter texture. An acid-base reaction, causes the batter to generate carbon dioxide.\n\n\nToothpaste\n\t\nCalcium carbonate and Sodium fluoride\n\t\nUsed for cleaning teeth and maintaining oral health.\n\n\nCommon Salt\n\t\nNaCl\n\t\nThe table salt that we use for seasoning and cooking. Additionally, it is an excellent food preservative.\n\n\nSugar\n\t\nC12H22O11\n\t\nSugar is used as a sweetener for edibles.\n\n\nBleach\n\t\nNaOCl\n\t\nUtilised as household bleach for cleaning. It is a powerful anti-microbial and disinfectant. Additionally, it is applied to clothing as a bleaching agent.\n\n\nVinegar\n\t\nC2H4O2: acetic acid, ethanoic acid\n\t\nCommonly used in homes as a seasoning and preservative. For some surfaces, it is also employed as a household cleaning agent.\n\n\nGraphite\n\t\nCarbon\n\t\nIt is an allotrope of carbon that is most widely found as pencil lead. In addition to several additional residential and industrial uses, it is a crucial component of the batteries we use for a variety of functions.\n\n\nAspirin\n\t\nC9H8O4: acetylsalicylic acid\n\t\nAspirin is most frequently used in over-the-counter medications for pain, inflammation, and fever.\n\n\nEpsom salt\n\t\nMgSO\u2084: Magnesium sulfate\n\t\nTo calm the body and ease muscle tension, it is used as a bath salt.\n\n\nHydrogen Peroxide\n\t\nH2O2\n\t\nThere are various industrial uses for hydrogen peroxide. Hydrogen peroxide is a substance that is utilised in personal hygiene products for home usage. Additionally, it is used to bleach hair and treat acne.\n\n.\n\n\n\nToilet Cleaner\n\t\nHCl: Hydrochloric acid\n\t\nIt is a widely popular acid that is used as a cleaning agent, particularly in bathrooms and toilets.\n\n\nCaustic Soda\n\t\nNaOH: Sodium hydroxide\n\t\nSince caustic soda is a very corrosive alkali, it is used to unclog sinks, toilets, and drains.\n\n\nMothballs\n\t\nC6H4C12\n\t\nIt is a chemical that smells strongly stinky. It is used to protect clothing and materials from fabric bugs and clothes moths\n\n\nHand Sanitizer\n\t\nIsopropyl alcohol\n\t\nA chemical that kills germs and bacteria from our hands and saves us from many diseases.\n\n\nInsect Repellent (to be applied on the skin)\n\t\nDiethyltoluamide\n\t\nKeeps us safe from bug bites, most commonly mosquito bites.\n\n\nRodent and Pests Killer\n\t\nArsenic\n\t\nArsenic is a poisonous chemical that is used to wipe off rats, cockroaches, and such pests in our homes.\n\n\nDeodorants / Anti-perspirant\n\t\nAluminum chlorohydrate\n\t\nIt is a substance that is used to regulate sweating and stop body odour.\n\n\nChalk\n\t\nCaCO3\n\t\nUsed for writing on blackboards.\n\n\nMSG\n\t\nC\u2085H\u2088NO\u2084Na: Monosodium glutamate\n\t\nThis name can be seen on the label of any packaged food that is ready to eat or prepare quickly. This substance is intended to improve flavour and leave you wanting more.\nEnvironmental and Health Considerations\n\nWhile chemicals in everyday life are indispensable in modern life, their production, use, and disposal come with environmental and health considerations.\n\nIssues such as pollution, chemical toxicity, and the accumulation of non-biodegradable substances in the environment have prompted increased regulation and a push towards greener alternatives.\nSustainable chemistry and the development of bio-based or less harmful substitutes are growing fields aimed at minimizing the negative impacts of chemicals on health and the environment.\n\nIn conclusion, chemicals are integral to daily life, providing numerous benefits across a wide range of applications. However, their pervasive use also necessitates a careful balance between enjoying their advantages and addressing the environmental and health challenges they pose.\n\nAlso read:\u00a0Spurious liquor: Hooch tragedies in India\n\nArticle written by: Krishnapriya JR",

Read more to find more.\n\nDo you know that drones were initially developed for use by military forces?\n\nBut eventually, the range of drone technology was also expanded, much like many other inventions.\n\nDue to their reach, adaptability, and usability, drones can significantly contribute to the creation of jobs and economic growth, particularly in India\u2019s rural and inaccessible regions.\n\nIndia has the potential to become a worldwide drone hub by 2030 due to its historical strengths in innovation, information technology, cost-effective engineering, and high local demand.\n\nPrior to now, the Ministry of Civil Aviation\u2019s stated drone rules were seen as being difficult because they involved paperwork, bureaucracy, the need for approvals for each drone flight, and the shortage of \u201cfree to fly\u201d green zones.\n\nThe current rules have taken the place of these rules.\n\n\ud83d\udc49 Which year are YOU targeting for success in the IAS/IPS/IFS Exam? \ud83d\ude80\n\n(1) \u21d2 UPSC 2025: Prelims cum Mains\n\n(2) \u21d2 UPSC 2026: Prelims cum Mains\n\n(3) \u21d2 UPSC 2027 Prelims cum Mains\n\nTip: Know more about ClearIAS Courses (Online/Offline)\n\nTable of Contents\n\nWhat standout characteristics do the new drone rules have?\nWhat are the different categories of drones under the new drone rules?\nWhat are the diverse possibilities for drones?\nConclusion\nWhat standout characteristics do the new drone rules have?\n\nThe new rules are based on the principles of self-certification, trust, and nonintrusive monitoring.\n\nNew drone rules, in 2021 abolished several approvals to make this field more inclusive.\n\nThe kinds of approvals which were removed included unique authorization number, unique prototype identification number, certificate of manufacturing and airworthiness, certificate of conformance, certificate of maintenance, etc\n\nA user-friendly single window system called the \u201cDigital Sky Platform\u201d will be created. There will be a very little human interface, and on the digital sky platform, an interactive airspace map with green, yellow, and red zones will be shown.\n\nNo limitations on foreign ownership in Indian drone firms shall exist and the import of drones shall be regulated by the Director General of Foreign Trade.\n\nThe DGCA is tasked with setting drone pilot training standards, supervising drone colleges, and issuing online pilot licenses.\n\nAll individuals who own or possess drones as well as everyone involved in the drone industry as well as all drones used in India must abide by the new regulations.\n\nUnder the new Drone Rules of 2021, these regulations will apply only to drones weighing less than 500 kg. Aircraft Rules, 1937 regulates drones weighing more than 500 kg. Drones operated by the army, navy, and air force are exempt from these regulations.\n\nWhat are the different categories of drones under the new drone rules?\n\nDrones are classified according to their weight including payload as under:\n\nNano drone: Less than 250 gm\nMicro drone: Between 250 gm and 2 kg\nSmall drone: Between 2 kg and 25 kg\nMedium drone: Between 25 kg to 150 kg\nLarge drone: More than 150 kg\nWhat are the diverse possibilities for drones?\n\nIn the Defense sector, drones can be used as weapons of attack, for intelligence collection, and for border management.\n\nDrones can be used in meteorology to collect information about the atmosphere.

Budhayana\n\nSeveral mathematical ideas that were later found by the western world were first introduced by him. He was the one who initially determined Pi\u2019s value.\n\nBudhayan\u2019s Sulva Sutra (Salbasutra), which was published several years before Pythagoras\u2019 time, has an earlier version of what is now known as the Pythagoras theorem.\n\nBudyayana Sutra, which is divided into six portions, was written by him.\n\n3. Mahaviracharya\n\nThe earliest textbook on mathematics in its modern form, Ganit Sara Sangraha, was written by Jain Guru Mahaviracharya in the year 850 AD.\n\nIn Jain literature, mathematics is described in great detail. He also provided a description of the present L.C.M. of numbers method.\n\nIndians were therefore familiar with it long before John Napier made it known to the rest of the world.\n\n4. Nagarjuna\n\nHe was a scientist from the 10th century(Not to be confused with the Buddhist Nagarjuna). His efforts were mostly aimed at alchemizing base materials into gold, much like the western world\u2019s alchemists.\n\nDespite the fact that he did not achieve his objective, he was able to create an element that shone like gold.\n\nIn his work, Rasaratnakara, he covered techniques for obtaining metals like gold, silver, tin, and copper.\n\n5. Susruta\n\nIn regard to surgery, he was a pioneer. Surgery, in his opinion, is \u201cthe highest division of healing art\u201d and is also the least subject to error.\n\nThere are around 1100 ailments mentioned in the Susruta Samhita. There are descriptions of about 760 plants for therapeutic uses.\n\nHe went into great detail on the techniques used to preserve a dead body.\n\nHis greatest accomplishments were in the fields of ocular surgery and rhinoplasty (plastic surgery, particularly of the nose) (removal of cataracts). Additionally, it describes 101 surgical instruments.\n\n6. Bhaskaracharya\n\nHis book Siddhanta Shiromani is well-known. Lilawati (arithmetic), Beejganit (algebra), Goladhyaya (sphere), and Grahaganit (mathematics of planets) are its four divisions.\n\nHe developed the cyclic approach, often known as the Chakrawat method, for solving algebraic equations.\n\nLilavati was translated by Englishman James Taylor in the 19th century, popularising this excellent literature.\n\nThe Bhaskara II satellite, named in honor of the mathematician and astronomer, was launched by the Indian Space Research Organization (ISRO) on November 20th, 1981.\n\n7. Kanada\n\nThe theory of atoms was developed by the ancient Indian naturalist and philosopher Acharya Kanada, also referred to as Kashyapa, 2500 years before John Dalton made his discovery.\n\nHe established the Indian philosophical Vaisheshika school, which embodied the oldest forms of Indian science.\n\nHe proposed an atomistic theory, using reasoning and realism to do so, making his school one of the oldest known systematic realist conceptions in human history.\n\nHe utilized this to explain the creation and existence of the cosmos.\n\n8. Varahamihira\n\nVarahamihira, an Indian mathematician, was born in the first half of the sixth century. Varahamihira, one of Chandragupta II\u2019s nine gems (Navaratnas), was a citizen of Ujjain.\n\nHe wrote the five astronomical treatises referred to as Panchasiddhantaka. Varahamihira made more accurate calculations of the sine tables of Aryabhata.\n\nThanks to his writings like the Pancha Siddhantika (Five Principles), Brihatsamhita (Master Collection), and Brahjataka, he has been elevated to the same level as Kautilya, Manu, and Panini.\n\n9. Aryabhatta\n\nAryabhatta was a fifth-century mathematician, astronomer, astrologer, and physicist. He authored Aryabhattiya, the era\u2019s reference work on mathematics. There are four sections to it.\n\nLater, he also wrote Arya-Siddhanta.\n\nAlso read: CV Raman: The Visionary Scientist\n\nModern- Era\n1. Srinivasa Ramnujam\n\nBorn on December 22, 1887, Srinivasa Ramanujan was a child prodigy and an autodidact. He was unique because of his contributions to mathematics and his aptitude for working through complicated mathematical problems fast.\n\nDespite lacking any formal education or experience in mathematics, he displayed great talent and motivated people all over the world with his self-taught efforts.\n\nEvery year, on December 22, National Mathematics Day is held in honor of Ramanujan.\n\n2. Jagadish Chandra Bose\n\nIn the field of microwaves, he performed pioneering work and he is considered one of the great Indian scientists.\n\nHe invented the use of galena crystals to create receivers for white and ultraviolet light as well as short-wavelength radio waves.\n\nBose demonstrated wireless communication using radio waves in 1895, two years before Marconi\u2019s demonstration, by using them to remotely strike a bell and ignite some gunpowder.\n\nTo find out if plants might feel and respond to stimuli in the same manner that people and other animals do, Jagadish Chandra Bose set out to conduct experiments. Bose developed a brand-new instrument he dubbed a crescograph to discover the solution by spotting exceedingly small motions in plant tissues.\n\nRead:\u00a0Jagadish Chandra Bose\n\n3. C.V Raman\n\nHe made significant contributions to the study of vibration, sound, musical instruments, ultrasonics, diffraction, photo electricity, colloidal particles, x-ray diffraction, magnetrons, and dielectrics, among other things.\n\nHis study on light scattering in particular during this time earned him international acclaim.\n\nHe received the Royal Society of London\u2019s election as a fellow in 1924. He won the Nobel Prize for Physics in 1930 for the Raman Effect. In 1954, he received the Bharat Ratna, the highest honor bestowed by the GOI.\n\nRead:\u00a0Sir CV Raman\n\n4. Subramaniyam Chandrasekhar\n\nThe maximum mass of a white dwarf star, as demonstrated by him, is roughly 1.44 times that of the sun. The \u201cChandrasekhar limit\u201d is what is signified by this. Away from this point, the stars become unstable after this point.\n\nFor his theoretical investigations of the physical processes crucial to the structure and evolution of stars, Chandrasekhar received the physics Nobel Prize in 1983 adding himself to the list of great Indian Scientists.\n\n5. Satyendra Nath Bose\n\nHis area of expertise was mathematical physics as a physicist.\n\nBose published a study in 1924 that used a revolutionary method of counting states with identical particles to derive Planck\u2019s quantum radiation equation while he was a reader at the University of Dhaka.\n\nBose\u2019s conclusion contributes to the development of quantum statistics.\n\nThis led to the prediction of the presence of the dense boson collection known as the Bose-Einstein condensate, a form of matter. Bose-Einstein condensate was proven to exist in an experiment in 1995 making him one of the prominent figures among Indian Scientists.\n\n6. Meghnad Saha\n\nHe was an Indian astrophysicist best known for creating the Saha education system, which was used to describe the chemical and physical properties of stars.\n\nThe oldest research institute in India, the Indian Association for the Cultivation of Sciences (IACS), appointed him as its first director. He founded the nuclear physics institute in 1947, which was eventually renamed the Saha Institute in his honor.\n\nSaha\u2019s equation was used to describe how stars are categorized according to their spectral types.\n\n7. Prasanta Chandra Mahalanobis\n\nHe was a statistician and one of the great Indian scientists of the Modern era. His most famous contribution to science is the Mahalanobis distance.\n\nHe conducted groundbreaking anthropometry research in India.\n\nHe contributed to the creation of large-scale sample surveys and formed the Indian Statistical Institute.\n\n8. Har Govind Khorana\n\nMarshall Nirenberg, Robert Holley, and Khorana shared the 1968 Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine for deciphering the genetic code.\n\nThe biological language that all living things share was found to be written in three-letter words, with each set of three nucleotides standing for a distinct amino acid.\n\nIn addition, Dr. Khorana was the first to create oligonucleotides, which are long strings of nucleotides. Oligonucleotides are now essential tools for biotechnology and are frequently employed in biology labs for genetic engineering, cloning, and sequencing.\n\n9. Sir Mokshagundam Visvesvaraya\n\nHe is credited for developing the block irrigation system and the \u201cautomated sluice gates,\u201d both of which are now regarded as engineering marvels.\n\nBecause of this, India celebrates Engineer\u2019s Day on September 15, the day of his birth. He received the Bharat Ratna, the highest honor bestowed by the Republic of India.\n\nBecause he thinks that industry may help India develop, Sir M V pushed India to endeavor to catch up to industrialized nations.\n\nSir Mokshagundam Visvesvaraya, a well-known Indian engineer, philosopher, and statesman, served as the Diwan of Mysore from 1912 until 1918.\n\n10. A.P.J Abdul Kalam\n\nIndian scientist Avul Pakir Jainulabdeen Abdul Kalam, who worked for DRDO and ISRO, was born on October 15, 1931.\n\nAs the director of the first Indian satellite launch vehicle (SLV-III), which successfully placed the Rohini satellite into low-Earth orbit in July 1980, Kalam joined the ISRO in 1969.\n\nHe served as India\u2019s 11th President from 2002 until 2007. He has received various awards, including the prestigious Bharat Ratna in India.\n\n11. Homi J Bhabha\n\nOn October 30, 1909, in Bombay, Homi Jehangir Bhabha was born. The Indian nuclear programme was founded by him. His contributions to the fields of cosmic radiation and quantum theory will never be forgotten.\n\nHe held the chairmanship of the Atomic Energy Commission as the first Indian to do so.\n\nBhabha is widely considered India\u2019s founding father of nuclear power. Few people are aware that he vehemently opposed India\u2019s ability to produce atomic bombs, even if it were possible.\n\nInstead, he suggested using an atomic reactor to lessen India\u2019s poverty and suffering.\n\nHe perished on January 24, 1966, when Air India Flight 101 went down close to Mont Blanc.\n\nThe quantum physics term \u201cBhabha scattering\u201d was given to the cross-section of electron-positron scattering in his honor.\n\nClick here to read more about India\u2019s Achievements in Science and Technology and Indian Scientists\n\nArticle Written by: Jis John Sebastian",

It is part of NASA\u2019s \u201cLiving with a Star\u201d program that explores different aspects of the Sun-Earth system.\n\nNASA said the probe will \u201crevolutionize our understanding of the Sun\u201d by gathering data on the Sun\u2019s atmosphere. It is also the closest a manmade object has ever come to the Sun.\n\nAlso read: Eclipse: Solar vs Lunar \u2013 Explained\n\nKey Features of Parker Solar Probe:\nNASA\u2019s historic Parker Solar Probe mission will transform our understanding of the sun, where altering conditions can spread throughout the solar system, influencing Earth and other planets.\nThe Parker Solar Probe mission\u2019s principal scientific goals are to investigate how energy and heat move across the solar corona, as well as what accelerates the solar wind and solar energetic particles.\nParker Solar Probe will journey through the sun\u2019s atmosphere, closer to the surface than any previous spacecraft, enduring extreme heat and radiation \u2014 and eventually delivering humanity with the closest-ever observations of a star.\nParker Solar Probe will use Venus\u2019 gravity during seven flybys over roughly seven years to progressively push its orbit closer to the sun to unravel the mysteries of the sun\u2019s atmosphere. The spacecraft will fly through the sun\u2019s atmosphere as close to 3.9 million miles from our star\u2019s surface as possible, well within Mercury\u2019s orbit and more than seven times closer than any previous probe.\nThe spacecraft and equipment will be shielded from the Sun\u2019s heat by a 4.5-inch-thick (11.43-cm) carbon-composite shield, which will have to survive temperatures outside the spacecraft of about 2,500 degrees Fahrenheit (1,377 degrees Celsius).\nParker Solar Probe: Aim\nTo trace how energy and heat move through the solar corona.\nTo explore what accelerates the solar wind and solar energetic particles.\nDetermine the structure and dynamics of magnetic fields at solar wind sources.\nExplore the role of dusty plasma near the Sun in the generation of solar wind and energetic particles.\nWhy study corona?\nThe corona is hotter than the sun\u2019s surface. The corona generates solar wind, which is a continuous flow of charged particles that pervades the solar system.\nUnpredictable solar winds disrupt our planet\u2019s magnetic field and potentially disrupt Earth\u2019s communications systems.\nNASA expects that the discoveries will help scientists predict changes in the Earth\u2019s space environment.\nImportance of the Study\nAs a dynamic and magnetically active star, the Sun is significantly more complex than meets the eye.\n\u00a0The Sun\u2019s atmosphere constantly sends forth magnetized material, encircling the Solar System far beyond Pluto\u2019s orbit and impacting every country along the way.\nThe corona generates solar wind, which is a continuous flow of charged particles that pervades the solar system.\nUnpredictable solar winds cause disturbances in our planet\u2019s magnetic field and can play havoc with communications technology on the earth.\nThe probe\u2019s results will allow scientists to foresee changes in the Earth\u2019s space environment.\nWhat part of this mission will \u2018touch\u2019 the Sun?\n\nThe Solar Probe Cup, often known as \u201cthe bravest little instrument,\u201d is a sensor that will reach beyond the heat shield to collect samples of the Sun\u2019s atmosphere.\nWhen the probe makes its closest approach to the sun, sampling the solar wind and effectively touching the sun, the cup will glow red.\n\nSignificance: Parker Solar Probe\n\n\u00a0The Sun is the only star we can study closely. By studying this star we live with, we learn more about stars throughout the universe.\nThe Sun provides light and heat to all living things on Earth. The more we learn about it, the more we can grasp how life evolved on Earth.\nThe Sun also has less obvious effects on Earth. It is the source of the solar wind, which is a flow of ionized gases from the Sun that travels past the Earth at more than 500 kilometers per second (a million miles per hour).\nSolar wind disturbances jolt Earth\u2019s magnetic field and push energy into the radiation belts, as part of a broader series of changes in near-Earth space known as space weather.\nSpace weather can alter satellite orbits, decrease their lifespan, and interfere with onboard electronics. The more we understand what causes space weather and how to predict it, the better we can safeguard the satellites on which we rely.\nThe solar wind also occupies a large portion of the solar system, dominating the space environment far beyond Earth. As we move spacecraft and personnel further from home, we must comprehend the space environment in the same way that early sailors needed to understand the ocean.\nIndia\u2019s similar project\n\nIndia belongs to the select group of countries that have developed indigenous space technology. Aditya L1 is India\u2019s first solar mission.\n\nAditya L1\nThe Aditya mission is envisioned as a 400kg spacecraft carrying one payload, the Visible Emission Line Coronagraph (VELC), and is scheduled to launch in an 800 km low earth orbit to research the solar corona.\nIt will be created in partnership with the Indian Space Scientific Organization (ISRO) and numerous Indian research institutes and will be launched by ISRO sometime between 2019 and 2020.\nObjectives: It will investigate the sun\u2019s outermost layers, the corona, and the chromospheres, as well as collect data on coronal mass ejection, which will help anticipate space weather.\nSignificance of the mission: The Aditya mission data will be extremely useful in distinguishing between competing hypotheses for the origin of solar storms, as well as restricting how the storms evolve and what course they travel across interplanetary space from the Sun to the Earth.\nPosition of the satellite: To acquire the finest research from the sun, continuous observation without occultation/eclipse is preferable, hence the Aditya-L1 satellite will be put in the halo orbit around the sun-earth system\u2019s Lagrangian point 1 (L1).\nStructure of Sun\nThe solar interior, from the inside out, is made up of the core, radiative zone, and convective zone.\nThe solar atmosphere above that consists of the photosphere, chromosphere, and corona.\nBeyond that is the solar wind, an outflow of gas from the corona.\n\nPhotosphere: The photosphere is the bright outer layer of the Sun that emits most of the radiation. The photosphere is an extremely uneven surface. The effective temperature on the outer side of the photosphere is 6000\u00b0K (11,000\u00b0F).\n\nChromosphere: Just above the photosphere is the chromosphere. It is a relatively thin layer of burning gases.\n\nSunspot: A dark patch on the surface of the Sun is known as a sunspot. Sunspots look like dark regions because they are around 1500\u00b0 colder than the chromospheres around them. The individual sunspot has a lifetime ranging from a few days to a few months. Each spot has a black centre, known as the umbra, and a brighter zone, known as the penumbra, surrounding it. It has been proposed that the Sun is 1% cooler when there is no spot and that this change in solar energy may alter Earth\u2019s temperatures.\n\nSolar Wind: Stream of energetic, charged particles, principally electrons, and protons, erupting from the Sun at speeds of up to 900 km/s and temperatures of one million degrees (Celsius). It is made of plasma.\n\nSolar flares: Produced due to magnetic anomalies. A magnetic storm on the Sun appears as a bright spot, as well as a gaseous surface eruption. Solar flares are explosions caused by high magnetic fields in sunspot-producing active areas.\u00a0 As solar flares pass through the corona, they heat its gas to temperatures ranging from 10 to 20 million degrees Celsius.\n\nCorona: A corona is the characteristic plasma atmosphere that surrounds the Sun and other celestial bodies. The corona of the Sun stretches millions of kilometers into space and is most visible during a total solar eclipse.\n\nLagrangian Points\n\nThe gravitational forces and orbital motion of the spacecraft, Sun, and planets interact at five additional areas around a planet\u2019s orbit, creating a stable location for observations.\nThese points are known as Lagrangian or \u2018L\u2019 points, after the 18th-century Italian astronomer and mathematician Joseph-Louis Lagrange (born Giuseppe Luigi Lagrancia).\nIt is the point at which the Sun\u2019s and Earth\u2019s attractions become equal. This point is not subject to gravitational attraction.\nA satellite at this point would not get deflected but the data captured will be accurate.\n\u25cb L-1: The first point L1 lies between Earth and the Sun at about 1 million miles from Earth.\n\u25cb L-2: It also lies a million miles from Earth but in the opposite direction of the Sun. With the Earth, Moon, and Sun behind it, at this point, the spacecraft can get a clear view of deep space.\n\u25cb L-3: L3 lies behind the Sun, opposite Earth\u2019s orbit.\n\u25cb L-4 & L-5: These stable points lie along Earth\u2019s orbit at 60 degrees ahead of and behind Earth, forming the apex of two equilateral triangles that have large masses as their vertices.\n\nFor detailed information about the Sun read: Sun: Structure, Composition, and Features\n\nHow does the corona cause solar winds?\n\nThe corona reaches far into space. It is responsible for the solar wind that passes through our solar system. The warmth of the corona causes its particles to move at breakneck speed. These speeds are so great that the particles can escape the gravity of the Sun.\n\nMany NASA missions have continued to focus on this complex space environment defined by our star \u2014 a field of research known as heliophysics.\n\nParker Solar Probe is going to answer questions about solar physics that we have puzzled over for more than six decades.\n\nUPSC Previous Year Questions\n\nQues 1: Consider the following statements regarding NASA\u2019s Mars 2020 Mission:\n\nThe space shit will land on Jezero Crater.\nIt also carries a Mars Helicopter to test whether the helicopter can fly in the sparse atmosphere on Mars.\n\nWhich of the following statements is/are correct?\n\n(a) 1 only\n\n(b) 2 only\n\n(c) Both 1 and 2\n\n(d) Neither 1 nor 2\n\nAns: c\n\nQues 2: Consider the following statements regarding NASA\u2019s Mars 2020 Mission:\n\nThe space shit will land on Jezero Crater.\nIt also carries a Mars Helicopter to test whether the helicopter can fly in the sparse atmosphere on Mars.\n\nWhich of the following statements is/are correct?\n\n(a) 1 only\n\n(b) 2 only\n\n(c) Both 1 and 2\n\n(d) Neither 1 nor 2\n\nAns: c\n\nTo know more about Achievements of Indians in Science & Technology click here.\n\nArticle Written by: Remya",

To learn more, read the article.\n\nComputer technology has done it\u2019s major contributions in the world for the enhancement of the quality of communication. It also helps in reducing the mortality rate as it aids in providing various health services. Moreover, computers have taken over different jobs, making human skills obsolete.\n\nIt has become a necessity for almost every sector in our society to make use of computers for their operations as the usage of computers has increased. It made working and sorting out things easier.\n\nTable of Contents\n\nGeneration of computer:\nFirst Generation Computers (1940-1956)\nSecond Generation Computers (1956 \u2013 1963)\nThird Generation Computers (1964 \u2013 1971)\nFourth Generation Computers (1971 \u2013 Present)\nFifth Generation Computers (Present and Beyond)\nWhat is a Super Computer?\nSuper Computers in India\nWhat is Cloud Computing?\nConclusion\nGeneration of computer:\n\nThe first computers appeared somewhere in the sixteenth century. The original computers experienced numerous modifications and advancements that led to the stylish modern computers we see today. Its size, price, precision, and speed have all increased over time. It was time-consuming. As a result, it has been separated into successive stages known as \u201ccomputer generations.\u201d\n\nThe different types of generation of computers are:\n\nFirst Generation Computers (1940-1956)\n\nThese computers were very heavy and really large in size. They occupy a full room and consume a lot of electricity. They do not use an OS. As they use high-level programming languages, it was a difficult task to do programming on them. A fragile glass device called a vacuum tube is used as the technology behind it. They are used for calculation, storage, and control purposes.\n\n\ud83d\udc49 Which year are YOU targeting for success in the IAS/IPS/IFS Exam? \ud83d\ude80\n\n(1) \u21d2 UPSC 2025: Prelims cum Mains\n\n(2) \u21d2 UPSC 2026: Prelims cum Mains\n\n(3) \u21d2 UPSC 2027 Prelims cum Mains\n\nTip: Know more about ClearIAS Courses (Online/Offline)\n\nImportant first-generation computers are ENIAC, EVAC, UNIVAC, etc.\n\nSecond Generation Computers (1956 \u2013 1963)\n\nInstead of bulky vacuum tubes, transistor technology is used in second-generation computers. The use of transistors makes it perform better than the first. It is much smaller in size and requires a lesser amount of energy compared to the first generation.\nExamples include: IBM 1920, IBM 7094, CDC 3600, etc.\n\nThird Generation Computers (1964 \u2013 1971)\n\nHere use of transistors can be taken the place of Integrated Circuit. This makes the computers to work with more efficiency and reliability. Size also reduced.\n\nExamples includes \u2013 CDC 1700, IBM \u2013 360 Series.\n\nFourth Generation Computers (1971 \u2013 Present)\n\nVery Large Scale Integrated (VLSI) Circuits, or simply microprocessors, are used in this generation. A microprocessor chip is made up of thousands of integrated circuits built on a single silicon chip. In this generation, the use of personal computers (PCs) has increased.\n\nExamples include: Apple, CRAY-1, etc.\n\nFifth Generation Computers (Present and Beyond)\n\nIt is based on artificial intelligence (AI). AI helps in describing the medium and the way of making computers like humans, like how humans think and how humans act, etc. Research work is carried out in this area, and it is an emerging branch.\n\nExamples include PARAM 10000, IBM notebooks, etc.\n\nWhat is a Super Computer?\n\nIt is based on artificial intelligence (AI). AI helps in describing the medium and the way of making computers like humans, like how humans think and how humans act, etc. Research work is carried out in this area, and it is an emerging branch.\n\nExamples include PARAM 10000, IBM notebooks, etc.\n\nSupercomputing facilitates data analysis and problem-solving, which would otherwise be expensive and time-consuming. Additionally, since supercomputers can handle the workloads needed for AI applications, they frequently run artificial intelligence (AI) programmes.\n\nA supercomputer\u2018s processing speed is measured in PETAFLOPs, which is one trillion floating point operations per second.\nFLOPS (floating point operations per second) are frequently used to gauge a computer\u2019s processor\u2019s performance. Extremely lengthy numbers can be handled rather easily with floating-point encoding.\n\nSuper Computers in India\n\nIn 1980, the Indian government established an indigenous development programme in response to the difficulties in obtaining supercomputers from abroad. The \u201cPARAM\u201d series of supercomputers were made available by the Centre for Development of Advanced Computing (C-DAC) mission. It wasn\u2019t until 2015 that the National Super Computing Mission was launched and the Indian supercomputers were given a boost. A seven-year, Rs. 4,500 crore scheme to install 73 indigenous supercomputers by 2022 was launched by NSM.\n\nThe fastest supercomputer in India as of November 2020 is PARAM Siddhi-AI, which ranks 63rd on the TOP500 list.\n\nThe PARAM 8000 was the first supercomputer in India.\n\nPARAM Padma \u2013 The first Indian supercomputer to enter the Top500 list of supercomputers in the world.\n\nThe supercomputers under the National Super Computing Mission were: PARAM Brahma, PARAM Shivay, PARAM Sanganak, and PARAM Pravega.\n\nWhat is Cloud Computing?\n\nDifferent services are delivered via the Internet through cloud computing. These tools and programmes comprise software, servers, databases, networking, and data storage, among other things.\n\nFor a variety of reasons, including cost savings, enhanced productivity, speed and efficiency, performance, and security, cloud computing is a popular choice for both individuals and corporations. Files can be saved to a distant database and then quickly retrieved using cloud-based storage.\n\nLike a chip or a phone, cloud computing is not a standalone piece of technology. Instead, it is a system made up largely of three services: platform-as-a-service (PaaS), infrastructure-as-a-service (IaaS), and software-as-a-service (SaaS).\n\nThe Government of India has launched an ambitious project called \u201cGI Cloud,\u201d also known as \u201cMeghRaj,\u201d in order to utilise and reap the benefits of cloud computing. To enable the widespread use of the cloud in government, this effort will put in place a number of different elements, including governance procedures. The goal of this programme is to maximise government ICT spending while accelerating the delivery of e-services in the nation.\n\nConclusion\n\nNumerous adjustments are required in all areas of life and work due to the rapid advancement of science and technology. A computer has entered every element of life, including economics, education, entertainment, and family.\n\nIn particular, computer technology is crucial to administrative procedures and is frequently used to monitor population growth and gather census information on a nation\u2019s residents. Instead of using conventional filing cabinets, secure computer systems are used to store data on members of a community since they save space and make it possible to process the data quickly for a variety of special needs.\n\nArticle written by: Krishnapriya JR",

Do you know what is a solution?\n\nA solution is a homogeneous mixture of two or more substances in chemistry.\n\nA solute in such a mixture is a substance that has been dissolved in another substance known as a solvent.\n\nIn sugarwater, for example, sugar is the solute and water is the solvent.\n\nNow let us understand what is Diffusion.\n\nDiffusion is the natural movement of a substance from a high-concentration area to a low-concentration area.\n\n\ud83d\udc49 Which year are YOU targeting for success in the IAS/IPS/IFS Exam? \ud83d\ude80\n\n(1) \u21d2 UPSC 2025: Prelims cum Mains\n\n(2) \u21d2 UPSC 2026: Prelims cum Mains\n\n(3) \u21d2 UPSC 2027 Prelims cum Mains\n\nTip: Know more about ClearIAS Courses (Online/Offline)\n\nDiffusion of a substance (solute) through a permeable membrane transports it from a region of high solute concentration (hypertonic solution) to a region of low concentration (hypotonic solution).\n\nDiffusion is important in the gaseous exchange between cells as well as between the cell and its external environment in living organisms.\n\nDiffusion can be seen in the exchange of O2 and CO2 in alveoli (millions of tiny, balloon-shaped air sacs in the lungs).\n\nNow let us expand our zone of learning.\n\nTable of Contents\n\nOsmosis\nReverse Osmosis\nWhat are the applications of Reverse Osmosis?\nWhat are the threats associated with RO purifiers?\nConclusion\nOsmosis\n\nWater is a substance that follows the law of diffusion.\n\nOsmosis is the passage of water (diffusion of solvent molecules) through a semi-permeable membrane from a low solute concentration (hypotonic) region to a high solute concentration region (hypertonic).\n\nSemi-permeable membranes allow small molecules and ions to pass through but act as a barrier to larger molecules or dissolved substances.\n\nAs a result, osmosis is a subset of diffusion through a selectively permeable membrane. Most unicellular freshwater organisms and plant cells obtain water via osmosis.\n\nWater absorption by plant roots is another example of osmosis.\n\nReverse Osmosis\n\nReverse osmosis (RO) is a water purification technology that removes larger particles from drinking water using a semipermeable membrane.\n\nIn reverse osmosis, an applied pressure is used to overcome osmotic pressure, allowing pure water to flow from a region of high solute concentration (hypertonic) to a region of low solute concentration\u00a0 (hypotonic).\n\nRead more on topics related to Science and Technology here.\n\nWhat are the applications of Reverse Osmosis?\n\nRO was originally developed in the late 1950s to desalinate seawater. Currently, a diverse array of membranes and multiple stages of filters can be used to filter a wide range of solutes, including arsenic, fluoride, hexavalent chromium, nitrates, and bacteria.\n\nThis has given rise to a cottage industry of home-RO systems for drinking water. RO uses a pump and electric motors to generate external pressure.\n\nIt makes use of \u201cactivated carbon\u201d components like charcoal and carbon black to filter out contaminants as well as organic substances like bacteria (UV light is also used to kill bacteria).\n\nIt all depends on the filtering material and the number of filters that must be passed through before incoming tap water can be used.\n\nWhat are the threats associated with RO purifiers?\n\nReverse Osmosis systems waste a lot of water by forcing tap water through multiple stages of cleaning.\n\nThey waste three to five times the amount of water (high carbon footprint). The Reverse Osmosis system removes essential micronutrients such as calcium, zinc, and magnesium.\n\nDrinking such water over time may be hazardous. Many manufacturers, however, claim to have overcome this challenge through \u201cpost-treatment\u201d (added minerals).\n\nThe Reverse Osmosis system only reduces Total Dissolved Solids and ensures that the water is odorless and has a pH between 6.5 and 8.5. According to the National Institute of Virology (NIV), most RO methods do not eliminate the Hepatitis E virus.\n\nRO systems diminish the incentive for government-funded water distribution systems, and the vast majority of the country cannot afford such systems.\n\nThe deposition of brine (highly concentrated salt water) along the shores of seawater desalination affects plankton, which is the primary food source for small fish species.\n\nConclusion\n\nThe ban was imposed by the National Green Tribunal on the grounds that RO filters frequently deprived drinking water of essential salts (thus compromising nutritional security) while also wasting a lot of water and power.\n\nCurrent BIS regulations accept 500 mg/litre to 1,200 mg/litre of total dissolved solids, which include salts and some organic matter.\n\nThe Ministry of Environment and Forests had issued a draught notification that seeks to regulate membrane-based RO water filtration systems in areas where the source of water meets Bureau of Indian Standards drinking water norms.\n\nArticle written by: Jis John Sebastian",

The plan was designed to utilize the country\u2019s extensive thorium reserves efficiently. \u00a0\n\nUnlike many countries that have abundant uranium reserves, India\u2019s limited uranium resources prompted the development of a unique, thorium-based nuclear fuel cycle strategy.

A three-stage nuclear power program, based on a closed nuclear fuel cycle, was then chalked out\n\nThe three stages are:\n\n\ud83d\udc49 Which year are YOU targeting for success in the IAS/IPS/IFS Exam? \ud83d\ude80\n\n(1) \u21d2 UPSC 2025: Prelims cum Mains\n\n(2) \u21d2 UPSC 2026: Prelims cum Mains\n\n(3) \u21d2 UPSC 2027 Prelims cum Mains\n\nTip: Know more about ClearIAS Courses (Online/Offline)\n\nNatural uranium-fuelled Pressurised Heavy Water Reactors (PHWRs),\nFast Breeder Reactors (FBRs) utilizing plutonium-based fuel,\nAdvanced nuclear power systems for utilization of thorium.\nStage 1: Pressurised Heavy Water Reactors\nThe first stage involves using natural uranium to fuel PHWR to produce electricity and producing Plutonium-239 as a by-product.\nKindly note here that the PHWRs were chosen for the first stage because, in the 1960s, India had an efficient reactor design in terms of uranium utilization.\nIt was calculated that rather than going for the creation of Uranium Enrichment Facilities, it would be wiser to create heavy water production.\nMoreover, using Pressurized Heavy Water Reactors rather than Light Water Reactors was also a correct and wise decision. While Pressurized Heavy Water Reactors used unenriched uranium, Light Water Reactors required enriched uranium. Further, India could domestically produce the components of PWHR, as opposed to LWRs.\nFurthermore, the by-product plutonium-239 would be used in the second stage. First Stage: Following Reactors\nBoiling Water Reactor\nPressurized Heavy Water Reactor\nPressurized Water Reactor\nStage 2: Fast Breeder Reactors\nThe second stage involves using plutonium-239 to produce mixed-oxide fuel, which would be used in Fast Breeder Reactors. Plutonium 239 undergoes fission to produce energy and metal oxide is reacted with enriched uranium reacts with mixed-oxide fuel to produce more plutonium-239.\nFurthermore, once a sufficient amount of plutonium-239 is built up, thorium will be used in the reactor, to produce Uranium-233. This uranium is crucial for the third stage.\n\nFast Breeder Reactor:\n\nFirst at Kalpakkam in TN\nUses Pu-239 as fuel and u-238 is converted into Pu-239\nAlso known as the Fast Neutron Reactor\nNo moderator\nCoolant is liquid Na\nStage 3: Advanced Heavy Water Reactors\nThe main purpose of stage 3 is to achieve a sustainable nuclear fuel cycle. The advanced nuclear system would be used as a combination of Uranium-233 and Thorium. Thus, India\u2019s vast thorium would be exploited, using a thermal breeder reactor.\nThorium use was reserved for the last stage because despite having significant availability, the use of Thorium in the production of energy has been full of certain challenges. It cannot be used directly.\nSince it is a fertile material, it can be only used with added fissile material that can be enriched with Uranium, Plutonium, or Uranium-233 (obtained after irradiation of Thorium).\nThorium absorbs neutrons, which can more efficiently produce more Plutonium in a Fast Breeder Reactor for faster growth.\nTherefore, using Thorium in the first, or an early part of the second stage of the nuclear power program will adversely affect the rate of growth of nuclear power generation capacity in the initial periods.\nDue to these reasons, large-scale deployment of Thorium was postponed until the later part of the second stage. Thorium is to be introduced only at an optimal point during the operation of Fast Breeder Reactors in the second stage.\nThorium, for power generation, is to be used mainly in the third stage.\nGoals of\u00a0 The Third Stage\n\nTechnologies about the utilization of thorium have been under development, mainly at BARC, right since the inception of our nuclear power program. The third stage of our program has to necessarily meet the following goals:\n\nUtilization of thorium as fuel on a commercial scale.\nLarge-scale deployment of nuclear power in the country.\nAchieving good economic performance as compared to alternate options for energy generation.\nAttaining higher levels of transparent safety, through optimal utilization of inherent and passive safety features.\nUtilizing the proliferation-resistant potential of the thorium fuel cycle to the full extent.\nProviding adaptability to non-electrical applications, in particular, desalination and high-temperature processing applications, including those for the generation of non-fossil fluid fuels.\nRecent Developments\n\n2024: The commencement of \u201cCore Loading\u201d at India\u2019s first indigenous Fast Breeder Reactor (500 MWe) at Kalpakkam, Tamil Nadu marked the entry into the vital second stage of India\u2019s three-stage nuclear program.\n\nThe government had approved in 2003, the creation of Bhartiya Nabhikiya Vidyut Nigam Ltd (BHAVINI) to construct and operate India\u2019s most advanced nuclear reactor-Prototype Fast Breeder Reactor (PFBR).\n\nThe Fast Breeder Reactor (FBR) will initially use the Uranium-Plutonium Mixed Oxide (MOX) fuel.\n\nThe Uranium-238 \u201cblanket\u201d surrounding the fuel core will undergo nuclear transmutation to produce more fuel, thus earning the name \u2018Breeder\u2019.\nThe use of Throium-232, which in itself is not a fissile material, as a blanket is also envisaged in this stage.\nThorium will create fissile Uranium-233 which will be used as fuel in the third stage.\nFBR is thus a stepping stone for the third stage of the program paving the way for the eventual full utilization of India\u2019s abundant thorium reserves.\n\nIn terms of safety, the PFBR is an advanced third-generation reactor with inherent passive safety features ensuring a prompt and safe shutdown of the plant in the event of an emergency.\u00a0 Since it uses the spent fuel from the first stage, FBR also offers a great advantage in terms of a significant reduction in nuclear waste generated, thereby avoiding the need for large geological disposal facilities.\n\nUpon completion of the core loading, the first approach to criticality will be achieved, leading to the generation of power subsequently.\n\nConclusion\n\nFor a large country like India, long-term energy security, mainly based on indigenous resources, is an important and inevitable need, from economic as well as strategic considerations. Nuclear energy plays a vital role in this regard.\n\nThe growth of the Indian three-stage nuclear program is imperative to meet the twin goals of energy security and sustainable development. As a responsible nuclear power with advanced technology, India remains committed to expanding peaceful applications of nuclear technology, both in the power and non-power sectors, while ensuring the security of nuclear and radiological materials.\n\nRead:\u00a0Nuclear waste\n\nArticle written by: Vivek Rajasekharan",

The growth of genomics, biotechnology and other molecular research technologies, along with the growth of information technology, paved the way for this new field of study, Bioinformatics.\n\nThe two Dutch biologists Ben Hesper and Paulien Hogeweg originally used the word \u201cbioinformatics\u201d in 1960. Their studies and discoveries led to the definition of bioinformatics as the study of information processes in biotic systems.\n\nNeed a scientific and authoritative definition?\n\nAccording to the NCBI- National Center for Biotechnology Information, Bioinformatics is defined as the analysis, collection, classification, manipulation, recovery, storage and visualization of all biological information using computation technology.\n\nHow does Bioinformatics work?\n\nIt is an interdisciplinary field of research that creates strategies and computer programmes to comprehend biological data .It analyses and interprets biological data by combining computer science, biology, chemistry, mathematics, \u00a0engineering and statistics into one discipline. This industry focuses mostly on the creation of new software with biological instruments.\n\nMapping and analysing DNA and protein sequences, matching various DNA and protein sequences to compare them, and building and examining 3D models of protein structures are typical bioinformatics tasks. Bioinformatics is now more important than ever because of the Human Genome Project.\n\nSequence alignment, protein structure prediction, gene expression and protein-protein interaction prediction, genome-wide association studies, and many other fields will benefit from the research\u2019s advancement and success.\n\nThe sciences of biological computation and bioinformatics are related yet separate from one another. Bioinformatics employs computation to learn more about biology, whereas biological computation uses bioengineering and biology to construct biological computers.\n\nAlthough their scopes are different, computational biology and bioinformatics share similar goals and methods. The former organises and analyses fundamental biological data, while the latter creates theoretical models of biological systems, much like mathematical biology does with mathematical models.\n\nApplications\n\nA collection of data that has been set aside to be turned into valuable information must be selected for bioinformatics and its applications to function. The fields of 3D image processing, 3D modelling of living cells, image analysis, drug development, and many more are the focus of bioinformatics.\n\nMicrobial analysis and computing.\nRecognizing and modelling protein structure.\nTreatments for contagious and dangerous diseases\nData storage and retrieval related to biotechnology.\nSearch for new medicines.\nUnderstanding agricultural trends, pest management, and crop management in agriculture.\nFinds relevance in evolutionary theory.\nTo understand the function of genes and gene therapy.\nCell organizations and function.\nAnalysis of drug targets.\nExamine the characteristics of various diseases.\nIntegration and development of various tools for the management of biological databases.\nUses of Bioinformatics in biomedicine\nDrug discovery: By combining Bioinformatics and structure-based drug design, researchers can create potent drugs for a wide range of acute and chronic conditions.\nCustomized medicine: It is possible to create personalised medicine, which would be significantly more successful, by evaluating the genetic structure of the patient and their individual medical histories.\nMedicines for the prevention of diseases: This is primarily accomplished by combining data from bioinformatics, bioanalytics, and epidemiology. Preventive medications, as their name implies, can stop the spread of a disease or treat any acute illness before it manifests.\nGenome therapy: It is the process of replacing damaged genes with new ones in a living organism\u2019s gene structure. Large amounts of data may be necessary because the gene structures of each creature vary greatly.\nMilestones of India in the Bioinformatics sector\nIndia was a pioneer in the field of genomics. Through the successful conclusion of the Human Genome Project in 2009, the nation joined the ranks of the US, the UK, Canada, China, and Korea.\nThe Department of Bio-Technology is also a regulatory body for bioinformatics.\nThe 1987 creation of the Biotechnology Information System Network (BTISnet) is attributed to DBT.\u00a0 India was the first nation to create such a network.\nDBT created the Bioinformatics Policy of India (BPI) in 2004.\nDBT created a system to facilitate the sharing of bioinformatics knowledge among SAARC members.\nIndia has more trained bioinformaticists than any other country in the world.\nDouble-digit growth in the bioinformatics sector.\nIndia is considered a good location for drug development low-cost R&D and cheap availability of knowledge resources.\nIndia\u2019s capacity and advancements\nMajor Indian government agencies including the Department of Biotechnology (DBT) and the Biotechnology Information System (BTIS) are pushing bioinformatics.\nFor the 10th plan period, DBT had deemed bioinformatics a high-priority issue (2002-2007). Along with IT, the Indian government is supporting the growth of the bioinformatics industry with a variety of tax benefits.\nBy constructing a Bio-IT park, India has combined its strengths in biotechnology and IT to entice outsourcing deals in bioinformatics. These parks will be a collection of academic-industry-research activities, opening up fresh perspectives and revitalising the Indian bioinformatics sector, making it a future sunrise industry.\nIndia\u2019s Department of Biotechnology has been collaborating with other departments on the establishment of Bio-IT parks and new biotech regulations which are projected to establish India as the world\u2019s centre for bioinformatics and to serve as a growth accelerator for the bioinformatics industry.\nIndia\u2019s bioinformatics industry has expanded quickly as a result of IT businesses\u2019 increased attention to the life sciences industry.\nIndian enterprises offering these services including data mining, mapping, DNA sequencing, functional genomics, proteomics, and molecular design modelling can anticipate capturing a sizable portion of the global market. The bioinformatics sections of Indian IT firms like Tata Consultancy Services (TCS), Cognizant Technologies, Infosys, and Wipro are already functioning in the bioinformatics sector.\nIn the field of bioinformatics, Indian pharmaceutical firms like GVK Biosciences, Dr Reddy\u2019s Laboratories, Biocon, AstraZeneca, Ranbaxy, Biological E, and Nicholas Piramal are moving quickly. The growth of pure-play bioinformatics businesses like Strand Genomics is also happening in India.\nConclusion\n\nBioinformatics avail central, globally accessible databases that allow scientists to submit, search and analyze the information provided to them making it very important for the analysis of data in modern biology and medicine.\n\nThe field is expanding on its own, greatly accelerating the development of biotechnology. Its ultimate objective is to unearth the vast amount of biological knowledge that is concealed in the bulk of data and to gain a greater understanding of the basic biology of organisms.\n\nThe study of biology, which is often regarded as the defining scientific enterprise of the twenty-first century, relies heavily on bioinformatics, which has emerged as a frontline applied science.\n\nWithout the use of bioinformatics, the growth of whole genome sequencing, structural genomics, proteomics, micro-array, etc. will be very slow. The ability of these fields to address challenging biological issues will be limited without bioinformatics and thus gives very high importance to bioinformatics.\n\nArticle Written By: Atheena Fathima Riyas",

As they split, the atoms release tiny particles called fission products.\n\nFission products cause other uranium atoms to split, starting a chain reaction. The energy released from this chain reaction creates heat.\n\nThe heat created by nuclear fission warms the reactor\u2019s cooling agent. A cooling agent is usually water, but some nuclear reactors use liquid metal or molten salt.\n\nThe cooling agent, heated by nuclear fission, produces steam. The steam turns turbines, or wheels turned by a flowing current. The turbines drive generators or engines that create electricity.\n\nRods of material called nuclear poison can adjust how much electricity is produced. Nuclear poisons are materials, such as a type of the element xenon, that absorb some of the fission products created by nuclear fission.\n\nThe more rods of nuclear poison that are present during the chain reaction, the slower and more controlled the reaction will be. Removing the rods will allow a stronger chain reaction and create more electricity.\n\nBenefits of Nuclear Energy:\nNuclear produces electricity reliably. Around-the-clock electricity is a must for our nation to prosper in the 21st century. Clean, reliable nuclear energy is a critical part because it runs nonstop for 18-24 months at a time.\nNuclear generates jobs. Nuclear energy provides more than 100,000 well-paid, long-term jobs and supports local economies with millions of dollars in state and local tax revenues.\nNuclear protects our air. Nitrogen oxide, sulfur dioxide, particulate matter and mercury: are all things you don\u2019t want in the air you breathe. Nuclear energy provides power 24/7 without a trace of those pollutants.\nNuclear boosts international development. Nuclear energy helps developing nations meet sustainable development goals.\nNuclear power electric vehicles. Electrified transportation promises to reduce carbon emissions. When powered by carbon-free nuclear energy, electric vehicles can reach their full potential.\nNuclear protects national security. Supports a resilient electrical grid at home, A country\u2019s security needs are addressed by using nuclear-powered submarines and nuclear-powered Aircraft carriers.\nNuclear power is used for space exploration.\nIt can be built in urban or rural areas.\nUsed for providing potable water through desalination.\nUsed in cancer treatment, Nuclear radiation is used in the treatment of food by killing bacteria, insects, and parasites that cause illness.\nUsed for sterilizing medical equipment.\nNuclear energy could play a major role in transportation by acting as a substitute for fossil fuels.\nNuclear Energy in India:\n\nNuclear power is the 4th largest source of electricity in India after thermal, hydroelectric and renewable sources of electricity.\n\nApproximately 2.5% of India\u2019s energy requirements are met through nuclear energy.\n\nIndia has 22 nuclear reactors in operation in 7 nuclear power plants, having an installed capacity of 6780 MW.\n\nTill 2009, India was excluded from global nuclear trade as it was a non-signatory of the Nuclear Non-proliferation treaty\u00a0due to its nuclear weapons program. This was a hindrance to the development of India\u2019s Civil Nuclear energy program.\n\nLocations of Nuclear Power Plants:\n\nTarapur Atomic Power Station (MH) \u2013 First in India\nKakrapar Atomic Power Station (GJ)\n(Kalpakkam) Madras Atomic Power Station (TN)\nNarora Atomic Power Station (UP)\nKaiga Nuclear Power Plant (KR)\nRajasthan Atomic Power Station (RJ)\nKudankulam Nuclear Power Plant (TN)\nLocations of Uranium Resources:\nTummalapalle (Kadapa District) \u2013 Andhra Pradesh\nNalgonda District \u2013 Telangana\nEast Singhbhum District \u2013 Jharkhand\nWest Khasi Hills District \u2013 Meghalaya\nUdaipur District \u2013 Rajasthan\nYadgir District \u2013 Karnataka\nRajnandgaon (District) \u2013 Chhattisgarh\nSonbhadra district \u2013 Uttar Pradesh\nRudraprayag District \u2013 Uttarakhand\nUna District \u2013 Himachal Pradesh\nGondia District \u2013 Maharashtra\nIndia\u2019s three-stage nuclear programme:\n\nIndia has very modest deposits of uranium and some of the world\u2019s largest sources of thorium. Keeping this in mind, in 1954 Homi Bhabha envisioned India\u2019s nuclear power programme in three stages to suit the country\u2019s resource profile.\n\nThe Indian nuclear power programme, launched in 1954, envisaged a three-stage development of nuclear power generation from the country\u2019s uranium and thorium resources.\n\nIn the first stage, heavy water reactors fuelled by natural uranium would produce plutonium.\n\nThe second stage would initially be fuelled by a mix of the plutonium from the first stage and natural uranium.\n\nThis uranium would transmute into more plutonium and once sufficient stocks have been built up, thorium would be introduced into the fuel cycle to convert it into uranium 233 for the third stage.\n\n(Transmutation is the conversion of an atom of one element to an atom of another through nuclear reactions. Induced nuclear transmutation is transmutation which is induced by scientists by striking the nuclei with high-volume particles)\n\nIn the final stage, a mix of thorium and uranium fuels the reactors. The thorium transmutes to U-233 as in the second stage, which powers the reactor.\n\nFresh thorium can replace the depleted thorium in the reactor core, making it essentially a thorium-fuelled reactor even though it is the U-233 that is undergoing fission to produce electricity.\n\nComponents of a nuclear power plant:\n\nThere are several components common to most types of reactors:\n\n\u00a0\n\nFuel\n\n\t\nUranium is the basic fuel. Usually, pellets of uranium oxide (UO2) are arranged in tubes to form fuel rods. The rods are arranged into fuel assemblies in the Nuclear reactor core. In a 1000 MWe class PWR there might be 51,000 fuel rods with over 18 million pellets.\n\n\nModerator\n\t\nThe material in the core slows down the neutrons released from fission so that they cause more fission. It is usually water but may be heavy water or graphite.\n\n\nControl rods or blades\n\t\nThese are made with neutron-absorbing material such as cadmium, hafnium or boron, and are inserted or withdrawn from the core to control the rate of reaction, or to halt it.\n\n\nCoolant\n\t\nFluid circulates through the core so as to transfer the heat from it. In light water reactors, the water moderator functions also as a primary coolant\n\n\nPressure vessels or pressure tubes\n\t\nUsually, a robust steel vessel contains the reactor core and moderator/coolant, but it may be a series of tubes holding the fuel and conveying the coolant through the surrounding moderator.\n\n\nSteam generator\n\t\nPart of the cooling system of pressurised water reactors (PWR & PHWR) where the high-pressure primary coolant bringing heat from the reactor is used to make steam for the turbine, in a secondary circuit.\nConclusion:\nIndia is blessed with the rare, and very important, nuclear fuel of the future \u2013 Thorium. It cannot afford to lose the opportunity to emerge as the energy capital of the world, which coupled with the largest youth power, will be India\u2019s answer to emerge as the leading economy of the world.\nIn the immediate past, the world was dealing with a power and energy crisis. While the factors that caused this emergency differ from country to country, the upshot has been a clamour to reduce dependence on fossil fuels and increase the production of renewable energy.\nHowever, the current green\u00a0energy paradigm needs some serious examination in terms of the 24\u00d77 availability of these renewable resources.\nNotwithstanding that\u00a0Nuclear Power\u00a0may be the cheapest, greenest and safest source of energy currently known to man. Every time the word \u201cnuclear\u201d is uttered, it gets a\u00a0negative and often hysterical response\u00a0rather than a reasoned fact-based one.\nIn the Indian context, nuclear, despite being a cleaner fuel, remains outside the priority list of power sources in India;\u00a0India contributes only 1.72% of global nuclear-installed capacity.\nThe global energy crisis should spur a rational relook at an energy source as clear as nuclear which is needlessly seen as a hot potato.\nWe must make the right choices between various low-carbon technologies, all of which have some social and environmental impact.\nTo meet rising energy demands, nuclear power is one of the better solutions. Considering lower capacity utilisation of renewables, rising fossil fuel prices and ever-soaring pollution problems, the potential of nuclear power must be fully exploited.\n\nRead: India\u2019s nuclear future;\u00a0Artificial Sun\n\nArticle written by: Aseem Muhammed",

In this article, you can read about space debris and the impacts which they make.\n\nThere are many threats in space.\n\nDo you know what are these?\n\nPresently, space debris is one of the main threats. This is an important topic in science and technology.\n\nTable of Contents\n\nWhat is Space debris?\nDoes \u201cKessler Syndrome\u201d describe this condition? Yes\nIn news\u00a0\nCauses of Space Debris\nImpacts of Space Debris\nMeasures Taken\nWay Forward\nWhat is Space debris?\n\nIn its broadest sense, space debris refers to both the natural micrometeoroid and artificial orbital debris components of the space environment.\n\nAccording to the European Space Agency, over 7,500 items of space junk that are at least 4 inches wide are currently in orbit.\n\nThis free-floating space debris poses a risk for operational satellites, and hitting it can render them inoperable.\n\n\ud83d\udc49 Which year are YOU targeting for success in the IAS/IPS/IFS Exam? \ud83d\ude80\n\n(1) \u21d2 UPSC 2025: Prelims cum Mains\n\n(2) \u21d2 UPSC 2026: Prelims cum Mains\n\n(3) \u21d2 UPSC 2027 Prelims cum Mains\n\nTip: Know more about ClearIAS Courses (Online/Offline)\n\nDoes \u201cKessler Syndrome\u201d describe this condition? Yes\n\nThe National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) scientist Donald Kessler coined the term \u201cKessler Syndrome\u201d in 1978 to describe this condition.\n\nAccording to the report, if there is too much space junk in orbit, it could cause a chain reaction where more and more objects collide and produce new space junk in the process until Earth\u2019s orbit is rendered useless \u2013 a Domino Effect.\n\nIn news\u00a0\n\nA Chinese military satellite named Yunhai 1-02 collided with a piece of debris from a Russian rocket launch in 1996 in March, creating a trail of debris high above the Earth.\n\nThese debris pieces are of varying sizes:\n\nSome 23,000 pieces are larger than a softball, according to the US government.\nAbout 0.5 million pieces are over 1cm.\n100 million pieces are 1mm and above.\n\nSpace is getting more crowded and more commercialized. The privatization of space may lead to a growing risk of collisions between satellites and space junk.\n\nCauses of Space Debris\nInactive satellites: Satellites have a finite amount of useful life, and once their batteries run out or they malfunction, they are left floating around in space.\nMissing equipment: During spacewalks, astronauts occasionally lose equipment or other items. Heidemarie Stefanyshyn-Piper, an astronaut, for instance, lost a box of tools in 2008.\nstages of a rocket: Shortly after launch, some rocket stages are lost in low orbits and come to rest on Earth. However, because they contain fuel remnants, the higher ones are left to drift in space and occasionally explode. Thousands of fragments are produced in these explosions.\nWeapons: In the 1960s and 1970s, tests of anti-satellite weapons were carried out by both the Soviet Union and the United States. One of these weapons, such as Mission Shakti of India, was used by the United States in 1985 to destroy a one-ton satellite (Sol wind).\nImpacts of micrometeoroids: Some waste is naturally produced by the collisions of micrometeoroids, which are dust-sized pieces of asteroids and comets.\nImpacts of Space Debris\n\nThe functioning of satellites and space stations is affected: Increased risk of collision with and damage to operational satellites and the International Space Station will have an impact on their performance (ISS)\nIncrease the risk of further collisions: Future space exploration is greatly endangered by an increase in the likelihood of collisions (Kessler syndrome). For example, the collision between Cosmos 2251 and Iridium 33\nImpact on Earth\u2019s atmosphere: A portion of the debris in low Earth orbit will gradually lose altitude and burn up in the atmosphere of Earth.\nImpact on earth\u2019s natural environment\nOn rare occasions, larger debris may strike Earth and harm the environment. For instance, the Altai region of eastern Siberia is covered in Proton rocket debris from Russia.\nTitanium, steel, ceramics, and other materials with a high melting point, as well as large or densely built objects, can withstand atmospheric re-entry to impact the earth\u2019s surface.\nAffect the navigational and communication systems: Its performance is impacted by collisions with navigation and communication satellites.\nImpact on the life of astronauts: Space debris may threaten the life of astronauts in the space station.\nMeasures Taken\nUnited Nations Committee on the Peaceful Uses of Outer Space (UNCOPUOS)\nThe General Assembly established it in 1959 to regulate space exploration and utilization for peace, security, and economic development for the entire human race.\nInter-Agency Space Debris Coordination Committee (IADC)\nIADC is an intergovernmental forum that was established in 1993 to coordinate actions to deal with debris in Earth\u2019s orbit. 3. NEO-01\nChina has launched the \u201cNEO-01\u201d prototype of a low-Earth orbit robot.\nIt has a large net that allows it to collect space debris left over from other spacecraft.\nRemove the DEBRIS mission\nThe goal of this satellite research project was to showcase different space debris removal techniques. The mission was overseen by the Surrey Space Center from the University of Surrey, and Surrey Satellite Technology Ltd. produced the satellite\u2019s platform (SSTL).\nKounotori experiment\nIt is a Japanese experiment using an innovative technique to remove space debris that is orbiting the Earth.\nWay Forward\nOrbit changes: A lot of contemporary satellites are launched into elliptical orbits with perigees inside the Earth\u2019s atmosphere, which eventually leads to their disintegration.\nSelf-destruction: This consists\u00a0of programming the satellite to leave its orbit at the end of its useful life and be destroyed when it comes into contact with the atmosphere.\nPassivation:\u00a0It is the removal of any remaining internal energy in the vehicle at the end of its useful life. Although the chassis remains in orbit, the risk of explosions is reduced. The same is true for the rocket stages.\nReuse:\u00a0These rockets return to Earth intact. These are used by Space X, the aerospace company owned by Elon Musk.\nLaser:\u00a0consists of stopping the fragments by using a strong laser to vaporize their surface, stopping them and causing them to fall.\nUse of nontoxic materials for building satellites:\u00a0Even wooden spacecraft are being tested by Japanese researchers to reduce the amount of toxic debris that is released into Earth\u2019s upper atmosphere when spacecraft deorbit.\nProtection of satellites:\u00a0The goal of protection is to shield spacecraft and employ clever design techniques to reduce the effects of debris impact.\n\nWe need to coordinate, cooperative efforts on several fronts to both remove the current space debris and stop the generation of future debris to keep space junk to a minimum and enable us to effectively use Low-Earth orbit for future exploration.\n\nInternational Space Law points out that if a satellite becomes dysfunctional, then the satellite should deorbit and its re-entry into the earth should be carried out.\n\nRead:\u00a0Zero Orbital Debris: How to Reduce Space Debris?\n\nArticle Written by: Remya",

It is spread to people and animals through bites or scratches, usually via saliva.\n\nIt is one of the Neglected Tropical Diseases (NTD) that predominantly affects poor and vulnerable populations who live in remote rural locations.\n\nAlthough effective human vaccines and immunoglobulins exist for the infection, they are not readily available or accessible to those in need.\n\nGlobally, deaths are rarely reported and children between the ages of 5\u201314 years are frequent victims.\n\nPrevention:\nIt is a vaccine-preventable disease. Vaccinating dogs is the most cost-effective strategy for preventing rabies in people. Dog vaccination reduces deaths attributable to dog-mediated infection and the need for PEP as a part of dog bite patient care.\nAwareness of the disease and preventing dog bites\nThe same vaccine is used to immunize people after exposure or before exposure to the virus (less common).\nSymptoms:\n\nInitial symptoms of the disease include:\n\nfever with pain and unusual or unexplained tingling,\npricking, or burning sensation (paraesthesia) at the wound site.\nAs the virus spreads to the central nervous system, progressive and fatal inflammation of the brain and spinal cord develops.\n\nA week to a year may pass during the incubation period for rabies, depending on variables like the site of virus entry and viral load.\n\nThere are two forms of the disease:\n\nFurious rabies results in signs of hyperactivity, excitable behavior, hydrophobia (fear of water), and sometimes aerophobia (fear of drafts or fresh air). Death occurs after a few days due to cardio-respiratory arrest.\nParalytic rabies accounts for about 20% of the total number of human cases. This form of rabies runs a less dramatic and usually longer course than the furious form. Muscles gradually become paralyzed, starting at the site of the bite or scratch. A coma slowly develops, and eventually, death occurs. The paralytic form of rabies is often misdiagnosed, contributing to the under-reporting of the disease.\nTreatment:\nPet vaccinations, avoiding contact with wildlife, and seeking medical attention immediately after probable exposure before symptoms appear can all help prevent the disease.\nIt is crucial to remove the virus from the site as soon as possible. To do this, wash the incision with water and soap right once, then apply an antiseptic to lessen or eliminate the possibility of a nerve infection.\nIndian\u00a0Initiative for Rabies\n\nIn India, human rabies is reported throughout the country except in Andaman & Nicobar and Lakshadweep Islands. In up to 99% of cases, domestic dogs are transmitting the infection to humans.\n\nNational Rabies Control Programme was implemented in India during the 12th FYP for rabies control.\n\nNational Action Plan for Dog Mediated Rabies Elimination by 2030:\n\nThis multifaceted approach is based on the One Health Approach.\nThe concept of One Health recognizes that the health of people is closely related to the health of animals, plants, and their shared environment.\nIn the One Health approach, multiple sectors communicate and work together at the local, regional, national, and global levels to achieve optimal health outcomes.\n\nThe Mission is \u201cTo\u00a0achieve zero human deaths\u00a0due to dog-mediated Rabies by 2030.\u201d\n\nPrinciples:\n\nPrevention:\u00a0Introduce\u00a0cost-effective public health intervention techniques\u00a0to improve accessibility, affordability, and availability of post-exposure prophylaxis to all people in need.\nPromotion: Improve understanding of rabies through advocacy, awareness, education, and operational research.\nPartnership: Provide coordinated support for the anti-rabies drive with the involvement of community, urban and rural civil society, government, private sectors, and international partners.\nWHO Response\n\nRabies is included in WHO\u2019s new 2021-2030 road map.

As of 31 July 2022, the total installed wind power capacity was 40.893\u00a0GW, the\u00a0fourth largest installed wind power capacity in the world.\u00a0Wind power\u00a0capacity is mainly spread across the Southern, Western and Northern Western regions.\n\n\u00a0\n\nGovernment Policies and initiatives to promote wind energy\n\nThe Government is promoting wind power projects in the entire country through private sector investment by providing various fiscal and financial incentives such as Accelerated Depreciation benefit and concessional custom duty exemption on certain components of wind electric generators. Besides, Generation Based Incentive (GBI) Scheme is available for the wind projects commissioned before 31 March 2017.\n\nIn addition to fiscal and other incentives as stated above, the following steps also have been taken to promote the installation of wind capacity in the country:\n\nTechnical support including wind resource assessment and identification of potential sites through the National Institute of Wind Energy, Chennai.\nIn order to facilitate the inter-state sale of wind power, the inter-state transmission charges and losses have been waived off for wind and solar projects to be commissioned by March 2022.\nIssued guidelines for Tariff-Based Competitive Bidding Process for Procurement of Power from Grid Connected Wind Power Projects with an objective to provide a framework for procurement of wind power through a transparent process of bidding including standardization of the process and defining roles and responsibilities of various stakeholders. These Guidelines aim to enable the Distribution Licensees to procure wind power at competitive rates in a cost-effective manner.\n\nAlso read: \u00a0Green grids initiative-one sun-one world-one grid\n\nThe potential of Wind Energy in India\n\nThe wind is an intermittent and site-specific resource of energy. Therefore, an extensive Wind Resource Assessment is essential for the selection of potential sites.\n\nThe Government, through the National Institute of Wind Energy (NIWE), has installed over 800 wind-monitoring stations all over the country and issued wind potential maps at 50m, 80m, 100m and 120m above ground level.\n\nThe recent assessment indicates a gross wind power potential of 302 GW in the country at 100 meters and 695.50 GW at 120 meters above ground level.\n\nAlso read: Solar\u00a0Radiation Management\n\nChallenges\nWind power must compete with other low-cost energy sources: When comparing the\u00a0cost of energy associated with new power plants, wind and solar projects are now more economically competitive than gas, geothermal, coal, or nuclear facilities. However, wind projects may not be cost-competitive in some locations that are not windy enough.\u00a0Next-generation technology,\u00a0manufacturing improvements, and a\u00a0better understanding of wind plant physics\u00a0can help bring costs down even more.\nIdeal wind sites are often in remote locations: Installation challenges must be overcome to bring electricity from wind farms to urban areas, where it is needed to meet demand. Upgrading the nation\u2019s transmission network to connect areas with abundant wind resources to population centres could significantly reduce the costs of expanding land-based wind energy. In addition, offshore wind energy transmission and grid interconnection capabilities are improving.\nBecause winds do not blow strongly enough to produce power all the time, energy from wind machines is considered \u201cintermittent,\u201d that is, it comes and goes. Therefore, electricity from wind machines must have a backup supply from another source.\nTurbines produce noise and alter visual aesthetics: Wind farms have different impacts on the environment compared to conventional power plants, but similar concerns exist over both the\u00a0noise\u00a0produced by the turbine blades and the\u00a0visual impacts\u00a0on the\u00a0landscape.\nWind plants can impact local wildlife: Although wind projects rank lower than other energy developments in terms of wildlife impacts, research is still needed to minimize wind-wildlife interactions. Advancements in technologies, properly sitting wind plants, and ongoing environmental research are working to reduce the impact of wind turbines on wildlife.\nWay forward\nGovernments need to tackle issues such as\u00a0planning barriers and grid connection challenges.\nTo sustain and increase growth in wind-based generation capacity,\u00a0policymakers need to streamline the procedures to grant permits, including land allocation and grid connection projects.\nWorkforce planning for large-scale renewables deployment\u00a0should be an early policy priority.\nThere is also a need for\u00a0greater public-private cooperation\u00a0to confront \u201cthe new geopolitics of the wind supply chain\u201d.\nA stronger international regulatory framework is needed to address the increased competition for commodities and critical minerals.\nConclusion\n\nIndia is continuously moving towards complying with its climate change commitments under the Paris Agreement (COP21).\n\nIndia\u2019s pledge at the climate summit stated the country\u2019s intention to follow \u201ca cleaner path than the one followed by others at a corresponding level of economic development\u201d.\n\nTo this end, investing in renewable sources of energy, particularly, wind and solar energy are crucial.\n\nArticle written by: Caroline Abraham",

About 5,000 trillion kWh per year of energy is incident over India\u2019s land area with most parts receiving 4-7 kWh per sq. m per day. Solar photovoltaic power can effectively be harnessed providing huge scalability in India.\n\nThe National Institute of Solar Energy has assessed the Country\u2019s solar potential of about 748 GW assuming 3% of the wasteland area to be covered by Solar PV modules.\n\nAlso read: Solar Radiation Management\n\nCurrent status of India\u2019s solar energy capacity\n\nIndia in its nationally intended has set an ambitious target to achieve a capacity of 175 GW worth of renewable energy by the end of 2022, which expands to 500 GW by 2030. This is the world\u2019s largest expansion plan in renewable energy.\n\nIndia was the second-largest market in Asia for new solar PV capacity and third globally (13 GW of additions in 2021). It ranked fourth for total installations (60.4 GW), overtaking Germany (59.2 GW) for the first time.\n\nMajor initiatives and policies of the Indian Government to promote solar energy\n45 solar parks with an aggregate capacity of 37 GW have been approved in India.\nSolar Parks in Pavagada (2 GW), Kurnool (1 GW), and Bhadla-II (648 MW) are included in the top 5 operational solar parks of 7 GW capacity in the country\nThe world\u2019s largest renewable energy park of 30 GW capacity solar-wind hybrid project is under installation in Gujarat\nVarious schemes to encourage the generation of solar power have been launched in the country like Solar Park Schemes, VGF Schemes, CPSU Schemes, Defence Schemes, Canal bank and canal top Schemes, Bundling Schemes, Grid Connected Solar Rooftop Schemes, etc.\nVarious policy measures undertaken included a declaration of trajectory for Renewable Purchase Obligation (RPO) including Solar energy.\nA waiver of Inter-State Transmission System (ISTS) charges and losses for inter-state sale of solar and wind power for projects to be commissioned up to March 2022 has been instituted.\nStandards for the deployment of solar photovoltaic systems and devices have been clearly defined.\nBuilding bye-laws have been suitably amended to include the mandatory provision of rooftop solar panel installation for new constructions or higher Floor Area Ratio\nSolar projects have been accorded infrastructure status.\nRecently, India achieved the 5th global position in solar power deployment by surpassing Italy. Solar power capacity has increased by more than 11 times in the last five years from 2.6 GW in March 2014 to 30 GW in July 2019. \u00a0Presently, solar tariffs in India are very competitive and have achieved grid parity.\nHigh-efficiency solar PV Modules have been included in the Production-Linked Incentive (PLI) Scheme for Enhancing India\u2019s Manufacturing Capabilities and Enhancing Exports.\n\nAlso read: Green Grids Initiative-one Sun One World one grid; PM-Surya Ghar Muft Bijli Yojana\n\nChallenges\n\nSome of the most notable Solar Energy Challenges in India include:\n\nLack of Domestic Manufacturing of Solar Parts:\u00a0The domestic manufacturing industry of solar PV cells and modules is severely lacking in India due to the lack of infrastructure, skilled workforce and high cost of production.\nSpace Scarcity:\u00a0Another part of the major Solar Energy Challenges in India is the scarcity of land to install large-scale ground-mount solar systems, solving which scope for greater R&D and innovation could be increased tenfold in terms of installation.\nFinancing Mechanism: The absence of innovative financing options for installing large-scale solar PV parks is another big part of Solar Energy Challenges in India that could offer higher sums at lower interest with longer durations. However, some government initiatives like the National Clean Energy and Environment Fund, Green Masala Bonds, etc., have slightly resolved this issue.\nLow Tariffs:\u00a0Since the Indian government enforces one of the lowest solar tariffs, it makes the prospect of purchasing solar parts unsustainable for some developers which further leads to compromise in the quality of solar panels. This forms another key part of the Solar Energy Challenges in India that need to be addressed.\nWaste Management: India\u2019s solar waste has been predicted to grow by 1.8 million tonnes by 2050. Currently, India\u2019s e-waste rules are not mandatory for solar cell\u00a0manufacturers\u00a0which leads to a large generation of solar waste every year.\n\nRead:\u00a0Solar Waste Management\n\nIn news\n\nRecently, the road transport and highway minister announced that the government is working on developing electric highways powered by solar energy.\n\nThis is expected to facilitate the charging of heavy-duty trucks and buses.\n\nThis signifies India\u2019s commitment to the adoption of renewable sources of energy in the present energy-strapped world.\n\nIn this context let us discuss the solar energy potential of India and analyze where India stands in the global arena in the march towards the attainment of energy security.\n\nWay forward\nPromote hybridization of solar and wind energy: The synergy in hybrid wind and solar plants will help reduce variability in power generation. Hybrid projects would also have much higher capacity utilization factors, thus practically eliminating the intermittency challenge.\nBuild enhanced evacuation infrastructure: We need greater investment in high-voltage transmission lines to transport bulk energy over vast distances quickly and efficiently from power-rich to power-scarce states. This is all the more important in a scenario where storage solutions are not well-developed\nInvest in digitalization: There is huge potential for advanced software solutions that can optimize grid-level operations besides impacting consumer behavior.\nDevelop battery storage solutions: Grid operators can store electricity generated from renewable projects in large battery systems in low-demand situations, and then promptly release that electricity into the grid when demand increases.\nTurnaround the distribution companies: Nearly a quarter of electricity generated is lost in transmission because India\u2019s distribution companies (known as DISCOMs) use outdated infrastructure, resulting in line faults and leakages, as well as undersized and over-utilized transformers. Immediate reforms are needed to revitalize the DISCOMs \u2013 privatization and greater autonomy may be the answer. There is a dire need to invest in upgraded infrastructure and formulate an action plan to enhance revenue collection.\n\nAlso read:\u00a0Wind Energy: Potential Of India\n\nConclusion\n\nIndia needs to enhance its solar manufacturing capacity as it cannot just rely on large-scale solar deployment by importing solar equipment.\n\nThere is an immediate necessity to develop the entire value chain ecosystem to become competitive and achieve sustainable growth in the long run.\n\nArticle written by: Caroline Abraham",

Fundamentally, it is based on Einstein\u2019s general theory of relativity.\n\nJust like black holes were predicted by Einstein\u2019s theory of relativity long before they were experimentally observed, the existence of wormholes, too, has been predicted. It is yet to be observed.\n\nIn theory, a wormhole could be used to connect very long distances, like millions of light years. In extreme scenarios, it might even be able to connect parallel universes.\n\nWormhole: Theory\n\nIn 1957, physicist John Archibald Wheeler introduced the name \u2018\u2019wormhole\u2019\u2019.\n\nAlbert Einstein and Nathan Rosen used the theory of general relativity to elaborate on the idea, proposing the existence of \u201clinks\u201d through space-time.\n\nAs per the theory, these tunnels could join two distant points in the universe and could minimize distance and travel time.\n\nLater, they were named wormholes or Einstein-Rosen-Bridge.

Statistically, about 10% of the patients progress to active disease which may lead to death if left untreated.\n\nTB is spread from person to person through the air which makes it highly contagious. But people with latent TB do not spread the disease.\n\nTypical symptoms of active TB are a chronic cough with blood in mucus, fever, night sweats, and weight loss.\n\nTreatment requires the use of antibiotics for a long period. This problem of antibiotic resistance is affecting the treatment as multiple drug-resistant TB (MDR-TB) is also on the rise.\n\nTreatment for TB\n\nActive TB is treated with combinations of antibiotics for a prolonged period to reduce the risk of antibiotic resistance.\n\nLatent TB treatment takes around 9-11 months to prevent conversion to active TB.\n\nHistory of TB\n\nTuberculosis has been present in humans since ancient times. Earlier it was considered a very lethal disease with a high death rate with no treatment.\n\n1689: Richard Morton, an English physician established the pulmonary form associated with\u00a0tubercles\u00a0as a pathology, but TB was not identified as a single disease until the 1820s.\n1720: Benjamin Marten, another English physician, conjectured that consumption (weight loss due to TB) was caused by microbes that were spread by people living near each other.\n1865: Jean Antoine Villemin, a French physician\u00a0demonstrated that tuberculosis could be transmitted, via inoculation, from humans to animals and among animals.\n1882: Robert Koch, the German physician, and microbiologist, identified and described Mycobacterium tuberculosis as the responsible bacteria. (He received the Nobel Prize in physiology or medicine for this in 1905).\n1906: Albert Calmette\u00a0and\u00a0Camille Gu\u00e9rin\u00a0achieved the first success in immunization against tuberculosis in 1906, using attenuated bovine-strain tuberculosis called\u00a0bacille Calmette\u2013Gu\u00e9rin(BCG).\n1921: The BCG vaccine was first used on humans in 1921 in France,\u00a0but achieved widespread acceptance in the US, Great Britain, and Germany only after World War II.\n\nWorld Tuberculosis Day\u00a0is marked on 24 March each year, the anniversary of Koch\u2019s original scientific announcement.\n\nGlobal data on TB\n\nIn 2018, one-quarter of the world\u2019s population was thought to have a latent infection of TB with new infections occurring in about 1% of the population each year.\n\nAs of 2018, most TB cases occurred in the regions of South-East Asia (44%), Africa (24%), and the Western Pacific (18%).\nMore than 50% of cases being diagnosed were in seven countries: India (27%), China (9%), Indonesia (8%), the Philippines (6%), Pakistan (6%), Nigeria (4%), and Bangladesh (4%).\n\nIn 2020, an estimated 10\u00a0million people developed active TB, resulting in 1.5\u00a0million deaths.\n\nThis was the second leading\u00a0cause of death from an infectious disease\u00a0after\u00a0COVID-19.\n\nBy 2021 the number of new cases per year was decreasing by around 2% annually.\n\nAbout 80% of people in many Asian and African countries test positive while 5\u201310% of people in the United States population test positive via the tuberculin test.\n\nThe\u00a0WHO (World Health Organisation)\u00a0has launched a joint initiative\u00a0\u201cFind.

India experienced a 19% increase in TB cases in 2021 compared to the previous year.\n\nA total of 1.5 million people died from TB and an estimated 10 million people fell ill with tuberculosis (TB) worldwide\u00a0in 2020.\nIndia\u00a0has the\u00a0world\u2019s highest tuberculosis (TB) burden,\u00a0with an estimated 26 lakh people contracting the disease and approximately 4 lakh people dying from the disease every year.\n\nThe problem in India is the poor primary health care infrastructure which does not reach the weaker and backward sections of the society.\n\nInitiatives by the government for TB eradication\nNational Strategic Plan for Tuberculosis Elimination 2017-2025\nNational Tuberculosis Elimination Program (NTEP)- Centrally Sponsored Scheme\nTB Harega Desh Jeetega Campaign\nBacillus Calmette\u2013Gu\u00e9rin (BCG) vaccine included in the Indradhanush program.\nNational TB Elimination Programme to meet the goal of ending the TB epidemic by 2025 the country, five years ahead of the Sustainable Development Goals (SDG) for 2030\nTwo vaccines\u00a0VPM (Vaccine Projekt Management) 1002 and MIP (Mycobacterium Indicus Pranii)\u00a0have been developed and are under\u00a0Phase-3 clinical trial.\nNi-kshay Poshan Yojana:\u00a0It provides Rs 500 support through\u00a0direct benefit transfer to the patients.\nThe government has also focused on utilizing technology and creating digital health IDs for TB patients under the Ayushman Bharat Digital Health Mission to ensure proper diagnostics and treatment are available.\n\n-Article written by Swathi Satish",

This causes these cells and molecules to mount a special immune response.\n\nAccording to experts, an intranasal vaccine can fight against the virus even before it tries to cross the body\u2019s protective barrier.\n\nSince intramuscular vaccinations rely on immune cells that have been mobilized from elsewhere in the body to swarm to the site of infection, they typically fail to trigger this mucosal response.\n\nWorking of the nasal vaccine\n\nVaccines generally invoke an immune response in the body through the B cells and T cells which produce immunoglobulins or antibodies like IgG to fight the disease-causing foreign bodies.\n\nThe T cells help the B cells by memorizing the foreign bodies for future response.\n\nNasal vaccines will activate the B cells residing near the mucosal lining tissues.\n\nThese B cells will produce IgA antibodies which specialize in destroying airway pathogens.\nThe T cells in the area will memorize the pathogens for future response.\n\nThere many types of mucosal vaccines like:\n\nUnit dose liquid: Single dose nasal spray system\nBidose liquid: Bidose nasal spray system\nThe multi-dose liquid device system\nUnit dose powder: Active, single dose nasal powder delivery system\nBidose powder: Passive, Bidose nasal powder delivery system\nAdvantages\nThe nasal route has excellent potential for vaccination due to the organized immune systems of the nasal mucosa.\nIt is non-invasive and needle-free.\nIt is easy to administer as it does not require trained healthcare workers.\nThis can eliminate needle-associated risks (injuries and infections).\nIt is ideally suited for children and adults.\nThe possibility of scalable manufacturing will be able to meet global demand.\n\nIntranasal vaccines may be most beneficial for special populations:\n\nchildren (easy to use, non-invasive)\nelderly patients (easy to use, non-invasive)\nHIV-infected patients (no fear of needle stick injuries)\nmulti-morbid patients (exhausted with injections)\n\nFrom a manufacturing and transportation point of view, nasal vaccines still have a better edge over intramuscular vaccines:\n\nA clear advantage of the intranasal route is, that liquids and dry powder formulations may be used.\nThis gives advantages to transportation and wastage issues, because a cold chain may not be required.\nLonger shelf life can be achieved.\nConcerns\nThere is very little evidence to back the effectiveness of this route of delivery so far and, except for some flu vaccines, attempts to deliver vaccines like this have not been successful.\nThough they are primarily safe, their efficacy is tough to achieve as it depends on multiple bioengineering approaches.\nIt still lacks sufficient data on human trials hence mass administration may provide false outcomes.\nSingle-dose devices will give the best protection for the vaccine but require highly sophisticated filling technology.\nGlobal nasal vaccine development scenario\n\nAround 100 mucosal COVID-19 vaccines are in development globally. Around 20 of those have reached clinical trials in humans, of which at least four have completed or are undergoing phase III studies to test the safety and how well they work compared to other vaccines.\n\nIran gave its vaccine emergency approval in October 2021, and at least five million doses have been delivered. And China also has approved a viral vector-based nasal vaccine.\n\nIndia also approved the emergency use of the internasal vaccine in September 2022.\n\nCurrently, Covishield, Covaxin, and Corbevax are part of the Government\u2019s Covid immunization drive while vaccines like Covovax and Sputnik are available at private centres.\n\nRead: Modern vaccines: Why do they have low durability?\n\n-Article written by Swathi Satish",

How can it be prevented?\n\nTomato flu has been reported in at least four states Kerala, Tamil Nadu, Haryana, and Odisha.\n\nThe Union Health Ministry has issued a set of guidelines for the prevention, testing, and treatment of the infection.\n\nA study was published in the Lancet Respiratory Medicine reading its epidemiology. \u00a0The study states that this common and contagious disease generally targets children between one and five years of age and adults with weaker immunity. The disease reportedly affects the mouth, hand, and foot.\n\nIt is called \u2018Tomato flu/fever\u2019 because of the red and painful blisters that appear throughout and grow gradually to the size of a tomato.\n\nTable of Contents\n\nWhat is tomato flu?\nHand-foot-and-mouth disease (HFMD)\nSymptoms of tomato flu\nTransmission of tomato flu\nPrevention and treatment\nWay forward\nPrevious year questions\nWhat is tomato flu?\n\nResearchers believe tomato flu is a different clinical presentation of hand-foot-and-mouth disease (HFMD) caused by a group of enteroviruses (viruses transmitted through the intestine).\n\nThe enteroviruses are an ancient and important group of\u00a0RNA viruses.\nHumans are the only hosts for the enteroviruses (non-polio enteroviruses or NPEV)\n\nTomato flu or tomato fever is characterized by fever, joint pain, and red, tomato-like rashes usually seen in children below the age of five years.

Lymphadenopathy is a distinctive feature of monkeypox compared to other diseases that may initially appear similar (chickenpox, measles, smallpox).\nThe skin eruption usually begins within 1\u20133 days of the appearance of fever.\nMonkeypox virus\n\nMonkeypox virus is an enveloped double-stranded DNA virus that belongs to the\u00a0Orthopoxvirus\u00a0genus of the\u00a0Poxviridae\u00a0family.\n\nThere are two distinct genetic clades of the monkeypox virus:\n\nThe central African (Congo Basin) clade\nThe West African clade.\n\nThe Congo Basin clade has historically caused more severe disease and was thought to be more transmissible.\n\nThe geographical division between the two clades has so far been in Cameroon, the only country where both virus clades have been found.\n\nHost of monkeypox virus\n\nVarious animal species have been identified as susceptible to the monkeypox virus. This includes rope squirrels, tree squirrels, Gambian pouched rats, dormice, non-human primates, and other species.\n\nUncertainty remains on the natural history of the virus and further studies are needed to identify the exact reservoirs and how virus circulation is maintained in nature.\n\nHistory of a monkeypox outbreak\n\nHuman monkeypox was first identified in humans in 1970 in the Democratic Republic of the Congo in a 9-month-old boy in a region where smallpox had been eliminated in 1968.\n\nSince 1970, human cases of monkeypox have been reported in 11 African countries: Benin, Cameroon, the Central African Republic, the Democratic Republic of the Congo, Gabon, Cote d\u2019Ivoire, Liberia, Nigeria, the Republic of the Congo, Sierra Leone, and South Sudan.\n\nSince 2017, Nigeria has experienced a large outbreak, with over 500 suspected cases and over 200 confirmed cases and a case fatality ratio of approximately 3%. Cases continue to be reported until today.\n\nIn 2003, the first monkeypox outbreak outside of Africa was in the United States of America and was linked to contact with infected pet prairie dogs.\n\nMonkeypox has also been reported in travelers from Nigeria to Israel in 2018, to the United Kingdom in 2018, 2019,\u00a0 2021, and\u00a0 2022, to Singapore in 2019, and to the United States of America in 2021.\n\nIn May 2022, multiple cases of monkeypox were identified in several non-endemic countries.\n\nTherapeutics and vaccination for monkeypox\n\nAn antiviral agent known as tecovirimat that was developed for smallpox was licensed by the European Medicines Agency (EMA) for monkeypox in 2022 based on data in animal and human studies. It is not yet widely available.\n\nVaccination against smallpox was demonstrated through several observational studies to be about 85% effective in preventing monkeypox. Thus, prior smallpox vaccination may result in milder illness.\n\nA still newer vaccine based on a modified attenuated vaccine virus (Ankara strain) was approved for the prevention of monkeypox in 2019. This is a two-dose vaccine for which availability remains limited.\n\nPrevention\n\nRaising awareness of risk factors and educating people about the measures they can take to reduce exposure to the virus is the main prevention strategy for monkeypox.\n\nReducing the risk of human-to-human transmission\nReducing the risk of zoonotic transmission\nPreventing monkeypox through restrictions on animal trade\nSmallpox and monkeypox\n\nThe clinical presentation of monkeypox resembles that of smallpox, a related orthopoxvirus infection that has been eradicated.\n\nSmallpox was more easily transmitted and more often fatal as about 30% of patients died.\n\nThe last case of naturally acquired smallpox occurred in 1977, and in 1980 smallpox was declared to have been eradicated worldwide after a global campaign of vaccination and containment.\n\nIt has been 40 or more years since all countries ceased routine smallpox vaccination with vaccinia-based vaccines.\n\nTo ensure global preparedness in the event of the reemergence of smallpox, newer vaccines, diagnostics, and antiviral agents are being developed. These may also now be helpful for the prevention and control of monkeypox.\n\nMonkeypox in news\n\nGiven the increasing reports of cases of monkeypox in non-endemic countries, the Union Health Ministry said on Tuesday while issuing \u2018Guidelines on Management of Monkeypox Disease\u2019.\n\nPrevious year question\n\nQ. Consider the following diseases: (2014)\n\nDiphtheria\nChickenpox\nSmallpox\n\nWhich of the above diseases has/have been\u00a0eradicated in India?\n\n(a) 1 and 2 only\n(b) 3 only\n(c) 1, 2 and 3\n(d) None",

It is transmitted through the bite of an infected Anopheles mosquito carrying the Plasmodium parasite (Plasmodium vivax). When this mosquito bites a human, the parasite is released into the bloodstream.\n\nIt is found in tropical and subtropical climates where the parasites can thrive and are prevalent in Africa, followed by Asia and Latin America. It also affects people in the Middle East and Europe to a much smaller degree.\n\nThe number of malarial cases worldwide in 2019 was around 229 million, according to the World Malaria Report in 2020, with 409,000 lives lost to the mosquito-borne disease.\n\nThe 2020 report said the majority of cases were reported in Africa, while India and Southeast Asia recorded a significant drop.

The 2 core interventions are insecticide-treated nets (ITNs) and indoor residual spraying (IRS).\nPreventive chemotherapy is the use of medicines, either alone or in combination, to prevent infections and their consequences. It includes chemoprophylaxis, intermittent preventive treatment of infants (IPTi) and pregnant women (IPTp), seasonal malaria chemoprevention (SMC), and mass drug administration (MDA). These safe and cost-effective strategies are intended to complement ongoing control activities, including vector control measures, prompt diagnosis of suspected malaria, and treatment of confirmed cases with antimalarial medicines.\nMalaria Vaccine\n\nIn 2020, World Health Organization (WHO) endorsed the first anti-malarial vaccine.\n\nRTS, S/AS01 (RTS, S) trade name Mosquirix vaccine is the first-ever anti-malarial vaccine recommended by the WHO.\n\nThe vaccine has been developed by GlaxoSmithKline (GSK) which is an essential part E-2025 initiative of WHO.\nUsing this vaccine with the existing tools to prevent malaria could save tens of thousands of young lives each year.\nThe WHO\u2019s recommendation was based on the results from an ongoing pilot program in Ghana, Kenya, and Malawi.\n\nWHO and its partners have reported stagnation in the progress against the disease that kills more than 2,60,000 African children under the age of five annually. According to WHO, the disease remains a primary cause of childhood illness and death in sub-Saharan Africa.\n\nWorld malaria day is observed on April 25th every year to create awareness and fund research for eradication. \u00a0The 2021 theme was \u201cReaching the Zero Malaria target\u201d.\n\nThe report, titled \u2018Zeroing in on malaria elimination\u2019,\u00a0was released by the\u00a0World Health Organization (WHO)\u00a0ahead of\u00a0World Malaria Day 2021.\n\nThe WHO has also identified 25 countries with the potential to eradicate malaria by 2025 under its\u00a0\u2018E-2025 Initiative\u2019.\n\nIndia\u2019s National Strategic Plan for Elimination of Malaria:\n\nThe objectives of the NSP for Elimination of Malaria are as follows:\n\nAchieve universal coverage of case detection and treatment services in endemic districts to ensure 100% parasitical diagnosis of all malaria cases and complete treatment of all confirmed cases.\nImprove the surveillance system to detect, notify, investigate, classify, and respond to all cases in all districts to move towards total malaria elimination.\nAchieve near-universal coverage of the population at risk of malaria with an appropriate vector control intervention.\nStrive for near-universal coverage of population at risk of malaria with an appropriate vector control intervention\nProvide for effective program management and coordination at all levels to deliver a combination of targeted interventions for malaria elimination.\n\nThe disease was once nearly eradicated in India, but it came back in the 1970s. India reported around 1.5 million malaria cases mostly caused by the deadly Plasmodium falciparum parasite in 2009. Thus there was a need for a national plan to eliminate the disease.\n\nThe National Strategic Plan is a great effort to eliminate Malaria and such a road map has been formulated by the\u00a0Union Health Ministry\u00a0for the first time. Though meeting the 2027 targets for elimination of malaria is difficult, strong political & administrative commitment and a focused approach can help in moving forward.\n\nDiseases like malaria, HIV-AIDS, Tuberculosis, etc have started receiving attention and funding for research and treatment, and there are many other diseases too that affect the impoverished sections of the world mostly and are mostly neglected.",

The www, or the web, consists of the \u2018surface\u2019 web and the \u2018deep\u2019 web.\n\nThe surface web is that portion that can be accessed by ordinary internet users using standard search engines like Google, Yahoo, etc. But it can retrieve only approximately 4 percent of the search results, while the majority of the results are hidden.\n\nWhat is the deep web?\n\nThe deep web constitutes 96 percent of the web- the password-protected or paywall-protected websites, including online banking services, for instance, are considered a part of the deep web. Such websites hold information relating to accounts of millions of individuals that are not accessible to the entire web population. The content of personal databases like email accounts, social media accounts, scientific and academic databases, legal documents, etc. that are accessible to only a closed group also forms part of the deep web.\n\nWhat is Darknet?\n\nThe darknet is a part of the deep web, but the deep web is accessible whereas the darknet is deliberately hidden.\n\nThe content of the darknet is encrypted and requires specific browsers such as TOR (The Onion Ring), FreeNet, Invisible Internet Project (I2P), TAILS (The Amnesic Incognito Live System), Whonix browser to access those pages.\n\nTOR was developed by United States Naval Research laboratory employees to protect US intelligence communications online. It is termed so as the traffic from the browser created several layers like those of an Onion before reaching the destination site.\n\nTOR is also used for legitimate purposes like secure and sensitive communications relating to medical ailments, helping law enforcement officials track down criminals, and assisting cybersecurity professionals to conduct security testing on their networks securely. It also provides access to social media websites in countries where they are banned. Using the Tor browser is not a criminal activity, although intelligence units keep track of Tor downloads to predict any possible criminal activity.\n\nAlso read: Dark Patterns\n\nThe exploitation of the dark web\n\nThe dark web has turned into the site of illegal transactions, posing a threat to cyberspace across multiple dimensions. Since anonymizers on the dark web make it difficult to track web patterns such as browsing history, location, etc., they are misused by criminals to hide their identities and carry out illegal activities.\n\nThe dark web market, \u2018Silk Road\u2019, was the first modern darknet market known for selling illegal drugs. This was taken down in 2013. But since then, users across the world have searched the online dark market to anonymously access weapons, credit card data, malware, Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS), stolen data, etc.\n\nCriminal and terrorist activities: The anonymous chat rooms and communication services on the dark web make it an ideal platform for planning and coordinating dangerous criminal and terrorist activities.\n\nDrug trafficking: In March 2021, the World Health Organisation (WHO) warned people against the sale of counterfeit COVID-19 vaccines, particularly on the dark web. Fraud services like fake vaccines have the potential to exploit the huge unmet global demand for COVID-19 vaccines criminally.\n\nIllegal activities like money laundering, drug trafficking, terrorism financing, ransomware, and cryptocurrencies on the dark web are all strongly linked to one another.\n\nChallenges to regulate the dark web\n\nEncryption technique and anonymity: This is one of the biggest challenges faced by the authorities- the dark web is completely anonymous making it difficult to attain sufficient information that could help combat cybercrimes and track criminals who exploit this space.\n\nCryptocurrency: Most financial transactions on the dark web are performed in cryptocurrencies which provide further anonymity. The technology of cryptocurrency called the blockchain is a digital ledger of transactions distributed across the network in which the blocks are cryptographically secured. It records information in a way that makes it difficult or impossible to modify or hack the system.\n\nBitcoin transactions have facilitated all kinds of illegal activities by cybercriminals and terrorists on the dark web and this has made it extremely difficult for law enforcement agencies to follow the trail of money to gather evidence of a crime. Regulation of cryptocurrencies is possible only concerning their legitimate use while a large portion of them can still be used for illegitimate purposes.\n\nWay forward\n\nThe dark web is a complex environment having both benefits and disadvantages based on whether it is utilized or exploited by the user.\n\nDarknet helps to protect the right to freedom of information and online privacy of individuals and is therefore often used by journalists and other activists across the world to carry out communication safely and securely. At the same time, it is misused by miscreants giving rise to a series of crimes.\nLaw enforcement agencies need to take a refined approach to protect the benefits of this space as well as eliminate the illegal activities in it.\nCooperation between public and private organizations can help in dealing with the new and emerging technological challenges of the dark web, by providing solutions such as new encrypting tools, etc. Law enforcement agencies should actively take the help of sophisticated technologies like artificial intelligence, machine learning, etc.\nA specified regulation on the amount of personal data collected by various companies and their automatic deletion after a stipulated period could increase the efficiency of cyber systems to secure the data and prevent such incidents in the future to a large extent.\nThe challenges of the trans-border nature of the dark web can be dealt with by sharing intelligence data across different sectors, agencies, and organizations.\nInternational cooperation in the form of multilateral exchanges through seminars, forums, and joint capacity-building exercises is highly beneficial in this regard.\n\nRelated article:\u00a0Dark patterns",

Dr. Banting later won the Nobel Prize for this discovery in 1923 along with Professor McLeod who was a Professor of Carbohydrate Metabolism.\n\nIf the pancreas gland is not able to produce enough insulin it causes hypoglycemia and if it is not used effectively then glucose levels in the blood are raised leading to hyperglycemia. If glucose levels increase in the long-term then it can also damage the body and failure of various organs and tissues.\n\nTypes of diabetes:\nType 1 Diabetes:\n\nIn this type, the body produces very little or no insulin. Therefore, a daily injection of insulin is required for the body to maintain blood glucose levels under control. It can develop at any age but mostly it affects children and adolescents.\n\nType 2 Diabetes:\n\nIn this type, the body is not able to use the insulin that it produces. The remedy for this is a healthy lifestyle, increase physical activity, and a healthy diet. Some people with time may take oral drugs or insulin to keep their blood glucose levels under control. It is more common in adults and 90% mostly cases of Diabetes are Type 2 only.\n\nGestational Diabetes (GDM):\n\nIn this type, glucose in the blood increases during pregnancy and may generate complications for both mother and child. It is also be seen that Gestational diabetes may disappear after pregnancy but affected women or children are at increased risk of developing type 2 diabetes later in life.\n\nDiabetes mellitus vs Diabetes insipidus\n\nDiabetes mellitus is what most people mean by diabetes. It\u2019s when your pancreas doesn\u2019t produce enough insulin to control the amount of glucose, or sugar, in your blood.\n\nDiabetes insipidus is a rare condition that has nothing to do with the insulin produced by the pancreas. If a person has diabetes insipidus, his kidneys produce a lot of extra urine. The loss of fluid makes the patient suffering from diabetes insipidus really thirsty. There are 4 types of diabetes insipidus \u2013 central, nephrogenic, dipsogenic, and gestational.\n\nThe global concern of diabetes:\n\nIt is the only major non-communicable disease for which the risk of dying early is going up, rather than down.\n\nIt has emerged as one of the major co-morbid conditions linked to severe Covid-19 infections. The International Diabetes Foundation Diabetes Atlas, in 2019, placed India among the top 10 countries for people with diabetes.\n\nGovernment initiatives:\nIndia\u2019s National non-communicable disease (NCD) Target is to prevent the rise in obesity and diabetes prevalence.\nNational Programme for Prevention and Control of Cancers, Diabetes, Cardiovascular Diseases and Stroke (NPCDCS) in 2010, to provide support for diagnosis and cost-effective treatment at various levels of health care.",

A black hole takes up zero space but does have mass, that used to be a star. And black holes get more massive as they consume matter near them.\n\nThe bigger they are, the larger a zone of \u201cno return\u201d they have, where anything entering their territory is irrevocably lost to the black hole. This point of no return is called the event horizon.\n\nWhen a massive star (more than 8 times bigger than Sun) runs out of its thermonuclear fuel in its core- signifies the end of its life and the core becomes unstable. Then its gravity caused the core to collapse upon itself.\n\nThis huge weight of its constituent matter falling in compresses the dying star to a point of zero volume and infinite density- called the singularity.\n\nThe\u00a0concept was given by Albert Einstein in 1915\u00a0but the term \u2018black hole\u2019 was coined in the 1960s by American physicist John Archibald Wheeler.\n\nThe black holes\u00a0belong to two categories:\nOne ranges between a few solar masses and tens of solar masses. These are thought to form when massive stars die.\nThe other is\u00a0supermassive black holes. These\u00a0range from hundreds of thousands to billions of times that of the sun\u00a0from the Solar system to which Earth belongs.\n\nA black hole cannot be observed but only detected by the effects of its enormous gravitational fields on nearby matter.\n\nSince any matter flowing into the black hole becomes intensely heated, it radiates x-rays before entering the event horizon and disappearing forever. These x-rays are detected and the radio images define our idea of the black hole.\n\nSupermassive black holes:\n\nAt the centre of most galaxies including our milky way, there is a supermassive black hole. Sometimes these supermassive black holes collect disk of gas, dust, and stellar debris around it- when they fall into the black hole. Its gravitational energy can be converted into light.\n\nThis process makes the centres of the galaxies very bright and is called Active Galactic Nuclei (AGN). At times the AGN shoots out jets of matter at the speed of light from its center called \u2018quasar\u2019.\n\nAnd when a galaxy is oriented such that these jets shoot towards the direction of the earth, it\u2019s called \u2018blazar\u2019.\n\nIn simpler words, quasar and blazer are the same things but are pointed at different angles.\n\nAlso read: LIGO-India\n\nLatest observations on black holes:\n\nApril 2019: The scientists at the Event Horizon Telescope project released the first-ever image of a black hole.\nJanuary 2021: The Indian astronomers of ARIES \u00a0institute reported one of the strongest flares from a blazer called BL Lacertae from 10 million light-years away. NOTE: A light-year is the distance light travels in one Earth year. One light-year is about 6 trillion miles (9 trillion km). Light travels at a speed of 186,000 miles (or 300,000 km) per second. Our Sun is the closest star to us. It is about 93 million miles away. So, the Sun\u2019s light takes about 8.3 minutes to reach us. This means that we always see the Sun as it was about 8.3 minutes ago.\nAugust 2021: Indian scientists have discovered the merger of three supermassive black holes from as many galaxies to form a triple Active Galactic Nucleus.

The immune system further memorizes to destroy any of the microorganisms associated with that agent that it may encounter in the future.\nHow do vaccines work?\n\nWhen viruses or bacteria (germs) invade our body, they attack and multiply. This invasion is called an infection, and the infection is what causes illness.\n\nThe first time the body encounters a germ, it can take several days for the immune system to make and use all the tools it needs to fight the infection.\nAfter the infection has been eradicated, the immune system keeps a few \u201cmemory cells\u201d that remember what it learned about how to protect against that disease.\nIf the body encounters the same virus or bacteria again, it will produce antibodies to attack the germ more quickly and efficiently.\nTypes\n\nVaccines are made up of viruses or bacteria that are altered or weakened so that they only cause an\u00a0imitation\u00a0of the disease and not the\u00a0disease.\n\n\ud83d\udc49 Which year are YOU targeting for success in the IAS/IPS/IFS Exam? \ud83d\ude80\n\n(1) \u21d2 UPSC 2025: Prelims cum Mains\n\n(2) \u21d2 UPSC 2026: Prelims cum Mains\n\n(3) \u21d2 UPSC 2027 Prelims cum Mains\n\nTip: Know more about ClearIAS Courses (Online/Offline)\n\nThere are a variety of different ways to alter or weaken the viruses or bacteria so that vaccination develops immunity instead of serious disease.\n\nFollowing are the different types\u00a0based on how they are made:\n\nLive attenuated vaccines have weakened forms of the living viruses in them. They are the closest to natural infections hence they are quite effective, but everyone cannot get them because people with weakened immune systems like those undergoing chemotherapy, may have adverse reactions. Examples include MMR, chickenpox, and the flu nasal spray also known as FluMist.\nToxoid vaccines prevent diseases caused by bacteria that produce toxins (poisons) in the body. These have weakened forms of toxins called toxoids in them. For example, DTaP and Tdap vaccination contain diphtheria and tetanus toxoids, in addition to protection against pertussis.\nInactivated vaccines have viruses in inactivated (killed) form. These vaccines produce immune responses, but cannot cause the disease itself.\u00a0 Examples include hepatitis A, influenza (shot only), polio (shot only), and rabies.\nSubunit vaccines use only a part of the virus or bacteria instead of the full organism. They contain only the essential antigens from the causative agent, hence they cannot cause illness. An example is the pertussis (whooping cough) component of the DTaP vaccine.\nConjugate vaccines use part of the coating of bacteria called polysaccharides. It is a type of subunit vaccine that combines a weak antigen with a strong antigen as a carrier so that the immune system has a stronger response to the weak antigen. Examples include hepatitis B, HPV, shingles, pneumococcal (PCV13), and meningococcal (MenACY).\nTypes of CoVID-19 Vaccines\n\nThere are four main types of COVID-19 vaccinations:\n\nWhole virus:\nThese have the live attenuated and inactivated types.\nThese require only conventional storage conditions.\nIndia\u2019s COVAXIN is an inactivated type.\nProtein sub-unit:\nThe viral subunit is mixed with adjuvants to help stimulate an immune response.\nThey are expensive to produce and may require booster doses.\nNOVAVAX is of such a category.\nmRNA (nucleic acid):\nThe RNA code of the SARS CoV-2 virus is inserted into the host cell whose protein machinery interprets it to produce viral antigens.\nThe host body then produces antibodies in response and develops immunity against the SARS-CoV-2.\nThese are easy to make and cheaper to produce, but this has never been used by humans before.\nThey require extreme cold storage of -70 degrees Celsius.\nPfizer and Moderna vaccines are such types.\nViral vector:\nThey also work by giving cells genetic instructions to produce antigens.\nHowever, they differ from nucleic acid vaccines because they use harmless viral vectors like adenovirus to deliver these instructions.\nOur cellular machinery is hijacked by them to produce antigens which then trigger the immune response.\nThey require only conventional cold storage.\nCOVISHIELD and Russia\u2019s Sputnik belong to this category.\nWhat is herd immunity or community immunity?\n\nHerd immunity occurs when a large percentage of a community (the herd) becomes immune to a disease, reducing the spread of disease from person to person. As a result, the whole community becomes protected along with those who are immune.\n\nCommunity immunity protects everyone and is especially important for people who are vulnerable to diseases but cannot be vaccinated.\nThis includes children too young to be fully vaccinated, people with serious allergies to certain vaccine ingredients, people with weakened or failing immune systems like patients with cancer, HIV-AIDS, type 1 diabetes, or other health conditions, and people going through medical treatments like chemotherapy.\nCommunity immunity plays an important role in protecting a very small group of people who don\u2019t have a strong immune response to vaccines.\nSuch people who cannot get vaccinated depend on a high level of immunization in their communities to help protect them against potentially deadly diseases.\nEach vaccination-preventable disease requires a certain percentage of people in a community to be vaccinated to prevent the disease from spreading. The exact percentage depends largely upon how easily a disease can spread from person to person.\nThe economic aspect of vaccine development\nLicensing\n\nVaccination manufacturers do not receive licensing until a complete clinical cycle of development and trials prove that the vaccine is safe and has long-term effectiveness, which is followed by a scientific review by a multinational or national regulatory organization, such as the European Medicines Agency (EMA) or the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA).\n\nCountries adopting World Health Organisation (WHO) guidelines for vaccination development and licensure have the responsibility to issue national licensure and to manage, deploy and monitor the vaccine throughout its use in each nation.\nWhen vaccination is licensed, the initial supply will be limited due to variable manufacturing, distribution, and logistical factors. It requires an allocation plan for the limited supply and which population segments should be prioritized to first receive the vaccine.\nVaccines developed for multinational distribution through the United Nations Children\u2019s Fund (UNICEF) require pre-qualification by the WHO to ensure international standards of quality, safety, immunogenicity, and efficacy for adoption by numerous countries.\nThe process requires manufacturing consistency at WHO-contracted laboratories following Good Manufacturing Practice (GMP).\nWhen UN agencies are involved in vaccine licensure, individual nations collaborate by issuing marketing authorization and a national license for the vaccine, its manufacturers, and distribution partners; and conducting post-marketing surveillance, including records for adverse events after the vaccination program.\nThe WHO works with national agencies to monitor inspections of manufacturing facilities and distributors for compliance with GMP and regulatory oversight.\nIn India, the Drugs Controller General of India who is the head of the department of the Central Drugs Standard Control Organization of the Government of India is responsible for the approval of licenses for specified categories of drugs such as vaccinations and others like blood and blood products, IV fluids, and sera.\nPatenting\n\nVaccinations are complex mixtures of biological compounds, and there are no generic vaccines like normal prescription drugs. The vaccination produced by a new facility must undergo complete clinical testing for safety and efficacy by the manufacturer.\n\nFor most vaccines, specific processes in technology are patented. These may be replaced by alternative manufacturing methods, but this requires R&D infrastructure and a skilled workforce.\nWhen new vaccines are created, patenting may become a barrier to its wider reach. The peak of the Covid-19 pandemic required increased vaccine production and intellectual property rights were hindering the cause.\nThe World Trade Organization (WTO) and various governments evaluated if the patent process should be waived to eliminate potential barriers to access for all, though it never came through.\n\nThe history of vaccine production is a fascinating tale to know. You can know about when various vaccinations were discovered here- timeline of human vaccines.\n\nRead: Modern vaccines: Why do they have low durability?",

Calcium phosphate also makes up the supportive components of our bones.\n\nElemental phosphorus exists in two major forms, white phosphorus, and red phosphorus, but because it is highly reactive, phosphorus is never found as a free element on Earth.\n\nPhosphorus plays a central role in aquatic ecosystems and is often the limiting nutrient thus limiting growth, in aquatic ecosystems. Another impact it has on the aquatic ecosystem is that excessive phosphorus may result in eutrophication. Phosphorus-containing compounds may also be carried in surface runoff to rivers, lakes, and oceans, where they get into the water bodies and aquatic organisms.\n\nThe main storage for phosphorus is in the earth\u2019s crust and is found as phosphates in the land.\n\nPhosphate compounds in the soil are taken up by plants and, transferred to animals that eat those plants. When plants and animals excrete wastes or die, phosphates are taken up by detritivores or returned to the soil.\n\nIn the ocean, phosphorus accumulates on the continental shelves in the form of insoluble deposits. When phosphorus-containing compounds from the bodies or wastes of marine organisms sink to the floor of the ocean, they form new sedimentary layers. After a long time, phosphorus-containing sedimentary rock may be moved from the ocean to the land by a geological process called uplift.\n\n\ud83d\udc49 Which year are YOU targeting for success in the IAS/IPS/IFS Exam? \ud83d\ude80\n\n(1) \u21d2 UPSC 2025: Prelims cum Mains\n\n(2) \u21d2 UPSC 2026: Prelims cum Mains\n\n(3) \u21d2 UPSC 2027 Prelims cum Mains\n\nTip: Know more about ClearIAS Courses (Online/Offline)\n\nTable of Contents\n\nThe Phosphorus cycle:\nAnthropogenic impact on the cycle:\nThe Phosphorus cycle:\n\nThe\u00a0phosphorus cycle is\u00a0the\u00a0sedimentary biogeochemical cycle\u00a0that describes the movement of\u00a0phosphorus\u00a0through the lithosphere, hydrosphere, and biosphere.\n\nPhosphorus is found in large amounts as a mineral in phosphate rocks and enters the cycle from weathering and erosion.

Pure sulfur is a tasteless, odorless, brittle solid, and pale yellow. It is a poor conductor of electricity and is insoluble in water.\n\nIt reacts with all metals except gold and platinum, forming sulfides. It also forms compounds with several nonmetallic elements.\n\nThe sulphur cycle is a biogeochemical cycle that describes the movement of sulfur in various forms through the Earth\u2019s biosphere, geosphere, hydrosphere, and atmosphere.

On land, sulfur is stored in underground rocks and minerals. It is released by precipitation, weathering of rocks, and geothermal vents.\n\nThe Sulphur cycle\n\nThe\u00a0sulphur cycle is a biogeochemical cycle in which sulphur moves between rocks, waterways, and living systems. It is a sedimentary cycle but hydrogen sulfide (H2S) and sulphur dioxide (SO2) are the gaseous components of the sulphur cycle.\n\nThe soil and sediments act as the sulfur reservoir where they are captured in organic (coal, oil, Peat) and inorganic (pyrite, sulfur rock). They are stored in the form of sulfates, sulfides, and organic sulfur.\n\nIt is released by weathering of rocks, erosional runoff, and decomposition of organic matter.\nIt is carried to terrestrial and aquatic ecosystems in the form of salt solutions.\nThe sulfides are converted to elemental sulphur by bacterial action. This is again converted to sulfates by chemolithotrophic bacteria.\nPlants take up sulfur in the form of sulfates and convert it into sulfur-containing amino acids through a series of metabolic processes.\nThese amino acids are incorporated in the proteins of the autotroph tissues which eventually pass along through the grazing food chain.\nThe sulphur is carried back into soil, lakes, and seas from living organisms through the excretion and decomposition of dead organic matter.\nSulphur enters the atmosphere from sources like volcanic eruptions, burning of fossil fuels, the surface of oceans, and gases released by decomposition.\nAtmospheric H2S gets oxidized to SO2 which is carried back to earth after being dissolved in rainwater as weak sulphuric acid (acid rain).\nEconomic importance of sulphur\nMillions of tons of sulfur are produced each year, mostly for the manufacture of sulfuric acid, which is widely used in industry.\nSulfur is directly involved in the production of fossil fuels and a majority of metal deposits because of its ability to act as an oxidizing or reducing agent.\nThe presence or absence of sulphur is one of the limiting factors for the concentration of precious metals in the source.\n\nSulphur Uptake by Plants:\n\nSulphur is taken up by plants in the form of sulfate ions (SO4^2-) from the soil. Plants incorporate sulfur into their organic compounds, including amino acids, proteins, and coenzymes.\n\nSulfur in the Food Web:\n\nSulphur moves through the food web as herbivores and carnivores consume plants or other animals. Sulfur-containing compounds are transferred from one organism to another.\n\nDecomposition and Mineralization:\n\nWhen plants and animals die, Sulphur is released during decomposition by the action of sulfur bacteria and fungi. This process involves the conversion of organic Sulphur compounds into inorganic forms like hydrogen sulfide (H2S).\n\nSulfur Bacteria:\n\nSulphur bacteria play a crucial role in the sulfur cycle. They can oxidize or reduce sulfur compounds, contributing to the release or consumption of sulfur in various forms.\nImpact of human activities on Sulphur cycle\n\nHuman activities are having a major impact on the global sulphur cycle. The burning of coal, natural gas, and fossil fuels has greatly increased the amount of sulphur in the atmosphere and ocean. It has also depleted the sedimentary rock sink.\n\nWithout human factors, sulphur would stay stored in rocks for millions of years until it gets uplifted through tectonic events, which is then released through erosion and weathering processes. But now it is being drilled out and burned at an increasing rate unnaturally.\nOver the most polluted areas of the world, there has been a 30-fold increase in sulfate deposition. The mining of coal and extracting of petroleum at such high rates that the global sulphur flux has become double in the last 100 years.\nAcid rain is caused by emissions of sulphur dioxide and nitrogen dioxide, which react with the water molecules in the atmosphere to produce acids.\nAcid rain has adverse impacts on forests, freshwaters, and soils, killing microbes, insects, and aquatic life-forms. It damages infrastructure by causing the paint to peel, corrosion of steel structures such as bridges, and weathering of stone buildings and statues.\nAcid rain has indirect impacts on human health also. The acid rain in rainwater is diluted and does not harm humans directly, but the particulates, sulphur, and nitrogen dioxide have adverse effects on human health.",

Read to know more about the importance of the oxygen cycle.\n\nOxygen is one of the most vital elements on Earth and the most common element of the human body. Oxygen constitutes about 65% of the mass of the human body and most of this is in the form of water. Oxygen also makes up about 30% of the Earth and 20% of the atmosphere.\n\nFree in the air and dissolved in water, oxygen is second only to nitrogen in abundance among elements in the atmosphere.\n\nThe oxygen cycle helps move oxygen through the Atmosphere, the Biosphere, and the Lithosphere.\n\nThe Atmosphere is the region that lies above the Earth\u2019s surface and it is one of the largest reservoirs of free oxygen on earth.\nThe Biosphere is the sum of all the Earth\u2019s ecosystems and also has some free oxygen produced from photosynthesis and other life processes.\nThe largest reservoir of oxygen is the lithosphere. But most of this oxygen is not free moving rather it is a part of chemical compounds such as silicates and oxides.\n\nPlants and animals use oxygen to respire and return it to the air and water as\u00a0carbon dioxide\u00a0(CO2). This CO2 is then taken up by algae and terrestrial green plants and converted into carbohydrates through the process of\u00a0photosynthesis of which oxygen is a by-product.\n\nThe water systems on earth are the main oxygen generators of the biosphere; their algae are estimated to replace about 90 percent of all oxygen used.

In the process, high-energy sunlight breaks apart oxygen-bearing molecules to produce free oxygen.\n\nThe ozone cycle is an outcome of the photolysis process. An oxygen molecule (O2) is broken down to atomic oxygen by the ultraviolet radiation of sunlight. This free oxygen then recombines with existing O2 molecules to make O3 or ozone. This cycle is important because it helps to shield the Earth from the majority of harmful ultraviolet radiation by turning it into harmless heat before it reaches the Earth\u2019s surface.\n\nBiosphere:\n\nIn the biosphere, the main processes in the oxygen cycle are respiration and photosynthesis. During respiration animals and humans breathe by consuming oxygen to be used in the metabolic process and exhale carbon dioxide. Photosynthesis is the reverse of this process and is done by plants and plankton.\n\nLithosphere:\n\nIn the lithosphere, oxygen is fixed and trapped in minerals such as silicates and oxides. This is the natural process of oxidation, when a pure element comes in contact with oxygen it gets oxidized.\n\nA portion of the oxygen is freed by chemical weathering. When an oxygen-bearing mineral is exposed to the elements a chemical reaction occurs that wears it down and in the process produces free oxygen.\n\nThe processes that produce oxygen:\nPhotosynthesis is a biological process by which all green plants synthesize their food in the presence of sunlight. During photosynthesis, plants use sunlight, water, carbon dioxide to create energy, and oxygen gas is liberated as a by-product of this process.\nSunlight also produced oxygen through reaction with water vapor in the atmosphere.\nThe processes that consume oxygen:\nBreathing is the physical process, through which all living organisms, including plants, animals, and humans inhale oxygen from the environment into the cells and exhale carbon dioxide back into the atmosphere.\nDecomposition is an important part of the oxygen cycle and occurs after the death of an organism. The dead organism decays and the organic matter with carbon, oxygen, water, and other components are returned into the soil and air. This process is carried out by decomposers like invertebrates (fungi, bacteria, and some insects. The entire process consumes oxygen and releases carbon dioxide.\nCombustion occurs when the organic and inorganic matter is burned in the presence of oxygen.\nRusting is the process of oxidation of metals and alloys.\nHuman influence on the oxygen cycle:\n\nThe anthropogenic activities are affecting the oxygen cycle also along with other biogeochemical cycles.\n\nFossil fuel combustion, respiration of humans and livestock, and wildfire are significant high Oxygen consumption activities. Areas like East Asia, India, eastern North America, Europe, and central Africa have high consumption rates due to dense population. While in regions of central Africa, the wildfire accounts for the majority of local Oxygen consumption.\n\nEven after the excessive burning of fossil fuel and the reduction of the natural vegetation on both land and in the sea, the level of atmospheric oxygen seems to be relatively stable which may be because of the increase in plant productivity due to agricultural advances worldwide.",

Nitrogen is found in soils and plants, in the water, and the air. It is also essential to life as a key building block of DNA, which determines our genetics, is essential to plant growth, and therefore necessary for the food we grow.\n\nThe balance of nitrogen is crucial for the environment and the life it sustains. When plants lack nitrogen, they become yellowed, with stunted growth, and produce smaller fruits and flowers. But when too much nitrogen is supplied it pollutes water systems and endangers aquatic life.\n\nNitrogen is a chief constituent of the bodies of living organisms as the Nitrogen atoms are found in all proteins, hormones, chlorophylls, vitamins, and DNA.\n\nPlants and microbes compete for the limited nitrogen available in the soil- hence it acts as a limiting agent for both natural and agricultural ecosystems and exists in the atmosphere as N2.\n\nOther sources of atmospheric nitrogen oxides are industrial combustions, forest fires, automobile exhaust, and power generating stations.\n\nTable of Contents\n\n\ud83d\udc49 Which year are YOU targeting for success in the IAS/IPS/IFS Exam? \ud83d\ude80\n\n(1) \u21d2 UPSC 2025: Prelims cum Mains\n\n(2) \u21d2 UPSC 2026: Prelims cum Mains\n\n(3) \u21d2 UPSC 2027 Prelims cum Mains\n\nTip: Know more about ClearIAS Courses (Online/Offline)\n\nWhat is eutrophication?\nThe Nitrogen cycle:\nStages of the nitrogen cycle:\nEffect of human activities of the nitrogen cycle:\nWhat is eutrophication?\n\nExcess nitrogen can also leach from the soil into underground water sources, entering aquatic systems as above-ground runoff. This excess nitrogen can build up, leading to a process called eutrophication.\n\nWhen excess nitrogen enriches the water, it leads to unrestrained growth of plants and algae which block the light from reaching the bottom layers of the water system. This can even cause a lake to turn bright green or other colors, with an \u201calgal bloom\u201d of smelly algae called phytoplankton.\n\nWhen these phytoplankton dies, microbes in the water decompose them and the process reduces the amount of dissolved oxygen in the water. This can lead to the formation of a \u201cdead zone\u201d that does not have enough oxygen to support most life forms eventually killing the organisms. These dead zones can form in freshwater lakes and also in coastal environments where rivers full of nutrients from agricultural runoff flow into oceans.\n\nThe Nitrogen cycle:\n\nThe nitrogen cycle is a biogeochemical cycle by which nitrogen is converted into multiple chemical forms as it circulates through the atmosphere, and the terrestrial, and marine ecosystems. The conversion of nitrogen can be carried out through both biological and physical processes.\n\nStages of the nitrogen cycle:\nNitrogen-fixing\nNitrification\nAmonification\nDenitrification\nNitrogen fixation:\nNitrogen is usable only after it is fixed. Nitrogen fixation is a process where bacteria convert N2into ammonia, a form of nitrogen usable by plants.\nNon-symbiotic bacteria or free-living bacteria- Azobacter and Beijemickia (aerobic); Clostridium and Rhodosprillium (anaerobic).\nSymbiotic bacteria- Rhizobium\u2013 live in association with leguminous root nodule plants.\nSome cyanobacteria, blue-green algae (Nostoc, Anabaena, Spirulina) are major sources of nitrogen fixation in oceans.\nThe lightning and UV radiation also provide enough energy to convert nitrogen to nitrogen oxides.\nThe industrial process like fertilizer factories also accomplish nitrogen fixation,\nNitrification: ammonia to nitrates\nAmmonium ions are directly taken up by some plants while most absorb nitrates obtained by oxidizing ammonia and ammonium ions.\nAmmonium ions are first oxidized to nitrite by Nitrosomonas/ Nitrococcus bacteria.\nNitrite is then oxidized to nitrate by Nitrobacter bacteria (chemoautotrophs).\nPlants absorb these nitrates and convert them into amino acids.\nAmmonification: urea, uric acid to ammonia\nLiving organisms produce nitrogenous waste products like urea and uric acid.\nThese waste products and dead remains of the organisms are converted back into inorganic ammonia and ammonium ions by bacteria by ammonification.\nDenitrification: nitrate to nitrogen\nThe process of reducing nitrate in the soil to nitrogen is called denitrification.\nSoil and oceans have denitrifying bacteria like Pseudomonas and Thiobacillus which convert nitrate/nitrites to elemental nitrogen.\nThis nitrogen is released into the atmosphere completing the cycle.\n\nEffect of human activities of the nitrogen cycle:\n\nThe excessive use of fertilizers for farming is one of the major causes of eutrophication in water systems. The agricultural runoff contains an uncontrolled amount of nutrients that cannot be balanced by the natural cycle.\n\nNitrogen gases and aerosols released by factories can be directly toxic to certain plant species, affecting the physiology and growth of plants near large sources of nitrogen pollution. Changes to plant species may also occur, as the accumulation of nitrogen compounds increases its availability in the ecosystem, eventually changing the species composition, plant diversity, and nitrogen cycle.\n\nReactive nitrogen from human activities can cause nitrate accumulation in the natural water environment, which can create harmful impacts on human health. Excessive use of N-fertilizer in agriculture has been one of the major sources of nitrate pollution in groundwater and surface water which can lead to nitrate poisoning.",

Energy is lost as heat whereas nutrients are recycled indefinitely.\nTypes of biogeochemical cycling:\n\nA nutrient cycle is gaseous or sedimentary based on the nature of the reservoir.\n\nGaseous cycle:\nThe main reservoir of nutrients is the atmosphere and the hydrosphere.\nGaseous cycles tend to move more rapidly to adjust more readily to changes in the biosphere because of the large atmospheric reservoir.\nExtraordinary disturbances (such as global warming) and more-frequent local disturbances(such as wildfires and storm-driven events) can, however, seriously affect the capacity for self-adjustment.\nExamples: water cycle, oxygen cycle, carbon cycle, nitrogen cycle, etc.\nThey are usually perfect- nutrients are replaced as fast as they are utilized.\nSedimentary cycle:\nThe main reservoir is the soil and the sedimentary and other rocks of the earth\u2019s crust.\nSedimentary cycles vary from one element to another, but each cycle consists fundamentally of a solution(or water-related) phase and a rock (or sediment) phase.\nExamples: phosphorus cycle, sulfur cycle, calcium cycle, magnesium cycle, etc.\nThese are imperfect as some nutrients lost get locked into sediments and are unavailable for immediate cycling.\nImportance of biogeochemical cycle:\n\nThe proper functioning of the various biogeochemical cycles is crucial for life forms on the earth. These cycles transform matter from one form to another for use of different organisms and natural systems. These cycles facilitate the storage of various elements for long-term and short-term usage.\n\nThese cycles connect different ecosystems and sustain them as well by maintaining a continuous flow of matter and energy through them. all the variants of the ecosystems whether living or non-living are interconnected through these cycles.",

Know all about it here.\n\nTable of Contents\n\nWhat is nanotechnology?\nBirth of nanotechnology\nApplications\nNanotechnology in health\nConcerns of using nanotechnology in healthcare\nPrevious year question\nWhat is nanotechnology?\n\nNanotechnology is the understanding and control of matter at the nanoscale, at dimensions between approximately 1 and 100 nanometers, where unique phenomena enable novel applications.\n\nIt is made of nanoscale science, engineering, and technology- nanotechnology involves imaging, measuring, modeling, and manipulating matter at this nano length scale.\n\nMatter such as gases, liquids, and solids can exhibit unusual physical, chemical, and biological properties at the nanoscale, differing in important ways from the properties of bulk materials and single atoms or molecules.\n\nSome nanostructured materials are stronger or have different magnetic properties compared to other forms or sizes of the same material. Others are better at conducting heat or electricity. They may become more chemically reactive or reflect light better or change color as their size or structure is altered.\n\nOne nanometer is a billionth of a meter or 10-9\u00a0of a meter. Here are a few illustrative examples:\n\n\ud83d\udc49 Which year are YOU targeting for success in the IAS/IPS/IFS Exam? \ud83d\ude80\n\n(1) \u21d2 UPSC 2025: Prelims cum Mains\n\n(2) \u21d2 UPSC 2026: Prelims cum Mains\n\n(3) \u21d2 UPSC 2027 Prelims cum Mains\n\nTip: Know more about ClearIAS Courses (Online/Offline)\n\nThere are 25,400,000 nanometers in an inch\nA sheet of newspaper is about 100,000 nanometers thick\nOn a comparative scale, if a marble were a nanometer, then one meter would be the size of the Earth\nBirth of nanotechnology\n\nThe ideas and concepts behind nanoscience and nanotechnology started with a talk entitled \u201cthere is plenty of room at the bottom\u201d by physicist Richard Feynman at an American Physical Society meeting at the California Institute of Technology (CalTech) on December 29, 1959, long before the term nanotechnology was used. In his talk, Feynman described a process in which scientists would be able to manipulate and control individual atoms and molecules.\n\nRichard Feynman is considered the father of nanotechnology.\n\nThe most important property that renders nanomaterials useful in a wide range of applications is the high surface-to-volume ratio. This one property alone has given a wide variety of applications for nanotechnology.\n\nApplications\n\nThe applications of nanotechnology widely range from industrial, and medicinal, to energy uses. These include more durable construction materials, therapeutic drug delivery, and higher-density hydrogen fuel cells that are environmentally friendly.\n\nNanoparticles and nanodevices are highly versatile through modification of their physiochemical properties, hence they have found uses in nanoscale electronics, cancer treatments, vaccines, hydrogen fuel cells, and nanographene batteries.\n\nNanotechnology\u2019s use of smaller-sized materials allows for the adjustment of molecules and substances at the nanoscale level, which can further enhance the mechanical properties of materials or grant access to less physically accessible areas of the body.\n\nAlso read: Neurotechnology\n\nNanotechnology in health\n\nNanobiotechnology and\u00a0bionanotechnology\u00a0refer to the combination of ideas, techniques, and sciences of biology and nanotechnology.\n\nNanobiotechnology refers to the application of nanoscale objects for biotechnology while bionanotechnology refers to the use of biological components in nanotechnology.\n\nNanotechnology is already leading to dramatic improvements in health care. Scientists are using nanoparticles to target tumors, in drug delivery systems, and to improve medical imaging. Some nanoparticle-based treatments are multi-functional; they can both find tumors and carry drugs for treatment. Nanotechnology is also being used to cut the cost and increase the speed of DNA sequencing and provide scaffolding for tissue regeneration or wound treatment.\n\nNanomedicine, the application of nanotechnology in medicine, draws on the natural scale of biological phenomena to produce precise solutions for disease prevention, diagnosis, and treatment. Below are some examples of recent advances in this area:\n\nCancer detection and treatment: Gold nanoparticles as probes for the detection of targeted sequences of nucleic acids, and they are also being clinically investigated as potential treatments for cancer and other diseases.\nDrug Delivery: Nanotechnology researchers are working on a number of different therapeutics where a nanoparticle can encapsulate or otherwise help to deliver medication directly to cancer cells and minimize the risk of damage to healthy tissue. This has the potential to change the way doctors treat cancer and dramatically reduce the toxic effects of chemotherapy.\nImaging and diagnostic tools: Tools enabled by nanotechnology are paving the way for earlier diagnosis, more individualized treatment options, and better therapeutic success rates.\nDiagnosis and treatment: Nanotechnology is being studied for both the diagnosis and treatment of atherosclerosis, or the buildup of plaque in arteries. In one technique, researchers created a nanoparticle that mimics the body\u2019s \u201cgood\u201d cholesterol, known as HDL (high-density lipoprotein), which helps to shrink plaque.\nGenetics: The design and engineering of advanced solid-state nanopore materials could allow for the development of novel gene sequencing technologies that enable single-molecule detection at low cost and high speed with minimal sample preparation and instrumentation.\nRegenerative medicine: Research in the use of nanotechnology for regenerative medicine spans several application areas, including bone and neural tissue engineering. Novel materials can be engineered to mimic the crystal mineral structure of human bone or used as a restorative resin for dental applications. Researchers are looking for ways to grow complex tissues with the goal of one-day growing human organs for transplant. Researchers are also studying ways to use graphene nanoribbons to help repair spinal cord injuries; preliminary research shows that neurons grow well on the conductive graphene surface.\nVaccine development: Nanomedicine researchers are looking at ways that nanotechnology can improve vaccines, including vaccine delivery without the use of needles. Researchers also are working to create a universal vaccine scaffold for the annual flu vaccine that would cover more strains and require fewer resources to develop each year.\nSmart pills: The term \u2018smart pills\u2019 refers to nano-level electronic devices that are shaped and designed like pharmaceutical pills but perform more advanced functions such as sensing, imaging, and drug delivery. Nanotechnology has previously helped in developing various kinds of smart pills, such as the PillCam, a capsule with a miniature video camera, and dose-tracking pills.\nNanobots: Nanobots are micro-scale robots, which essentially serve as miniature surgeons. They can be inserted into the body to repair and replace intracellular structures. They can also replicate themselves to correct a deficiency in genetics or even eradicate diseases by replacing DNA molecules. This property is still under development.\nNanofibres: Nanofibers are being used in wound dressings and surgical textiles, as well as in implants, tissue engineering, and artificial organ components. Scientists are working on developing \u2018smart bandages\u2019, which when left on the site, will absorb itself into the tissue once the wound heals. Embedded nanofibres in these smart bandages can contain clotting agents, antibiotics, and even sensors to detect signs of infection.\nCOVID\u201319: For image-based and clinical diagnostic of COVID-19, nanomaterials are emerging as promising substrates because of their unique optical, electronic, magnetic, and mechanical properties. Nanomaterials that have been proposed for viral detection include metal, silica, and polymeric nanoparticles, quantum dots, and carbon nanotubes.\nConcerns of using nanotechnology in healthcare\nToxicity: Scientists are primarily concerned about the toxicity, characterization, and exposure pathways associated with Nanomedicine that might pose a serious threat to human beings and the environment.\nLack of proper knowledge about the effect of nanoparticles on biochemical pathways and processes of the human body.\nExpensive processes and treatments make them less desirable.\n\nNanotechnology helps to overcome the limitations of conventional dosage forms. This technology promises to be used in disease treatment as well as diagnostics with high efficacy. Therefore, nanomedicine has been gaining widespread popularity. However, nanoparticles and nanotechnology, in general, is a relatively novel concept, and very little experimental data is available about their harmful effects. This lack of information may lead to impediments in the safety regulation of nanotherapeutics and present before us unique assessment challenges.\n\nPrevious year question\n\nWhat do you understand by nanotechnology and how is it helping in the health sector?
