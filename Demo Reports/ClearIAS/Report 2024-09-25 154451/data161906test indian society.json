Portuguese employed casta in the modern sense when they applied it to hereditary Indian social groups called as \u2018jati\u2019 in India. \u00a0\u2018Jati\u2019 originates from the root word \u2018Jana\u2019 which implies taking birth. Thus, caste is concerned with birth.\n\nAccording to Anderson and Parker, \u201cCaste is that extreme form of social class organization in which the position of individuals in the status hierarchy is determined by descent and birth.\u201d\n\nHow did Caste System originate in India: Various Theories\n\nThere are many theories like traditional, racial, political, occupational, evolutionary etc which try to explain the caste system in India.\n\n\ud83d\udc49 Which year are YOU targeting for success in the IAS/IPS/IFS Exam? \ud83d\ude80\n\n(1) \u21d2 UPSC 2025: Prelims cum Mains\n\n(2) \u21d2 UPSC 2026: Prelims cum Mains\n\n(3) \u21d2 UPSC 2027 Prelims cum Mains\n\nTip: Know more about ClearIAS Courses (Online/Offline)\n\n1.Traditional Theory\n\nAccording to this theory, the caste system is of divine origin. It says the caste system is an extension of the varna system, where the 4 varnas originated from the body of Bramha.\n\nAt the top of the hierarchy were the Brahmins who were mainly teachers and intellectuals and came from Brahma\u2019s head. Kshatriyas, or the warriors and rulers, came from his arms. Vaishyas, or the traders, were created from his thighs. At the bottom were the Shudras, who came from Brahma\u2019s feet. The mouth signifies its use for preaching, learning etc, the arms \u2013 protections, thighs \u2013 to cultivate or business, feet \u2013 helps the whole body, so the duty of the Shudras is to serve all the others. The sub-castes emerged later due to intermarriages between the 4 varnas.\n\nThe proponents of this theory cite Purushasukta\u00a0of Rigveda, Manusmriti etc to support their stand.\n\n2. Racial Theory\n\nThe Sanskrit word for caste is varna which means colour. The caste stratification of the Indian society had its origin in the chaturvarna system \u2013 Brahmins, Kashtriyas, Vaishyas and Shudras. Indian sociologist D.N. Majumdar writes in his book, \u201cRaces and Culture in India\u201d, the caste system took its birth after the arrival of Aryans in India.\n\nRig Vedic literature stresses very significantly the differences between the Arya and non-Aryans (Dasa), not only in their complexion but also in their speech, religious practices, and physical features.\n\nThe Varna system prevalent during the Vedic period was mainly based on division of labour and occupation. The three classes, Brahma, Kshatra and Vis are frequently mentioned in the Rig Veda. Brahma and Kshatra represented the poet-priest and the warrior-chief. Vis comprised all the common people. The name of the fourth class, the \u2018Sudra\u2019, occurs only once in the Rig Veda. The Sudra class represented domestic servants.\n\n3. Political Theory\n\nAccording to this theory, the caste system is a clever device invented by the Brahmins in order to place themselves on the highest ladder of social hierarchy.\n\nDr. Ghurye states, \u201cCaste is a Brahminic child of Indo-Aryan culture cradled in the land of the Ganges and then transferred to other parts of India.\u201d\n\nThe Brahmins even added the concept of spiritual merit of the king, through the priest or purohit in order to get the support of the ruler of the land.\n\n4. Occupational Theory\n\nCaste hierarchy is according to the occupation. Those professions which were regarded as better and respectable made the persons who performed them superior to those who were engaged in dirty professions.\n\nAccording to Newfield, \u201cFunction and function alone is responsible for the origin of caste structure in India.\u201d With functional differentiation there came in occupational differentiation and numerous sub-castes such as Lohar(blacksmith), Chamar(tanner), Teli(oil-pressers).\n\n5. Evolution Theory\n\nAccording to this theory, the caste system did not come into existence all of a sudden or at a particular date. It is the result of a long process of social evolution.\n\nHereditary occupations;\nThe desire of the Brahmins to keep themselves pure;\nThe lack of rigid unitary control of the state;\nThe unwillingness of rulers to enforce a uniform standard of law and custom\nThe \u2018Karma\u2019 and \u2018Dharma\u2019 doctrines also explain the origin of caste system. Whereas the Karma doctrine holds the view that a man is born in a particular caste because of the result of his action in the previous incarnation, the doctrine of Dharma explains that a man who accepts the caste system and the principles of the caste to which he belongs, is living according to Dharma. Confirmation to one\u2019s own dharma also remits on one\u2019s birth in the rich high caste and violation gives a birth in a lower and poor caste.\nIdeas of exclusive family, ancestor worship, and the sacramental meal;\nClash of antagonistic cultures particularly of the patriarchal and the matriarchal systems;\nClash of races, colour prejudices and conquest;\nDeliberate economic and administrative policies followed by various conquerors\nGeographical isolation of the Indian peninsula;\nForeign invasions;\nRural social structure.\n\nNote: It is from the post-Vedic period, the old distinction of Arya and Sudra appears as Dvija and Sudra, The first three classes are called Dvija (twice-born) because they have to go through the initiation ceremony which is symbolic of rebirth. \u201cThe Sudra was called \u201cekajati\u201d (once born).\n\nNote: Caste system developed on rigid lines post Mauryan period, especially after the establishment of Sunga dynasty by Pushyamitra Sunga (184 BC). This dynasty was an ardent patron of \u2018Brahminism\u2019. Through Manusmriti, Brahmins once again succeeded in organizing the supremacy and imposed severe restrictions on the Sudras. Manusmriti mentioned that, \u2018the Sudra, who insults a twice-born man, shall have his tongue cut out\u2019.\n\nNote: Chinese scholar Hieun Tsang, who visited India in 630 AD , writes that, \u201cBrahminism dominated the country, caste ruled the social structure and the persons following unclean occupations like butchers, scavengers had to live outside the city\u201d.\n\nPrincipal features of caste system in India\n\nSegmental Division of Society: The society is divided into various small social groups called castes. Each of these castes is a well developed social group, the membership of which is determined by the consideration of birth.\nHierarchy: According to Louis Dumont, castes teach us a fundamental social principle of hierarchy. At the top of this hierarchy is the Brahmin caste and at the bottom is the untouchable caste. In between are the intermediate castes, the relative positions of which are not always clear.\nEndogamy: Endogamy is the chief characteristic of caste, i.e. the members of a caste or sub-caste should marry within their own caste or sub-caste. The violation of the rule of endogamy would mean ostracism and loss of caste. However, hypergamy (the practice of women marrying someone who is wealthier or of higher caste or social status.) and hypogamy (marriage with a person of lower social status) were also prevalent. Gotra exogamy is also maintained in each caste. Every caste is subdivided into different small units on the basis of gotra. The members of one gotra are believed to be successors of a common ancestor-hence prohibition of marriage within the same gotra.\nHereditary status and occupation: Megasthenes, the Greek traveller to India in 300 B. C., mentions hereditary occupation as one of the two features of caste system, the other being endogamy.\nRestriction on Food and Drink: Usually a caste would not accept cooked food from any other caste that stands lower than itself in the social scale, due to the notion of getting polluted. There were also variously associated taboos related to food. The cooking taboo, which defines the persons who may cook the food. The eating taboo which may lay down the ritual to be followed at meals. The commensal taboo which is concerned with the person with whom one may take food. Finally, the taboo which has to do with the nature of the vessel (whether made of earth, copper or brass) that one may use for drinking or cooking. For eg: In North India Brahmin would accept pakka food (cooked in ghee) only from some castes lower than his own. However, no individual would accept kachcha(cooked in water) food prepared by an inferior caste. Food prepared by Brahmin is acceptable to all, the reason for which domination of Brahmins in the hotel industry for a long time. The beef was not allowed by any castes, except harijans.\nA Particular Name: Every caste has a particular name though which we can identify it. Sometimes, an occupation is also associated with a particular caste.\n\u00a0The Concept of Purity and Pollution: The higher castes claimed to have ritual, spiritual and racial purity which they maintained by keeping the lower castes away through the notion of pollution. The idea of pollution means a touch of lower caste man would pollute or defile a man of higher caste. Even his shadow is considered enough to pollute a higher caste man.\nJati Panchayat: The status of each caste is carefully protected, not only by caste laws but also by the conventions. These are openly enforced by the community through a governing body or board called Jati Panchayat. These Panchayats in different regions and castes are named in a particular fashion such as Kuldriya in Madhya Pradesh and Jokhila in South Rajasthan.\nVarna vs Caste \u2013 The difference\n\nVarna and caste are 2 different concepts, though some people wrongly consider it the same.\n\n\u00a0Varna\n\t\n\u00a0Caste\n\n\nLiterally \u2018Varna\u2019 means colour and originates from the world \u2018Vri\u2019 meaning the choice of one\u2019s occupation. Hence Varna is concerned with one\u2019s colour or occupation.\n\t\nCaste or \u2018Jati\u2019 originates from the root word \u2018Jana\u2019 which implies taking birth. Thus, caste is concerned with birth.\n\n\nVarna\u2019s are only four in number i.e. Brahmin, Kshatriya, Vaishya and Sudra\n\t\nCastes are very large in number. Castes also have many subdivisions known as sub-castes.\n\n\n\u00a0It is an all-India phenomenon\n\t\nPresence of regional variations mostly based on linguistic differences.\n\n\nMobility pattern Varna\u2019s are relatively flexible with one\u2019s talent and knowledge, compared with the castes.\n\t\nIt is based on rigid principles and mobility is less. It is a closed type of stratification\n\n\nVarna system is free from socio-economic and political disabilities\n\t\n\u00a0Imposes many restrictions on the members.\n\u00a0\n\n\nVarna-class correlation is mostly positive\n\t\nCaste-class correlation is not always positive, There may be variations in the placement due to economic, political arid educational status of various groups.\nFunctions of the caste system\nIt continued the traditional social organization of India.\nIt has accommodated multiple communities by ensuring each of them a monopoly of a specific means of livelihood.\nProvided social security and social recognition to individuals. It is the individual\u2019s caste that canalizes his choice in marriage, plays the roles of the state-club, the orphanage and the benefits society. Besides, it also provides him with health insurance benefits. It even provides for his funeral.\nIt has handed over the knowledge and skills of the hereditary occupation of a caste from one generation to another, which has helped the preservation of culture and ensured productivity.\nCaste plays a crucial role in the process of socialization by teaching individuals the culture and traditions, values and norms of their society.\nIt has also led to interdependent interaction between different castes, through jajmani relationships. Caste acted as a trade union and protected its members from the exploitation.\nPromoted political stability, as Kshatriyas were generally protected from political competition, conflict and violence by the caste system.\nMaintained racial purity through endogamy.\nSpecialization led to quality production of goods and thus promoted economic development. For eg: Many handicraft items of India gained international recognition due to this.\nDysfunctions of the caste system\n\nThe caste system is a check on economic and intellectual advancement and a great stumbling block in the way of social reforms because it keeps economic and intellectual opportunities confined to a certain section of the population only.\nIt undermines the efficiency of labour and prevents perfect mobility of labour, capital and productive effort\nIt perpetuates the exploitation of the economically weaker and socially inferior castes, especially the untouchables.\nIt has inflicted untold hardships on women through its insistence on practices like child-marriage, prohibition of widow-remarriage, seclusion of women etc.\nIt opposes real democracy by giving a political monopoly to Kshatriyas in the past and acting as a vote bank in the present political scenario. There are political parties which solely represent a caste. eg: BSP was formed by Kanshi Ram mainly to represent SC, ST and OBC.\nIt has stood in the way of national and collective consciousness and proved to be a disintegrating rather than an integrating factor. Caste conflicts are widely prevalent in politics, reservation in jobs and education, inter-caste marriages etc. eg: Demand for Jat reservation, agitation by Patidar community.\nIt has given scope for religious conversion. The lower caste people are getting converted into Islam and Christianity due to the tyranny of the upper castes.\nThe caste system by compelling an individual to act strictly in accordance with caste norms stands in the way of modernization, by opposing change.\nIs the caste system unique to India?\n\nThe caste system is found in other countries like Nepal, Pakistan and Sri Lanka. Caste-like systems are also found in countries like Indonesia, China, Korea, Yemen and certain countries in Africa, Europe as well.\n\nBut what distinguishes Indian caste system from the rest is the core theme of purity and pollution, which is either peripheral or negligible in other similar systems of the world. In\u00a0Yemen,\u00a0there exists a hereditary caste, Al-Akhdam\u00a0who are kept as perennial manual workers. Burakumin\u00a0in Japan, originally members of outcast communities in the\u00a0Japanese\u00a0feudal era, includes those with occupations considered\u00a0impure\u00a0or tainted by death.\n\nHowever, India is unique in some aspects.\n\nIndia has had a cultural continuity that no other civilization has had. The ancient systems, religions, cultures of other civilizations have been mostly gone. In India, history is present and even the external empires mostly co-opted the system rather than changing them.\nThe caste has been merged into a modern religion, making it hard to remove.\nIndia has integrated multiple systems more easily. What is known as \u201ccaste\u201d in Portuguese/English is actually made of 3 distinct components \u2013\u00a0jati, jana, varna.\u00a0Jati is an occupational identification. Jana is an ethnic identification. Varna is a philosophical identification. These have been more tightly merged over the centuries.\nIn the world\u2019s most transformative period \u2013 of the past 3 centuries, India spent most of it under European colonialism. Thus, India lost a lot of time changing. Most of the changes to the system came only in 1950 when India became a republic.\n\nTo summarize theoretically, caste as a cultural phenomenon (i.e., as a matter of ideology or value system) is found only in India while when it is viewed as a structural phenomenon, it is found in other societies too.\n\nThere are four sociological approaches to caste by distin\u00adguishing between the two levels of theoretical formulation, i.e., cultural and structural, and universalistic and particularistic. These four ap\u00adproaches are cultural-universalistic, cultural-particularistic, structural- universalistic and structural-particularistic.\n\nStructural-particularistic view of caste has maintained that the caste system is restricted to the Indian society\nStructural-universalistic category holds that caste in India is a general phenomenon of a closed form of social stratification found across the world.\nThe third position of sociologists like Ghurye who treat caste as a cultural universalistic phenome\u00adnon maintains that caste-like cultural bases of stratifica\u00adtion are found in most traditional societies. Caste in India is a special form of status-based social stratification. This viewpoint was early formulated by Max Weber.\nThe cultural-particularistic view is held by Louis Dumont who holds that caste is found only in India.\nIs the caste system unique to Hinduism?\n\nCaste-based differences are practised in other religions like Nepalese Buddhism, Christianity,\u00a0Islam,\u00a0Judaism\u00a0and\u00a0Sikhism. But the main difference is \u2013 caste system in Hinduism is mentioned in its scriptures while other religions adopted casteism as a part of socialization or religious conversions. In other words, the caste system in Hinduism is a religious institution while it is social in others.\n\nAs a general rule, higher castes converts became higher castes in other religions while lower caste converts acquired lower caste positions.\n\nIslam \u2013 Some upper caste Hindus converted to Islam and became part of the governing group of Sultanates and Mughal Empire, who along with Arabs, Persians and Afghans came to be known as Ashrafs. Below them are the middle caste Muslims calledAjlafs, and the lowest status is those of the\nChristianity \u2013 In Goa, Hindu converts became Christian\u00a0Bamonns\u00a0while Kshatriya\u00a0and\u00a0Vaishya became Christian noblemen called\u00a0Chardos. Those Vaishya who could not get admitted into the\u00a0Chardo\u00a0caste became\u00a0Gauddos, and\u00a0Shudras\u00a0became\u00a0Sudirs. Dalits\u00a0who converted to Christianity became\u00a0Mahars\u00a0and\u00a0Chamars\nBuddhism \u2013 various forms of the caste system are practised in several Buddhist countries, mainly in Sri Lanka, Tibet, and Japan where butchers, leather and metal workers and janitors are sometimes regarded as being impure.\nJainism \u2013 There are Jain castes wherein all the members of a particular caste are Jains. At the same time, there have been Jain divisions of several Hindu castes.\nSikhism \u2013 Sikh literature mentionVarna\u00a0as\u00a0Varan, and\u00a0Jati\u00a0as\u00a0Zat. Eleanor Nesbitt, a professor of Religion, states that the\u00a0Varan\u00a0is described as a class system, while\u00a0Zat\u00a0has some caste system features in Sikh literature. \u00a0All Gurus of Sikhs married within their\u00a0Zat, and they did not condemn or break with the convention of endogamous marriages.\nCaste Divisions \u2013 The future?\n\nThe caste system in India is undergoing changes due to progress in education, technology, modernization and changes in general social outlook. In spite of the general improvement in conditions of the lower castes, India has still a long way to go, to root out the evils of the caste system from the society.\n\nReferences:\nhttps://www.sociologyguide.com\nSociology for Nurses by Shama Lohumi\nIndian Social system by Ram Ahuja\n\nArticle contributed by: Rehna R.

However, after the 103rd constitutional amendment in 2019, economic backwardness is also considered.\n\nApart from the reservation quota, additional relaxations like upper-age relaxations, additional attempts, and lower cut-off marks are also provided for various reservation categories.\n\nReservation quota in India for Government Jobs\nReservation quota in India for Government Jobs and Higher Educational Institutions\n\nA vacancy reserved for SCs STs or OBCs cannot be filled by a candidate other than an SC ST or OBC candidate, as the case may be.\n\nAs seen from the above table, about 60% of seats are reserved in India \u2013\u00a0 for various sections like ST, SC, OBC, and EWS \u2013\u00a0with respect to Government jobs and Higher Education Institutions. 3% of seats are also reserved for differently-abled persons across all categories.\n\nThis also means that only 40% of seats are available under merit. In the merit seats,\u00a0not only the general category candidates but all other categories like SC, ST, OBC, and EWS can also compete.\n\nSC/ST Reservation\n\nThe objective of providing reservations to the Scheduled Castes(SCs), and Scheduled Tribes (STs) in services is not only to give jobs to some persons belonging to these communities. It basically aims at empowering them and ensuring their participation in the decision-making process of the State.\n\nBesides, the state is also keen to end practices such as untouchability.\n\nScheduled Castes (SC) are given a 15% quota in jobs/higher educational institutions while Schedule Tribes (ST) are given a 7.5% quota in jobs/higher educational institutions.\n\nReservation is provided not only with respect to direct recruitment but also with respect to promotions for the SC/ST category (Article 16(4A)).\n\nThere is no concept of a \u2018creamy layer\u2019 with respect to SC/ST reservation. This means that irrespective of the income status or the government posts held by the parents, children of SC/ST parents will get SC/ST Reservations.\n\nOBC Reservation\n\nReservation for Other Backwards Classes (OBC) was introduced based on the Mandal Commission Report (1991). The quota for OBCs is 27% in government jobs and higher educational institutions.\n\nHowever, there is a concept of a \u2018creamy layer\u2019 with respect to the OBC reservation. Only those from OBC who come under the Non-Creamy Layer would get an OBC reservation.\n\nThe creamy layer concept brings income and social status as parameters to exclude some of the privileged members of OBC from the extent of reservation. This concept also keeps a check to ensure that the benefits of reservation do not get extended to subsequent generations.\n\nRead more about the OBC Reservation Eligibility.\n\nEWS Reservation\n\nThe Central Government of India recently introduced EWS Reservation. A 10% quota is provided for the Economically Weaker Sections (EWS)\u00a0among General Category candidates in government jobs and educational institutions. This is done by adding clauses for the same in the Indian\u00a0Constitution (103rd Constitution Amendment Act, 2019).\n\nRead more about the EWS Reservation Eligibility\n\nHistory of Reservation System in India \u2013 Rectifying the Historical Injustice\n\nTo an extent, reservation as a policy is pursued by the State to correct the historical injustice done to certain castes by the so-called \u201cupper castes\u201d. The caste system that prevailed in India had alienated many \u201clower castes\u201d from the mainstream \u2013 hindering their development. To a great extent, the repercussions are still felt.\n\nThe original Consitution of India provided reservation only for quota in legislatures \u2013 that too only for 10 years until 1960 (article 334). Subsequent amendments to the constitution extended the period of reservation for quota in legislatures.\n\nProvisions of reservations in Educational Institutions and Government Jobs \u2013 article 15(4) and Article 16 (4) \u2013 were also created by means of Constitutional Amendments later. No time period is given for the validity of the reservations mentioned in Article 15(4) and Article 16(4).\n\nThe initial reservations were only for SC and ST [Article 15(4) and Article 16(4)]. OBCs were included in the ambit of reservation in 1991 [Article 15(5)]. In 2019, Economically Weaker Sections are also included [Article 15(6) and Article 16(6)].\n\nAlso read: Maratha quota law\n\nShould India need reservations (now)?\n\nIt\u2019s the duty of the government to provide\u00a0equality of status and opportunity in India.\n\nReservation is one of the tools against social oppression and injustice against certain classes. Otherwise known as affirmative action, reservation helps in uplifting backward classes.\n\nHowever, reservation is just one of the methods for social upliftment. There are many other methods like providing scholarships, funds, coaching, and other welfare schemes.\n\nThe way the reservation is implemented and executed in India is largely governed by vote-bank politics.\n\nIndian Consitution\u00a0allowed reservation only for\u00a0socially and educationally backward classes. However, in India, it became a caste-based reservation instead of a\u00a0class-based reservation.\n\nInitially, the reservation was intended only for SC/ST communities \u2013 that too for a period of 10 years (1951-1961). However, it has extended ever since. After the implementation of the Mandal Commission report in 1990, the scope of the reservation was widened to include Other Backward Communities (OBCs).\n\nThe benefits of the reservation were successively enjoyed only by a few communities (or families), excluding the truly deserving ones. Even 70 years after independence, the demand for reservations has only increased.\n\nNow, with the introduction of economic criteria for reservation, in addition to the caste criteria that already existed, things have become more complicated.\n\nUnequals should not be treated equally, but is reservation the only solution?\n\nThere is no doubt that unequal people should not be treated equally. However, is the current system of unequal treatment perfect? Is it creating more injustice? Is it the only way out in a welfare nation? It\u2019s time to introspect.\n\nReservation based entirely on economic criteria is not an all-in-one solution, though family income can be one of the parameters. Also, it\u2019s time to fix a time period for the reservation system \u2013 rather than extending it to eternity.\n\nDenying India, the service of the\u00a0meritorious candidates, who see them being overtaken by others with lesser academic performance or brilliance, is also a crime and injustice.\n\nAren\u2019t there any alternative mechanisms to uplift the marginalized so that everyone gets equal opportunities? How is affirmative action done in other countries?\n\nReforms in the reservation system of India are the need of the hour. However, as the subject of reservation revolves around a lot of votes, parties are reluctant to disrupt the existing system.\n\n50% Cap on Caste-Based Reservations\n\nIn Indra Sawhney vs Union Of India, 1992, the Supreme Court of India capped caste-based reservation, ruling that \u201cno provision of reservation or preference can be so vigorously pursued as to destroy the very concept of equality\u201d.\n\n\u201cSince this Court has consistently held that the reservation under Articles 15(4) and 16(4) should not exceed 50% and the States and the Union have by and large accepted this as correct it should be held as constitutional prohibition and any reservation beyond 50% would liable to be struck down.\u201d\n\nWhile introducing the bill for Economic Reservation in 2019, Arun Jaitley (Finance Minister) contended that the 50% cap on reservations imposed by the Supreme Court was only\u00a0for caste-based reservations, and the\u00a0Economically Weaker Section (EWS) reservation\u00a0won\u2019t be impacted by it.\n\nPoverty cannot be the basis for providing reservations: SC\n\nAs per Article 16(4), one of the main purposes of the reservation is to provide adequate representation of all classes (castes) in government services. Economic Reservation introduced by Article 16(6) is actually against this concept \u2013 as it does not take into consideration the caste-based representation.\n\nMoreover, the reservation is not a poverty alleviation scheme.\n\nSupreme Court had also ruled that economic status cannot be the sole criterion for reservation.\n\nMany states had tried to implement Economic Reservation, however, they were subsequently quashed by Courts.\n\nIntroducing the EWS bill in 2019, Union Social Justice and Empowerment Minister Thaawarchand Gehlot said the similar state laws for the EWS quota were quashed by Courts because there was no provision for economic reservation in the Constitution before.\u00a0 Now, the Law will not be struck down by the Supreme Court if challenged as it has been brought by making required provisions in the Constitution.\n\nWill the Reservation System in India compromise the Merit (and efficiency of the system)?\n\nArticle 335 of the Indian Constitution states that\n\nThe claims of the member of the Scheduled Castes and the Scheduled Tribes shall be\ntaken into consideration, consistently, with the maintenance of efficiency of administration in\nthe making of appointments to services and posts in connection with the affairs of the Union\nor of a State.\n\nProvided that nothing in this article shall prevent in the making of any provision in\nfavour of the members of the Scheduled Castes and the Scheduled Tribes for relaxation in\nqualifying marks in any examination or lowering the standards of evaluation, for reservation in\nmatters of promotion to any class or classes of services or posts in connection with the affairs\nof the Union or of a State.\n\nThere is no second question that all castes/classes should be adequately represented in government services. However, which percentage can be called adequate \u2013 without compromising the merit or efficiency of the administration?\n\nIs the current level of reservation adequate? Or is it less? Or has it already compromised the merit? What do you think?\n\nFrequently Asked Questions (FAQs)\n\nQ. What is the reservation percentage in India?\n\nAns: In India, reservation to the SCs, STs and OBCs in case of direct recruitment on an India basis by open competition is given at the rate of 15%, 7.5% and 27%\u00a0respectively.\n\nQ. How many reservations are there in India?\n\nAns: Reservation in India is provided to Scheduled Castes (SCs), Scheduled Tribes (STs) and Other Backward Classes (OBCs) at the rate of 15%, 7.5% and 27%, respectively, in case of direct recruitment on all India basis by open competition.\n\nQ. Who created reservations in India?\n\nAns: \u00a0William Hunter and Jyotirao Phule in 1882 originally conceived the idea of the caste-based reservation system. The reservation system that exists today, in its true sense, was introduced in 1933 when British Prime Minister Ramsay Macdonald presented the \u2018Communal Award\u2019. After long negotiations, Gandhi and Ambedkar signed the \u2018Poona Pact\u2019,\u00a0where it was decided that there would be a single Hindu electorate with certain reservations in it.\n\nRead:\u00a0\n\nMaratha Quota Law\nLocal reservation in private sector\nSub-classification of SCs and STs"

Its goal is to make that individual so uncomfortable that he decides to voluntarily leave the society.\n\nOstracism is a related practice \u2013 much eviler. Ostracism is the forcible expulsion of an individual from society for any reason, often accompanied by the confiscation of his property.\n\nTable of Contents\n\nWhy Social Boycott in news?\nProvisions of the\u00a0Social Boycott Prevention\u00a0Act\nWhat is the definition of Social Boycott?\nPenal Provisions\nWhy an Act against Social Boycott?\nImpact of the Act\nChallenges ahead\nConclusion\nWhy Social Boycott in news?\n\nMaharashtra, recently became the first state in India to enact a Social Boycott (Prevention, Prohibition and Redressal) Act, 2016 after it received the Presidential Assent on 13th July 2017. (Reference: TOI) In this article, we discuss in detail the provisions of the act, the reasons for the enactment of such an act, its possible impacts and challenges.\n\nProvisions of the\u00a0Social Boycott Prevention\u00a0Act\nWhat is the definition of Social Boycott?\n\nAccording to the act, if any individual or group tries to prevent or obstruct another members or group from observing any social or religious custom or usage or ceremony, or from taking part in a social, religious or community function, assembly, congregation, meeting or procession, the act amounts to social boycott.\nThe challenging of freedom of individuals in the name of jati panchayats, religion, customs or denying them the right to practice a profession of their choice amounts to social boycott as well.\nFreedom in the above context includes the freedom to marry outside one\u2019s caste, visit places of worship, wear clothes of one\u2019s choice and use of any specific language. Discrimination on the basis of morality, political inclination or sexuality also qualifies as an act of social boycott. As does stopping children from playing in a particular space, or disallowing access to burial grounds, community halls or educational institutions with mala fide intentions.\nPenal Provisions\nA Collector or District Magistrate/Deputy Commissioner, on receiving information of the likelihood of unlawful assembly for the imposition of social boycott can, by order, prohibit the assembly.\nConviction of the offence of social boycott will attract a prison term of up to three years and/or a fine up to rupees 1 lakh. Abetment by an individual or group will invite the same punishment as well.\nIt is a cognizable offence and bailable and will be tried by a Judicial Metropolitan Magistrate or a Judicial Magistrate of the First Class. To ensure speedy justice under the Act, the trial would have to be completed within a period of six months from the date of filing the charge sheet.\nWhy an Act against Social Boycott?\nIn India, since historical times, a legacy of caste system has been established which is carried forward to this date. Its manifestation can be seen this day itself.\nThe carrying out of jati panchayats of gavkis in Maharashtra and the infamous khap panchayats of Haryana are examples of the rigid implementation of the caste system.\nThese groups, after assembling, deliver extra judicial judgments, which are inhuman in nature but also go against the dignity of the individual and are at times, cruel and harsh.\nFor example, the naked parading of women in the entire village after applying black paint on their face, ostracizing particular individuals because they carried out acts which were against the so called established rules of the assemblies, whipping and lashing of individuals and in some cases, marrying of the rape victim to the perpetrator etc.\nThese extra judicial pronouncements are carried out to this date in rural areas of those places where caste system and caste hierarchy is very strongly observed.\nImpact of the Act\nWith the active involvement of the government and the bringing in of such an act against the evil of social boycott, it would be possible for the community individuals to exercise their Constitutional Rights more freely and with legal backing now. For example, people can now marry outside their caste, accessibility of public places and wells and temples cannot be denied.\nIn fact, the government has gone a step further by mentioning sexual orientation as one\u2019s personal choice and boycott on those lines will also attract penal provisions under the aforementioned act.\n\nChallenges ahead\nDespite a legal backing, there are fears of increased backlash amongst various communities residing in the nation.\nFor example, Orthodox elderly people of the villages who rigidly observe the caste system and its established customs might resist the empowerment of the so called lower castes of the villages and this might lead to a rise of the spate of honour killings. Also, this can lead to increased social unrest amongst the rural areas\nNational Crime Records Bureau (NCRB) data made available in 2014 says that there has been a sharp increase of up to 20% in the number of crimes committed against the Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes in the previous three years.\nThe rising awareness of their (SCs and STs) rights and the legal means that are available to get their rights enforced and prepare to make use of government mechanisms to protect their interests is one major reason for the rising crimes which is a logical corollary of the first point.\nConclusion\nThe Chief Minister of Maharashtra had mentioned while introducing the act that a state like Maharashtra, which has had such a rich legacy of social reformers who have contributed to the social development of the nation can\u2019t carry on with such regressive activities.\nMahatma Jyotirao Phule who had founded the Satyashodhak Samajh along with his wife Savitribai Phule. He had also started the first girls\u2019 school in India in 1848.\nSavitribai Phule had founded a shelter home, which attended to rape victims.\nBR Ambedkar, also called the Father of the Indian Constitution, was a pioneer of social reforms and waging a war against the caste system was also from Maharashtra.\nPandita Ramabai, who founded The Pandita Ramabai Mukti Mission in Maharashtra, which runs to this date.\nMahadev Govind Ranade, also known as Justice Ranade, who founded the Social Conference Movement and was a pioneer in social reforms was also from Maharashtr\nAnna Hazare, the leader of India Against Corruption Movement.\nNarendra Dabholkar, the founder of Maharashtra Andhashraddha Nirmoolan Samiti was the work force behind putting pressure on the government to implement the Social Boycott Act.\n\nThe government of Maharashtra has taken a step in the right direction. With legal backing for the prevention of social boycott activities, there will be a rise in individuals who can now exercise their rights in a much better manner and will also have an opportunity to lead their life better.\n\n\ud83d\udc49 Which year are YOU targeting for success in the IAS/IPS/IFS Exam? \ud83d\ude80\n\n(1) \u21d2 UPSC 2025: Prelims cum Mains\n\n(2) \u21d2 UPSC 2026: Prelims cum Mains\n\n(3) \u21d2 UPSC 2027 Prelims cum Mains\n\nTip: Know more about ClearIAS Courses (Online/Offline)\n\nAlso, with these rights already being mentioned in the Constitution, it will lead to better usage of Fundamental Rights by various individuals.

            "[META]": "Last updated on September 4, 2024 by ClearIAS Team",
            "[CONTENT]": "India is an agrarian country with around 70% of its people depending directly or indirectly upon agriculture. But farmers\u2019 suicides in India is worrying.\n\nAs per the Central Government despite a multi-pronged approach to improving income and social security of farmers, over 12,000 suicides were reported in the agricultural sector every year since 2013. Farmer suicides account for approximately 10% of all suicides in India. (Reference: TOI)\n\nThere is no denying that the menace of farmer\u2019s suicides exists and runs counter to the aspirations of reaping benefits of our demographic dividend. In this article, we are analysing the farmers\u2019 suicides in India and its related data, the reasons and the way forward.\n\nTable of Contents\n\nFarmers\u2019 Suicides \u2013 What do the facts say?\nWhat are the reasons behind\u00a0farmers\u2019 suicides in India?\nIs Suicide a matter of economics?\nResponses to farmers\u2019 suicides\nWay Ahead\nFarmers\u2019 Suicides \u2013 What do the facts say?\nThe list includes\u00a0farmers-cultivators and agricultural labourers.\nSeven states account for 87.5% of total suicides in the farming sector in the country. The states are Maharashtra, Karnataka, Telangana,\u00a0Madhya Pradesh,\u00a0Chhattisgarh,\u00a0Andhra Pradesh and Tamil Nadu 606.\nBoth marginal farmers and small farmers are committing suicide.\nMaharashtra is the worst affected state.\nIronically, Punjab, which benefited most from the Green Revolution, also presents a depressing picture of farmer\u2019s suicides in India. Between 1995-2015, 4687 farmers\u2019 suicides have been reported from the state of Punjab of which 1334 from one Mansa district alone.\nWhat are the reasons behind\u00a0farmers\u2019 suicides in India?\n\nScholars have given various reasons such as monsoon failure, climate change, high debt burdens, government policies, mental health, personal issues and family problems among the reasons for farmers\u2019 suicides in India. Let\u2019s analyse.\n\nThe surge in input costs:\u00a0A major cause of the farmers\u2019 suicides in India has been the increasing burden on the farmers due to inflated prices of agricultural inputs.\u00a0The culmination of these factors is seen in the overall increase in the cost of cultivation, for wheat, the cost at present is three times than it was in 2005.\nCost of chemicals and seeds: Be it the fertilisers, crop protection chemicals or even the seeds for cultivation, farming has become expensive for the already indebted farmers.\nCosts of Agricultural equipment:\u00a0 The input costs, moreover, aren\u2019t limited to the basic raw materials. Using agricultural equipment and machinery like tractors, submersible pumps etc adds to the already surging costs. Besides, these secondary inputs have themselves become less affordable for the small and marginal farmers.\nLabour costs: Likewise, hiring labourers and animals is getting costlier too. While this may reflect an improvement in the socio-economic status of the labourers, driven primarily by MGNERGA and hike in minimum basic income, this has not gone too well with boosting the agriculture sector.\nDistressed due to loans:\nNCRB data points out that in 2474 suicides out of the studied 3000 farmer suicides in 2015 the victims had unpaid loans from local banks. This is clear enough an indication for drawing correlations between the two. Whether or not the banks had been harassing them, however, is a long-drawn debate and needs more specific empirical evidence.\nMoreover, a shift away from the usual trend also revealed that of the loans taken by these farmers, only 9.8% were loaned from money-lenders. Thus the pressure or muscle-power of money-lenders could be far from being a major driving force, as is otherwise perceived.\nAnother source of strong linkages between farmer suicides and indebtedness is reflected from the spread of the two. While Maharashtra had 1293 suicides for indebtedness, Karnataka had 946. Note that both these states saw one of the highest incidences of farmer suicides as well as indebtedness.\nLack of direct integration with the market:\u00a0Although initiatives like the National Agricultural Market and contract farming are helping integrate the farmers\u2019 produce directly with the market, cutting the role of intermediaries, the reality is still lagging behind.\nLack of awareness: The digital divide, as well as the literacy gap, has made the marginal and small farmers particularly vulnerable due to their inability to utilise the positives of government policies. This is reflected in the continued unsustainable cropping practices \u2013 like cultivating sugarcane in water-deficit regions.\nWater crisis: The concentration of these suicides in the water-deficit regions of states like Maharashtra, Karnataka is a manifestation of how the water crisis and thereby failure to meet production demands have intensified the menace. This is particularly true in the backdrop of continued failed monsoons.\nInterstate water disputes:\u00a0What has added to the already prevalent crisis is the unwillingness to cater to each other\u2019s water needs amongst the states. A case in point is the recently resurfaced Kaveri dispute that saw Karnataka and Tamil Nadu battle out water shortage both in and outside the tribunal even to the extent of non-compliance with the tribunal award.\nClimate change has acted as the last nail in the coffin by resulting in furthering of the uncertainties associated with the already uncertain monsoon system and hence agricultural production. While incidents like flash floods have led to crop losses, deferred monsoons have seen production shortfall year-in and year-out\nIndia\u2019s urban consumer-driven economic policies: The political economy of India is driven more by urban consumers than rural producers. This is reflected in the urgency to impose price controls in case of price rise (imposing Minimum Export Prices, bringing items under Essential Commodities etc) and a lacklustre withdrawal once the price is under control. Contrast this with how we have been imposing a minimum import price to secure our steel sector. This differential treatment to primary sector also limits profit margin and thereby hinders farmers\u2019 chances of breaking free from the cycle of indebtedness.\nLoan waivers instead of restructuring, re-investment measures: Our approach of handling farmer indebtedness and hence farmer suicides have been appeasement politics like the recent move by the UP government to waive off Rs 36000 crore worth of loans. Surprisingly this comes at a time when the agricultural yield is expected to be better in the wake of a good monsoon.\nIn essence, the factors sum up to crop failure, unsustainable production and subsequent farmer indebtedness leading to failure of strengthening the economic state of the farmer as the driving force behind these suicides.\nIs Suicide a matter of economics?\n\nThe National Mental Health Association of the USA states that \u201cNo matter the race or age of the person; how rich or poor they are, it is true that most people who commit suicide have a mental or emotional disorder\u201d. Suicide is not a matter of economics.\n\n\ud83d\udc49 Which year are YOU targeting for success in the IAS/IPS/IFS Exam? \ud83d\ude80\n\n(1) \u21d2 UPSC 2025: Prelims cum Mains\n\n(2) \u21d2 UPSC 2026: Prelims cum Mains\n\n(3) \u21d2 UPSC 2027 Prelims cum Mains\n\nTip: Know more about ClearIAS Courses (Online/Offline)\n\nThis is well supported by the data released by World Health Organisation in 2011: while the suicide rate in India, an agrarian economy, was 13 per 100,000; that of industrialised, rich countries were often higher or comparable\u2013 South Korea \u2013 28.5, Japan \u2013 20.1, Russia \u2013 18.2, USA- 12.6, Australia- 12.5, and UK-11.8. (Reference \u2013 Hindustan Times)\n\nResponses to farmers\u2019 suicides\n\nSome of the major relief packages and debt waiver schemes announced by the government are summarised below:\n\n2006 relief package \u2013 primarily aimed at 31 districts in the four states of Andhra Pradesh, Maharashtra, Karnataka, and Kerala with a high relative incidence of farmers suicides.\nAgricultural debt waiver and debt relief scheme, 2008 \u2013\u00a0Agricultural Debt Waiver and Debt Relief Scheme in 2008 benefited over 36 million farmers at a cost of 65000 crore rupees (US$10 billion). This spending was aimed at the writing of part of loan principal as well as the interest owed by the farmers.\n2013 diversify income sources package \u2013\u00a0In 2013, the Government of India launched a\u00a0Special Livestock Sector and Fisheries Package\u00a0for farmers suicide-prone regions of Andhra Pradesh, Maharashtra, Karnataka and Kerala. The package was aimed to diversify income sources of farmers.\n\nApart from these Central Government initiatives, there are many efforts from the state governments side like\u00a0Maharashtra Bill to regulate farmer loan terms, 2008 and\u00a0Kerala Farmers\u2019 Debt Relief Commission (Amendment) Bill, 2012.\n\nWay Ahead\n\nPolicies of integrated pest management\u00a0to prevent pest damage \u2013 An all-inclusive approach that integrates biological, chemical, mechanical and physical methodology should be used to prevent crop damage. In this case, seeking inspiration from Vietnam\u2019s no-spray early rule (predatory beetles are sustained for biological pest control, cutting pesticide requirement by 50%) can be a good way to start.\nLower fertilizer costs \u2013 Helping fertiliser industries cut down on costs, through internal funding rather than external borrowing should lower the input costs.\nLeveraging advancements in Science and Technology by ensuring that state seed policies focus on new genotypes, contract farming and sensitization to adverse weather conditions.\nPrecision farming techniques like SRI (Systematic Rice Intensification) must be encouraged.\nFarm equipment policy must focus on imported equipment to provide for cheaper local manufacture, some incentives like grant of duty credit scrips may be tried.\nSubsidies must be rerouted towards capital generation and entrepreneurial Custom Hiring Centers\u00a0(CHCs) and the implementation must be ensured in a timely fashion.\nCorporate Social Responsibility (CSR) must be encouraged in the agricultural sector, particularly towards capacity-building, skill development and the establishment of CHCs.\nInstitutional financing must also be ensured to be adequate and inclusive rather than catering to the elites within the farming community.\nCooperative farming must be promoted amongst small and marginal farmers to ensure that they are not left lurking while the big farmers reap the benefit at their cost.\nDoubling the farmer income by 2022 is a healthy aim, but loan waivers can\u2019t be the answer. Instead, sustainable agriculture that thrives on re-investment & restructuring is the way ahead. The role that the state has been playing is one of emancipation, but what the primary sector and the farmer needs is empowerment.\nDirect interventions:\nEarly-warning signals for unsustainable loans to launch a 2-pronged approach catering to both the burdened farmers as well as stressed banks.\nOptions for restructuring loans must be used wherever possible.\nInsurance claim settlements must be speedy and just.\nDistrict wise list of indebted farmers and efforts in de-stressing them through counselling and other alternative mechanisms should be tried.\nNABARD and local administration must take control of the situation and play a greater role in curbing farmers\u2019 suicides.\nInnovative efforts like Crowdfunding can be employed through the involvement of Civil Society Organizations (CSOs).\nEfforts like Agro-Climatic zoning, education through DD Kisan, Soil Health Card Scheme, various crop insurance and facilitative schemes like PM Krishi Sinchayi Yojana will go a long way in helping out\nCommunity-led awareness must be taken employing a role model approach highlighting progress of farmers who have benefited from sustainable & climate-tailored agricultural practices\n\nAlso read:\u00a0\n\nSuicide Prevention Policy\nNew Schemes for Farmers\n\nArticle by: S S Naik, with inputs from ClearIAS Team"

Across India\u2019s population of over 1.2 billion people, all forms of modern slavery, including inter-generational bonded labour, trafficking for sexual exploitation and forced marriage, exist. Evidence suggests that members of lower castes and tribes, religious minorities and migrant workers are disproportionately affected by modern slavery. Modern slavery occurs in brick kilns, carpet weaving, embroidery and other textile manufacturing, forced prostitution, agriculture, domestic servitude, mining, and organised begging rings. Labour is particularly prevalent throughout India with families enslaved for generations.\nThere are reports of women and children from India being recruited with promises of non-existent jobs and later sold for sexual exploitation, or forced into sham marriages. In some religious groups, pre-pubescent girls are sold for sexual servitude in temples. Recent reports suggest that one child goes missing every eight minutes; it is feared that some are sold into forced begging, domestic work, and commercial sexual exploitation.\nOn paper, criminal justice reforms specific to human trafficking are the strongest component of India\u2019s response to modern slavery. In 2013, the government amended the Indian Penal code to include specific anti-trafficking provisions. In 2014, the government expanded the number of police anti-human trafficking units across the country to 215 units, aiming to establish a unit in 650 districts.\nThe judiciary and over 20,000 law enforcement have received training on victim identification, the new legal framework, and victim-centered investigations.\nDalits have the least social protections and are highly vulnerable to severe forms of exploitation and modern slavery.

Assam, Meghalaya, Nagaland, Jammu & Kashmir, Tripura, Mizoram, Bihar, Manipur, Arunachal Pradesh, and Tamil Nadu, accounting for another 15.3% of the total Scheduled Tribe population. The share of the remaining states / Uts is negligible.\nThe Scheduled Tribes in India form the largest proportion of the total population in Lakshadweep and Mizoram followed by Nagaland and Meghalaya.\nMadhya Pradesh has the largest number of scheduled Tribes followed by Orissa.\nBastar district of Chattisgarh consists of the largest number of Scheduled Tribes.\nThere are no Scheduled Tribes in Punjab, Delhi, Chandigarh, Pondicherry, Haryana.\nIn Lok Sabha, there is a reservation of seats for Scheduled Tribes. Here also census figures are taken into account. Allocation of seats for Scheduled Tribes in the Lok Sabha are made on the basis of the proportion of Scheduled Tribes in the State concerned to that of the total population, vide provision contained in Article 330 of the Constitution of India read with Section 3 of the R. P. Act, 1950.\nFor Scheduled Tribes, 47 seats are reserved in Lok Sabha. The 1st schedule to R. P. Act, 1950\u00a0 as amended vide Representation of People (Amendment) Act, 2008 gives the Statewise break up\nScheduled Tribes\n\nArticle 366 (25) defined scheduled tribes as \u201csuch tribes or tribal communities or parts of or groups within such tribes or tribal communities as are deemed under Article 342 to be Scheduled Tribes for the purposes of this constitution\u201d.\n\nArticle 342 in The Constitution Of India 1949\n\nScheduled Tribes\n\n(1) The President may with respect to any State or Union territory, and where it is a State, after consultation with the Governor thereof, by public notification, specify the tribes or tribal communities or parts of or groups within tribes or tribal communities which shall for the purposes of this Constitution be deemed to be Scheduled Tribes in relation to that State or Union territory, as the case may be\n\n(2) Parliament may by law include in or exclude from the list of Scheduled Tribes specified in a notification issued under clause ( 1 ) any tribe or tribal community or part of or group within any tribe or tribal community, but save as aforesaid a notification issued under the said clause shall not be varied by any subsequent notification PART XVII OFFICIAL LANGUAGE CHAPTER I LANGUAGE OF THE UNION.\n\nMinistry of Tribal Affairs\n\nThe Ministry of Tribal Affairs is responsible for the overall development of the scheduled tribes in India. This Ministry was set up in 1999 after the bifurcation of the Ministry of Social Justice and Empowerment with the objective of providing a more focused approach on the integrated socio-economic development of the Scheduled Tribes (STs), the most underprivileged of the Indian Society, in a coordinated and planned manner.\n\nThe Ministry of Tribal Affairs shall be the nodal Ministry for overall policy, planning and coordination of programmes of development for the Scheduled Tribes. In regard to sectoral programmes and schemes of development of these communities policy, planning, monitoring, evaluation etc. as also, their coordination will be the responsibility of the concerned Central Ministries/ Departments, State Governments and Union Territory Administrations. Each Central Ministry/Department will be the nodal Ministry or Department concerning its sector.\n\nBefore the formation of the Ministry, tribal affairs were handled by different Ministries as follows:\n\nAs a Division of the Ministry of Home Affairs named as \u2018Tribal Division\u2019 since independence up to September 1985.\nMinistry of Welfare: From September 1985 to May 1998.\nMinistry of Social Justice & Empowerment from May 1998 to September 1999.\nNational Commission for Scheduled Tribes (NCST)\n\nThe National Commission for Scheduled Tribes (NCST) was established by amending Article 338 and inserting a new Article 338A in the Constitution through the Constitution (89th Amendment) Act, 2003. By this amendment, the erstwhile National Commission for Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes was replaced by two separate Commissions namely- (i) the National Commission for Scheduled Castes (NCSC), and (ii) the National Commission for Scheduled Tribes (NCST) w.e.f. 19 February 2004.\n\nThe Tribal Sub Plan (TSP) strategy\n\nThe Tribal Sub Plan (TSP) strategy is a Government of India initiative aimed for the rapid socio-economic development of tribal people. The funds provided under the Tribal Sub Plan of the State have to be at least equal in proportion to the ST population of each State or UTs.\n\nSimilarly, Central Ministries/Departments are also required to earmark funds out of their budget for the Tribal Sub-Plan. As per guidelines issued by the Planning Commission, the Tribal Sub Plan funds are to be non-divertible and non-lapsable.\n\nThe National Commission for Scheduled Tribes is vested with the duty to participate and advise in the planning process of socio-economic development of STs, and to evaluate the progress of their development under the Union and any State.\n\nReference:\n\nMinistry of Tribal Affairs\nMinistry of Law and Justice\nCensusIndia\n\nRelated article:\u00a0De-notified, Nomadic, and Semi-Nomadic Tribes (DNTs)\n\nArticle by: Priyanka Sunil"

In 2021, till September 30 around 1,11,287 Indians have given up their citizenships.\n\nIn the past two decades, there has been a continuous outflow of Indians, except during the 2008 financial crisis and in 2020-21 due to Covid-19 related travel bans.\n\n\ud83d\udc49 Which year are YOU targeting for success in the IAS/IPS/IFS Exam? \ud83d\ude80\n\n(1) \u21d2 UPSC 2025: Prelims cum Mains\n\n(2) \u21d2 UPSC 2026: Prelims cum Mains\n\n(3) \u21d2 UPSC 2027 Prelims cum Mains\n\nTip: Know more about ClearIAS Courses (Online/Offline)\n\nIndia has become a major exporter of healthcare workers to developed nations particularly to the Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) countries, Europe, and other English-speaking countries. As per OECD data, around 69,000 Indian-trained doctors worked in the UK, US, Canada, and Australia in 2017. In these four countries, 56,000 Indian-trained nurses were working in the same year. Hence, there is also large-scale migration of health workers from India.\n\nAlso read: Remote voting for migrants\n\nWhy are Indians emigrating?\n\nIndian competence, linguistic prowess, and a higher level of education are a few of the attractions for countries, which have eased visa rules to attract talent. As the opportunities become scarcer here, the foreign countries are ever more aware of the multi-talented Indian engineers, doctors, and scientists with English language prowess as well.\n\nThe reasons for this brain drain can be substantiated into a few key categories-\n\nPush factors for brain drain:\nLack of higher education opportunities: The increasing cut-offs and legion of competitive exams make access to higher education difficult in India. Abroad, they have an advantage over students from other countries in terms of skills and knowledge.\nLack of financial research support: India\u2019s Gross domestic expenditure on research has stayed at 0.7% of the GDP for years. India has one of the lowest GERD/GDP ratios among the BRICS nations. So, the minds in R&D tend to migrate to other countries to continue their research.\nLower-income: Developed countries offer better pay to sectors like health, research, IT, etc. Income is one of the main triggers of emigration from India.\nNon-recognition of talents: The chances of being recognized in one\u2019s field are difficult in a populace this large and with conventions preferring the glamour world over academic talent; bright minds choose foreign countries where their work is appreciated more.\nPull factors for brain drain:\nBetter standard of living: The developed countries provide better living standards, salaries, tax benefits, etc, which becomes a great attraction for emigration.\nImproved quality of life: It is unarguable that the facilities available abroad are yet to be matched with by developing countries, and hence till that level of life quality is achieved, migrations will continue.\nSocietal pressure: Indian youth are becoming more liberal and personal with their life, and the society here is yet to come to terms with the kind of lifestyle. Hence, the pressure to live a certain way among the Indian society is curbing the freedom of choice of today\u2019s youths, encouraging them to seek western countries where the society is more liberal non-interfering.\nEasy migration policies: The developed nations are easing migration policies to attract talents to boost their economy. They target Asians specifically to take up intellectual labour.\nBetter remuneration: The better pay and living standard offered by developing countries is, of course, a foremost reason for emigration.\n\nAlso read: Refugee Crisis in India; Labor migration\n\nThe effect of brain drain on the Indian health sector:\n\nThe emigration of health workers from India to GCC and western countries has been taking place for decades. And this is part of the reason for the shortage of nurses and doctors.\n\nAs per government reports, India has 1.7 nurses per 1,000 population and a doctor to patient ratio of 1:1,404 which is well below the WHO norm of three nurses per 1,000 population and a doctor to patient ratio of 1:1,100.\n\nThere are strong pull factors associated with the migration of healthcare workers, in terms of higher pay and better opportunities in the destination countries.\n\nBut the push factors are what often drive these workers to migrate abroad.\n\nIn the case of nurses in India, the low wages in private sectors, along with reduced opportunities in the public sector plays a big role in them seeking employment opportunities outside the country.\nThe lack of government investment in healthcare and delayed appointments to public health institutions act as a catalyst for such migration.\n\nDeveloped countries were in desperate need of retaining their healthcare workers, so they adopted migrant-friendly policies during the beginning of the pandemic.\n\nOECD countries exempted health professionals from a job offer from the travel bans.\nSome countries processed visa applications of healthcare workers even during the lockdown period.\nThe UK has granted free one-year visa extensions to eligible overseas healthcare workers and their dependents whose visas were due to expire before October this year.\nFrance has offered citizenship to frontline immigrant healthcare workers during the pandemic.\n\nThe Indian government\u2019s policies to check brain drain do not provide long-term solutions, rather they are restrictive.\n\nIn 2014, they stopped issuing\u00a0No Objection to Return to India (NORI)certificates to doctors migrating to the US.\nThe NORI certificate is a US government requirement for doctors who migrate to America on a J1 visa and seek to extend their stay beyond three years.\nThe government has included nurses in the Emigration Check Required (ECR) category. This move was taken to bring about transparency in nursing recruitment and reduce the exploitation of nurses in the destination countries.\n\nThe need of the hour is for increased investment in healthcare which has been evident throughout the pandemic. The 2020 Human Development Report shows that India has five hospital beds per 10,000 people which is one of the lowest in the world.\n\nIncreased investment in healthcare, especially in the public sector is essential as this would increase employment opportunities for health workers.\n\nRelated concepts: Brain Gain and Reverse Brain Drain\n\nThere are few positive outcomes of such emigrations too occasionally which can be summarised under Brain gain and Reverse brain drain theories.\n\nBrain Gain:\nThe movement of skilled workers internationally represents brain gain for the countries that reap their skills.\nThe young population that goes abroad has a very limited skill set. They improve their skills abroad through higher education and job experience, so when they return, they bring back brainpower. Some label it as Brain Circulation also.\nThen the internal migrations of the skilled and unskilled lot have resulted in the formation of major industrial / tech hubs.\nReverse Brain Drain:\nWhen the professionals return to their home country after a few years of experience and open a business, join a research university, or work in an MNC in the home country, it is called \u201cReverse Brain Drain\u201d.\nReverse brain drain occurs when human capital moves in reverse order from a more developed country to a less developed or rapidly developing country.\nThese migrants accumulate savings, also known as remittances, and develop skills abroad and use them in their home country.\nIndia has a large diaspora scattered around the world. Indian skilled professionals who have been trained and based in other countries are returning home in increasing numbers to take advantage of the country\u2019s positive economic growth and employment opportunities in the STEM field.\nReturnees with good work experience and entrepreneurial skills are setting up successful start-ups with the added advantage of their global networks and links to international venture capitals.\nGovernment\u2019s stance on Brain drain\n\nIndia does not offer dual citizenship hence people seeking citizenship in other countries must give up their Indian passport. However, Indians who renounce citizenship can still apply for an Overseas Citizen of India (OCI) card, which gives them the benefit of residing and even running a business in India.\n\nThe Indian government has a simple online process for citizenship renouncing, making it clear that they are much worried about the outflow of the talented population.\n\nA reason for this is maybe the fact that the expatriates have become huge financial assets for India through remittances and investments. NRI remittances have been a major contributor to India\u2019s forex receipts though motivated by personal gains.\n\nSome schemes have been devised by the government to bring back Indian scientists like-\n\n\u2018The Ramanujan Fellowship, Innovation in Science Pursuit for Inspired Research (INSPIRE) Programme\u2019 to encourage scientists and engineers of Indian origin from all over the world to take up scientific research positions in India, especially those scientists who want to return to India from abroad.\nThe Ramalingaswamy Fellowship, for providing a platform for scientists who are willing to return and work in India.\nVaishvik Bharatiya Vaigyanik (VAIBHAV) summit:\u00a0Under this, Numerous overseas Indian-origin academicians and Indians participated to form ideas on innovative solutions to several challenges.\nScheme for Transformational and Advanced Research in Sciences\u00a0(STARS),\u00a0Scheme for Promotion of Academic and Research Collaboration\u00a0(SPARC), and Impactful Policy Research in Social Science(IMPRESS) with the common objective to boost India-specific research in social and pure sciences.\nWay forward\n\nIndia needs systematic changes to build an overall environment that would be beneficial for the talented enough to motivate them to stay in the country.\n\nThe government should focus on framing policies that promote circular migration and return migration. Like policies that incentivize professionals to return home after the completion of their training or studies would be welcomed.\n\nIndia could also hold talks to frame\u00a0bilateral agreements\u00a0for a policy of\u00a0\u201cbrain-share\u201d\u00a0between the\u00a0sending and receiving countries.\n\nPotential Mains Questions:\n\u201cIndia\u2019s brain drain is West\u2019s brain gain.\u201d Critically discuss why India\u2019s scientists move to foreign countries and excel. Do you think brain drain is a thing of the past, especially in the field of science? Examine.

It is a general term used to describe situations of exploitative nature in which the person cannot refuse or leave due to threats, violence, deception, and abuse of power.\nModern slavery includes exploitative acts such as forced labour and debt bondage, forced marriage, and human trafficking.\nForced labour and Debt bondage in India\nBonded labour is defined in the Bonded Labour System (Abolition) Act of 1976 as a system of forced or partly forced labour in which a debtor gets an advance of cash or kind in return for his labour or service to the creditor.\nForced labour and debt bondage are common practice across all the economic sectors in India.\nIt is mainly found\u00a0in certain industries such as brick kilns, carpet weaving, textile and garment manufacturing, embroidery, manual scavenging and agriculture.\nWho is affected by debt bondage?\nThe most affected people of debt bondage are the members of marginalised castes, tribes, religious minorities, refugees and migrant workers.\nThere are also instances of Nepali and Bangladeshi migrants being subjected to forced labour in India through debt bondage and recruitment fraud.\nWhat are the causes of forced labour in India?\nThe social and economic marginalisation of weaker sections and their inability to move out of their respective group makes them particularly vulnerable to forced labour and human trafficking.\nAbout 94% of the workforce in India are employed under informal and unregulated sectors. And the debt bondage continues to be prevalent in these sectors. Moreover, the lack of labour regulations in these sectors creates huge power imbalances in employer-worker relationships and increases workers\u2019 vulnerability to exploitation. Note- Labour legislation only available for formal sectors.\nChronic underpayment of minimum wages in low-skilled and semi-skilled work is also a major reason for debt bondage because due to the non-payment, the large-scale workforce has to depend on debt bondage to meet basic consumption needs, medical needs, social ritual needs etc.\nMost often, the members of the vulnerable groups lack good livelihood opportunities and access to credit and financial services, which makes them vulnerable to constant indebtedness.\nFailure of authorities to effectively implement measures to address the issue is also a reason for the prevalence of forced labour in India.\nWhat are the impacts of forced labour?\n\n\ud83d\udc49 Which year are YOU targeting for success in the IAS/IPS/IFS Exam? \ud83d\ude80\n\n(1) \u21d2 UPSC 2025: Prelims cum Mains\n\n(2) \u21d2 UPSC 2026: Prelims cum Mains\n\n(3) \u21d2 UPSC 2027 Prelims cum Mains\n\nTip: Know more about ClearIAS Courses (Online/Offline)\n\nThe labourers under forced labour and debt bondage are most often experience a wide range of exploitations such as contract substitution, holding back of the documents, non-payment or delayed payment of wages, exhausting working hours, deception and coercion.\nIn extreme cases, this exploitation becomes human trafficking for labour exploitation or slavery.\nFurthermore, higher degrees of poverty and illiteracy remain among these communities than the general population due to the forced labour practice.\nWhat are the measures taken by the government against forced labour?\nBonded labour System (Abolition) Act, 1976 was enacted by the government in order to provide a legal framework against the practice of bonded labour in India. The Act is strengthened by labour legislation such as the Contract Labour Act of 1970, the Inter-State Migrant Workmen Act, and the Minimum Wages Act. The Act abolished debt bondage and explicitly stated that all traditions, customs, contracts, and agreements which requires a person to provide bonded labour are null and do not have any legal or binding force. It also abolished bonded labour and provides for corporate and criminal liability which prescribes up to three years of imprisonment and a 2000 rupees fine for the acts of bonded labour. The act also provides for the establishment of vigilance committees across the country in order to identify and help the bonded labourers.\nThe Child and Adolescent Labour (Prohibition and Regulation) Act, 1986 prohibits the engagement of children in all occupations and to prohibit the engagement of adolescents in hazardous occupations and processes. (Refer:\u00a0Child Labour (Prohibition and Regulation) Amendment\u00a0Act, 2016)\nJuvenile Justice Act of 2010 outlaws exploitation of juvenile or child workers such as procurement of juvenile for hazardous employments, keeping them in debt bondage, or withholding their wages.\nLabour laws \u2013 There are over 40 central legislation which is classified by industry or type of work and cover a wide range of work in factories, plantations and construction work. These legislations deals with issues such as minimum wage, maximum working hours, health, safety and working conditions.\nHow is the implementation?\nWith 90% of workers in the informal sectors in the country, the labour legislation is ineffective since it covers only formal sectors.\nDespite the abolition, debt bondage is still prevalent in India mainly because of the low prosecution rate for these crimes and in the case of a conviction, the penalties of imprisonment are imposed very rarely.\nAccording to Anti-slavery international, large numbers of Vigilance Committees have been established across India with an aim to identify and help bonded labourers. However, in reality, these committees are generally inactive and ineffective in its functioning.\nWhat is the way forward?\nInstead of just focussing on capturing and prosecuting the criminals, the government should also focus on addressing the root causes such as huge informal sector, marginalisation of communities, lack of financial and credit services, lack of livelihood opportunities etc.\nHuman trafficking in India\n\n[click_to_tweet tweet=\u201dAccording to the UN Office on Drugs and Crime, South Asia with India at its centre, is the fastest growing and second-largest region for human trafficking in the world, after East Asia.\u201d quote=\u201dAccording to the UN Office on Drugs and Crime, South Asia with India at its centre, is the fastest growing and second-largest region for human trafficking in the world, after East Asia.\u201d]\n\nAbout 90% of trafficking in India is internal and the most vulnerable are lower caste people, tribal people, religious minorities and women and girls from excluded groups.\n\nWhat are the causes of human trafficking in India?\nThe rise in mobility and growth of industries employing forced labourers are important factors for human trafficking.\nLack of regulations for work placement agencies which attracts adults and children for sex trafficking and forced labour including domestic servitude under false promises of providing work.\nTerrorist groups such as Naxalites are trafficking children as young as six for the purpose of spying, couriers, planting improvised explosive devices and fighting against the government.\nVarious groups are working across the country who traffick children and force them to beg.\nWhat are the impacts of human trafficking on victims?\nHuman trafficking results in mental disorders including depression and anxiety for the victims.\nTrafficked women are forced into prostitution and slavery, which adversely impacts their fundamental rights.\nWomen who are forced into trafficking also affected by diseases such as HIV, Tuberculosis and other Sexually Transmitted Diseases (STDs).\nChildren as young as six are removed from their families and their basic rights such as the right to life and education have been deprived.\nWhat are the measures taken by the government against human trafficking?\nThe Immoral Trafficking Prevention Act, 1986 penalises trafficking for commercial sexual exploitation. The penalties under the act ranging from 7 years to life imprisonment.\nThe Trafficking of Persons (prevention, protection and rehabilitation) bill, 2018 aims at addressing the issue of trafficking with objectives of prevention, rescue and rehabilitation. It covers various forms of trafficking which includes trafficking for the purpose of forced labour, begging, marriage etc. It also provides for punishment, confidentiality of victims, rehabilitation of victims and institutional mechanism for effective enforcement of the law.\nHow is the implementation?\nThere were several cases of inaction by police and prosecutors which signifies poor enforcement of the anti-trafficking legal framework, corruption and absence of awareness or capacity in several parts of the country.\nVictims often face issues such as difficulty in accessing justice including their inability to travel to court, social stigma and intimidation, and considerable delays in trials.\nWhat is the way forward?\nThe government should stop the penalisation of trafficking victims such as restrictions on their travel and increase effective prosecutions and convictions for all forms of trafficking.\nThe government should also increase prosecutions and convictions of officials who are complicit in the enforcement of laws against trafficking.\nForced Marriage in India\n\nEven though India is fast developing and moving towards a better tomorrow, forced marriage still affects many Indian families and society at large. When a girl crosses the age of 18, she is emotionally convinced and is forced into marriage. Evidence proves that forced marriage often results in slave-like conditions for women in Indian families.\n\nWhat does forced marriage mean?\nForced marriage happens when one or both spouses do not agree to the marriage. Children and adults with mental disabilities cannot consent to marriage. Girls below the age of 18 and boys below the age of 21 cannot legally marry in India.\nForced marriage is different from arranged marriage in the sense that unlike latter, forced marriage doesn\u2019t need the consent of the persons who are going to marry and often involves threat, coercion, violence, pressure etc. In extreme cases, parents drugs and kidnaps their own child to make the marriage happen.\nWhat are the reasons behind forced marriage?\nPersons who are having a developmental or mental disability are most often forced to marry since they cannot give their consent.\nForced marriage occurs often in the name of protecting family honour.\nThe need to retain ancestral land, property, and wealth in the family is also a factor for the forced marriage.\nParents often react to social pressures such as neighbours and older relatives to force their children into marriage.\nHigh poverty and debt levels also drive the parents to coerce their children into marriage in return for dowry.\nWhat are the impacts of forced marriage on victims?\nVictims often endure violence in the forced marriage which threatens them and breaks them to make sure that they can\u2019t withdraw from the marriage. The violence may include rape. When the rape results in the birth of a child, mothers often find it difficult to leave the marriage. Their right to life and personal liberty under Article 21 of the constitution taken from them.\nWhat are the initiatives taken by the government?\nThere is a number of laws related to forced marriage which includes the Guardians and Wards Act, 1890, the Family Courts Act, 1984 and the Protection of Women from Domestic Violence Act, 2005 (PWDVA) and Prohibition of child marriage act, 2006.\nPWDVA recognises the forced marriage as a form of domestic violence so as to prevent child marriages or forced marriages of daughters.\nThe Delhi High Court declared that the right to choose one\u2019s life partner is a fundamental right and an integral part of the right to life. Therefore, the right to life includes the right to consensual marriage in India. Hence forced marriage is a violation of the fundamental right and the victims can move the Supreme Court directly to get justice.\nWhat is the way forward?\nSecuring access to quality education for girls at primary and secondary level can prevent forced and early marriages since education will enable them to take decisions on their own and also gives them exposure to various initiatives of the government against forced marriages.\nDespite Right to Education implementation, girls still face multiple barriers in accessing education such as fees, geographic barriers, sexual harassment at school, lack of safe and sanitary toilet facilities, lack of adequate teachers and corporal punishment.\nConclusion\n\nThe country will not be able to achieve its sustainable development goals if the majority of its population are under modern slavery or slave-like conditions. In the words of Sheryl WuDunn, \u201cThe tools to crush modern slavery exist, but the political will is lacking\u201d.\n\nTherefore, it is high time that the government take proper actions against the forced labour, forced marriage and human trafficking in order to make the country a better place to live.\n\nRead:\u00a0Forced Labour\n\nArticle by:\u00a0Santhosh Kumar D"

Men are not physically strong enough to do this activity.\nWomen are more hardworking than men and can work for longer hours.\nWomen are responsible to carry out the ancillary and tertiary works in horticulture, fishery, sericulture, poultry farming etc.\nWomen are the managers of kitchen and hence using pollution-free chullas which help in pollution free atmosphere.\nWomen are not just considered as beneficiaries of smart climate actions but as entrepreneurs of clean energy technologies, as organic food producers-farmers and as local planners.\nWhat is hindering women from playing their role in agriculture?\nMost women do not have\u00a0land in their name and hence cannot be associated with agriculture in the real sense.\nThey cannot go on migrating from place to place in case of land transfers owing to family responsibilities and children, unlike men do.\nThey are not incentivized and do not get due credit too. Hence women are not encouraged to work in this sector.\nMen constitute 81 % approx in agriculture while women constitute only 32 % approx in the agriculture sector.\nThere is huge gender wage gap.\nHousehold chores and care economy is not counted in the GDP of the country. The role of women in agriculture is considered just to be a \u201chelp\u201d and not an important economic contribution to agricultural production.\n\u00a0Social customs dictate, moreover, that women, should \u2013 in addition to agricultural activities \u2013 be responsible for cooking, carrying water and fetching firewood, limiting their participation in decision-making processes and their exposure to those economic opportunities that arise, thus increasing the level of inequality vis-\u00e0-vis their partners.\nWomen are an unorganized sector and hence discrimination against them cannot be reported.\nWomen Empowerment Concerning Agriculture and Climate Change Management \u2013 Efforts by Government\nAt COP22, Parties to the Convention discussed to adopt a comprehensive work programme on gender to integrate gender perspectives in climate policies and actions and to ensure women\u2019s participation at all levels.\nMahila Kisan Sashaktikaran Pariyojana (MKSP) empowers women in agriculture by making systematic investments to enhance their participation and productivity and sustainable livelihood, especially for rural women.\nIn National Food Security Mission (NFSM), training and awareness are given to women on enhanced technology improvements that can be applied to agriculture.\nCSIR-NEERI\u2019s initiative to develop a domestic multi-fuel stove: NEERDHUR, an Improved Cook Stove (ICS) has been developed by adopting a comprehensive approach to technological innovations for improved stove efficiency, emission reduction and intensive stakeholder interactions to address issues of adoption such as stove cost, stove maintenance, fuel affordability, and availability. The NEERI stove \u201cNEERDHUR\u201d addresses adoption and sustainability-related challenges of ICS. It is a multi-fuel (biomass, charcoal, agro residue etc.) stove with hybrid operation modes.\nMinistry of New and Renewable Energy\u2019s, National Biomass Cookstoves Programme (NBCP) during 2009-10 initiated the process of consultations under its Core Group on cookstoves to ascertain the status of various types of biomass improved cookstoves being developed and promoted by various organizations, NGOs, entrepreneurs and industries in the country, and to identify ways and means for the development and expansion of the deployment of improved biomass cookstoves. The consultations indicated that biomass cook stoves do have the potential to directly address health and welfare concerns of the weakest and most vulnerable sections of society. The cleaner combustion in these devices will also greatly reduce greenhouse pollutants. It will mitigate drudgery of women and children using traditional chulha for cooking.\nICAR- Central Institute for Women in Agriculture (ICAR-CIWA) has been undertaking research on issues affecting women in agriculture.\nThe state government has been asked to ensure the free flow of 30 % of funds to women farmers.\nWhat else can be done?\n\nRealizing the importance of rural women in agriculture is an important aspect of gender relations.\nThe adoption of measures that facilitate the transition to a type of agriculture that respects the environment and contributes to the conservation of natural resources that benefit women is, in particular,\u00a0necessary.\nWe must undertake joint efforts to create favourable conditions in agricultural areas, including the reinforcement of road networks for the transportation of produce from production areas where rural women work, as well as the processing and commercialization of such products.\nThere is a need to drop policies which are less favorable to rural women, focusing on the appreciation of their role as producers of wealth and strengthening the network of public services in rural areas, including health, education, and welfare services, as well as establishing policies that combat the asymmetries that prevent rural women from being protected against the effects of climate change.\nThere should be skill empowerment which would give a boost to women to work in this sector.\nThe training of rural women is very important, especially with the adoption of modern agricultural techniques that are tailored to local conditions, with a view to achieving economic development without degrading the environment.\nIt requires the dissemination of the results of research carried out by experts \u2013 including those on agroecological techniques with a view to increasing Rural Women\u2019s production levels.\nWomen entrepreneurs in this sector should be provided ample opportunity, capital, resource and support too.\nThere should be changes in financial and educational sectors.\nSelf Help Group (SHG) creation would help women make their own decisions and they can be financially independent.\nThere should be data collection where women have been involved in agriculture and climate change which would boost the confidence of other women to come and be a part of this sector too.\nPublic-Private Partnership ecosystem in Specific Services Partnership\u2019s initiative provides rural women improved access to technology, finance and markets.\nSuccess Stories of women: Recent examples\nA group of about 30 \u201csolar mamas\u201d from Tanzania and a few other African countries demonstrated their skills in fabrication, repair and maintenance of solar lanterns and household lighting systems in India.\nWomen in Vanuatu worked to restore their livelihoods and adapt their marketplace to be more resilient to future climate disasters.\nIn post-hurricane Haiti, women worked together to rebuild after a disaster.\nIn 10 of the most climate-vulnerable districts of Bangladesh, more than 19,100 women built better systems of support and preparation for disasters, while livelihood skills training has enabled more than 1,600 women to expand their businesses.\n\nRead:\n\nClimate Change and Women\nEcofeminism\n\nArticle by: Ipsita Mishra"

Thus it treats both men and women equally.\n\nFundamental Rights:\nArticle 14 ensures to women the right to equality.\nArticle 15(1) specifically prohibits discrimination on the basis of sex.\nArticle 15(3) empowers the State to take affirmative actions in favour of women.\nArticle 16 provides for equality of opportunity for all citizens in matters relating to employment or appointment to any office.\n\n(To know more about the Fundamental Rights, click here)\n\nDirective Principles of State Policy:\nArticle 39 (a) provides that the state direct its policy towards securing for men and women equally the right to an adequate means of livelihood.\nArticle 39 (d) mandates equal pay for equal work for both men and women.\nArticle 42 provides that the state make provisions for securing just and humane conditions of work and for maternity relief.\n\n(To know more about the Directive Principles of State Policy, click here)\n\n\ud83d\udc49 Which year are YOU targeting for success in the IAS/IPS/IFS Exam? \ud83d\ude80\n\n(1) \u21d2 UPSC 2025: Prelims cum Mains\n\n(2) \u21d2 UPSC 2026: Prelims cum Mains\n\n(3) \u21d2 UPSC 2027 Prelims cum Mains\n\nTip: Know more about ClearIAS Courses (Online/Offline)\n\nWhy does India need a\u00a0National Policy for Women?\n\nGiven the long-term nature of issues which impact on women in India, there is a need to strengthen the processes that promote all-round development of women by focusing on a coordinated approach for implementation of the schemes of the concerned Ministries/Departments and by creating an enabling environment conducive to social change.\n\nDespite the special measures that the state has taken for the welfare of the women in India, they are facing problems like feminization of poverty, inadequate investment in social sectors, increasing violence against women and stereotyped portrayal of women in society.\n\nSince 2001, when the last National Policy for Empowerment of Women in India was formulated, the concept of women empowerment has seen changes, from being recipients of welfare benefits to the need to engage them in the development process, welfare with a heavy dose of rights. This draft policy has tried to address this shift. It will define the government\u2019s action on women in India in the next 15-20 years.\n\nPrevious legislation and policies for women\nIn 1976, the National Plan of Action (1976) was enforced providing guidelines based on the United Nations \u2018World Plan of Action for Women\u2019 with special attention to areas of health, family planning, nutrition, education, employment, legislation and social welfare for formulating and implementing of action programmes for women.\nDuring the 7th Plan period, the National Policy on Education 1986 was adopted which focused on providing educational opportunities to women.\nThe reservations provided to women through the 73rd and 74th Constitutional Amendment Acts of 1992 in local bodies have enabled them to be brought to the centre stage in the nation\u2019s efforts to strengthen democratic institutions.\nThe Government of India adopted the National Policy for Empowerment of Women in 2001 intending to bring about the advancement, development and empowerment of women and to eliminate all forms of discrimination against women. It was directed towards achieving inclusive growth with a special focus on women.\nIndia is also a signatory to several UN conventions, Primarily the Convention on Elimination of all Forms of Discrimination Against Women (CEDAW), the Beijing Platform for Action and the Convention on Rights of the Child.\nWelfare schemes for women in India\nBeti Bachao Beti Padhao\nIt aims at taking coordinated and convergent efforts are needed to ensure the survival, protection and education of the girl child.\nSupport to Training and Employment Programme for Women (STEP)\nIt is a Central Sector Scheme launched in 1986-87, that seeks to upgrade the skills of poor and assetless women and provide employment on a sustainable basis by mobilizing them in viable cooperative groups, strengthening marketing linkages, support services and access to credit.\nRajiv Gandhi Scheme for Empowerment of Adolescent Girls (RGSEAG) \u2013 \u2018SABLA\u2019\nIt is a Centrally-sponsored scheme was approved by the Government to meet nutritional needs and to provide vocational training for girls above 16 years of age for their economic empowerment.\nRashtriya Mahila Kosh \u2013 (National Credit Fund for Women)\nThe Rashtriya Mahila Kosh (National Credit Fund for Women) was set up in 1993 with a corpus of Rs. 31 crores, against the backdrop of socio-economic constraints faced by poor women to access micro-credit from the formal financial system in the country, especially those in the rural and in unorganized sectors.\nIndira Gandhi Matritva Sahyog Yojana (IGMSY) \u2013 Conditional Maternity Benefit (CMB) Scheme\u00a0\nIt is a Conditional Cash Transfer scheme for pregnant and lactating women to contribute to a better enabling environment by providing cash incentives for improved health and nutrition to pregnant and nursing mothers.\nUjjwala Scheme\nUjjwala is a comprehensive scheme that was launched in 2007 for the prevention of trafficking and rescue, rehabilitation and reintegration of victims of trafficking for commercial sexual exploitation.\nSWADHAR (A Scheme for Women in Difficult Circumstances)\nIt aims at the protection of women, especially in a difficult circumstance like widows, destitute and deserted women, women ex-prisoners, victims of sexual abuse and crimes, including those trafficked and rescued from brothels, migrant or refugee women who have been rendered homeless due to natural calamities.\nKey features of the Draft National Policy for Women, 2016\n\nThe policy is roughly based on the Pam Rajput Committee report set up by the MWCD in 2012 which submitted its recommendations in 2016, including a suggested national policy for women and an action plan to end violence against women.\nMaternal and prenatal mortality will remain a priority area, focusing on a coordinated referral transport system for safe deliveries and emergency obstetric care to be made available in difficult, remote and isolated areas.\nIt aims to implement \u201ca gender transformative health strategy\u201d which shifts the focus of family planning efforts from female sterilisation to male sterilisation.\nIt focuses on prioritising the nutrition of women of all ages and strengthening geriatric services to address women aged above 60, who form 8.4% of the population.\nIt tries to address the problem of navigating the distance from home to school by suggesting \u201cinnovative transportation models\u201d such as \u201ccluster pooling of minibuses.\u201d to enrol more girls in secondary schools and retain current girl students.\nThe policy talks about engaging men and boys through advocacy, awareness generation programmes and community programmes to instil respect for women in men from a young age.\nIt also takes note of more women taking recourse to artificial reproductive techniques. It proposes efforts to ensure the rights of surrogate mothers, commissioning mothers along with those of the children born through surrogacy.\nIt mentions designing \u201ca comprehensive social protection mechanism\u201d to address the vulnerabilities of widows, single, deserted, separated and divorced women and create opportunities for them such as building a 1000-room shelter for widows and other vulnerable women in Vrindavan.\nAnother area of concern the policy focuses on is the trafficking of women. The draft policy features efforts to develop a compatible and comprehensive database on violence against women, strict monitoring of the response of (law) enforcement agencies to violence against women, the time-bound trial of heinous crimes against women, strengthening\u00a0naari\u00a0adalats\u00a0and family courts, etc.\nIt also focuses on increased participation of women in the workforce and politics (through need-based training), narrowing the gender-based wage gap, creating entrepreneurial opportunities for women (through schemes like E-haats), recognising women\u2019s unpaid work (at home) in terms of economic and societal value, achieving gender equity in agriculture, effective implementation of the legal provisions to ensure rights of women to immovable properties as well as the skill development\u00a0of women in traditional, new and emerging areas.\nThe policy aims at bettering security environments with initiatives, such as one-stop centres, women helplines, Mahila police volunteers, reservation of women in the police force, creating immediate response mechanisms through panic buttons in mobile phones, public and private transport and surveillance mechanisms in public places.\n\nYou can download the draft national policy for women\u00a0here.\n\nAlso read: WUEGA (Women\u2019s Urban Employment Guarantee Act)\n\nConclusion\n\nThough the policy aims at women\u2019s empowerment and tries to take into consideration the interests of women, it is silent about the issue of Marital rape. In addition to more traditional women\u2019s empowerment programmes, the policy claims to recognise complexities in gender roles brought about by \u201cthe new millennium, and the dynamics of a rapidly changing global and national scenario\u201d.\n\nHowever, making legislation alone is not sufficient. There is a need for ushering in changes in the societal attitude towards women and ushering in behavioural changes involving men and boys and institutions of family and women\u2019s organizations. Only then, we can go ahead in the direction of making women have equal rights and provisions as men.\n\nProbable Question for Mains from this topic\n\n(Qn) Do you think India needs a national policy for women in order to make them more empowered and stand equal to other sections? Discuss the key features of the National Policy on Women recently drafted by the Central government.\n\nArticle by: Pooja Chaudhary"

Although not all of them have a lot of speakers, many of them are still going steady.\n\nThe concept of mother tongue is central to the preservation of languages, especially in the face of the extinction of many languages around the world. As dominant languages continue to spread globally, there is a risk of losing linguistic diversity.\n\nMother tongue, the first language a person learns at home, plays a vital role in cultural identity.\n\nEfforts to revitalize and protect endangered languages are essential to maintaining the rich tapestry of linguistic heritage in our global community.\n\nIndian languages have not received attention and care since the country has lost over 220 languages in the last 50 years alone.\n\nEvery two weeks, according to United Nations studies, an indigenous language dies.\n\nEndangered languages in India\n\nThe UNESCO list of endangered languages in India gives us some idea about the vernaculars that will go extinct shortly and which ones can be saved with efforts from the people. India\u2019s Endangered Languages Language loss has been a fact of life throughout history.\n\nAndamanese Languages: The Great Andamanese languages were once spoken by several tribes in the Andaman Islands. Today, only a few elderly individuals speak these languages, and they are considered critically endangered.\n\nToda: Spoken by the Toda people in the Nilgiri Hills of Tamil Nadu, Toda is a Dravidian language with few speakers. Efforts are being made to document and revitalize the language.\n\nKusunda: Kusunda is a language isolate spoken by a small community in western Nepal and, historically, in parts of northern India. It is critically endangered, with only a handful of elderly speakers.\n\nSentinelese: The Sentinelese language is spoken by the Sentinalese people, an isolated tribe on North Sentinel Island in the Andaman and Nicobar Islands. Due to their isolation, little is known about their language.\n\nMandaic: Mandaic is the language of the Mandaeans, a small religious community in Iraq and Iran. In India, the Mandaic community resides in Maharashtra, and their language is considered endangered.\n\nKoro: Koro is a Tibeto-Burman language spoken in the northeastern state of Arunachal Pradesh. It is considered severely endangered, with a dwindling number of speakers.\n\nNihali: Nihali is a language isolate spoken by the Nihali people in parts of Maharashtra, Madhya Pradesh, and Telangana. It is critically endangered, and efforts are being made for documentation and preservation.\n\nIrula: Irula is a Dravidian language spoken by the Irula tribe in parts of Tamil Nadu, Karnataka, and Kerala. While it is not yet critically endangered, there are concerns about its sustainability due to language shift.\n\nGaro: Garo is a Tibeto-Burman language spoken by the Garo people in the northeastern states of Meghalaya and Assam. While it is not critically endangered, there are concerns about its future.\n\nBoro: Boro, also known as Bodo, is a Tibeto-Burman language spoken by the Bodo people in the northeastern states of Assam and West Bengal. Despite having a significant number of speakers, there are concerns about its sustainability.\n\nBalti: Spoken in both India and Pakistan, this is a Tibetan language. It has less than 400,000 speakers and could go extinct in a hundred years. For now, it is considered a vulnerable tongue. The Perso-Arabic script is used to write Balti. But in the past, it was written using Tibetan script. The language has been separated from other Tibetan vernaculars. Nowadays, it gets pressurized by the dominant tongues of the region.\n\nDarma: This tribal tongue had less than two thousand speakers in 2006. It is closely related to a bunch of vernaculars that are spoken by different tribes.\n\nGangte: Spoken by the people of Manipur and Assam, this Kuki-Chin tongue has no known dialects. But it is mutually intelligible with other Kuki-Chin vernaculars. It also has a few speakers in Burma. In the census of 2011, its speakers were 17,542.\n\nKoch: Koch is another Sino-Tibetan language in India that is endangered. Despite being spoken in Nepal, Bhutan, Bangladesh, and India, the tongue still appears on the list of endangered tongues.\n\nMandeali: One of the highly endangered vernaculars in India is Mandeali. The number of its speakers has decreased drastically since 1961. The vernacular is divided into multiple dialects, mostly not mutually intelligible.\n\nSumi: The people of the ethnic group known as Sumi Naga speak this language. They were less than eleven thousand in number in the census of 2011. The speakers of Sumi can be found in different parts of the country, but Nagaland is the central region where the tongue can be heard.\n\nZakhring: Spoken in Arunachal Pradesh, this tongue has only nine hundred speakers, which is highly at risk. A close relative of Zakhring is\u00a0spoken in China. The vernacular has adopted a lot of foreign words over the years.\n\nMahasu Pahari or Mahasuvi: Mahasu Pahari or Mahasuvi is one of the western Pahari languages with origins in the Mahasu district of Himachal Pradesh. Like all other Pahari languages, Mahasuvi\u2019s history goes back to the Maurya period, i.e., 4th century BC. The language was originally recorded in the Takri\u00a0script, but due to modern distortions and convenience reasons, it is now written in the Devanagari script. Its decline can be attributed to the Colonisation of Lands Act levied upon Himachal Pradesh in 1912.\n\nEfforts for Language Preservation\n\nDocumentation: Linguists and anthropologists are working on documenting endangered languages, creating dictionaries, and compiling grammatical resources.\n\nLanguage Revitalization Programs: Some communities and organizations are implementing language revitalization programs, including language classes, cultural events, and publications.\n\nInternational Decade of Indigenous Languages: Following the 2016 Resolution 71/178\u00a0on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples, in 2019, the United Nations General Assembly adopted a resolution proclaiming the period of 2022-2032 the International Decade of Indigenous Languages, based on a recommendation by the\u00a0Permanent Forum on Indigenous Issues.\u00a0The proclamation of the IDIL2022-2032 is a key outcome of the 2019 International Year of Indigenous Languages \u200b\u200b(IYIL2019).\u00a0\n\nGovernment Initiatives: Governments, both at the state and national levels, are recognizing the importance of preserving linguistic diversity and supporting initiatives for language preservation.\n\nScheme for Protection and Preservation of Endangered Languages of India (SPPEL): Under this Scheme, the Central Institute of Indian Languages (CIIL), Mysore works on the protection, preservation, and documentation of all the mother tongues/languages of India spoken by less than 10,000 people which are called endangered languages. In the first phase of the scheme, 117 endangered languages/mother tongues have been chosen from all over India for study and documentation on a priority basis.\nThe University Grants Commission (UGC) has also initiated two schemes for the protection of endangered languages, namely \u2018Funding Support to the State Universities for Study and Research in Indigenous and Endangered Languages in India\u2019 and \u2018Establishment of Centres for Endangered Languages in Central Universities\u2019.\nConclusion\n\nEfforts to preserve endangered languages are crucial for maintaining cultural diversity and ensuring the survival of unique linguistic heritage. Ongoing initiatives and increased awareness can contribute to the revitalization of endangered languages in India.\n\nRelated articles:\n\nClassical languages of India\nDiversity in India\nMultilingulism in Education\n\n-Article by Swathi Satish"

National Education Policy 2020 discusses multilingual education at length. Read here to understand the significance of multilingual education.\n\nMultilingualism in education recognizes and respects the linguistic diversity of students and aims to provide them with an inclusive and effective learning environment.\n\nMultilingual education can take various forms and has both cognitive and socio-cultural benefits.\n\nThere is a chance to change education with the introduction of the National Education Policy (NEP) and recent initiatives like the NIPUN Bharat Mission that highlight the value of employing the mother tongue in the teaching-learning process and developing educational resources.\n\nTable of Contents\n\nMultilingualism in education\nAdvantages of Multilingualism in Education\nImplementation of a multilingual education system\nChallenges\nWay forward\nMultilingualism in education\n\nNote: Subscribe to the ClearIAS YouTube Channel to learn more.\n\n\ud83d\udc49 Which year are YOU targeting for success in the IAS/IPS/IFS Exam? \ud83d\ude80\n\n(1) \u21d2 UPSC 2025: Prelims cum Mains\n\n(2) \u21d2 UPSC 2026: Prelims cum Mains\n\n(3) \u21d2 UPSC 2027 Prelims cum Mains\n\nTip: Know more about ClearIAS Courses (Online/Offline)\n\nMultilingualism is a significant aspect of education in India due to the country\u2019s rich linguistic diversity.\n\nIndia is home to numerous languages, with the Eighth Schedule of the Indian Constitution recognizing 22 languages as official languages.\n\nAdditionally, there are hundreds of regional and local languages spoken throughout the country. As a result, multilingualism plays a crucial role in shaping the Indian education system.\n\nThe foundational years of school set the groundwork for a child\u2019s intellectual development in the future.\n\nChildren must develop and improve their foundational literacy and numeracy (FLN) abilities, and language should not stand in the way of this process.\nAccording to neuroscientific studies, a person\u2019s brain develops before the age of six more than 85% of the time.\nChildren develop their cognitive capacities, verbal capabilities, and in-depth awareness of their environment at this vital stage.\nThe NEP places a strong focus on using regional languages as a medium of education for several crucial reasons.\n\nIn a multilingual education system, students are taught subjects and concepts in more than one language. This can include using the students\u2019 mother tongue or a regional language alongside a national or international language.\n\nMultilingualism practice creates the development of mixed languages mainly due to intense language contact. As a result, speakers, therefore, tend to involve a mixture of languages during verbal communication.\n\nIndia follows a three-language formula for its language policy.\n\nThe three-language formula typically involves the study of three languages: the mother tongue or regional language, the official language of the state, and English.\nHowever, the specific implementation of the language policy may vary across different states.\nSome states in India have introduced Mother Tongue-Based Multilingual Education programs, where the mother tongue or regional language is used as the medium of instruction in the early years of schooling.\nThe goal is to strengthen the foundation of student\u2019s language skills and gradually introduce other languages as they progress.\n\nMultilingualism in Indian education also plays a role in preserving and promoting regional languages and cultures.\n\nEducational institutions often offer language courses and encourage the use of regional languages to maintain linguistic diversity and cultural heritage.\n\nAdvantages of Multilingualism in Education\n\nThe advantages of multilingualism are numerous ranging from linguistic and socio-political.\n\nEmbracing regional languages fosters inclusivity and makes the Right to Education under Article 21A a \u2018substantive right\u2019.\nMultilingual education has been shown to have cognitive advantages, including improved problem-solving skills, critical thinking, and mental flexibility. Learning in multiple languages can enhance cognitive development and promote language proficiency in different languages.\nMultilingual education can help preserve and promote indigenous languages and cultures. It allows students to connect with their cultural heritage and maintain a strong sense of identity.\nStudents who are educated in their mother tongue or a language they are familiar with are likely to have better comprehension and communication skills. This enhances their ability to grasp complex concepts and perform well academically.\nMultilingual education promotes inclusivity by catering to the diverse linguistic backgrounds of students. It ensures that students from different language communities have equal access to quality education.\nIn an increasingly interconnected world, multilingualism equips students with the skills needed to communicate and collaborate across linguistic and cultural boundaries.\nImplementation of a multilingual education system\n\nEducational institutions may offer bilingual or multilingual programs, where subjects are taught in two or more languages.\n\nThis can include immersion programs, dual-language programs, and content and language-integrated learning (CLIL) approaches.\nEffective implementation of multilingual education requires well-trained teachers who can teach in multiple languages and create a supportive learning environment for diverse students.\nGovernments and educational authorities play a crucial role in developing policies that support multilingual education. This includes curriculum development, teacher training, and providing appropriate resources.\n\nThe Indian educational system has placed an excessive focus on English, frequently alienating students from non-English speaking backgrounds.\n\nThe NEP eliminates linguistic barriers by providing instruction in regional languages, opening up education to a larger audience, and guaranteeing that no kid feels left behind.\nChallenges\n\nChallenges of multilingual education can include the need for suitable teaching materials, language proficiency of teachers, potential resistance to change, and the complexities of curriculum design.\n\nCreating suitable curriculum materials, ensuring proficiency in multiple languages among teachers, and addressing language barriers for students who may speak different languages at home can be complex tasks.\nAmple resources are needed to implement multilingual education, including qualified instructors, suitable curricula, high-quality texts, evaluation tools, and digital platforms. But many schools lack these supplies, particularly those in remote and rural regions.\nAlthough multilingual education is supported by the NEP 2020 and the NIPUN Bharat Mission, there is still a disconnect between policy and implementation.\nMany governments have yet to adequately enact or execute these policies.\nAdditionally, there is a need for greater coordination and cooperation between many stakeholders, including communities, educational institutions, civil society organizations, and the federal and state governments.\nThe advantages of bilingual education are not well-known by many parents, teachers, students, or politicians.\nIt might be difficult to strike a balance between the use of mother tongues or regional languages and national or standardized curricula.\nIt is essential to guarantee that kids have access to a broad education while also honoring their language heritage.\nIt might be challenging to create unbiased, uniform assessment procedures for varied linguistic contexts.\nIt might be difficult to ensure that pupils are graded fairly and consistently when employing various languages.\nWhile bilingual education is beneficial at the elementary school level, moving on to further education or the job market may demand fluency in a language that is more frequently spoken, which might be detrimental to children who were taught in their mother tongue.\nWay forward\n\nOverall, multilingualism in education acknowledges the linguistic diversity of societies and seeks to leverage it as an asset for learning and personal development.\n\nIt helps create inclusive, culturally sensitive, and effective educational systems that empower students to succeed academically and contribute positively to their communities.\n\nMultilingualism in Indian education recognizes the importance of linguistic diversity and strives to provide an inclusive and culturally relevant learning environment for students.\n\nLEAP, or Language Enrichment for Advancing Progress, must be implemented throughout India.\n\nLEAP will foster multilingualism, advance cognitive development, strengthen FLN abilities, and foster a more culturally diverse and intellectually interesting learning environment by offering teachers the necessary training and tools.\n\nBy embracing multiple languages, India seeks to empower its learners with a strong foundation in their mother tongue and other languages, enabling them to participate effectively in a multilingual and interconnected world.\n\n-Article by Swathi Satish"

            "[CONTENT]": "The current global women in workforce participation rate are under 47% while for men it is 72%. This gender gap in employment is not a good sign for the advancement of the global economic and social environment. Read here to learn more about the challenges faced by the women workforce globally and in India as well.\n\nIf economies don\u2019t provide their women, who make up over half of their population, the same rights as males, they will fall behind in the development race. Women benefit from gender equality, but society and the economy also benefit from it because it makes them more robust and dynamic.\n\nGreater numbers of women entering and continuing in the workforce, advancing to management positions, and emerging as intellectual and political leaders are all related to equal treatment of women under the law.\n\nThe fact that women have equal legal rights gives their involvement in all aspects of social, economic, and political life an immeasurable power.\n\nHow much progress has the world made in addressing gender inequality under the law?\n\nTable of Contents\n\nWomen in the workforce: Global scenario\nWomen in the Workforce in India\nChallenges faced by women in the workforce\nWay forward\nWomen in the workforce: Global scenario\n\n\ud83d\udc49 Which year are YOU targeting for success in the IAS/IPS/IFS Exam? \ud83d\ude80\n\n(1) \u21d2 UPSC 2025: Prelims cum Mains\n\n(2) \u21d2 UPSC 2026: Prelims cum Mains\n\n(3) \u21d2 UPSC 2027 Prelims cum Mains\n\nTip: Know more about ClearIAS Courses (Online/Offline)\n\nNote: Subscribe to the ClearIAS YouTube Channel to learn more.\n\nThe past 20 years have witnessed some progress for women in the world of work and in terms of gender equality in society.\n\nToday, more women than ever before are both educated and participating in the workforce, and there is greater awareness that gender equality is of paramount importance in efforts to reduce poverty and boost economic development.\n\nThe adoption of the 2030 UN Agenda for Sustainable Development and the resolve of world leaders \u201cto achieve full and productive employment and decent work for all women and men, including for young people and persons with disabilities, and equal pay for work of equal value\u201d (Sustainable Development Goal (SDG) 8, target 8.5.) and \u201cto achieve gender equality and empower all women and girls\u201d (SDG 5) by 2030 are proof of that awareness.\n\nYet, despite the progress made thus far and the global commitments to secure further improvement, women\u2019s prospects in the world of work are far from equal to men\u2019s.\n\nGlobally women enjoy only 77% of the legal rights that men do. At the current pace, it would take at least 50 years to approach legal gender equality everywhere.\nGlobally, the Covid-19 Pandemic disrupted the participation of the women workforce more than men.\nDespite an increase in women pursuing higher education globally, a gender gap in employment rates remains among highly educated women and men in some countries.\nUnpaid caregiving responsibilities can prevent paid employment opportunities, and this work disproportionally falls to women.\nGlobally, only 1.5% of men provide unpaid care on a full-time basis, compared to 21.7% of women. Covid-19 has widened this gap even further.\nThe pay parity is also alarming between women and men in the same workforce.\nAmong the OECD countries, 2.4 billion women of working age do not have equal economic opportunities and 176 economies maintain legal barriers that prevent their full economic participation.\n\nThe past five decades have seen some progress in ensuring gender equality as more countries decided to remove legal barriers for women workforce.\n\nWomen\u2019s participation rates are gradually approaching those of men in many developed countries.\nMuch of the progress achieved over the past couple of decades in developed countries can be attributed to the fact that women and men in these countries have near equal educational achievements and women face less restrictive social norms regarding paid work.\nEconomies with historically larger legal gender gaps have been catching up, especially since 2000. Economies with the highest growth rates in the Women, Business, and Law score include Bahrain, Botswana, the Democratic Republic of Congo, Indonesia, S\u00e3o Tom\u00e9 and Pr\u00edncipe, Saudi Arabia, South Africa, Togo, and the United Arab Emirates.\n\nAlso read: Acid Attacks\n\nWomen in the Workforce in India\n\nIndia has one of the fastest-growing economies in the world. By 2030, India is forecast to be the third-largest economy in the world, behind only the U.S. and China. Millions of Indians are emerging from poverty each year.\n\nMost countries develop faster with women in their workforces which is true for India too. Throughout the 1990s and particularly in the early 2000s which were decades of robust GDP growth, female workforce participation grew, albeit from very low levels.\n\nBut the figures are still when it comes to the women workforce in India.\n\nAccording to the latest World Bank figures, from 2021, fewer than 1 in 5 Indian women work, at least formally.\nThough most work in India is informal like agricultural or domestic work which often doesn\u2019t get counted.\nOver nearly two decades, India\u2019s female labor participation rate looks like a steady downward curve: From 32% in 2005 to 19% in 2021 \u2013 the most recent year for which statistics are available.\n\nAs India develops, women are dropping out of its workforce in record numbers. This is happening among rich and poor women, in urban and rural areas across social class, religion, and age groups.\n\nAlso read: Role of women and women\u2019s organizations in Indian Society\n\nChallenges faced by women in the workforce\n\nToday, women are more literate and educated than ever before. They\u2019re enrolling in schools and colleges in greater numbers and staying in school longer than previous generations did.\n\nBut that hasn\u2019t translated into jobs, at least not statistically. Developing countries show the highest ratio of female-to-male unemployment rates across income groups.\n\nGender Bias: Women continue to remain underrepresented at every level, starting from entry-level jobs to high-paying roles. This underrepresentation gets worse in senior management positions.\nInsufficient Maternity Leave: During child-rearing years, the unemployment penalty for women is longer. This means that when women take longer leaves, they have a much harder time getting rehired.\nMental/Physical harassment: About 30-70% of women in different kinds of jobs face unwelcome verbal, visual, non-verbal or physical harassment.\nUnequal Pay: Research finds that the median salary for women is roughly 22 percent lower than the median salary for men. In India, the Labour Bureau in India has found that in rural areas in the agricultural sector, the daily wage for men is \u20b9264.05 and \u20b9205.32 for women. In non-agricultural sects, the average daily wage rate for men is \u20b9271.17, while for women it is \u20b9205.90.\nFamily Duties: Women are expected and forced to move in and out of employment, depending on their family\u2019s needs. Reasons such as a mother\u2019s responsibility, dividing time between household activities and office, issues created for going on business Tours/training, safety concerns, etc are the few family issues faced by women workforce.\nWay forward\n\nReforms in laws affecting women\u2019s pay, laws affecting women\u2019s work after having children, constraints on women starting and running a business, gender differences in property and inheritance, etc are needed.\n\nIt\u2019s necessary to improve legal equality for keeping the rights of women workforce intact. Major regulations for equal remuneration for work of equal value, allowing women to work at night and in an industrial job in the same way as men, etc need to be implemented.\n\nIn India, the government has come up with several initiatives for improving opportunities for women workforce-\n\nSexual Harassment of Women at Workplace (Prevention, Prohibition and Redressal) Act, 2013.\nMaternity Benefit (Amendment) Bill, 2016.\nSeveral State Governments including Karnataka UP have allowed factories to employ women on night shifts.\n\nThe freedom to work \u2013 by choice, in conditions of dignity, safety, and fairness \u2013 is integral to human welfare. Guaranteeing that women have access to this right is an important end in itself.\n\nFrom an economic perspective, reducing gender gaps in labour force participation could substantially boost global GDP. The regions with the largest gender gaps would see huge growth benefits. Many developed countries would also see their average annual GDP growth increase, which is significant during times of near-zero economic growth.\n\n-Article written by Swathi Satish"

It is also known as distributive justice.\nIt emphasizes fairness in how society divides its social resources.\nGender inequality, racism, and LGBTQ+ discrimination are frequent subjects of social justice advocacy.\nSocial justice establishes rights and obligations within societal institutions, allowing everyone to share in the advantages and costs of collaboration.\nTaxation, social insurance, public health, public education, public services, labor legislation, and market regulation are common examples of pertinent institutions that help assure equitable opportunity and wealth distribution.\n\nThe concept of Social Justice has been in place since the ancient ages when Plato and related philosophers wrote about it.\n\n\ud83d\udc49 Which year are YOU targeting for success in the IAS/IPS/IFS Exam? \ud83d\ude80\n\n(1) \u21d2 UPSC 2025: Prelims cum Mains\n\n(2) \u21d2 UPSC 2026: Prelims cum Mains\n\n(3) \u21d2 UPSC 2027 Prelims cum Mains\n\nTip: Know more about ClearIAS Courses (Online/Offline)\n\nPlato wrote in The Republic that it would be an ideal state that \u201cevery member of the community must be assigned to the class for which he finds himself best fitted.\u201d\nPlato believed rights existed only between free people, and the law should take \u201caccount in the first instance of relations of inequality in which individuals are treated in proportion to their worth and only secondarily of relations of equality.\u201d\nSocrates (through Plato\u2019s dialogue Crito) is credited with developing the idea of a social contract, whereby people ought to follow the rules of society, and accept its burdens because they have accepted its benefits.\nSignificance of Social Justice\n\nPoverty and inequalities within and among countries are on the rise in many parts of the world.\n\nThe economic and social crises of recent years have been exacerbated by the consequences of the COVID-19 pandemic, natural disasters due to accelerating climate change, geopolitical tensions, and armed conflicts.\nBeyond the human tragedies associated with them and their impact on the world of work, these crises have highlighted the interlinkages and dependencies of economies and societies around the world and shown the crucial need for concerted action to respond to them, at global, regional, and national levels.\nImportant global changes have led to growing disruptions in economies linked to globalization and technology, significant demographic transformations, increasing migration flows, and prolonged situations of fragility.\nThe need of the hour is to curb the growing divide between problems and solutions and call for more inclusive and networked multilateralism, re-embracing global solidarity and renewing the social contract between governments and their people and within societies with a comprehensive approach to human rights.\nSocial justice makes societies and economies function better and reduces poverty, inequalities, and social tensions.\nIt plays an important role in attaining more inclusive and sustainable socio-economic development paths and is key for reaching the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development (2030 Agenda), especially at a time when the achievement of those goals remains far away.\nHence, social justice must become one of the pillars of the revitalized multilateralism that is needed; it must serve as a unifying ideal as well as a key tool for a more effective multilateral system, maintaining coherence across a variety of policy areas.\nWorld Day of Social Justice\n\n2023 Theme: Overcoming Barriers and Unleashing Opportunities for Social Justice\n\nThe 2023 World Day of Social Justice provides an opportunity to foster dialogue with UN Member States, youth, social partners, civil society, UN organizations, and other stakeholders on actions needed to strengthen the social contract that has been fractured by rising inequalities, conflicts, and weakened institutions that are meant to protect the rights of workers.\nDespite these multiple crises, there are many opportunities to build a coalition for social justice and to unleash greater investments in decent jobs, with a particular focus on the green, digital, and care economy, and young people.\nSocial justice in India\n\nThe problem of social justice is associated with social equality and the constitution makers were strongly affected by the feeling of social equality and social justice at the time of the independence.\n\nThe terms, like Socialist, Secular, Democratic, and Republic, were inserted in the Preamble for the same cause.\nSocial justice denotes that all people are treated fairly without any social distinction. This ensures that the absence of privilege is limited to every specific segment of society and the conditions of poor classes (SCs, STs, and OBCs) and women are strengthened.\nIt involves eliminating glaring disparities in wealth, pay, and property. What is referred to as \u201cdistributive justice\u201d is a combination of social and economic fairness. All Indians are guaranteed equality of opportunity and status under the Preamble.\nSocial injustice is a critical problem in Indian society.

Read here to understand the gender gap in STEM.\n\nDespite attempts to increase the number of women working in STEM fields (Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics), this issue of underrepresentation has persisted.\n\nFighting the gender pay gap and outdated assumptions, more women are increasingly seeking and succeeding in engineering and mathematics, two of the most profitable STEM areas.\n\nThroughout their education, girls, and women are systematically guided away from science and math, which restricts their access to, preparedness for, and opportunity to work in these disciplines as adults.\n\nTable of Contents\n\nWomen in STEM\nWhy there is a gender gap in STEM?\nWomen in STEM in India\nGovernment initiatives\nGlobal initiatives for Women in STEM\nWomen scientists shaping history\nWay forward\nWomen in STEM\n\nA significant gender gap has persisted throughout the years at all levels of science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) disciplines all over the world.\n\nEven though women have made tremendous progress toward increasing their participation in higher education, they are still under-represented in these fields.\n\n\ud83d\udc49 Which year are YOU targeting for success in the IAS/IPS/IFS Exam? \ud83d\ude80\n\n(1) \u21d2 UPSC 2025: Prelims cum Mains\n\n(2) \u21d2 UPSC 2026: Prelims cum Mains\n\n(3) \u21d2 UPSC 2027 Prelims cum Mains\n\nTip: Know more about ClearIAS Courses (Online/Offline)\n\nWomen are typically given smaller research grants than their male colleagues and, while they represent 33.3% of all researchers, only 12% of members of national science academies are women.\nIn cutting-edge fields such as artificial intelligence, only one in five professionals (22%) is a woman.\nDespite a shortage of skills in most of the technological fields driving the Fourth Industrial Revolution, women still account for only 28% of engineering graduates and 40% of graduates in computer science and informatics.\nFemale researchers tend to have shorter, less well-paid careers. Their work is underrepresented in high-profile journals and they are often passed over for promotion.\nWhy there is a gender gap in STEM?\n\nThe number of women in science and engineering is growing, yet men continue to outnumber women, especially at the upper levels of these professions. Why is this so?\n\nGirls\u2019 achievements and interests in Math and Science are shaped by the environment around them. Hence, societal beliefs and the growth environment around them influence the future.\nNegative stereotypes about girls\u2019 abilities compared to boys in math can indeed measurably lower girls\u2019 test performance. Such stereotypes can lower girls\u2019 aspirations for science and engineering careers over time.\nThe issue of self-assessment, or how we view our abilities, is another area where cultural factors have been found to limit girls\u2019 interest in mathematics and mathematically challenging careers.\nOne of the largest gender differences in cognitive abilities is found in the area of spatial skills, with boys and men consistently outperforming girls and women. Spatial skills are considered by many people to be important for success in engineering and other scientific fields.\nThe foundation for a STEM career is laid early in life, but scientists and engineers are made in colleges and universities.\nWomen are less satisfied with the academic workplace and more likely to leave it earlier in their careers than their male counterparts are.\nMost people associate science and math fields with \u201cmale\u201d and humanities and arts fields with \u201cfemale\u201d.\nNot only are people more likely to associate math and science with men than with women, people often hold negative opinions of women in \u201cmasculine\u201d positions, like scientists or engineers.\nWomen in STEM in India\n\nIn India, nearly 43% of STEM graduates are women, as opposed to other developed nations like the United States, Canada, and the UK, where there are fewer women \u2013 34%, 31%, and 38%, respectively \u2013 studying STEM at the tertiary level.\n\nAs per the annual All India Survey on Higher Education (AISHE) report, which indicates enrolment in undergraduate, Master, and PhD-level programs, the number of women in India who have opted for STEM courses has increased from 10,02,707 in 2017-18 to 10,56,095 in 2019-2020.\n\nIn India, one in three research papers is being written by a female author in over 186 fields, as per the Scopus database.\n\nWomen are almost on par with their male counterparts in subjects such as dentistry, psychology, and humanities, where for every two male authors there is at least one female author.\n\nYet, the turnaround for women\u2019s participation in STEM-related jobs in the country is currently as low as 14%.\n\nThe reasons for this unfortunate state of affairs include persistent institutional gender biases, strictly defined gender norms, patriarchal culture, etc.\nGovernment initiatives\n\nAt the school level, the Department of Science and Technology (DST) launched the Vigyan Jyoti scheme in 2020.\n\nUnder the scheme, schools were directed to conduct regular special lectures, classes, and science camps as a way of encouraging female students, especially those in classes 9 to 12, to pursue higher education in STEM.\n\nThe Government announced scholarships such as Pragati through the All India Council for Technical Education, making it easier for girls to access technical education at the undergraduate and diploma levels.\n\nTo support the development of a gender-equitable ecosystem within higher education and research institutions, the DST launched a pilot project \u2013 Gender Advancement for Transforming Institutions (GATI).\n\nDST also launched the Consolidation of University Research for Innovation and Excellence (CURIE) initiative, which provides support to women universities in improving their Research & Development (R&D) facilities.\n\nFor women researchers interested in undertaking R&D activities, Science and Engineering Research Board (SERB) formulated SERB-POWER (Promoting Opportunities for Women in Exploratory Research) as a funding framework that aimed at providing financial assistance through grants and fellowships, enabling women to pursue their STEM research projects.\n\nThe Biotechnology Career Advancement and Re-orientation Programme (BioCARe), was also undertaken by the Department of Biotechnology (DBT) as a step forward to encourage women scientists to take up biotechnology research.\n\nDST\u2019s \u201cIndo-U.S. Fellowship for Women in STEM\u201d launched in collaboration with the Indo-US Science and Technology Forum (IUSSTF) in the United States (US).\n\nWomen in Engineering, Science, and Technology (WEST),\u00a0a new I-STEM (Indian Science Technology and Engineering facilities Map) initiative called \u201cWomen in Engineering, Science, and Technology (WEST)\u201d was launched in 2022.\n\nThe WEST program will cater to women with a STEM background and empower them to contribute to the science, technology, and innovation ecosystem.\nThrough the WEST initiative, I-STEM shall provide a separate platform to scientifically inclined women researchers, scientists, and technologists for pursuing research in basic or applied sciences in frontier areas of science and engineering.\nGlobal initiatives for Women in STEM\n\nGender equality and the empowerment of women and girls will make a crucial contribution not only to the economic development of the world but to progress across all the goals and targets of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development.\n\nThe International Day of Women and Girls in Science (IDWGIS) is observed on February 11th each year since 2015.\n\nThe day is observed by the United Nations to promote equal access and participation of women in STEM fields.\nThe theme for 2023 is Innovate. Demonstrate. Elevate. Advance. Sustain. (I.D.E.A.S.)\n\nIDWGIS aims to connect the International Community to Women and Girls in Science, strengthening the ties between science, policy, and society for strategies oriented toward the future.\n\nOther international days observed by the UN to promote the growth and education of women are:\n\nInternational Women\u2019s Day (8 March)\nGirls in ICT Day (22 April)\nInternational Day of the Girl Child (11 October)\nInternational Day of Rural Women (15 October)\nWorld Science Day for Peace and Development (10 November)\nInternational Day for the Elimination of Violence against Women (25 November)\nWomen scientists shaping history\n\nIndia\u2019s rich history is replete with examples of several great scientists who have brought immense pride to the nation. Among them are several women scientists who have contributed significantly to various science disciplines.\n\nKadambini Ganguly (1861-1923) was India\u2019s first female doctor and practitioner of western medicine.\nAnandibai Gopalrao Joshi (1865-1887) was the first Indian woman physician and the first woman to have graduated with a two-year degree in Western Medicine in the United States.\nJanaki Ammal (1897-1984) was the first Indian scientist to have received the Padma Shri Award in 1977, who went on to occupy the reputed post of the director-general of the Botanical Survey of India.\nKamala Sohonie (1912-1998) was the first Indian woman to have a Ph.D. degree in the scientific discipline. She was the first female student of Prof. CV Raman, who was the then IISc director. She discovered that every cell of a plant tissue contained the enzyme \u2018cytochrome C\u2019 which was involved in the oxidation of all plant cells.\nRajeshwari Chatterjee (1922-2010) was the First woman engineer from the state of Karnataka, who received a government scholarship to study abroad in 1946.\nKalpana Chawla (1962-2003) was the first astronaut of Indian origin to have forayed into space. She first flew on a Space Shuttle Columbia in 1997 as a mission specialist and primary robotic arm operator.\nIndira Hinduja is an Indian gynecologist, obstetrician, and infertility specialist who pioneered the Gamete intrafallopian transfer (GIFT) technique resulting in the birth of India\u2019s first GIFT baby on January 4, 1988.\nAditi Pant was the first Indian woman to visit Antarctica in 1983 as a part of the Indian expedition to study Geology and Oceanography.\nTessy Thomas known as the \u2018Missile Woman\u2019 of India is the Director General of Aeronautical Systems and the former Project Director for Agni-IV missile in the Defence Research and Development Organisation (DRDO). She is the first woman scientist to head a missile project in India.\n\nGlobally, numerous women scientists and engineers have helped shape the work we see today. Some of the pioneers in STEM were:\n\nMarie Curie was a Polish and naturalized-French physicist and chemist who conducted pioneering research on radioactivity. She discovered radium and polonium and won two Nobel prizes.\nRosalind Franklin, a British chemist contributed to the unraveling of the helical structure of DNA.\nJanet Taylor designed instruments for nautical navigation during the 1800s. She ran a manufacturing business for nautical instruments, many of which she designed herself; and embarked on the business of compass adjusting at the height of the controversies generated by magnetic deviation and distortions on iron ships.\nBeatrice Shilling was a daredevil motorcyclist and engineer who contributed greatly to the repair of Rolls-Royce engines during World War II.\nDorothy Hodgkin discovered the structure of insulin. In 1964, Dorothy won the Nobel Prize for Chemistry for \u201cher determinations by X-ray techniques of the structures of important biochemical substances\u201d. She was only the third woman to have won a Nobel Prize for Chemistry after Marie Curie and her daughter Ir\u00e8ne Joliot-Curie, and the fifth woman to win a science Nobel Prize.\nKatherine Johnson was a mathematician who worked on NASA\u2019s early space missions. She was one of the \u201ccomputers\u201d who solved equations by hand during NASA\u2019s early years and those of its precursor organization, the National Advisory Committee for Aeronautics.\nPayne-Gaposchkin was a woman of many firsts: the first to receive a Ph.D. from Radcliffe College, the first to be a professor at Harvard and the first to discover the composition of stars.\nWay forward\n\nGiving women equal opportunities to pursue and thrive in STEM careers helps narrow the gender pay gap, enhances women\u2019s economic security, ensures a diverse and talented STEM workforce, and prevents biases in these fields and the products and services they produce.\n\nGovernments and global organizations should ensure the necessities to encourage the involvement of Women in STEM:\n\nGive girls and women the skills and confidence to succeed in math and science.\nImprove STEM education and support for girls starting in early education.\nWork to attract, recruit and retain women into STEM majors and fields in colleges and universities.\nImprove job hiring, retention, and promotion pathways and intentionally inclusive cultures.\nSmall improvements by physics and computer science departments, such as providing a broader overview of the field in introductory courses, can add up to big gains in female student recruitment and retention.\n\nWomen and girls represent half of the world\u2019s population and, therefore, also half of its potential. Gender equality, besides being a fundamental human right, is essential to achieve peaceful societies, with full human potential and sustainable development.\n\nAlso read:\u00a0Women in Politics and Women in Judiciary\n\n-Article written by Swathi Satish"

These are holidays that are observed by various communities that follow a certain philosophy or faith. The majority of religious groups have significant festivals in their communities. For instance, the Hindu community celebrates Diwali celebration all over the world.\n\nReligious festivals\n\nPeople who practise a particular religion and adhere to its rituals participate in religious festivals.

Festivals are a significant part of the cultures of the majority of religious groups.\n\nIndian\u00a0 Religious festival\u2019s characteristics\n\nThe main characteristics of religious festivals are as follows:\n\nContain socio-religious material: Religious rites of one kind or another are performed in conjunction with almost all of them. There are two parts to any traditional event. One is worship, which is conducted in accordance with particular religious customs. Hindus, for instance, worship their gods and goddesses individually or as a family on certain occasions like Holi, Diwali, or Ram Navami. Muslims visit mosques to perform namaz during Id because their faith places a high value on communal prayer. Similarly to this, Christians attend church services on Christmas Day.\nParticipation of society as a whole: The majority of our festivals are open to people from all communities. The celebrations that go along with a festival are attended by members of all the communities. Everyone participates in Holi, Diwali, Id, Muharram, Baisakhi, and Christmas to varying degrees. Therefore, despite having a strong religious focus, our holidays serve to highlight our similarities, foster our solidarity, and promote a sense of community.\nSeasonally based: The majority of Hindu-specific holidays are seasonal in nature. They mark the harvesting seasons and proclaim the start of each. The two harvesting seasons, kharif (August through October) and rabi are when all of the seasonal celebrations are observed (March- April). Additionally, spring is a time when there are seasonal celebrations.\nThe social importance of Religious Festivals\n\nReligious holidays have a significant significance in society. They have value for integration. They are important for socialisation as well.\n\nThe interaction of society, nature, and man: The \u201cplanned alternating of sacred and profane periods, of celebration and work\u201d happens in the yearly social cycle of life. The festivals show that most religious celebrations occur during transitional intervals between the three well-defined seasons of rain, winter, and summer.\nThe Person\u2019s Emotional Social Security: Festivals that aim for emotional security often take on a magical undertone.\nConflict, Differentiation, and Solidarity: Religious holidays have social implications for both group unity and identification as well as for conflict and division within and across groups.\nChallenges\u00a0of Religious Festivals\n\nAs every coin has a head and tail religious festivals also possess some challenges.\n\nWhile the Indian Constitution declares the state being absolutely neutral to all religions, our society has steeped in religion and religious festivals. The mingling of religion in terms of religious festivals and Politics that is mobilisation of votes on grounds of primordial identities like religion, caste and ethnicity, have put Indian secularism in danger.\nReligious tensions: Some religious festivals have been the source of communal tensions and violence, particularly in instances where there is a perceived threat to religious traditions or cultural practices.\nThe politicisation of any one religious group leads to the competitive politicisation of other groups, thereby resulting in inter-religious conflict.\nOne of the manifestations of communalism is communal riots. In the recent past also, communalism has proved to be a great threat to the secular fabric of Indian polity. Non-secular ideas which are formed as a result of religious festivals may result in mob lynching on mere issues.\nExtra efforts must be given to look after the law and order during the time of religious festivals.\nLimited access: Some religious festivals are only accessible to certain sections of society, particularly women, who may face restrictions on their participation in public celebrations.\nConclusion\n\nIndian festivals are now widely observed over the world with more enthusiasm. There are many delightful things to do, such as the essentials of praying to gods and participating in religious festivals and customs. Even foreign travellers who visit India make festivals a part of their vacation since they are important to understanding Indian culture.\n\nIn India, fairs and festivals are a magnificent, fantastic, and cheerful collection of events that represent the rituals of birth, death, and rebirth. India celebrates its national holidays to honour its gods, goddesses, heroes, heroines, gurus, prophets, and saints, and to remember their heroic deeds.\n\nIndian holidays are now widely observed over the world with more enthusiasm.

When the state links to every person during a census, it will find it difficult to evade or avoid the data.\n\nGrants\n\nBased on population figures obtained from the Census data, the Finance Commission awards grants to the states.\n\nWelfare Schemes\n\nCensus is the key to building identification and confirming it over time by identifying the actual beneficiaries. Census statistics provide for easy, cross-temporal comparison.\n\nImproved Access for Businesses\n\nBusiness houses and industries can utilise the census data to develop and strengthen their operations so that they can expand into previously untapped markets.\n\nCensus in India so far\n\nIn India, census activities were first conducted under The Maurya dynasty, which was long ago.\nIt was organised from 1865 to 1872, but it has been running continuously since 1881, making it a reliable source of information.\n\nFrom 1881 until 2011, India consistently conducted decadal censuses despite epidemics, wars, Partition, and other unrest, with COVID-19 being the sole exception.\n\nThe 2011 Census is the country\u2019s fifteenth national census.\n\nAccording to the census, the Total Fertility Rate (TFR) is rapidly declining and is headed toward stabilisation.\nThe 2011 Census also disproved the idea that divorce rates in urban and rural India differed. The divorce rate in urban areas (0.89%) is approximately the same as that in rural areas (0.82%).\n\nWhy was the Census of 2021 Delayed Indefinitely?\n\nBecause of the Covid-19 pandemic outbreak, the census 2021 has been delayed.\n\nHowever, it will be the first digital Census and will include a self-enumeration option.\n\nImpact of Delay in Census 2021\n\nFollowing are the impacts of a delay in Census 2021:\n\nAffects the Public distribution system\n\nAccording to the National Food Security Act of 2013, 75% of rural residents are eligible to receive subsidised food grains through Public Distribution System.\n\nIndia has roughly 121 crore inhabitants according to the 2011 Census, hence PDS covered about 80 crore people.\n\nMore than 10 crore people would continue to be denied access to subsidised food benefits if we used the projected population of 137 crores. The greatest gaps would be in Uttar Pradesh and Bihar, with 2.8 crores and 1.8 crore predicted exclusions, respectively.\n\nHuge lag in Migration data\n\nIt was discovered from Covid-19 lockdowns that the numbers, reasons, and migration patterns could not be determined using the current 2011 Census data.\n\nThe D-tables on migration from the 2011 Census was only made public in 2019, hence they were already out of date when they were published.\n\nIn actuality, migration data is not used all that much in larger economic policy and planning.\n\nWelfare Schemes\n\nDespite the Government\u2019s intention to employ SECC data, the projected expansion\u2019s budgetary allocation was unsuccessful.\n\nAlthough most schemes do not use census data to determine their beneficiaries, planning, budgeting, and execution of policies depend on it.\n\nThe disaggregated age and fertility indicators must be used by a number of programmes to evaluate their efficacy as demographics change over time.\n\nKey findings of 2011 Census\n\nFollowing are the key findings of the 2011 Census:\n\nPopulation\n\nIndia\u2019s population increased by 17.7% between 2001 and 2011, compared to a 21.5 percent increase in the prior decade.\n\nIndia now has a Total population of 1.21 billion, an increase of 17.7% over the previous ten years. Female population growth outpaced male growth.\n\nThe growth rate of girls was 18.3%, which was higher than the growth rate of males, which was 17.1%.\n\nBihar has experienced the largest decadal population growth among the main states (25.4%), while 14 other states and union territories have experienced growth rates above 20%.\n\nRural and Urban Population\n\nThe urban population increased from 17.3% in 1951 to 31.2% in 2011.\n\nIn NCT Delhi, the proportion of urban residents is the highest (97.5 per cent).\n\nThe top five states in terms of the percentage of people living in cities are Goa (62.2%), Mizoram (52.1%), Tamil Nadu (48.4%), Kerala (47.7%), and Maharashtra (45.2 per cent).\n\nLiteracy\n\nThe literacy rate in India has improved from 64.8% in 2001 to 73% in 2011, an increase of 8%.\n\nThe literacy rate for men currently stands at 80.9%, up 5.6% from the previous census, while the rate for women currently stands at 64.6%, up 10.9% from 2001.\n\nThe largest gain occurred in Dadra and Nagar Haveli, rising 18.6 points (from 57.6 to 76.2%), followed by Bihar (14.8 points (from 47.0 to 61.8%) and Tripura (14.0 points) (from 73.2 per cent to 87.2 per cent)\n\nDensity\n\nFrom 325 in 2001 to 382 in 2011, the country\u2019s population density grew.\n\nWith a density of 1106, Bihar surpasses West Bengal, which held the top spot among the main states in 2001, to take the top spot.\n\nAccording to the 2001 and 2011 Censuses, Delhi (11,320) and Chandigarh (9,258) are the two states and UTs with the densest populations.\n\nIn Arunachal Pradesh, the minimum population density (17) holds true for both the 2001 and 2011 Censuses.\n\nSex Ratio\n\nIn 2011, there were 940 females against 1000 males in the country, which is 10% more than in the previous census, when there were 933 females against 1,000 males.\n\nHaryana has 879 girls for every 1000 males as of 2011, followed by Jammu & Kashmir (889 females) and Punjab (895 females).\nBihar (912 females) and Uttar Pradesh (912 females) are the other two states that fare poorly in terms of skewed sex ratio (918 females).\n\nKerala (1,084 females), Tamil Nadu (996), Andhra Pradesh (993), Chhattisgarh (991), and Odisha were the top five states in terms of sex ratio (979).\n\nChild Population\n\nThere has been a 0.4% increase in the number of children aged 0 to 6 years.\n\nThe sex ratio for children aged 0 to 6 has decreased by 8%. Compared to 927 females in 2001, the kid sex ratio (0\u20136) in 2011 is 919 females to 1000 males.\n\nDuring the years 2001 to 2011, the number of male children (0 to 6) increased while that of female children fell.\n\nThe states that do the poorest in terms of the sex ratio for children aged 0 to 6 are Gujarat (888), Jammu and Kashmir (888), Haryana (834 females), Punjab (846), and Jammu and Kashmir (862). (890).\n\nChhattisgarh (969), Kerala (964), Assam (962), West Bengal (956) Jharkhand (948) and Karnataka are the top-performing states (948).\n\nSC/ST data\n\nScheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes are informed in 31 states, including UTs, and 30 states, respectively, according to the Census. There are 1,241 distinct ethnic groups that have been designated as SCs overall. There are 705 distinct ethnic groups that have been designated as STs.\n\nThe list of SCs/STs in states and UTs has seen some revisions during the past ten years.\n\nThe number of SC people in India has increased by 20% since the last census, to 201.4 million. In 2011, there were 104.3 million ST people, which is a 23.7% increase from 2001.\n\nReligious Demographics\n\nOn August 25, 2015, the Indian government made available the religious data from the 2011 census.\n\nHindus make up 79.8% (966.3 million) of the population, while Muslims make up 14.23% (172.2 million).\n\nIn the 2011 census, a \u201cNo religion\u201d category was added for the first time. In India, 2.87 million people were counted in the \u201cNo Religion\u201d category in the 2011 census. \u2013 0.24% of the 1.21 billion people in India.\n\nSocio-Economic and Caste Census (SECC)\n\nFor the first time since 1931, the Socio-Economic and Caste Census (SECC) was carried out in 2011.\n\nIt aims to survey every Indian household in India, both urban and rural, and inquire about:\n\nTo enable Central/State authorities to develop a range of deprivation indicators that each authority might use to designate a poor or deprived person.\nTo enable the government to reassess whether caste groupings are more and less economically advantaged.\nSignificance of SECC Census\n\nSECC has the potential to enable the mapping of inequalities at a higher level.\n\nEstablishing statistical support for the continuation of caste-based affirmative action programmes or welfare programmes will be helpful.\n\nIt is also legally necessary since the courts demand \u201cquantifiable data\u201d to back up the current levels of reservation.\n\nThe Indian Constitution also supports the idea of holding a caste census.\n\nAccording to Article 340, a commission must be established to look into the circumstances of socially and educationally disadvantaged groups and recommend appropriate actions that governments should take.\n\nConcerns Related to SECC Sensus\n\nA caste census will have political and social ramifications since caste has an emotional component.\n\nCaste counting has raised questions about whether it contributes to or hardens identities.\n\nIn India, caste has never served as a stand-in for class or deprived status; instead, it represents a unique form of ingrained discrimination that frequently goes beyond class.\n\nConclusion\n\nThe census is essential and priceless because it serves as a repository for all available information about the nation and is a social benefit because it is conducted publicly, voluntarily, and with the aid of public funds.\n\nThe breadth of the observed migration trends toward smaller two-tier communities outside of the major metropolitan centre is likely to be captured by the new Census.\n\nIt might provide insight into the types of healthcare and social services that are most needed and where they exist.\n\nFundamentally, though, it\u2019s a method for the state to show that it wants to engage with the citizens who will ultimately make up the country by knocking on all their doors.\n\nFrequently Asked Questions (FAQs)\n\nQ. What is the current Census of India?\n\nAns: The last census was held in 2011, whilst the next was to be held in 2021 before it was postponed due to the COVID-19 pandemic in India.

What are the types of poverty existing in the world? How is poverty estimated in India? What are the measures to tackle it? Read on to know more.\n\nPoverty is a complex phenomenon in which an individual or group lacks the means of subsistence and other basic necessities.\n\nThe World Bank defines poverty as a severe lack of well-being that has several dimensions.\n\nLow salaries and the inability to obtain the fundamental goods and services required for humane survival are examples of this. Low levels of health and education, poor access to sanitary facilities, insufficient physical security, lack of voice, and lack of resources are all included in the definition of poverty.\n\nTable of Contents\n\nTypes of Poverty\n1.

Absolute poverty\n\nIt describes a state in which a person consistently falls short of earning enough money to cover at least one or more essential expenses for a long time. It can be calculated in terms of money, calories, or nutritional attainment.\n\n\ud83d\udc49 Which year are YOU targeting for success in the IAS/IPS/IFS Exam? \ud83d\ude80\n\n(1) \u21d2 UPSC 2025: Prelims cum Mains\n\n(2) \u21d2 UPSC 2026: Prelims cum Mains\n\n(3) \u21d2 UPSC 2027 Prelims cum Mains\n\nTip: Know more about ClearIAS Courses (Online/Offline)\n\nFor example, Families that are unable to feed their children and themselves, as well as homeless persons living on the streets, are examples of absolute poverty.\n\n2. Relative poverty\n\nIt happens when people do not have the minimal level of living standards that are set by the government and are enjoyed by the majority of the population and vary from country to country. It is thought to be on the rise and may never completely disappear.\n\nFor example, A person living in a wealthy culture may have a regular income and all of the essentials of life, but because they do not have as many luxuries as other members of the community, relative poverty is defined in the UK as income that is 50% below average salaries.\n\n3. Situational Poverty\n\nIt is a form of temporary poverty predicated by the occurrence of a negative event like an environmental catastrophe, a job loss, or a serious health issue.\n\nPeople are capable of helping themselves even with modest assistance because poverty is the result of unfavourable circumstances.\n\nAlso read: Economic and Social Development \u2013 Sustainable Development, Poverty, Inclusion, Demographics, Social Sector Initiatives, etc.\n\n4. Generational Poverty\n\nIt is passed down from one generation to the next to individuals and families.\n\nThis is more challenging because there is no way out because everyone is caught up in the root of the problem and lacks access to the necessary resources.\n\n5. Rural Poverty\n\nThis happens in rural locations where there are fewer job prospects, services to access, support for people with impairments, and opportunities for a good education.\n\nMost of the locals depend on farming and other clerical labour that is available in the area to make a living.\n\n6. Urban Poverty\n\nThe main difficulties urban residents confront as a result of poverty include:\n\nHaving trouble accessing health care and education\n\nPoor housing and services\n\nDue to congestion, the environment is violent and unpleasant a weak or nonexistent social safety net.\n\nAlso read: Urban Poverty\n\nPoverty Estimation\nPre-Independence Poverty Estimation\n\nThe oldest calculation of the poverty line was done by Dadabhai Naoroji in his book \u201cPoverty and unBritish Rule in India.\u201d\n\nThis estimate was made based on the price of subsistence or minimally adequate food.\n\nNational Planning Committee (1938)\n\nThis committee, which was established under the leadership of Jawaharlal Nehru, proposed a poverty line based on a minimal quality of living, ranging from $15 to $20 per person per month.\n\nThe Bombay Plan (1944)\n\nSupporters of the Bombay Plan1 proposed a poverty limit of $75 per person per year, which was far lower than the National Planning Committee\u2019s estimate.\n\nPost-Independence Poverty Estimation\n\nPlanning Commission (1962)\n\nThe Planning Commission formed the Planning Commission Expert Group in 1962, and it was this group that developed the distinct poverty lines for rural and urban areas Rs.20 and Rs.25 per capita per year respectively.\n\nY. K. Alagh Committee (1979)\n\nThe accurate measurement of poverty based on starvation was decided.\n\nA committee made a suggestion based on the fact that impoverished people are those who consume less than 2,100 calories in urban regions and less than 2,400 calories in rural areas, respectively.\n\nLakdawala Committee (1993)\n\nThe following recommendations were made by an expert group, led by D.T. Lakdawala, which was formed to assess the technique for estimating poverty:\nAs in the past, calorie consumption should serve as the basis for calculating consumption expenditure;\n\nPoverty lines should be created for each state and updated using the Consumer Price Index of Agricultural Labor (CPI-AL) in rural regions and the Consumer Price Index of Industrial Workers (CPI-IW) in urban areas;\n\nThe stoppage of \u201cscaling\u201d poverty statistics based on National Accounts Statistics\n\nSuresh Tendulkar Committee (2005)\n\nThe recommendations made by this committee serve as the foundation for the current poverty estimates.\n\nThis committee suggested abandoning the calorie-based approach and broadening the definition of poverty by taking into account monthly expenditures on power, transportation, health care, and education.\n\nIt advocated for nutrient intake as opposed to calorie intake. A line based on the cost of living was also drawn by the committee. In rural and urban areas, the Tendulkar panel set a baseline daily per capita spending of Rs. 27 and Rs. 33, respectively.\n\nC. Rangarajan Committee (2012-14)\n\nThe committee increased the cost of living per day for rural and urban areas, respectively, to Rs. 32 and Rs. 47.\u00a0As a result, India\u2019s poverty rate was close to 30% and its total population was near to 40 crores.\n\nArvind Panagariya Task Force (2015)\n\nA committee to identify people \u201cBelow Poverty Line (BPL)\u201d was suggested by the task group. \u00a0\u00a0 The study discusses four methods for tracking the impoverished, starting with maintaining the Tendulkar poverty line.\n\nNext, move to the Rangarajan or other higher rural and urban poverty levels.\n\nThird, follow-up data on the bottom 30% of the population over time\n\nFourth, keeping track of the bottom 30%\u2019s performance on particular metrics like housing, sanitization, electricity, dietary intake, etc.\n\nNITI Aayog Task Force\n\nNITI Aayog has emphasised that the poverty level will only be used to assess progress in addressing poverty rather than identifying the poor for entitlements in order to allay concerns that many poor people would be left behind if the Tendulkar Committee\u2019s poverty line is adopted.\n\nMultidimensional Poverty Index by Niti Ayog\n\nA Multidimensional Poverty Index Coordination Committee (MPICC) has been established by NITI Aayog with representatives from pertinent Line Ministries and Departments.\n\nThe competition between states is intended to compel states to adopt drastic measures to reduce poverty.\n\nThe UNDP\u2019s Multidimensional Poverty Index is also anticipated to be influenced by the findings (MPI).\n\nWhy does poverty still exist?\nThe heavy pressure on the population\n\nIndia has 84.63 billion people in 1991 and 102.87 billion in 2001.\n\nThe excessive subdivision and holdings fragmentation that results from rapid population increase. As a result, there is significantly less land available per person, and households lack access to enough land to meet their needs for productivity and revenue.\n\nSince 1951, India\u2019s population has been expanding quickly, which has resulted in a slower increase in per capita income and decreased living standards for the populace.\n\nUnemployment and underemployment\n\nIn India, there is persistent unemployment and underemployment as a result of the country\u2019s ongoing population growth.\n\nPoverty is merely a reflection of this element, and there is educated unemployment as well as concealed unemployment.\n\nLack of Inclusive Economic Growth\n\nThe lack of adequate economic growth in India is the primary factor contributing to the country\u2019s widespread poverty.\n\nSince India gained independence, the national income and savings rate has increased, but poverty has not decreased as much as it could have because industrial expansion has not produced enough job possibilities.\n\nGrowth strategies benefited the wealthy more than they did the poor.\n\nFailure to enact land reforms\n\nFair access to land is a crucial component of the fight against poverty.\n\nThe majority of rural poor people work as agricultural labourers (who typically lack land) and are independent small farmers with less than 2 acres of land.\n\nAdditionally, they are unable to find work all year long. As a result, they work too little and are unemployed for a lot of days each year.\n\nInflation and Food Prices\n\nThe cost of the minimal consumer expenditure necessary to meet basic necessities increases due to inflation, notably given the increase in food costs. As a result, many households are forced below the poverty line by inflation.\n\nShortage of Capital and Able Entrepreneurship\n\nThe ability to start your own business and have money both play a big part in driving growth. However, compared to other developing countries, these are scarce, making a large rise in output difficult.\n\nSocial Factors\n\nThe social structure is still outdated and does not encourage rapid development.\n\nInheritance laws, the caste system, traditions, and conventions are impeding rapid progress and making the poverty issue worse.\n\nClimatic variables\n\nIndia\u2019s hot climate makes it harder for individuals, particularly rural residents, to work, which has a negative impact on productivity.\n\nFrequent floods, famines, earthquakes, and cyclone harm agriculture severely; as a result, food prices rise and access becomes increasingly difficult, increasing the risk of poverty for many.\n\nMoreover, the agricultural production of the nation is adversely impacted by the lack of timely rain, heavy rain, or insufficient rain.\n\nPolitical elements\n\nThe process of granting concessions and eradicating poverty is disrupted by ethnic issues and conflict between two regional parties.\nThe main reason for concern about India\u2019s poverty is that various development programmes are being driven by political interests. As a result, efforts to address the issues of unemployment and poverty have been ineffective.\n\nActions to address issues of Poverty and developmental issues\nMore Citizen participation\n\nAny programme cannot be implemented successfully without the poor\u2019s engaged participation.\n\nOnly until the impoverished begin actively participating in the growth process and contributing to growth can poverty be truly erased.\n\nThis is made feasible by a social mobilisation approach that empowers the underprivileged by promoting their participation.\n\nAccelerating Economic Growth\n\nWhile attempts should be made to hasten economic growth, it is best to avoid importing capital-intensive technologies from Western nations.\n\nInstead, we should pursue a path of economic growth that requires lots of labour.\n\nAdopting monetary and fiscal measures that encourage the use of labour-intensive methods is necessary.\n\nGrowth of Non-Farm Employment\n\nThe growth of non-farm employment in rural areas is particularly important for reducing poverty.\n\nIt is possible to generate non-farm jobs in marketing, transportation, handicrafts, dairying, forestry, food processing, other agricultural product processing, repair businesses, etc.\n\nProviding access to more assets to vulnerable sections\n\nReduce rural poverty through redistributing land through practical means, such as the implementation of tenancy reforms to provide security of tenure and the determination of reasonable rent.\n\nInstitutional Credit Access\n\nThe conditions enabling small farmers to acquire access to productive resources, such as HYV seeds fertilisers, and installation of minor irrigation, such as wells and tube wells, can be created through the availability of loans to the poor on easy terms.\n\nSmall farmers will be able to employ high-yielding technologies as a result, increasing their productivity.\n\nPoverty Alleviation Schemes\nNational Urban Livelihoods Mission: Deen Dayal Antyodaya Yojana (DAY-NULM)\nHousing and Urban Affairs Ministry\nProvide skill development and loans for self-employment to urban disadvantaged people Government interest subsidies are made through the PAISA Portal.\nCreate markets for vendors in cities.\nshelters for the homeless\nNational Rural Livelihoods Mission: Deen Dayal Antidaya Yojana (DAY-NRLM)\nRural Development Ministry\nBring at least one woman from each low-income household, and provide them with training and funding for businesses making candles, soap, crafts, etc.\nThey\u2019ll work for themselves or for a skilled wage, which will bring in more money than working as farm labourers.\nDeen Dayal Upadhyaya Grameen Kaushalya Yojana (DDUGKY-2014)\nProvides rural youth aged 15 to 35 with FREE skill training.\nAt least 75% of trained candidates will be guaranteed a job.\nCover Left-Wing Extremist (LWE) districts and youth in North Eastern States.\nAajeevika Grameen Express Yojana (AGEY-2017)\n\nInterest-free loans are provided to SHGs and Community Based Organizations (CBOs) to purchase public transportation vehicles so they can make money transporting passengers.\n\nDisha Committee (2016)\nFor effective and timely development, the Ministry of Rural Development has established the District Development Coordination and Monitoring Committee (DISHA), which is made up of elected representatives from the local governments (PRI, ULB, State Assembly, and Parliament).\nThey will check on the progress of the plans at a quarterly meeting.\nThe senior-most Lok Sabha member from the designated district will serve as head of the DISHA Committee. To carry out the Committee\u2019s instructions, DM/Collector(IAS) will serve as the member secretary.\nMission Antyodaya (2017)\nMinistry of Rural Development\nHere, the government will use the assistance of the Gram Panchayat, NGOs, SHGs, ASHA workers, etc. to more vigilantly and accountable implement the other ongoing programmes.\nBy 2020, at least 50,000 Gram Panchayats will be free of poverty.\nConclusion\n\nThe major goal of all of our development programmes had been to encourage quick, balanced economic growth that was both equitable and socially just.\nHowever, not all groups of individuals have benefited from our policies and actions. The constitution\u2019s promise and our ancestors\u2019 hopes for an equitable society have not been realised.\nIt\u2019s time to consider unconventional approaches to ending poverty because while some regions and certain economic sectors have reached a level of social and economic growth that allows them to compete with industrialised nations, many others have been unable to escape the cycle of poverty.\n\nArticle Written By: Aryadevi"

The commission is mandated to study and monitor all matters relating to the Constitutional and legal safeguards provided to women; review the existing legislations to suggest amendments wherever necessary, and look into complaints involving the deprivation of the rights of women. All the state governments also have to set up State Commissions for Women (SCW) with similar functions.\n\nMission Shakti\n\n\u201cMission Shakti\u201d is a programme in a mission mode that aims to improve interventions for women\u2019s empowerment, safety, and security. The plan aims to economically empower women and provide them with the freedom to make their own decisions about their bodies and minds in a setting free from abuse and threat. Encouraging skill development, capacity building, financial literacy, access to microcredit, etc., it also aims to lessen the burden of care on women and enhance their involvement in the labour force.\n\n\u2018Swadhar Greh Scheme\n\nThe \u201cSwadhar Greh Scheme\u201d is being implemented by the Ministry of Women and Child Development. The programme meets the basic requirements of women in precarious situations, including those who have lost their homes due to family strife, crime, violence, mental stress, social isolation, or who are being coerced into prostitution and are in danger. The programme strives to economically and emotionally rehabilitate such women by offering them shelter, food, clothing, counselling, training, clinical assistance, and legal aid.\n\nSakhi \u2013 One-Stop Centres\n\nThe One Stop Center (OSC) Scheme is also carried out by the Ministry of Women and Child Development.

However, a person\u2019s religion may have various personal rules depending on issues like marriage, divorce, inheritance, and alimony.\n\nIndian secularism aimed to achieve the peaceful coexistence of various religions, but it was not an end in and of itself.\n\nIndian philosophical concept refers to equal respect for all religions. It derived from the Vedic idea of \u201cSarva Dharma Sambhava\u201d (meaning, \u201cthat the endpoint of the pathways pursued by all faiths is the same, though the paths themselves may be different\u201d)\n\nThis idea, known as \u201cPositive Secularism,\u201d which embodies the dominant spirit of Indian culture, was adopted and pushed by individuals like Vivekananda and Mahatma Gandhi.\n\nSecularism in Indian History\n\nSecular traditions are deeply ingrained in Indian history.\n\nThe foundation of Indian culture is the synthesis of numerous spiritual traditions and social movements.\n\nEmperor Ashoka\u00a0was the first great emperor to declare that the state would not persecute any religious denomination.\n\nIn his 12th Rock Edict, Ashoka urged people to adopt a spirit of profound respect for all religious factions in addition to tolerating them.\n\nThe pursuit of religious tolerance and the coexistence of various faiths persisted even after the arrival of Jainism, Buddhism, and later Islam and Christianity on Indian territory.\n\nThe Sufi and Bhakti traditions in medieval India created a loving and peaceful link between members of many communities.\n\nKhwaja Moinuddin Chisti, Baba Farid, Sant Kabir Das, Guru Nanak Dev, Saint Tukaram, and Mira Bai, among others, were major luminaries of these movements.\n\nIn medieval India, Akbar\u2019s rule was characterised by religious tolerance and freedom of worship. Numerous Hindus served as his ministers, and he abolished Jizya and prohibited forced conversions.\n\nHis proclamation of \u201cDin-i-Ilahi,\u201d or the Divine Beliefs, which combined components of both Hindu and Muslim faith, was the most obvious manifestation of his tolerance policy.\n\nIn addition, he emphasised the idea of \u201csulh-i-kul,\u201d or religious harmony and peace.\n\nHe even sponsored a number of theological discussions that took place at the Hall of Worship\u2019s \u201cIbadat Khana,\u201d featuring theologians from the Brahmin, Jains, and Zoroastrians.\n\nThe Indian liberation movement also contributed to the strengthening and enrichment of secularism, despite the fact that the British had a divide-and-rule policy in the name of many religions. The partition of Bengal, the establishment of separate electorates, and communal awards as examples of how Britishers fostered religious diversity in Indian society.\n\nHowever, the secular culture and ethos that defined the Indian freedom movement were present from the beginning.\n\nThe liberals who participated in the early stages of the Indian freedom movement, such as Sir Feroz Shah Mehta, Govind Ranade, and Gopal Krishna Gokhale, largely adopted a secular political philosophy.\n\nThere were many provisions on secularism in the constitution that Pandit Moti Lal Nehru drafted in 1928 while serving as the chairman of the \u00a0Nehru Committee, such as: \u201cThere shall be no state religion for the commonwealth of India or for any province in the commonwealth, nor shall the state, either directly or indirectly, endow any religion with any preference or impose any disability on account of religious beliefs or religious status.\u201d\n\nWhile J. L. Nehru\u2019s secularism was based on a dedication to scientific humanism tinted with a progressive perspective of historical development, Gandhiji\u2019s secularism was founded on a commitment to the brotherhood of religious communities based on their respect for the pursuit of truth.\n\nSecularism and the Indian Constitution\n\nAll the fundamental ideas of secularism have been explicitly incorporated into the constitution\u2019s different clauses.\n\nThe term \u201csecular\u201d was inserted into the preamble of the Constitution by the 42nd Amendment Act of 1976.\n\n\u201cIndia is a sovereign, socialist, secular, democratic, republic.\u201d\n\nIt highlights the fact that India is a constitutionally secular nation without a State religion. And that the state must respect all religions equally without favouring or patronising anyone in particular.\n\nOther constitutional provisions enlarge the concept of secularism:\n\nArticle 14\u00a0grants equality before the law and equal protection of the laws to all\n\nArticle 15 prohibits discrimination on grounds of religion, race, caste, sex or place of birth.\n\nArticle 16 (1) guarantees equality of opportunity to all citizens in matters of public employment and reiterates that there would be no discrimination on the basis of religion, race, caste, sex, descent, place of birth and residence.\n\nArticle 25 all persons are equally entitled to freedom of conscience and the right to freely profess, practise and propagate religion.\n\nArticle 26 every religious group or individual has the right to establish and maintain institutions for religious and charitable purposes and to manage its own affairs in matters of religion.\n\n\u00a0Article 27 the state shall not compel any citizen to pay any taxes for the promotion or maintenance of any particular religion or religious institution.\n\nArticle 28 allows religious instruction to be given at educational institutions run by various religious groups.\n\nArticle 29 Protect the cultural identities of minority\n\nArticle 30 Protect the educational rights of all minorities\n\nArticle 51A to uphold peace, the spirit of fraternity, and the rich history of our composite culture.\n\nIndian vs Western Secularism Model\n\nOver time, India has created its own distinct idea of secularism that, in the following ways, distinguishes it from the similar western concept:\n\nAccording to the western concept of secularism, the \u201cState\u201d and the \u201creligion\u201d have their own distinct domains and may not interfere with one another\u2019s business.\n\nThus, the full separation of religion and state is required by the western concept of secularism.\n\nHowever, there is no \u201cwall of separation\u201d between religion and the State in India, either in law or in reality.\n\nIn India, both the state and religion are permitted to interact and interfere in one another\u2019s business as long as they do so within the limits that have been set by law and the courts.\n\nIn other words, Indian secularism does not call for the complete exclusion of religion from the state.\n\nAccording to the western model, religious communities\u2019 educational institutions cannot get any financial assistance from the state.\n\nAll religious minorities in India have the legal right to create and maintain their own educational institutions, with possible state support.\n\nIn the western paradigm, the state stays out of religious concerns until they are conducted within the bounds of the law.\n\nOn the other hand, Indian secularism requires the state to intervene in religion in order to purge its vices.\n\nIndia has stepped in by implementing laws that forbid the customs of Sati, or the burning of widows, dowries, animal and bird sacrifice, child marriage, and denying Dalits access to temples.\n\nSince no public policy can be created in the west on the basis of religion, the government is completely cut off from the religious activities and practises of its people.\n\nIn India, the government has a policy of establishing Wakf Boards, Departments of Religious Endowments, etc. Additionally, it is involved in choosing the Trustees for these boards.\n\nThreats to Secularism\n\nDespite the fact that the Indian Constitution declares the state to be completely neutral toward all religions, our society is deeply religious.\n\nReligious persecution and inter-religious dominance are displayed in our society when one community or its members are discriminated against by another community or its members because of their religious identity.\n\nIndian secularism is in danger as a result of the blending of religion and politics, or the mobilisation of votes based on fundamental identities like religion, caste, and race.\n\nA communal politics is one that attacks rational ideals, communalizes social space, propagates myths and prejudices about minorities, and engages in divisive ideological propaganda and politics.\n\nInter-religious conflict results from the competitive politicisation of other groups as a result of the politicisation of any one religious organisation.\n\nCommunal riots are one of the signs of communalism. The secular foundation of Indian polity has shown to be seriously threatened by communalism in recent years as well.\n\nIn recent years, the rise of Hindu nationalism has led to mob lynchings based on the mere suspicion of eating meat and butchering cows.\n\nIn addition to this, forced slaughterhouse closures, efforts against \u201clove jihad,\u201d forced reconversion of Muslims to Hinduism (Ghar- wapsi), etc. all serve to strengthen communal tendencies in society.\n\nThe establishment of an Islamic State based on sharia law is promoted by Islamic fundamentalism or revivalism, which is directly at odds with ideas of a secular and democratic state.\n\nWay Forward\n\nCooperation towards \u201cmutual enlightenment\u201d is one method for decreasing religious prejudice. Only through education can people\u2019s mindsets be changed. To ensure that young people receive a valuable education that helps them understand and respect both their own and other religions\u2019 traditions in the nation.\n\nA shared set of values or a framework that enables the coexistence of the various groups is also required.\n\nThe establishment of a supportive atmosphere and the development of a socio-political consensus are necessary for the implementation of social reform initiatives like the Uniform Civil Code.\n\nArticle Written By: Aryadevi E S"

Similarly, there are various Muslim sects, including Shi\u2019ites, Sunnis, Ahmadis, etc.\nLanguage diversity\nThe major language families among the languages spoken in India are the Dravidian languages, which are spoken by 20% of Indians, and the Indo-Aryan languages, which are spoken by 75% of Indians.\nThe Austroasiatic, Sino-Tibetan, Tai-Kadai, and a few other minor language families and isolates are home to other languages.\nAfter Papua New Guinea, India has the second-highest number of languages in the world.

There are more than 3000 jatis, and there isn\u2019t a single system for classifying and ranking them across all of India.\nThe jati system is dynamic and allows for movement, which has allowed jatis to vary their location throughout time.

Religious sites and sacred rivers can be found all over the length and breadth of the country, from Badrinath and Kedarnath in the north to Rameshwaram in the south, Jagannath Puri in the east, and Dwaraka in the west. They are closely tied to the long-standing tradition of pilgrimage, which has always drawn people to different regions of the nation and given them a feeling of geo-cultural identity.\nFairs and festivals: These serve as integrating factors as well because people from all across the nation participate in them. Hindus around the nation celebrate Diwali, just as Muslims and Christians celebrate Id and Christmas, respectively. In India, interreligious celebrations are also observed.\nWeather integration via the monsoon: The monsoon season affects the entire Indian subcontinent\u2019s flora and fauna, agricultural activities, and way of life, including holidays. Sports and cinema are widely popular throughout the nation, serving as unifying forces. Factors that undermine India\u2019s unity include:\nRegionalism: Regionalism favours the interests of a certain region or region over those of the nation. It may also hurt national integration. Regional demands and the resulting law and order situation\nPolarising politics: Politicians would occasionally invoke ascriptive identities like caste, religion, etc. to gain support. Violence, feelings of mistrust, and suspicion among minorities can emerge from this kind of polarising politics.\nUnbalanced development Backwardness of a region can be brought on by uneven socioeconomic growth, poor economic policies, and the resulting economic inequities. As a result, this may spark acts of violence, ignite migrant waves, or even fuel separatist demands. For instance, numerous examples of secessionist demands and tendencies have emerged as a result of the North East\u2019s economic underdevelopment.\nEthnic diversity and nativism: Ethnic diversity has frequently resulted in conflicts between various ethnic groups, particularly as a result of reasons like employment competition, a lack of resources, and threats to identity For instance, Bodos and Muslims who speak Bengali frequently fight in Assam. The son of the soil idea, which links people to their place of birth and bestows upon them certain advantages, privileges, duties, and obligations that may not apply to others, has served to emphasize this.\nGeographic isolation: Isolation can also result in separatist thinking and identity problems. Geographically, the North-East is separated from the rest of the nation by a small passageway called the Siliguri corridor, sometimes known as the \u201cChicken\u2019s Neck.\u201dThe area is less developed economically than the rest of the nation and has poor infrastructure. As a result, it has seen several incidents of separatist and cross-border terrorism.\nInter-religious disputes: Inter-religious disputes not only deteriorate relations between two communities by sowing distrust and fear, but they also damage the nation\u2019s secular fabric.\nConflicts between states: This may cause feelings of regionalism to grow. Additionally, it may have an impact on interstate commerce and communication. For instance, the Karnataka-Tamil Cauvery River dispute\nExternal influences: External influences, such as foreign organizations, terrorist organizations, and extremist groups, can occasionally inspire violence and foster feelings of secession. g. Inter-Services Intelligence (ISI) is alleged to have supported and trained mujahideen to fight in Jammu and Kashmir and incite separatist sentiment among local groupings.\n\nDespite the difficulties diversity might provide, there is no denying the vital role sociocultural diversity has played in maintaining and advancing Indian culture.\n\nConclusion\n\nThe handling of diversity in Indian society, not diversity itself, is the issue. Because the benefits of growth haven\u2019t been divided fairly or certain groups\u2019 cultures haven\u2019t received the acknowledgement they deserve, problems like regionalism, communalism, and ethnic conflicts have emerged.\n\nTherefore, the Constitution and its ideas must serve as the foundation of our society. Any culture that has attempted to homogenize itself has experienced eventual stagnation and decline.\n\nThe most notable instance in this situation is Pakistan\u2019s attempt to force its culture on East Pakistan, ultimately leading to Bangladesh\u2019s establishment.\n\nArticle Written By: Atheena Fathima Riyas"

India is the second most populated nation in the world after China, with 1,412,495,893 people living there based on the latest United Nations data. India\u2019s populace is equivalent to 7% of the world\u2019s.\n\nIndia\u00a0ranks number\u00a02 in the list of\u00a0countries (and dependencies) by population.\n\nIndia\u00a0has overtaken\u00a0China\u00a0as the world\u2019s most populous country, according to UN\u00a0population estimates in April 2023.\n\nAlso read: China\u2019s Population Decline\n\nFindings related to India in UN World Population Prospects Report 2022\nIndia\u2019s growth rate was 2.3% in 1972, while it is currently less than 1%.\nOver this time, the average number of children an Indian woman has in her lifetime has decreased from around 5.4 to under 2.1.\nThe Replacement Fertility Rate, at which a population precisely replaces itself from one generation to the next, has reached India.\nWith improved access to healthcare and medical developments, both fertility rates and mortality rates have been dropping.\nIn the following decades, the population of 0-14 years, 15-24 years, and 65+ will continue to decrease while rising.\nPopulation expansion in India has been fueled by this decline in early mortality for succeeding generations, which is reflected in higher levels of life expectancy at birth.\nWhat opportunities are brought about by a growing populace?\nFirst, a growing working-age population presents a chance for increased per-capita economic growth. The \u201cdemographic dividend,\u201d a time-limited potential for rapid economic growth, is made possible by this change in the age distribution.\nSecond, it contributes to the development of a consumption-driven economy that is less reliant on exports to survive. As observed in the example of India, such economies have the propensity to absorb global shocks in a substantially better manner.\nFor international investors, the large domestic market is appealing. As a result, it contributes to drawing foreign investment into the domestic economy.\nThird, a growing population increases opportunities for immigration to other nations, which contributes to the creation of more foreign exchange reserves and strengthens a country\u2019s soft power abroad.\nFor instance, the Indian Diaspora in the U.S. sends a sizable share of remittances to their families who live in India.\nIssues Related to Population Growth\n\nOverpopulation is a severe threat to our existence. It results in issues with politics, society, and the economy, including unequal resource distribution, subpar living circumstances, a broken health system, and others.\n\nOverpopulation causes working institutions to become dysfunctional, undermines all efforts to upgrade the nation\u2019s infrastructure, and makes social welfare programs ineffective.\n\nSocial Aspects\nCrime: Populace growth and poverty are directly related, and lack of resources and job prospects result in unemployment. The educated youth who are affected by unemployment are thus driven to commit social crimes like robbery, burglary, prostitution, murder, etc.\nThe discontent among educated unemployed youth is reflected in the terrorist actions that we currently witness in several regions of the nation, for instance, Jammu and Kashmir.\nMinority-majority gap: Fears of supremacy over minorities and identity loss might arise in some cultures as a result of overpopulation.\nThus, it has the potential to fuel communalism and cause rifts in the social fabric based on religion.\nEconomical Aspects\nAgeing population: Due to an increase in life expectancy, India\u2019s population is ageing. This has increased the percentage of the elderly populace.\nfor example, in 2011, Kerala\u2019s share of the populace over 60 years old was 12.6% and Tamil Nadu\u2019s was 10.4%. By 2031, these are anticipated to rise to 20.9% and 18.2%, respectively.\nAn increase in the senior populace results in higher healthcare and social security costs. This will significantly increase the state exchequer\u2019s financial burden and cut back on funding for investing in capital assets.\nUnemployment: Although there is a large army of labourers as a result of overpopulation, it is difficult to give each working person a job that pays a living wage due to a lack of capital resources.\nThere is a clear distinction between disguised unemployment in rural areas and open unemployment in urban areas.\nResource Depletion: Overpopulation is a direct cause of excessive resource exploitation, environmental degradation, and deterioration. While resources in India have either remained constant or have expanded arithmetically, generating resource constraints, population growth in India has been geometric.\nUneven Income Distribution: The government\u2019s need for investment and capital formation is impacted by overpopulation, which has an impact on the government\u2019s overall development efforts.\nUnemployment, unequal food distribution, and rising poverty, which are the main causes of the increase in poverty, make the situation worse.\nPoverty: People become poor as a result of unemployment, unfair income distribution, and a lack of resources.\nPolitical Aspects\nA nation\u2019s politics is impacted by its economic and social conditions. Rising unemployment, poverty, and unequal wealth distribution all have an impact on the nation\u2019s law and order condition.\nCaste politics: Political parties engage in caste-based politics to satisfy their vote bank, which is another factor contributing to the nation\u2019s division.\nThe interstate disparity in population distribution: There are significant differences between states in terms of growth and population. Increased migration into states with smaller populations and more established economies will be caused by rising populations in some states.\nSocial conflict including the insider-versus-outsider debate may result from this. States already reserve jobs for their residents. Additionally, ageing States will depend on foreign immigrants to sustain economic growth.\n\nAlso read: Fertility Rate in India: Reasons for Decline\n\nEnvironmental Aspects\nEnvironmental deterioration: Overpopulation is putting pressure on the land, and there is less land available per person.\nEnvironmental deterioration brought on by population growth includes pollution, biodiversity loss, and global warming, among other things. Cities like Delhi, which are suffering from air pollution, are already seeing the effects of overcrowding.\nHealth Aspects\nSpread of infectious diseases: One of the main elements affecting people\u2019s health is population growth. Numerous infectious diseases have emerged as a result of concerns like urban overcrowding and environmental changes brought on by population growth.\nGovernments are increasingly unable to expand their healthcare facilities and systems due to population increase.\nDemographic Disaster\n\nHowever, if the economic benefits are not inclusive, unable to create jobs, and unable to enhance the living conditions of the youth, the social cohesiveness may suffer significantly.\n\nThis optimistic view of the demographic dividend presented in the preceding discussion may be clouded by issues with education, employment prospects, and health care.\n\nA youthful population that lacks skills is underutilized, and is frustrated might stymie economic development and cause a demographic disaster that could destabilize peace and incite conflict.\n\nThe Pratham research states that just about 50% of fifth graders can read books from class two and struggle with basic addition and subtraction.\nSimilarly to this, the health system is underdeveloped, and 48% of children are underweight now, contributing to the demographic dividend of the future.\nIn eight industries over the last few years, India added the fewest new organized jobs than any other country. In 2017, the contribution from jobs in the unorganized sector increased to 93%, and 60% of those having jobs did not find work for the entire year, indicating persistent underemployment.\n\nTherefore, the only way to prevent this demographic dividend from becoming a demographic disaster is to ensure that there is more employment in the manufacturing and service sectors, and we also need to work on revamping the educational system.\n\nThe negative consequences of low employment growth are already evident in the rise in violent protests, terrorism, and other law-and-order issues.\n\nHow Can the Population Rise be Effectively Managed?\nRaising the Marriage Age: Fertility is influenced by marriage age. Therefore, raising the marriage age to 21 is a good idea.\nEducation dissemination: It influences people\u2019s perspectives. It increases understanding of the significance of family planning and birth control options. Women who have received education are more health-conscious and steer clear of repeated pregnancies, which lowers the birth rate.\nAdoption: Adoption is another powerful tool for reducing the population. Despite costly medical care, some parents are unable to conceive. It is advised that they adopt children from orphanages.\nEconomic Measures: Numerous economic actions must be implemented as preventative measures against population expansion. More employment opportunities must be created by the government through policies. It is essential to increase employment opportunities in both urban and rural locations.\nIndia\u2019s Population Policy\nIndia has had a formal population policy in place for more than 50 years.\nIndia may have been the first nation to formally declare such a policy in 1952.\nThe National Family Planning Programme served as the implementation of the population policy. The fundamental goals of this programme have not changed much throughout the years; they are to attempt and change the rate and pattern of population growth in a socially desirable way.\nEarly on, the main goals were to enhance public health standards, raise public knowledge of population and health issues, and cut down the rate of population growth by promoting various birth control methods.\nAfter the Emergency, the National Family Welfare Program was established instead of the National Family Planning Program, and coercive techniques were abandoned. A wide range of sociodemographic goals is now present for the programme.\nThe National Population Policy of 2000 included the development of a fresh set of rules.\nNational Population Policy (NPP), 2000\n\nThe strategy sought to combine community initiative, women\u2019s empowerment, education, and Panchayati Raj institutions into the field of population control. Family welfare is used in place of family planning.\n\nObjectives:\n\nTo provide integrated service delivery for essential reproductive and child health care, as well as to meet the unmet needs for contraceptives, health care infrastructure, and health professionals.\nBy 2010, the total fertility rate should reach replacement levels as a medium-term goal.\nlong-term goal: to stabilize the population by 2045.\n\nBroad Targets:\n\nReduce infant mortality to 30 per cent and improve child and reproductive health by addressing the infrastructure, service, and supply needs for basic reproductive and child health.\nReduce the percentage of boys and girls who drop out of primary and secondary school to under 20% by making education up to the age of 14 free and mandatory.\nreduce maternal mortality to 100.\nAchieving universal immunization of children against all vaccine-preventable illnesses.\nAchieving 80% of deliveries should take place in medical facilities, 100% should be handled by skilled experts, and 100% of pregnancies, births, and deaths should be registered.\nIt envisioned a stable population by 2045, which was later postponed to 2065.\nEnhancing the health and family welfare services and expanding access to contraceptives.\n\nIt has drawn criticism on several fronts since it offers monetary incentives for small family norms, even though financial incentives do not alter habits and behaviours based on social norms.\n\nAdditionally, NPP-2000 placed a strong emphasis on the function of Panchayati Raj Institutions, although it did not specify exactly what that function would be.\n\nDisincentives are the most common kind of coercion. State-imposed disincentives frequently discriminate against the poor and women.\n\nGovernment Schemes\n\nTo stabilize the population, the government has mostly relied on family planning initiatives. Family welfare programs are a crucial part of the family planning process, and several different ones have been introduced over time:\n\nThe Janani Suraksha Yojana encourages institutional delivery while lowering maternal and newborn fatalities through financial aid.\nThe Integrated Child Development Scheme emphasizes the overall health, nutrition, and vaccination of children under the age of six as well as the correct dietary and physical education of expectant and nursing mothers.\nprogram for universal immunization.\nPradhan Swasthya Mantri The Suraksha Yojana aims to balance out the disparities between the cost and accessibility of tertiary-level healthcare.\nProgram for ASHAs to provide contraceptives to beneficiaries\u2019 homes and doorsteps.\nPlan for ASHAs to ensure birth spacing. An essential component of the ASHA kit now includes the pregnancy testing kit.\n\nPopulation growth is a serious global concern that has negative socioeconomic, environmental, and health effects. The birth rate, mortality rate, and migration rates are all factors that affect the population growth rate of the country, which is rapidly rising. The demand for greater resources in overpopulated areas leads to deforestation for food production, urban overcrowding, and the spread of terrible diseases.\n\nSince Independence, the government has launched several initiatives to reduce population increase, some of which have been somewhat successful in doing so. There is a need for a more targeted strategy in certain areas that continue to experience rapid population expansion.\n\nArticle Written By: Aryadevi E S"

The recent increase in hate crimes has also triggered debates about the need for separate legislation to protect minorities against lynching and hate crimes.\u00a0\n\nSome of the main problems faced by minorities in India are as follows:\u00a0\n\nThe problem of identity- Because of the differences in socio-cultural practices, history, and backgrounds, minorities have to grapple with the issue of identity everywhere which gives rise to the problem of adjustment with the majority community.\nThe problem of Security: Different identity and their small number relative to the rest of society develops a feeling of insecurity about their life, assets, and well-being. This sense of insecurity may get accentuated at times when relations between the majority and the minority communities in society are strained or not very cordial.\nThe problem of equity:- The minority community in society may remain deprived of the benefit of opportunities for development as a result of discrimination. Because of the difference in identity, the minority community develops the perception of the sense of inequity. Religion is a complex phenomenon in India. Though India is declared a \u2018secular\u2019 state, the problem of secularism looms large here. Conversion to Islam and Christianity has been a controversial issue over the last couple of decades.\nVaried reasons:\u2014ranging from poverty to perceived discrimination resulted in the alienation of Muslims and Christians in India. The Government of India constituted a committee on 9th March 2005 under the chairmanship of Justice Rajendra Sachar to enquire and analyze the problems faced especially by Muslims in India.\nEconomic reasons Indian socio-economic fabric is very complex because it is much affected by caste, religion, and the more regional/linguistic differentials. At the same time, the Indian economic, social, and political institutions which are persisted for centuries have a historical basis also. These factors have given a unique character to Indian society. It has become a conglomeration of various layers and segments divided and sub-divided.\nBackwardness:- Minority communities are unable to join the mainstream of society. Sachar Committee which was constituted in 2005 has placed Muslims below the scheduled castes, and scheduled tribes.\nThe problem of Representation:- In terms of religious composition, 90.4% of MPs in Loksabha are Hindus. 5.2% are Muslims and another religious community represents 4% MPS. Muslims contribute only 2.5% of the Indian bureaucracy.\nLack of Clear definition:- There was no clear definition for the minority which creates a huge flaw.

There are certain special advantages that these communities are entitled to by the Constitution of India as well as various other legislative and administrative measures.\nArticle 30 of the Indian Constitution upholds the right of religious and linguistic minorities to establish and administer educational institutions of their choice. Hence, statement 1 is correct. There is no provision for the President of India to automatically nominate a member of a minority religious community to the Lok Sabha. This provision was earlier available for members of the Anglo-Indian community under Article 331 of the Constitution. Hence, statement 2 is not correct.\nReligious minorities can derive benefits from the Prime Minister\u2019s 15-Point Programme. The programme was launched in 2005 to ensure the welfare of minorities in the fields of education, skill development, employment and prevention of communal conflicts. Hence, statement 3 is correct. Therefore, option (c) is the correct answer.\n\nArticle written by Aseem Muhammed"

Many people in the population are poor and unable to buy as much food as they require. In contrast to this, obesity is becoming a more widespread problem across the nation. Read here to understand more about the issue of malnutrition.\n\nOver 40% of youngsters receive less food than they should, and almost a third of Indians are thought to be malnourished.\n\nThe Indian government is raising food subsidies to solve this issue, but there are still problems because of the country\u2019s fast-expanding population and the increased share of its citizens who live in urban areas.\n\nRegarding its global standing as a crucial indication of human development, the Global Hunger Index (GHI) 2022 has handed India more dismal news. India came in at position 107 out of 121.\n\nThe GHI examines stunting, wasting, and mortality among children as well as caloric insufficiency throughout the population, making it a crucial indicator of nutrition, especially for children.\nFurthermore, there is no evidence of a global conspiracy; according to India\u2019s National Family Health Survey (NFHS-5), from 2019 to 21, 35.5% of children under the age of five had stunting, 19.3% had wasted, and 32.1% had an underweight condition.\n\nTable of Contents\n\nMalnutrition\nThe gap in India\u2019s nutrition status\nMajor causes of malnutrition in India\nMalnutrition in India: Government initiatives\nWay forward\nRelated posts\nMalnutrition\n\nNote: Subscribe to the ClearIAS YouTube Channel to learn more.\n\n\ud83d\udc49 Which year are YOU targeting for success in the IAS/IPS/IFS Exam? \ud83d\ude80\n\n(1) \u21d2 UPSC 2025: Prelims cum Mains\n\n(2) \u21d2 UPSC 2026: Prelims cum Mains\n\n(3) \u21d2 UPSC 2027 Prelims cum Mains\n\nTip: Know more about ClearIAS Courses (Online/Offline)\n\nMalnutrition refers to deficiencies or excesses in nutrient intake, imbalance of essential nutrients, or impaired nutrient utilization.\n\nThe double burden of malnutrition consists of both undernutrition and overweight and obesity, as well as diet-related noncommunicable diseases.\n\nUndernutrition manifests in four broad forms: wasting, stunting, underweight, and micronutrient deficiencies.\n\nWasting is defined as low weight for height. It often indicates recent and severe weight loss, although it can also persist for a long time. It usually occurs when a person has not had food of adequate quality and quantity and/or they have had frequent or prolonged illnesses. Wasting in children is associated with a higher risk of death if not treated properly.\nStunting is defined as low height for age. It is the result of chronic or recurrent undernutrition, usually associated with poverty, poor maternal health and nutrition, frequent illness, and/or inappropriate feeding and care in early life. Stunting prevents children from reaching their physical and cognitive potential.\nUnderweight is defined as low weight for age. An underweight child may be stunted, wasted, or both.\nMicronutrient deficiencies are a lack of vitamins and minerals that are essential for body functions such as producing enzymes, hormones, and other substances needed for growth and development.\n\nMalnutrition in India has multiple dimensions like calorific deficiency, protein hunger, and micronutrient deficiency.\n\nAlso read: Biofortification\n\nThe gap in India\u2019s nutrition status\n\nUndernutrition and stunting persist as roadblocks for the country. India is the home to almost one-third of all the world\u2019s stunted children and half the world\u2019s wasted children.\n\nAs per the NFHS-5, wealth quintile analysis gives us a further grim picture \u2013 half of all children from families in the lowest income quintile are still stunted or underweight. While India has made sustained rapid progress economically, the nutritional status of the country remains at odds.\n\nIn India, this situation is complex, as, despite the GDP rise of the country in recent years, untold numbers still live in abject poverty.\n\nThis creates a dual burden of obesity among the wealthier individuals, as well as vast swathes of the population suffering from poverty-related malnutrition.\nMajor causes of malnutrition in India\nHigh levels of adult undernutrition affect one-third of the country\u2019s adults\nHigh levels of child undernutrition, affect almost every second child\nHigh levels of maternal undernutrition, lead to low birth-weight\nInappropriate and sub-optimal infant and young child feeding and caring practices\nIssues relating to the prevention of illnesses and access to healthcare\nLow awareness regarding nutrition and the use of local nutritious food including sources of nutrients\nInadequate attention to the health and nutrition of adolescent girls\nInadequate access to safe drinking water and proper sanitation facilities\nMalnutrition in India: Government initiatives\n\nThe government is running various schemes that aim to curb the malnutrition problem.\n\nIntegrated Child Development Services (ICDS) Scheme:\n\nIt was launched in 1975 and the program aims to provide food, preschool education, primary healthcare, immunization, health checkups, and referral services to children under 6 years old and their mothers.\n\nPradhan Mantri Matru Vandana Yojana (PMMVY):\n\nPradhan Mantri Matru Vandana Yojana (PMMVY) is a Centrally Sponsored DBT scheme with a cash incentive of \u20b9 5000/- (in three installments) being provided directly in the bank/post office account of Pregnant Women and Lactating Mothers.\n\nNational Nutrition Mission (NNM):\u00a0\n\nThe government of India has launched the National Nutrition Mission (NNM), also known as\u00a0POSHAN Abhiyaan, to\u00a0eradicate malnutrition by the year 2022.\n\nAnemia Mukt Bharat Abhiyan:\u00a0\n\nThe mission was launched in 2018 to accelerate anemia decline by one to three percentage points annually.\n\nMid-day Meal (MDM) scheme:\u00a0\n\nIt aims to\u00a0improve nutrition levels among school children\u00a0in addition to increasing\u00a0enrolment, retention, and attendance.\n\nNational Food Security Act (NFSA), 2013:\u00a0\n\nNFSA Assuring food and nutrition security for the most vulnerable is the aim of this law, which makes access to food a legal entitlement.\n\nRead: Anemia Mukt Bharat\n\nWay forward\n\nMalnutrition in India is a multi-dimensional problem hence the Government efforts should prioritize three key areas:\n\nFood system:\n\nTo support healthy diets for everyone and to address the political economy of food, the government has to put robust regulatory and policy frameworks in place.\nAccording to some sources, biofortification is one of the most affordable ways to supply the required nutrient levels.\nPrioritization should be given to steps that assure efficient execution, integration into policies, customer demand, and access to food.\n\nFinance for nutrition:\n\nThe government should aggressively create new finance mechanisms that can supplement current sources.\nBoth within communities and within states, there are disparities in nutrition.\nAs a result, data should be used to guide resource allocation decisions through practical, affordable, and evidence-based approaches.\nIn addition, the revival and widespread adoption of MDM would be a fantastic place to start.\n\nHealth systems:\n\nThe government should design cost-effective nutrition care programs and invest in human resources to expand nutrition services within health services and ensure that everyone has access to high-quality nutrition care.\nThe Community-based Management of Acute Malnutrition (CMAM) paradigm and community-driven activities like Village Health Sanitation Nutrition Day (VHSND) must be improved.\nThere is evidence to support the idea that many kids with severe acute malnutrition can be treated in their neighborhoods without being admitted to a hospital or a therapeutic feeding facility.\nRelated posts\nSaksham Anganwadi and Poshan 2.0\nFood Security in India\nBreakfast scheme: Feeding the future\nFood Safety and Standards Authority of India (FSSAI)\nChild food poverty\n\n-Article written by Swathi Satish"

Union of India (2020)\nThe Problem of over-criminalization of Hate Speech\nA Forward Approach\nConclusion\nWhat are the legal provisions related to Hate Speech in India?\nArticle 19(2) of the Constitution of India puts reasonable restrictions on the Freedom of Speech including public order, decency or morality, defamation, or incitement to an offense.\n\nSection 153(a) of the Indian Penal Code (IPC) punishes the promotion of enmity between different groups on grounds of religion, race, place of birth, residence, language, etc. with imprisonment up to 3 years.\nSection 153(b) of IPC punishes assertions prejudicial to national integration (e.g., asserting that a class of persons cannot bear true faith and allegiance to the Constitution of India) with imprisonment of up to 3 years.\nSection 295(a) of IPC punishes deliberate and malicious acts, intended to outrage the religious feelings of any class by insulting its religion or religious beliefs with imprisonment for up to 3 years.\nSection 505(2) of IPC punishes statements creating or promoting enmity, hatred, or ill will between classes with imprisonment for up to 3 years.\n\nSection 8 of the Representation of People\u2019s Act, 1951 (RPA) prevents a person convicted of the illegal use of the freedom of speech from contesting an election.\nSections 123(3A) and 125 of the RPA bar the promotion of animosity on the grounds of race, religion, community, caste, or language in reference to elections and include it under corrupt electoral practices.\nSuggestions made by Law Commission\n\nIn its 267th report, the Law Commission of India proposed including the following two provisions:\n\nSection 153C covers\u00a0crimes committed when someone threatens someone with remarks meant to incite fear, hatred, or violence based on someone\u2019s race, caste, religion, sex, gender identity, or other characteristics.\nSection 505A should be included and have provisions that make inciting fear, alarm, or violence a crime.\nInterpretation of the Supreme Court related to Hate Speech\n\nFollowing are the case laws wherein the Supreme court cleared its stand.\n\n\ud83d\udc49 Which year are YOU targeting for success in the IAS/IPS/IFS Exam? \ud83d\ude80\n\n(1) \u21d2 UPSC 2025: Prelims cum Mains\n\n(2) \u21d2 UPSC 2026: Prelims cum Mains\n\n(3) \u21d2 UPSC 2027 Prelims cum Mains\n\nTip: Know more about ClearIAS Courses (Online/Offline)\n\nRamji Lal Modi Case( 1957)\n\nA five-judge Supreme Court bench upheld the validity of Section 295(A) in this case.\n\nWhile Article 19(2) permits reasonable restrictions on freedom of speech and expression for the sake of public order, the Supreme Court reasoned, a\u00a0more severe type of blasphemy that is done with the intent to outrage the religious sensibilities of any group is punishable under Section 295(A).\n\nSuperintendent, Central Prison, Fatehgarh Vs Ram Manohar Lohia case (1960)\n\nIt was claimed that in order to invoke Section 295(A) of the IPC, a strong linkage must exist between the speech that was spoken and any public disorder that was brought about as a result of it.\n\nIn addition, it came to the conclusion in 2011 that only speech that amounted to \u201cincitement to impending unlawful conduct\u201d is punishable.\n\nThat is to say, a very high standard must be met before the state can use public disturbance as an excuse to censor expression.\n\nS. Rangarajan Etc vs P. Jagjivan Ram\n\nIn this decision, the Court ruled that the right to free speech cannot be restricted unless the situation it creates is one that endangers the community or the public interest, and that threat cannot be imagined, remote, or improbable.\n\nIf the expression is taken, there must be a close connection.\n\nAmish Devgan v. Union of India (2020)\n\nAccording to the Supreme Court, \u201chate speech has no valid or redeeming motive other than hostility for a specific group.\u201d\n\nThe Problem of over-criminalization of Hate Speech\n\nIn a dramatic and very personal turn of events in 2015, Indian novelist Perumal Murugan declared his creative \u201cdeath,\u201d pulled the entirety of his published works from circulation, and vowed never to write again.\n\nThis resulted from the violent backlash he received from religious and caste-based groups who claimed that his fifth book, \u201cMadhorubagan\u201d in Tamil, or \u201cOne Part Woman,\u201d offended religious sensibilities, insulted the Kailasanathar temple, Lord Shiva, and female worshippers, among other allegations.\n\nThey also claimed that it appealed to prurient interest, among other things.\n\nA Forward Approach\n\nMany of the legal restrictions on hate speech that are in place today date back to the days before the Internet. Specialized law to control hate speech spread on the Internet and, notably, social media, is urgently needed.\n\nIt is possible to make reference to the Australian federal law known as the Criminal Code Amendment Act, 2019, which holds Internet service providers accountable if they know that any obscene or violent content\u2014which is defined to include content that a reasonable man would find offensive\u2014is accessible through the service they provide.\n\nIn the context of a \u201cdigital single market,\u201d the European Union has also adopted a code of conduct to prevent the spread of hate speech. It calls for cooperative, autonomous, inclusive regulation that adheres to global best practices for content filtering and privacy rights while being tailored to local and cultural norms.\n\nConclusion\n\nActions usually performed in response to contemporary hate speech have a whack-a-mole effect, whereby the underlying desire to sow division or hatred among communities endures through digital or social media platforms irrespective arrest of the offenders.\n\nBy modifying the IPC and the Information Technology Act, it is crucial to implement precise and long-lasting legislative rules that prevent hate speech, especially that which is spread online and through social media.\n\nIn the end, only when hate speech is acknowledged as a justifiable limitation on free expression would this be feasible.\n\nClick here to read more about the 100 Must-Know Acts Enacted by the Indian Parliament.\n\nArticle Written By: Jis John Sebastian\u00a0"

Read here to know more about them.\n\nAccording to the Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes Research and Training Institute (SCSTRTI), the word Santhal is derived from two words: \u2018Santha\u2019 means calm and peaceful; \u2018ala\u2019 means man.\n\nSanthal is mainly agricultural people and is the third largest Scheduled Tribe Community in the country after Gond and Bhil. The Santhal population is mostly distributed in Odisha, Jharkhand, Bihar, and West Bengal. Their literacy rate is very high compared to other tribal groups in those states.\n\nSanthali is the language spoken by Santhals and has its own script called Ol Chiki is included in the Eighth Schedule to the constitution.

The Santhals are considered to be an Adivasi or indigenous community, and their history is marked by resilience, resistance, and a harmonious connection with nature.\n\nThey are believed to have come from the Champa Kingdom of northern Cambodia. In the past, they had led a nomadic life. Eventually, they settled down in Chhotanagpur Plateau. Towards the end of the 18th century, they migrated to the Santhal Parganas of Bihar, and then they came to Odisha.\nTheir migration was driven by various factors, including socio-economic conditions, a search for fertile land, and a desire for self-governance.\n\nThe Santhal culture is vibrant, expressed through their music, dance, art, and oral traditions. Santhal folk music and dance, especially during festivals, are integral to their identity. The \u201cBaha\u201d dance and \u201cSoor Diul\u201d festival are notable cultural expressions that showcase their close connection with nature and agricultural practices.\n\nTraditionally, the Santhals have been an agrarian community, practicing shifting cultivation and subsistence farming. Their economy revolves around agriculture, forestry, and traditional handicrafts. The community is known for its expertise in making musical instruments, pottery, and traditional Santhal paintings.\n\n\ud83d\udc49 Which year are YOU targeting for success in the IAS/IPS/IFS Exam? \ud83d\ude80\n\n(1) \u21d2 UPSC 2025: Prelims cum Mains\n\n(2) \u21d2 UPSC 2026: Prelims cum Mains\n\n(3) \u21d2 UPSC 2027 Prelims cum Mains\n\nTip: Know more about ClearIAS Courses (Online/Offline)\n\nSanthal Rebellion (1855-1856)\n\nSanthal tribes are known for their bravery. They were great fighters since the British regime in India. Peasant revolts take an important place in modern Indian history. The Santhal rebellion was the first of its kind which began as a reaction to the introduction of the Permanent Land Settlement of 1793.\n\nThe company imposed high taxes on their land, which they had to borrow to pay it off.\nMoneylenders demanded high interest rates which in turn added a burden on Santhals to pay their debts and eventually claimed their lands.\nWhen they became landless, they were forced to work as bonded laborers on their land which turned havoc on Santhal\u2019s way of life.\n\nTo fight against all these oppressions, the Santhals formed an army made up of peasants.\n\nMain leaders:- Sidhu, Kanhu, Chand, and Bhairav Murmu (brothers).\n\nImpact of the Santhal Rebellion\nAround 15,000 tribesmen were killed and tens of villages were destroyed. British officers suppressed the rebellion.\nOne of the main impacts is that it was responsible for the creation of the present state of Jharkhand.\nThe region between Bhagalpur and Rajmahal hills in Singhbhum district was separated and named Santhal Pargana. It is declared a non-regulation district.\nIt provided a greater influence on future tribal movements.\n\nIt happened in present-day Jharkhand (Rajmahal area), then part of the Bengal presidency.\n\nPresent day status of Santhals\n\nThe Santhal tribes, one of the largest indigenous communities in India, have a rich history and cultural heritage that extends through centuries. Spread across several states in eastern India, the Santhals have significantly contributed to the country\u2019s cultural mosaic.\n\nChallenges and Struggles\n\nThroughout history, the Santhal tribes have faced challenges, including displacement, exploitation, and socio-economic disparities. The community has often been at the forefront of movements advocating for land rights, forest rights, and social justice. The Santhal Rebellion of 1855-56, led by tribal leaders Sidhu and Kanhu, is a historic example of their resistance against oppressive policies.\n\nLegal Recognition and Rights\n\nIn contemporary times, efforts have been made to address the rights and welfare of the Santhal tribes. Constitutional provisions, such as the Fifth and Sixth Schedules, recognize the rights of scheduled tribes, providing protection and safeguards. Additionally, the Panchayats (Extension to Scheduled Areas) Act, 1996 (PESA), empowers tribal communities, including the Santhals, with self-governance rights.\n\nEducation and Development\n\nWhile there have been initiatives to improve education and healthcare among the Santhals, challenges such as limited access to quality education and healthcare persist. Organizations and NGOs are working towards bridging these gaps and empowering the community through skill development and awareness programs.\n\nCultural Revival and Identity\n\nEfforts are being made to revive and preserve the Santhal cultural heritage. Cultural festivals, language preservation, and documentation of traditional knowledge contribute to the community\u2019s identity and resilience.\n\nConclusion\n\nThe Santhal tribes, with their rich history and cultural diversity, are an integral part of India\u2019s social fabric. While the community has faced historical challenges, its resilience, cultural pride, and contributions to India\u2019s cultural landscape remain undeniable. Efforts toward legal recognition, social inclusion, and economic empowerment continue to shape the present and future of the Santhal tribes, highlighting the importance of preserving and celebrating the diversity of India\u2019s indigenous communities.\n\nPrevious Year UPSC question\n\nAfter the Santhal uprising subsided, what was/were the measure/measures taken by the colonial government?\u00a0(Prelims 2018)\n\nThe territories called \u2018Santhal Paraganas\u2019 were created.\nIt became illegal for a Santhal to transfer land to a non-Santhal.\n\nSelect the correct answer using the code given below:\n\n(a) 1 only\n(b) 2 only\n(c) Both 1 and 2\n(d) Neither 1 nor 2.\n\nAnswer:- (c)\n\nArticle written by: Krishnapriya JR"

It was decided that the Doctrine of Coverture formed the foundation for Section 497, which defined adultery as a crime.\n\nDespite the Constitution\u2019s rejection of this doctrine holds that a woman loses her identity and legal rights when marriage, which is an infringement on her fundamental rights.\n\nCase laws in the issue of Marital Rape\n\nThe top court ruled in the case of State of Karnataka v. Krishnappa that sexual assault is a demeaning act in addition to being a violation of someone\u2019s right to privacy and the sanctity of their own body female.\n\nSuchita Srivastava v. Chandigarh Administration is a case where, the Supreme Court compared the freedom to decide on issues that affect sexual action with respect for one\u2019s privacy, personal space, and dignity under Article 21 of the Constitution, as well as physical integrity.\n\nIn 2018, the Supreme Court in Joseph Shine v. Union of India struck down the 158-year-old Victorian morals code regarding adultery. According to the Supreme Court, husbands are not their wives\u2019 masters and wives are not their husbands\u2019 property.\n\nThe woman is seen as the husband\u2019s property when he has control over her sexual agency. The husband\u2019s control over the woman\u2019s loyalty is considered as upholding the husband\u2019s property stake in his wife.\n\nWhat are the arguments for criminalizing marital rape?\n\nIn opposition to married women\u2019s individual rights ie. Articles 14 and 21 :\n\nMarital rape infringes on a woman\u2019s or a wife\u2019s right to live her life in dignity.\n\nA fundamental right under Article 21 of the Indian Constitution, the right to life includes the right to live with dignity.\n\nThe Supreme Court of India ruled in numerous cases that the crime of rape violates the victim\u2019s right to life and right to a dignified existence.\n\nThe rights to one\u2019s body should be the same for married and single women alike.\n\nBreaking the law on sexual privacy\n\nThe Indian constitution does not specifically address the right to privacy. However, the Supreme Court has determined that the scope of Article 21 ensures a right to privacy inherently.\n\nThe Supreme Court ruled in the case of the State of Maharashtra v. Madhukar Narayan that every woman has a right to her sexual privacy and that no one has the right to invade that privacy whenever they like.\n\nAn infringement of the right to bodily autonomy\n\nEvery person has the right to decide what to do with their body. Similar to this, one of a woman\u2019s most personal choices is whether or not to engage in sexual activity or grant her consent.\n\nIt is a natural right to express oneself. In light of this, the idea of marital exclusion under Section 375 of the Indian Penal Code (IPC) in regard to rape becomes a form of interference with her right to decision-making and thus a violation of the right to freedom of expression (Article 19).\n\nInconsistencies with other laws\n\nEven if they are not divorced, a husband who is living apart from his wife may be charged with rape (Section 376B)\n\nCarnal intercourse against the laws of nature by any male (including a husband) is punishable under Section 377 of the IPC.\n\nThis exception implies that the woman is a husband\u2019s property, contradicting the Supreme Court\u2019s ruling in Joseph Shine v. Union of India (2018).\n\nWhat are the arguments against criminalizing marital rape?\n\nDestabilizing the institution of marriage:\n\nIt may lead to complete anarchy in families, undermine the institution of marriage, and obliterate the foundation of the family, which protects family values and supports the nation. In Indian culture, marriage is regarded as a sacrament.\n\nMisuse of the law\n\nIt might be utilized in the same way that section 498A of the IPC, which prohibits harassment of married women by their husbands and in-laws, is increasingly being misapplied to harass husbands.\n\nImplementation problems\n\nMaking marital rape a crime will lead to problems like\n\nIf any sexual act a man engages in with his wife qualifies as marital rape, then the woman, who cannot always be trusted, will be the only one who can decide whether the conduct is marital rape or not.\n\nWhat evidence the courts will consider in these cases\u2014where there can be no conclusive proof of a man\u2019s wife engaging in sexual activity?\n\nConclusion\n\nInvolvement of the court tips the scales in favor of eliminating the legal exception for marital rape. The Supreme Court\u2019s reluctance to suspend the ruling, which resulted in the first marital rape trial of a man, shows that the higher judiciary is prepared to conduct a thorough investigation of the colonial-era clause.\n\nThe UN Committee on Elimination of Discrimination and the JS Verma committee, which were both established in connection with the Nirbhaya gang-rape case against Women had suggested to the government in 2013 that the\nLegalizing marital rape is a smart option for India.\n\nIt is crucial that the legislative ban on marital rape be matched by behavioral changes in society at large, including prosecutors, police, and the general public.\n\nClick here to read more notes on Indian Polity which you shouldn\u2019t miss.\n\nArticle Written by: Jis John Sebastian"

A recent survey found that 30% to 50% of elderly persons reported depressive symptoms.\n\nReduced quality workforce:\u00a0 There can be a severe lack of qualified workers due to the decline in the number of people who are of working age.\n\nIncrease in dependency ratio: In order to cover greater healthcare expenses, pension benefits, and other publicly supported services, India with an increasing rate of older populations must rely on smaller labor pools to raise taxes.\n\nNational Policy on Senior Citizens\n\nA number of elements formed the basis of the \u201cNational Policy for Senior Citizens 2011\u201d policy.\n\nThese include the growing older population, the shifting economy and social climate, the growth of science, technology, and medicine, as well as the high rates of destitution among the elderly and rural poor.\n\nIt aimed to include elderly citizens, particularly older women, and their concerns in the discussion of national development.\n\nIt promoted the idea of \u201cAgeing in Place\u201d or ageing in one\u2019s own home, housing, income stability, homecare, access to healthcare insurance plans, and other programs and services to enable and sustain dignity in old age.\n\nWhich are the intervening areas of this policy?\n\nMicrofinance\n\nSenior citizens would be provided with loans at fair interest rates to launch small companies. The Reserve Bank of India will assist microfinance for senior folks by issuing the necessary rules. This can be a productive step toward tackling ageing in India.\n\nTaxation of the elderly people\n\nTaxation policies would be sensitive to the financial issues faced by elderly citizens, which are exacerbated by the high costs of medical and nursing care, as well as the necessity for home support services and transportation.\n\nSafety of the elderly\n\nThere would be provisions for harsh punishments for elder abuse committed by others.\n\nCommunity awareness and policing would be used to combat elder abuse and crimes against senior persons, particularly those committed against widows, those who are living alone, and the crippled.\n\nGovernment Schemes related to old-age people\n\nIn partnership with the States/UTs, the Ministry of Social Justice and Empowerment and other ministries creates and implement Acts, Government Schemes, Policies, and Programs for the Welfare of Senior Citizens.\n\nRashtriya Vayoshri Yojana for the Elderly\n\nIt is a Central\u00a0 Sector scheme supported by money from the senior Citizens\u2019 Welfare Fund.\n\nIt aims to provide support and assisted living devices to older persons who fall under the BPL category and have age-related disabilities such as low vision, hearing loss, tooth loss, and locomotor impairments.\n\nA PSU\u00a0 within the Ministry of Social Justice and Empowerment, Artificial Limbs Manufacturing Corporation (ALIMCO), is the implementing agency of the Scheme.\n\nPradhan Mantri Vaya Vandana Yojana for the Elderly\n\nSpecifically for senior individuals 60 years of age and over, the Indian government introduced the Pradhan Mantri Vaya Vandana Yojana (PMVVY) Pension Scheme.\n\nSubscribers to the plan will receive an assured pension based on a guaranteed rate of return of 8% per year payable monthly, quarterly, half-yearly, or annually in exchange for paying an initial lump sum amount ranging from Rs 1,50,000 for a minimum pension of Rs 1000 per month to Rs 7,50,000 for a maximum pension of Rs 5,000 per month.\n\nFor activities up to the district level, the state government will pay 25% of the budget and the centre will cover 75% of it.\n\nSACRED Portal for Elderly\n\nTo assist senior citizens looking for employment, the government developed an online employment exchange platform.\n\nThe portal was created by the Ministry of Social Justice and Empowerment and is called Senior Able Citizens for Re-Employment in Dignity (SACRED).\n\nThe portal allows anyone over the age of 60 to register and search for jobs and employment possibilities.\n\nThe Jobs Portal will benefit companies, Self Help Groups (SHGs), senior citizens developing skills, other organizations, and individuals in addition to senior persons looking for employment.\n\nThis project is at par with the concept of productive ageing in India.\n\nThe SAGE project\n\nThe SAGE project and SAGE site for seniors were introduced by the Ministry of Social Justice and Empowerment.\n\nThe SAGE portal will provide \u201cone-stop access\u201d to reputable start-ups\u2019 aged care goods and services.\n\nIt was started with the intention of assisting those people who are interested in starting their own business offering services for aged care.\n\nThe SAGE project aims to identify, evaluate, verify, aggregate, and deliver products, solutions, and services directly to the stakeholders.\n\nThe Ministry will serve as an intermediary to help senior citizens get the products through designated start-up businesses.\n\n\u00a0Indira Gandhi National Old Age Pension Scheme\n\nThe eligibility age for the Indira Gandhi National Old Age Pension Scheme is 60 years. For people between 60 and 79 years old, the pension is Rs. 200 per month.\n\nThe pension is Rs. 500 per month for those who are 80 years of age or above.\n\nElder Line: Elderly Toll-Free Number\n\nIn addition to urgent assistance in cases of abuse, it offers information, advice, and emotional support, particularly with regard to pension, medical, and legal matters.\n\nIt is designed to give all elderly persons, or those who care about them, access to ONE platform across the nation where they can interact, share their worries, and seek advice on issues that they deal with on a daily basis.\n\nSilver Economy: A related concept\n\nIt is a system of producing, distributing, and consuming goods and services with the goal of utilizing the purchasing power of older and elderly people and meeting their consumption, living, and health needs.\n\nWhat is Gerontechnology?\n\nGerontechnology encompasses a wide range of technical systems and solutions designed to assist the elderly and/or their caregivers with basic daily tasks.\n\nConclusion\n\nThe first step in moving forward is to reduce the financial burden by eradicating the negative stigma associated with ageing in India.\n\nEducation, public awareness campaigns, and creative initiatives like Switzerland\u2019s time bank can all help to encourage behavioral change.\n\nAdditionally, strengthening our pension systems through increased financing and coverage is considered essential. The government must set aside a specific budget for the senior population to do this.\n\nArticle written by: Jis John Sebastian"

            "[CONTENT]": "What are the salient features of Indian society? What makes Indian society unique in sustaining its culture? Read here to understand the intricacies of Indian society.\n\nIndian society is known for its ability to tolerance acceptance, and social cohesion making it unique in sustaining its culture. The importance of fraternity enshrined in the Preamble of the Constitution makes it a duty of every citizen.\n\nIndian society is extensively diverse in cultural and regional aspects and it is pertinent that it is posited in each individual the realization of ideas and objectives in the Preamble concerning every other individual.\n\nIndia from ancient times has thrived to create a nationality that is neither governed by universalism nor by exclusivity to its interest groups.\u00a0 The multi-cultural conundrum is a salient feature of Indian society that has been a boon and a bane over the history of the country.\n\nJawahar Lal Nehru wrote in\u00a0The Discovery of India- \u201cIndian Society and Culture are like some ancient palimpsest on which layer upon layer of thought and reverie\u00a0had been inscribed, and yet no succeeding layer had completely hidden or erased what had been written previously\u201d.\n\nAlso read: Sanskrit Literature\n\nTable of Contents\n\n\ud83d\udc49 Which year are YOU targeting for success in the IAS/IPS/IFS Exam? \ud83d\ude80\n\n(1) \u21d2 UPSC 2025: Prelims cum Mains\n\n(2) \u21d2 UPSC 2026: Prelims cum Mains\n\n(3) \u21d2 UPSC 2027 Prelims cum Mains\n\nTip: Know more about ClearIAS Courses (Online/Offline)\n\nSalient Features of Indian Society\nThe multi-ethnic Indian society\nMultilingualism- a salient feature of Indian society\nMulti-religious society\nCaste system in Indian society\nThe salient feature of Indian society rests in the Unity in diversity\nPatriarchal society\nFamily and Kinship\nTribes\nThe balance between spiritualism and materialism in Indian society\nThe balance between individualism and collectivism in Indian society\nCo-existence of traditionalism and modernity in Indian society\nConclusion\nPrevious year questions\nSalient Features of Indian Society\n\nIt is rather difficult to make pointers on what are the features of Indian society as the essence of Indian society lies in harbouring diverse and distinct identities, ethnicities, languages, religions, and culinary preferences. History stands witness to the fact that the societies that have struggled to hold differences were shattered in such an attempt.\n\nBut for understanding and simplifying the conundrum, the salient features of Indian society can be listed down as-\n\nMulti-ethnic Society\nMulti-Lingual Society\nMulti-Religious Society\nMulti- Caste\nUnity In Diversity\nPatriarchal Society\nTribes\nFamily\nKinship System\nThe balance between spiritualism and materialism\nThe balance between Individualism and collectivism\nCo-existence of traditionalism and modernity\nThe multi-ethnic Indian society\n\nMulti-ethnicity is a major salient feature of Indian society. An ethnic group or ethnicity is a category of people who identify with each other, usually based on a common language or dialect, history, society, culture, or nation.\n\nA society with the co-existence of a wide variety of racial groups is a Multi-ethnic society. India is home to almost multiple racial profiles like Nordic, Dinaric, Proto-Australoid, Mongolian, etc.\n\nHerbert Risley classified the people of India into seven racial types. These are-\n\nTurko-Iranian,\nIndo-Aryan,\nScytho-Dravidian,\nAryo-Dravidian,\nMongolo-Dravidian,\nMongoloid, and\nDravidian.\n\nIndian multiculturalism can be explained by the \u2018Salad bowl theory\u2019- within the large Indian society, the newly arrived cultures do not lose their identity, but rather get intermixed without losing their unique characteristics, just like ingredients in a salad bowl are recognizable while contributing to the overall composition of the salad.\n\nAlso read: Classical Languages of India\n\nMultilingualism- a salient feature of Indian society\n\nIndia is home to many native languages, and it is also common for people to speak and understand more than one language or dialect, which can entail the use of different scripts as well.\n\nIndia\u2019s 2011 census documents that 121 languages are spoken as mother tongues, which is defined as the first language a person learns and uses.\n\nOf these languages, the Constitution of India recognizes twenty-two of them as official or \u201cscheduled\u201d languages. Articles 344(1) and 351 of the Constitution of India, titled the Eighth Schedule, recognize the following languages as official languages of the states of India:\n\nAssamese, Bengali, Bodo, Dogri, Gujarati, Hindi, Kannada, Kashmiri, Konkani, Maithili, Malayalam, Manipuri, Marathi, Nepali, Oriya, Punjabi, Sanskrit, Santhali, Sindhi, Tamil, Telugu, and Urdu.\n\nSix languages also hold the title of classical languages (Kannada, Malayalam, Odia, Sanskrit, Tamil, and Telugu), which are determined to have a history of recorded use for more than 1,500 years and a rich body of literature.\n\nLanguages in India are categorized into language families based on their different linguistic or\u00adigins, which often include different scripts as well.\n\nThe main language families include Dravidian, Indo\u2013Aryan, and Sino\u2013Tibetan. Bodo is the Sino\u2013Tibetan language spoken in northeastern Indian states with the most speakers (1.4 million).\nLanguages considered mother tongues or regional languages in the south of India have grammatical structures and scripts with Dravidian roots, and languages used in the central and northern regions of India are part of the Indo\u2013Aryan family of languages.\n\nMany central and northern Indian languages use scripts derived from the Nagari script.\n\nContemporary variations of Hindi use the Devanagari script, and scripts used in Gujarati, Punjabi, and Marathi use Nagari-derived scripts or versions of Devanagari that include some differences in their alphabets.\n\nAnother aspect of India\u2019s multilingualism is that each mother tongue, or regional language, roughly belongs to one or more states. India\u2019s twenty-eight states have been largely organized along linguistic lines since the 1950s, just after Independence, with the formation of the southern state of Andhra Pradesh in 1953 for Telugu speakers.\n\nMulti-religious society\n\nIndia is a cradle of world religions whose ancestors have preached and practised almost all major religions of the world giving rise to worldly beliefs, practices, rites, rituals, ceremonies, and institutions.\n\nThe co-existence of all religions and a variety of faiths has been a shining example of religious pluralism and tolerance.\n\nThe principle of secularism despite several conflicts and riots has been upheld by our citizens time and again.\nIndian Constitution has rightly reflected the idea of multiple religions. It states that \u201cevery citizen has a right to freely practice, preach, profess and propagate any religion or faith\u201d.\nA secular state has been defined as a \u201cstate in which all religions and citizens irrespective of their faith would be treated impartially\u201d.\nApart from the major religions, several tribal religions are coexisting in Indian society.\n\nHinduism:\n\nHinduism is one of the most ancient religions in India. Although followed by the majority of the population, its origin is not owed to any founder.\nMajor Hindu scriptures include Vedas and the holy book is Bhagwad -Gita, Ramayana, Puranas, etc.\nIdol worship, the theory of Purushartha, the theory of Karma, and the doctrine of rebirth are some of the major principles of Hinduism.\nThey believe in the trinity of Brahma (creator), Vishnu(sustained), and Mahesh or Shiva (destroyer).\n\nIslam:\n\nOriginated in Arabia in around the 7th century A.D.The term Islam in Arabic means to surrender to God.\nProphet Mohammad is the founder of this religion and followers believe only in one god Allah with Quran as the holy book of Islam.\nThe religion is based on five pillars, they are Allah (belief in only one god), Ramzan (fast in the auspicious month), Hajj (Pilgrimage at least once in a lifetime), Namaz (praying five times a day), and Zakat (Charity).\nThe major two sects of Islam are Shiyahs and Sunnis.\n\nChristianity:\n\nThe Bible is the holy book of Christianity.\nThe believers are further divided into Roman Catholics and Protestants.\nThe major principles of religion are described in the Ten Commandments.\nThe Bible includes the values of humanity, charity, mercy, repentance etc.\n\nSikhism:\n\nGuru Nanak is the founder of Sikhism. Guru Granth Sahib is the holy book of Sikhs which includes all the hymns and the songs composed by all the ten Gurus of Sikhism.\nSikhs believe in Satnaam, God as the almighty. A Sect of Sikhs who follow Khalsa Panth is known as a Singh meaning lion or the protector of religion.\nThey are expected to follow the 5 K\u201fs. i.e. Kesh, Kara, Kanga, Kachha and Kirpaan.\n\nJainism:\n\nJainism is a religion based on ethical conduct alone. The twenty-fourth Tirthankara was Vardhaman Mahavira who is said to be the founder of Jainism.\nIt is further divided into two sects, Shwetambara and Digambara. Jainism believes in Karma but does not believe in caste inequalities.\nAhimsa (Non-violence), non-stealing, truth, and non-possessiveness are some of the values preached by Jainism.\nThe majority of the followers of this religion are found in India.\n\nBuddhism:\n\nBuddhism is termed a universal religion.\nThough found in India, its followers are found all over the further divided into Hinayanas and Mahayanas.\nThey believe in the eightfold path as the solution to sorrow in life.\nCaste system in Indian society\n\nThe social division of society in India is peculiar. Unlike many other civilizations in the world where the society was divided into race, ethnicity, or clans, Indian society is broadly divided into a hierarchy of caste.\n\nThe word caste comes from the Portuguese word \u2018Caste\u2019 which means breed and is intended to be used for classification based on the purity of blood.\n\nCaste is unique to India and especially to Hindu traditional society and its customs. It is imposed as a divine and has an extensive sanction in society.\n\nThe Sanskrit word for caste is \u2018Varna\u2019 which means color. The caste stratification in Indian society has its origin in the chaturvarna system. During the Vedic period, there were four Varnas or castes namely Brahmins, Kshatriyas, Vishays, and Shudras.\nThis division was based on the division of labor and occupation. Along with occupation, it also denotes endogamy (marriage within one\u2019s caste) and the notion of purity and pollution related to food restrictions, clothing, and language.\nFurther, these groups were subdivided into several jatis or subcastes based on diversity of occupation. Each group was like a water-tight compartment moving out from which was impossible for any member of the society.\nThe notion of purity and pollution resulted in several atrocities in the hierarchy against the lowest strata. The shudras (untouchables) faced tremendous injustice and atrocities at the hands of the higher castes, especially Brahmins.\n\nIt was termed the black period of Indian history where several inhuman practices were prevalent in the society denying the basic human rights of these suppressed classes.\n\nHowever after independence, under the great leadership of Dr. Baba Sahib Ambedkar, the oppressed class got a special status in the Constitution of India as Scheduled castes.\n\nThe term used for them was Dalit (the depressed) or Harijan (as coined by Mahatma Gandhi). Dr. Baba Saheb Ambedkar was a pioneer in initiating the Dalit movement in India to bring up the status of untouchables by converting to Buddhism which does not believe in the caste hierarchy.\nThe salient feature of Indian society rests in the Unity in diversity\n\nIndia as a nation is a classic example of it as despite having multiple geographical, religious, linguistic, cultural, and racial diversities, India has always stood up as an integrated nation.\n\nIn India, people of different religions have continued to\u00a0respect the ideals and values of people of other religions,\u00a0and hence, India has always stood up as an integrated nation ready to put its arms around everybody in this world.\n\nDiversity in India\u00a0exists at various levels in different forms and various factors that contribute to Unity In diversity can be as follows:\n\nGeographical\nCultural\nReligious\nPolitical\nLanguage\n\nThe previously mentioned salient features of Indian society very well define how the factors have influenced the diverse yet united culture of Indian society.\n\nThere have been instances in history wherein the unity of the country was tested like during the partition, communal riots in Gujarat and Karnataka are a few dark chapters. But each time the country has fought back and upheld its values.\n\nPatriarchal society\n\nPatriarchy is a social system in which men hold primary power and enjoy greater status than women. Indian society is a largely patriarchal society.\n\nHowever, some tribal societies are matrilineal societies\u00a0where women have the dominant decision-making power. The few matrilineal societies of India are:\n\nThe Nairs and Ezhavas of the state of Kerala have a matrilineal society,\nthe Khasi and Garo tribes of Meghalaya,\nBunt and billava of Karnataka\n\nPatriarchy is a still existing problem in India- and impacts women the most-few impacts of this are-\n\nWomen are still paid 20% less than men for the same job.\nThey still experience a shockingly high rate of\u00a0domestic violence, which highly depicts the culture of the patriarchal society in India.\nMale child preference is also one such example that shows the patriarchal mindset leading to female infanticide and foeticide.\nDowry tradition and discrimination based on that.\nFamily and Kinship\n\nBlood relations and kinship ties enjoy a stronghold over other social relationships in India.\n\nThe family is one of the most important social institutions. Most of the world\u2019s population lives in family units. The family is a primary institution responsible for \u2018socialization\u2019.\n\nKinship\u00a0refers to\u00a0a set of relationships\u00a0and relatives formed thereof, based on blood relationships (consanguineal), or marriage (affinal).\n\nThis social institution ties individuals and groups together and establishes a relationship between them.\n\nTribes\n\nThere are about 705 Scheduled tribes in the country and they constitute 6 percent of the population of the country, according to the 2011 census.\n\nScheduled Tribes mostly inhabit two distinct geographical areas \u2013 Central India and the North-Eastern Area.\n\nMore than half of the Scheduled Tribe population is concentrated in Central India, i.e., Madhya Pradesh (14.69%), Chhattisgarh (7.5%), Jharkhand (8.29%), Andhra Pradesh (5.7%), Maharashtra (10.08%), Orissa (9.2%), Gujarat (8.55%) and Rajasthan (8.86%).\nThe other distinct areas are the Northeast (Assam, Nagaland, Mizoram, Manipur, Meghalaya, Tripura, Sikkim, and Arunachal Pradesh).\n\nMore than two-thirds of the ST population is concentrated only in the seven states of the country, viz. Madhya Pradesh, Maharashtra, Orissa, Gujarat, Rajasthan, Jharkhand, and Chhattisgarh.\n\nThere is no ST population in 3 States (Delhi NCR, Punjab, and Haryana) and 2 UTs (Puducherry and Chandigarh), as no Scheduled Tribe is notified.\n\nThe balance between spiritualism and materialism in Indian society\n\nContradictions between spirituality and materialism have existed in Indian society for a long time. The ancient thoughts differ in positing that material life is all that matters, matter and consciousness interact to create the world, or matter is just the base from which one has to rise to full consciousness.\n\nSwami Vivekananda is one of the prominent figures and makers of modern India who was known for his speeches on spiritualism and materialism.\n\nIn his various speeches and writings, he emphasized the need for the material development of the poor. According to Vivekananda human beings are not just physical and material beings that exist to satisfy their senses but spiritual beings as well.\nIt is this spirituality that unites humanity across the world at a higher level. But, mere spirituality is not enough. Therefore, he underscores the need for material development.\n\nAlso read:\u00a0Anti-superstition laws\n\nThe balance between individualism and collectivism in Indian society\n\nIndia is a society with both collectivistic and Individualist traits. The collectivist side means that there is a high preference for belonging to a larger social framework in which individuals are expected to act for the greater good of their defined in-groups.\n\nIn such situations, the actions of the individual are influenced by various concepts such as the opinion of one\u2019s family, extended family, neighbours, workgroup, and other such wider social networks that one has some affiliation with.\nFor a collectivist, to be rejected by one\u2019s peers or to be thought lowly of by one\u2019s extended and immediate in-groups, leaves him or her rudderless and with a sense of intense emptiness.\nThe employer/employee relationship is one of expectations based on expectations \u2013 Loyalty by the employee and almost familial protection by the Employer.\nHiring and promotion decisions are often made based on relationships which are the key to everything in a Collectivist society.\n\nThe Individualist aspect of Indian society is seen as a result of its dominant religion/philosophy \u2013 Hinduism. The Hindus believe in a cycle of death and rebirth, with the manner of each rebirth being dependent upon how the individual lived the preceding life.\n\nPeople are, therefore, individually responsible for the way they lead their lives and the impact it will have upon their rebirth. This focus on individualism interacts with the otherwise collectivist tendencies of the Indian society which leads to its intermediate score on this dimension.\n\nCo-existence of traditionalism and modernity in Indian society\n\nIndian society is always trying to balance traditions and modernity, especially with changing times, which is a salient feature of Indian society.\n\nIndian society will always be in transition, continually transient, and undergoing a constant process of change. It implies the idea of constant change is intrinsic to contemporary Indian society.\n\nGlobal and regional happenings have shaped the changing society in India-\n\nColonization is a crucial factor that impacted Indian society the most by introducing foreign cultures and practices.\nIndustrialization and modernization led to technological expansion and went on to transform society at various levels.\nLiberalization, Privatisation, and Globalisation (LPG) were\u00a0inherent in the logic and processes of economic growth and reform in India.\nMass Media and Information and Communication Technology (ICT) is a crucial factor in modernization and development in India. It has both personal and social consequences.\nSocial Movements caused change in multiple ways in the past as well as in the present. They occur due to certain societal conditions and aim at improving it by bringing transformation in the social structure.\nConclusion\n\nIndian society is the result of a journey from the Indus civilization to today\u2019s globalized world. In this journey, it has gone through many transformations under the influence of the outside world and reform movements within the society. However, what is unique and appreciable is the fact that it has managed to adopt and accept various features while preserving its past.\n\nThere are many factors out there threatening the unity of the Indian society but India has the strength to overcome communal violence and religious threats. The\u00a0common values of democracy, equality, and justice, as defined in the constitution is a part of the value system of Indian Society.\n\nPrevious year questions\n\u201cThe caste system is assuming new identities and associational forms.

It is important for supporting and reinforcing the personal empowerment of other members of their group or community as well.\n\nCommunalism, Regionalism, and Secularism are political ideologies with different belief systems and different modes of application. The three are important parts of Indian polity but have different interpretations based on the ideologies.\n\nCommunalism is defined as prioritizing association toward one\u2019s ethnic group rather than the society as a whole.\n\nRegionalism can be defined as a political ideology focusing on the development of a political or social system based on one or more particular regions.\n\nSecularism is based on the principle that the affairs of the state are distinct from religion and should not be intermixed.\n\n\ud83d\udc49 Which year are YOU targeting for success in the IAS/IPS/IFS Exam? \ud83d\ude80\n\n(1) \u21d2 UPSC 2025: Prelims cum Mains\n\n(2) \u21d2 UPSC 2026: Prelims cum Mains\n\n(3) \u21d2 UPSC 2027 Prelims cum Mains\n\nTip: Know more about ClearIAS Courses (Online/Offline)\n\nSocial empowerment\n\nSocial empowerment is understood as the process of developing a sense of autonomy and self-confidence. It also involves acting individually and collectively to change social relationships and the institutions and discourses that exclude poor people and leads to an increase in poverty.\n\nIndividual empowerment is influenced by individual assets like land, house, and savings along with social factors like health and education. Also, concepts of choice, liberty, agency, capacity, contribution, self-sufficiency and increased resources are all crucial to societal empowerment.\n\nSocial empowerment has both individual and community aspects related to it. Individual factors like self-esteem. Self-confidence, imagination, and aspirations all influence social fulfilment. People\u2019s collective assets and capabilities such as voice, organization, representation and identity also sway the social responsibility.\n\nIt is important that socially and economically backward classes of people get involved in local associations and inter-community cooperation mechanisms can contribute to social empowerment by improving their skills, knowledge, and self-perception.\n\nOne such example is the formation of farming cooperatives to empower the agrarian class. It helps to organize economic aid through cooperative banks or microfinance groups.\n\nIt is also important to understand that associational life at the local level takes place within the informal sphere, such as religious organizations, traditional and customary institutions, and informal community-based groups. Such groups have more reach into peoples\u2019 lives.\n\nThe phrase social empowerment is also linked with gender equality. The role of women and women\u2019s organizations is important in empowering women and building an inclusive society.\n\nThe human being is seen as a part of society, and change is considered impossible unless social structures related to political power are changed. Individual and structural transformation is closely associated with the individual\u2019s inner life shapes, and social environment, and that environment, in turn, exerts a deep influence on one\u2019s well-being.\n\nThe ability to recognize the root causes of inequality is decisive to the empowerment of populations to become agents of social transformation. Social empowerment leads to social transformation, and it involves the ability to identify the forces to recognize the drivers of social injustice and eliminate such practices.\n\nTo eliminate social injustices, the people need to form groups and raise their voices. And throughout history, many such groups have been formed which gave rise to multiple ideologies.\n\nSocial empowerment and Communalism\n\nThe term \u201ccommunalism\u201d was first coined by socialist author\u00a0Murray Bookchin in the early 20th Century.\n\nCommunalism is a philosophical notion and causes competition, ferocity, and tension among different communities. It manifests as an expression of the superiority of one\u2019s community combined with intolerance of different communities.\n\nCommunalism is used as an instrument of power for operating in economic, social and political domains. The ideology is generally looked upon unfavorably in society.\n\nCommunalism is practised in society since the nineteenth century. Especially in the Indian context, it is defined as faithfulness to one\u2019s group, be it ethnic, religious, or political. It promotes belief in orthodox principles, intolerance and hatred of other religions in the end dividing the society.\n\nCommunalism acts in a negative sense for social empowerment as it emphasizes the separate identity of a religious group from other groups with a tendency to promote its own interests at the expense of the others.\n\nCommunalism is also defined as a mechanism to energize people for or against by raising an appeal on communal lines. India has seen great communal events since medieval times. It is a political philosophy with its roots in the religious and cultural diversity of India.\n\nIt has been used as a political propaganda tool to create division, differences, and tensions between the communities based on religious and ethnic identity leading to communal hatred and violence.\n\nCauses of communalism:\nHistorical factors like Islamic invasions.\nSocial factors like traditional differences in religious practices\nPsychological factors like extremist and fanatical thinking\nForeign entities creating internal security threats on a religious basis like terrorism\nMisinformation spread through media\n\nMedieval India witnessed the arrival of Islam which is when occurrences of violence based on religion started to take place. Mahmud Ghazni\u2019s destruction of Hindu temples and Mahmud of Ghori\u2019s attack on Hindus, Jains, and Buddhists are well documented in history books.\n\nTill then religion was an important part of people\u2019s lives but there was no communal ideology or communal politics based on violence. The Indian society was more concentrated on the caste-based divide than religion-based.\n\nIslamic rulers like Akbar and Sher Shah Suri followed a tolerant religious policy towards different cultures and traditions practised across the country.\n\nBut some sectarian rulers like Aurangzeb were among the least tolerant towards other religious practices and destroyed various places of worship and took lives in the name of religion.\n\nIn modern India, communalism grew due to British colonial impact and their poor understanding of Indian social strata. But they very well took advantage of the religious diversity of the country and used the policy of divide and rule. It is true to say that the base of today\u2019s communal problems in India was laid down by inhumane British rule.\n\nMajor incidents of communalism in India were:\n1947: The partition of India witnessed mass bloodshed and violence that continued up to 1949.\n1961: The Jabalpur riots took place due to economic competition between a Hindu and a Muslim bidi manufacturer.\n1964-67: A series of riots broke out particularly in the eastern part of India (Rourkela, Jamshedpur, and Ranchi) in places where Hindu refugees from the then East Pakistan were being settled.\n1969: Ahmedabad riots due to the Jan Sangh passing a resolution on Indianisation of Muslims to show its intense opposition to Indira Gandhi\u2019s leftward thrust.\n1983: The violence took place in Nellie after the decision to hold the controversial state elections amidst the Assam Agitation, after Indira Gandhi\u2019s decision to give 4 million immigrants from Bangladesh the right to vote. It has been described as one of the worst pogroms since World War II.\n1984: The anti-Sikh riots broke out after the assassination of Indira Gandhi, where more than 4000 Sikhs were killed in Delhi, Uttar Pradesh, and other parts of India.\n1985: The Shah Bano controversy and the Babri Masjid-Ram Janmabhoomi controversy became powerful tools for intensifying communalism.\n1992: The Babri Masjid was demolished by right-wing parties. This was followed by the worst riots of post-independence India \u2013 in Mumbai, Surat, Ahmadabad, Kanpur, Delhi, and other places.\n2002: Gujarat witnessed communal riots when violence was triggered by the burning of a train in Godhra.\n2006: Riots occurred in Vadodara due to the municipal council\u2019s decision to remove the dargah of Syed Chishti Rashiduddin, a medieval Sufi saint.\n2013: Uttar Pradesh witnessed the worst violence in recent history with clashes between the Hindu and Muslim communities in the Muzaffarnagar district.\n\nThere is a need to eradicate communalism for which the people and government should work in tandem.\n\nSocial empowerment and Regionalism\n\nEven though it\u2019s the age of globalization, the sense of regionalism hasn\u2019t left the minds of people yet. With the current global trade and economical trends, regionalism is gaining over globalization.\n\nRegions can be described as groups of countries belonging to similar geographic areas with social and cultural similarities and shared political attitudes. And high levels of interdependence across multiple dimensions that include economic transactions, communications, and political values as determining whether a group of countries constitutes a region.\n\nRegionalism is a psychic phenomenon. It is built around an expression of group identity, as well as loyalty to the region. It presupposes the concept of development of one\u2019s region without taking into consideration the interest of other regions. It prohibits people from other regions to be benefitted from a particular region.\n\nRegionalism in India\n\nThe\u00a0origin\u00a0of regionalism is\u00a0in India\u2019s diversity of languages, cultures, ethnic groups, communities, and religions.\n\nFor many centuries, India was the land of many regions, cultures, and traditions. The linguistic, tribal, religious, regional or their combinations, have remained the principal form in which regionalism in India has sought to express itself, historically as well as in contemporary times.\n\nThe many empires that came and went in India had united and bifurcated regions over the years. The north and south divide is the prominent so is the east and west divide.\n\nDuring colonial times, the divide and rule policy were not only applied on religious lines but also on the sentiments of regionalism. They build and bifurcated the country according to their selfish gains. This territorial reorganization became the seed for a larger regional divide in the country.\n\nAfter Independence, the leaders\u00a0tried to encourage a feeling among the people\u00a0that they belonged to one single nation. The framers of the constitution wanted to achieve this by introducing\u00a0single citizenship for all.\n\nBut India is a complex country, and keeping given its vastness and diversity in culture and language, a strong sense of regional loyalty started appearing, and thus regionalism became inevitable.\n\nTypes of regionalism:\nSupra-state regionalism is a manifestation of the group identity of numerous states. In this form of regionalism, the group of states unites to make common views on the issue of mutual interest vis-\u00e0-vis another group of states or at times against the union.\nInter-state regionalism is coterminous with local territories and involves contrasting the identities of one or more states against another. This form of regionalism is issue-specific. For example disagreements between Karnataka and Tamil Nadu over the distribution of Kaveri water may be interpreted as inter-state regionalism.\nIntra-state regionalism is a type of regionalism that signify that wherein a part of the state strives for self-identity and self-development and therefore, it is taken in a positive sense.\nInstances of regionalism in India\n\n1950-60: Intense (ethnic) mass mobilization occurred in south India. The demand for separate statehood for the Telugu-speakers out of the composite Madras Presidency led to the formation of the State Reorganization Act, 1956.\n\n1970-80: The tribal uprisings in the North-eastern region for separation and statehood led to the formation of the North-eastern States Reorganisation Act, 1971, which upgraded the Union Territories of Manipur and Tripura, and the Sub-State of Meghalaya to full statehood, and Mizoram and Arunachal Pradesh (then Tribal Districts) to Union Territories. The latter became states in 1986.\n\nThe 1990s: Demand for\u00a0Chhattisgarh out of Madhya Pradesh, Jharkhand out of Bihar, and Uttaranchal out of Uttar Pradesh. Regional backwardness was the reason. In\u00a02000\u00a0all three states were carved out of their parent state.\n\n2014: The division of Andhra Pradesh, giving a separate state of Telangana.\n\nThe reasons for regionalism are somewhat similar to that of communalism, and efforts from the ground level to the administrations level is needed to bring in the sense of unity among diversity in the county.\n\nSocial empowerment and Secularism\n\nSecularism is the opposite of communalism and was adopted by Indian Constitution, which signifies respect for all religions and broad-mindedness of all faiths, no State religion and support or favour to any religion by the State. Secularism is a form of government process that enhances democracy and commitment to financial development.\n\nSecular means separate from religion and stands for equal opportunities to everyone without discrimination.\n\nSecularism in India\n\nIndian culture is a blend of various spiritual traditions and social movements. In ancient India, the Sanatan Dharma was a holistic religion that welcomed different spiritual traditions and integrated them into a common mainstream.\n\nThe development of the four Vedas and the various interpretations of the Upanishads and the Puranas highlight the religious plurality of Hinduism.\n\nIn the third century B.C, Emperor Ashoka announced that the state would not prosecute any religious sect. In his Rock Edict, Ashoka appealed not only for the toleration of all religious sects but also to develop a spirit of great respect toward them.\n\nEven after the advent of Jainism, Buddhism and later Islam and Christianity on the Indian soil, the quest for religious toleration and coexistence of different faiths continued.\n\nIn medieval India, the Sufi and Bhakti movements brought together the people of various communities. The leading personalities of these movements were Khwaja Moinuddin Chisti, Baba Farid, Sant Kabir Das, Guru Nanak Dev, Saint Tukaram and Mira Bai.\n\nIn Mughal India, religious toleration and freedom of worship marked the State under Akbar. He had several Hindus as his ministers, forbade forcible conversions, and abolished Jizya. The most prominent evidence of his tolerance policy was his promulgation of \u2018Din-i-Ilahi\u2019 or the Divine Faith, which had elements of both Hindu and Muslim faith.\n\nThe British had always tried to break the secularity and the seeds of hatred were watered by the colonial rule. But the spirit of secularism was strengthened and enriched through the Indian freedom movement too, though the British pursued the policy of divide and rule.\n\nBritish acts like:\n\nPartitioning of Bengal in 1905.\nSeparate electorates were for Muslims through the Indian Councils Act of 1909, a provision which was extended to Sikhs, Indian Christians, Europeans, and Anglo-Indians in certain provinces by the Government of India Act, 1919.\nRamsay MacDonald Communal Award of 1932, provided for separate electorates as well as reservation of seats for minorities, even for the depressed classes became the basis for representation under the Government of India Act, 1935.\n\nThese were acts that escalated the communal and regional sentiments of the people and the negative effects of which are still being felt in the country.\n\nThe Indian freedom movement was characterized by secular tradition and ethos right from the start. In the initial part of the Indian freedom movement, the liberals like Sir Feroz Shah Mehta, Govind Ranade, and Gopal Krishna Gokhale by and large pursued a secular approach to politics.\n\nThe constitution drafted by Moti Lal Nehru as the chairman of the historic Nehru Committee in 1928, had many provisions on secularism as: \u2018There shall be no state religion for the commonwealth of India or for any province in the commonwealth, nor shall the state, either directly or indirectly, endow any religion any preference or impose any disability on account of religious beliefs or religious status\u2019.\n\nGandhiji\u2019s secularism was based on a commitment to the brotherhood of religious communities based on their respect for and pursuit of truth, whereas, Jawaharlal Nehru\u2019s secularism was based on a commitment to scientific humanism tinged with a progressive view of historical change.\n\nHeterogeneity is the basis of Indian culture and religious tolerance is the core factor of Indian secularism. The Introduction of the Constitution along with Articles 25 to 28 highlights the concept of secularism represented in the constitutional scheme.\n\nSecularism is a part of a democratic state which grants to citizens equal rights. It guards democracy by restricting the power of the majority. Secularism is therefore advantageous for a plural culture in India.\n\nSummary\n\nIndia is a diverse land by all means- it has seen worst and best times- communalism, regionalism and in the end upheld secularism for social empowerment and well being of the people of the country.\n\nThe attack on religious minorities is representative of the crisis threatening secularism in India. Communalism and regionalism are for the narrow-minded and is based on prejudices about the other factions of the society. In India, communal politics based on region and religion drives the deep-rooted colonial mindset that still exists like a parasite.\n\nIn the Indian framework, secularism and communalism are considered to be two contrasting facts. Secularism is a symbol of modernity, plurality, co-existence, rationalism, and development within a fast-growing multicultural society.\n\nPrevious years Mains questions from the topic:\n\nDo you agree that regionalism in India appears to be a consequence of rising cultural assertiveness?

Read here to know the effect of globalization on Indian society.\n\nGlobalization is a term used to describe how trade and technology have made the world a more connected and interdependent place. Globalization also captures in its scope the economic and social changes that have come about as a result.\n\nIn today\u2019s world, consumers have a wide choice of goods and services before them. The latest models of digital cameras, mobile phones, and televisions made by the leading manufacturers of the world are within the reach. Every season, new models of automobiles can be seen on Indian roads. Gone are the days when Ambassador and Fiat were the only cars on Indian roads.\n\nToday, Indians are buying cars produced by nearly all the top companies in the world. A similar explosion of brands can be seen for many other goods: from shirts to televisions to processed fruit juices. Such a wide-ranging choice of goods in our markets is a relatively recent phenomenon.\n\nOne wouldn\u2019t have found such a wide variety of goods in Indian markets two decades back. In a matter of years, our markets have been transformed! How do we understand these rapid transformations? What are the factors that brought about these changes? And, how did these changes affect the lives of the people?

India is one of the fastest-growing economies in the world and is predicted to reach the top three in the next decade.\n\n\ud83d\udc49 Which year are YOU targeting for success in the IAS/IPS/IFS Exam? \ud83d\ude80\n\n(1) \u21d2 UPSC 2025: Prelims cum Mains\n\n(2) \u21d2 UPSC 2026: Prelims cum Mains\n\n(3) \u21d2 UPSC 2027 Prelims cum Mains\n\nTip: Know more about ClearIAS Courses (Online/Offline)\n\nIndia\u2019s massive economic growth is largely due to globalization which was a transformational change that didn\u2019t occur until the 1990s. Since then, the country\u2019s gross domestic product (GDP) has grown at an exponential rate.\n\nThe many effects of globalization on Indian society and multiple aspects of it have been discussed here.\n\nImpact of globalization on the Indian economy\n\nOverall, globalization has improved various aspects of India, like:\n\nInternational trade relations\nEconomy\nTechnology and communication\nCorporate world\nSocial and cultural expansion\n\nThe reduction of export subsidies and import barriers enabled free trade that made the Indian market attractive to the international community. The untapped potential of the nascent Indian market was opened to the global market and the significant changes were made to its industrial, financial, and agricultural sectors:\n\nIndustrial\u00a0sector: It saw a massive influx of both foreign capital investments\u2019 India became a favorite offshore market for pharmaceutical manufacturing, chemical, and petroleum industries. This brought advanced technologies and processes that helped in the modernization of the Indian industrial sector.\n\nFinancial sector: Prior to globalization and privatization, India\u2019s financial sector had been mismanaged by a combination of corrupt and inept government officials. The privatization of the financial space created a much more dynamic financial services sector.\n\nAgricultural sector: India still has a largely agrarian society, with a significant majority of the country\u2019s population depending on this sector either directly or indirectly for their livelihood. The new technological capabilities of farmers have increased helping drive global exports of Indian products such as tea, coffee, and sugar.\n\nThe betterment of these sectors has brought about an increase in national income, employment, exports, and GDP growth.\n\nAdvantages of globalization for India\nThe increasing globalization of India has access to markets of the country to foreign companies seeking to invest and operate within the massive Indian market.\nIncrease in employment opportunities.\nInitially, globalization gave foreigners access to an inexpensive, robust labor force. But as the country has progressed, the labor force has grown more skilled and educated over time. Now India has the largest diaspora living abroad.\nFor foreign investors considering the economy as a whole, India offers a well-diversified export basket. This has been highlighted in the Economic Survey of India as well.\nThe cultural impact of globalization on Indian society\n\nThe process of globalization increased access to television and other entertainment sources over the years. Even in the rural areas satellite television has an established market. In the cities, Internet facility is everywhere and it is being extended to rural areas also through schemes like Smart Cities Mission.\n\nThere is an increase in the global food chain and restaurants in the urban areas of India. Multiple movie halls, big shopping malls, and high-rise residential are seen in every city.\n\nThe entertainment sector in India has now obtained a global market. After economic liberalization, Bollywood expanded its area and showed a major presence on the global scale. Bollywood movies are quite famous in Middle Eastern and many African countries as well.\n\nWestern styles began to be incorporated into Bollywood films to expand the outreach.\n\nAs these new cultural ideologies began to permeate the Indian population, the Indian urban population was pushed to re-evaluate their traditional Indian cultural ideology.\n\nBollywood movies are also distributed and accepted at the international level. Big international companies like Walt Disney, 20th Century Fox, and Columbia Pictures are investing in this sector.\n\nSimilarly, famous International brands such as Armani, Gucci, Nike, and Omega are also making investments in the Indian market with the changing of fashion statement of Indians.\n\nWomen are getting the equal opportunities they very well deserve now in more numbers due to the globalization of the market. Their empowerment has given considerable opportunities and possibilities for improving employment conditions through global solidarity and coordination. It is found that the growth of computers and other technologies enabled women with better waged, flex timings, and capacity to negotiate their role and status in-home and at the corporate level.\n\nEffects of Globalization on Indian Education:\n\nThere is a profound effect observed in the educational sector due to globalization such as the literacy rate becoming high.\n\nForeign Universities are collaborating with different Indian Universities now, expanding the reach for Indian students.\n\nThe Indian educational system embraced globalization through Information technology and it offers opportunities to evolve new paradigms shifts in developmental education.\n\nThe shift from largely uneducated to an industrial society to an information society has gradually taken shape.\n\nGlobalization promotes new tools and techniques such as E-learning, Flexible learning, Distance Education Programs, and Overseas training.\n\nMany government schemes like the \u2018New Education Policy\u2019 are pushing for a more global education system to make Indian students from every walk of life at par with the global community.\n\nChallenges of globalization in Indian society\nEconomically, for a large market like India is harder to maintain a free, convertible, and open access enabled transnational market.\nGlobalization also means growing interdependence in other nations- this can issues like misdistribution of resources. The parity between underdeveloped, developing, and developed remains status quo in many cases.\nThe universalization of information technology has boons but also banes, in terms of cybercrimes and other darknet activities. The increase in the number of cyberattacks in India is proof of this.\nGlobalization does have a great effect on the ecologies and environments of nations that need safeguards that lessen the negative effects rather than exploiting them without regard to such concerns.\nThe negative effects of globalization on the Indian Industry are that with the coming of technology the number of labor required is decreased and this resulted in increasing unemployment, especially in the arena of the pharmaceutical, chemical, manufacturing, and cement industries.\nThere are a few challenges for companies due to globalization such as Migration, relocation, labor shortages, competition, and changes in skills and technology.\nSummary\n\nThe effects of globalization on Indian society are manifold and have been discussed in detail. The process of globalization has changed the industrial pattern and social life of people. This has had an immense impact on Indian trade, finance, and cultural system.\n\nThe globalization of the economic, social, and cultural structures happened in simultaneously. Previously, the pace of the process was slow but now the change is happening in every arena at lightning-fast speed with the use of information technology.\n\nGlobalization has resulted in an increase in the production of a range of goods and services. MNCs have established manufacturing plants all over the world. It has positive effects on India and the administration is trying its best to overcome many obstacles and adopt global policies to expand business an international scale.\n\nIndia is surely gaining international recognition which leads to the strengthening of economic and political areas.\n\nTruly, globalization has made the world a small place, a whole lot of different people interconnected in diverse ways."

It is the process through which cities grow as higher percentages of the population come to live in the city.\n\nUrbanization involves a complex set of economic, demographic, social, cultural, technological, and environmental processes that increase the proportion of the population of a territory that lives in towns and cities.\n\nUrbanization is often discussed in countries that are currently in the process of industrializing and urbanizing, but all industrialized nations have experienced urbanization at some point in their history. Moreover, urbanization is on the rise all over the globe.\n\nTable of Contents\n\nWhat leads to urbanization?\nUrbanization in India\nState-wise data:\nGlobal scenario\nSignificance of Urbanization\nDrawbacks of urbanization\nGovernment schemes to manage urbanization\nWay forward\nPrevious year question\nWhat leads to urbanization?\n\nIndustrialization: Industrialization has improved job prospects by allowing individuals to work in contemporary sectors in occupations that contribute to economic progress.

Better educational facilities, higher living standards, improved sanitation and housing, improved health care, improved recreation facilities, and improved social life are only a few examples\n\n\ud83d\udc49 Which year are YOU targeting for success in the IAS/IPS/IFS Exam? \ud83d\ude80\n\n(1) \u21d2 UPSC 2025: Prelims cum Mains\n\n(2) \u21d2 UPSC 2026: Prelims cum Mains\n\n(3) \u21d2 UPSC 2027 Prelims cum Mains\n\nTip: Know more about ClearIAS Courses (Online/Offline)\n\nJob prospects: Higher-value-added occupations are created and increased by services and industries, resulting in additional work possibilities\n\nCities also emerge when rural regions gradually transition into urban landscapes. Such a transition may be a result of mineral discoveries, resource exploitation, or agricultural operations.\n\nUrbanization in India\n\nIndia along with China and Nigeria are the most rapidly urbanizing countries as they account for 35% of world urban population growth projected for the 2018-2050 period.\n\nIn 2018 a large number of India\u2019s cities had a population of between 300,000 and 1 million inhabitants. There are 120 medium-sized cities of such population size and only five urban settlements with 20 million or more inhabitants.\n\nIn India, the urban population amounts to 461 million people. This number is growing by 2.3 percent each year. By 2031, 75 percent of India\u2019s national income is estimated to come from cities.\n\nProviding the necessary urban infrastructure is the big challenge as 70 to 80 percent of the infrastructure that will be needed by 2050 has not been built yet, and the estimated investment gap amounts to approximately 827 billion US dollars.\n\nAlso read: Economic and Social Development \u2013 Sustainable Development, Poverty, Inclusion, Demographics, Social Sector Initiatives, etc.\n\nState-wise data:\nMore than 75% of the urban population of the country is in 10 States: Maharashtra, Uttar Pradesh, Tamil Nadu, West Bengal, Andhra Pradesh, Gujarat, Karnataka, Madhya Pradesh, Rajasthan, and Kerala.\nMaharashtra has 50.8 million persons which are 13.5% of the total urban population of the country.\nUttar Pradesh accounts for about 44.4 million, followed by Tamil Nadu with 34.9 million.\nGoa is the most urbanized State with a 62.2% urban population.\nTamil Nadu, Kerala, Maharashtra, and Gujarat have attained over 40% urbanization.\nAmong the North-Eastern States, Mizoram is the most urbanized with 51.5% urban population.\nBihar, Odisha, Assam, and Uttar Pradesh continue to be at a lower level of urbanization than the national average.\nThe NCT of Delhi and the UT of Chandigarh are most urbanized with 97.5% and 97.25% urban population respectively, followed by Daman and Diu and Lakshadweep.\nGlobal scenario\n\nAt the international scale, levels of urbanization are closely correlated with levels\u00a0of economic development, while rates of urbanization are inversely correlated with levels of economic development.\n\nDemographic processes of immigration and migration, as well as natural population growth, are important determinants of urbanization, but these are in turn underpinned by other processes, especially structural economic change.\n\nThe most urbanized regions are Northern America with 82% of its population living in urban areas (as of 2018), Latin America and the Caribbean (81%), Europe (74%), and Oceania (68%).\n\nAsia has about 50% level of urbanization in Asia and Africa remains mostly rural, with only 43% of its population living in urban areas.\n\nSignificance of Urbanization\n\nSome of the beneficial effects of urbanization include job development, technical and infrastructure improvements, better transportation and communication, educational and medical facilities, and higher living standards.\n\nUrban living is linked with\u00a0higher levels of literacy\u00a0and education,\u00a0better health, longer life expectancy, greater access to social services,\u00a0and enhanced\u00a0opportunities for cultural and political participation.\n\nUrbanization and economic growth are strongly related in terms of industrialization, employment generation, and increase in productivity.\n\nAlso read: Sustainable Livestock Production\n\nDrawbacks of urbanization\n\nDwelling crisis: There is a continuous scarcity of housing as the number of people living in metropolitan areas grows.\n\nOvercrowding: Overcrowding, urban congestion is a constant, and it is an element that is growing day by day as more people and immigrants migrate to cities and towns in quest of a better living.\n\nUnemployment: Lack of highly skilled jobs is most prevalent in metropolitan areas, especially among educated individuals.\n\nSlums: Industrialization is fast-paced but there is a shortage of developed land for housing. The increasing migration of rural immigrants to the city, and the inflated prices of land beyond the urban poor contribute to the rise of slums and squatters in metropolitan areas.\n\nSewage infrastructure: In most metropolitan areas, insufficient sewage infrastructure is observed concerning the rapid population growth.\n\nHealth crisis: Communicable illnesses like typhoid, dysentery, plague, and diarrhea eventually can spread rapidly. The COVID-19 pandemic is a live example of how overpopulated cities and medical facilities collapse under the weight of a pandemic.\n\nPollution: The need for transportation increases with the increase in population, resulting in traffic congestion and pollution.\n\nUrban Heat Islands (UHI): These\u00a0are\u00a0significantly warmer urban areas than their surrounding rural areas\u00a0due to human activities. Urban Heat Island is a major problem associated with rapid urbanization.\n\nCrime rates: Shortage of resources, overcrowding, higher poverty rates, unemployment, and a loss of social services and education lead to social issues such as violence, drug misuse, and crime.\n\nGovernment schemes to manage urbanization\n\nSmart cities mission\u00a0\n\nThe National Smart Cities Mission is an urban renewal mission launched in 2015, to promote cities to provide core infrastructure, a clean and sustainable environment, and a decent quality of life to their citizens through the application of \u2018smart solutions\u2019.\n\nAMRUT (Atal Mission for Rejuvenation and Urban Transformation) mission\n\nThe purpose of AMRUT\u00a0 which is mainly for urban rejuvenation is to:\n\nEnsure that every household has access to a tap with an assured supply of water and a sewerage connection.\nIncrease the amenity value of cities by developing greenery and well maintained open spaces (e.g. parks) and\nReduce pollution by switching to public transport or constructing facilities for non-motorized transport (e.g. walking and cycling).\n\nSwacch Bharat mission\n\nIt was launched in 2014 to accelerate the efforts to achieve universal sanitation coverage and to ensure that the open defecation free (ODF) behaviours are sustained, no one is left behind, and that solid and liquid waste management facilities are accessible, the Mission is moving towards the next Phase II of SBMG i.e ODF-Plus.\n\nSwacch Bharat mission Urban 2.0 was allocated funds in Union Budget 2021. The goal of the Swachh Bharat Mission Urban 2.0 is to make all the cities garbage-free with sophisticated waste management systems.\n\nHRIDAY (Heritage City Development and Augmentation Yojana)\n\nNational Heritage City Development and Augmentation Yojana (HRIDAY) was launched on 21 January 2015 to bring together urban planning, economic growth, and heritage conservation in an inclusive manner to preserve the heritage character of each Heritage City.\n\nPM Awas Yojana\n\nThe Housing for All scheme was an initiative of the Indian government to establish housing facilities for slum dwellers and was introduced by the Indian government\u2019s Ministry of Housing and urban affairs. The mission has an Urban part and Gramin part to comprehensively acknowledge the diversity of the Indian landscape.\n\nAtmanirbhar Bharat Abhiyan\n\nAtmanirbhar Bharat Abhiyan (Self-reliant India Mission) is a campaign launched by the Central Government of India which included an Rs.20 lakh crore economic stimulus package and several reform proposals. The five pillars of the mission are- economy, infrastructure, system, democracy, and demand.\n\nWay forward\n\nSustainable, planned, and eco-friendly cities: Governments\u2019 efforts to build smart, safe, environmentally friendly, and affordable cities should get more boost and legal backing as well.\n\nPrivate investments: More investments can be encouraged for green living and other urban initiatives for sustainable landscapes.\n\nAccess for all: every resident should be able to access all the services, without discrimination of any kind. Disabled friendly and inclusive infrastructure should be made mandatory in urban areas.\n\nEmployment: To mitigate the negative consequences of increasing urbanization while still protecting natural ecosystems, private investments in environmental resource utilization and employment creation should be promoted.\n\nHealth and Population management: population control is important to manage the spread of diseases. It will help in creating a healthy society with medical facilities accessible to all.\n\nPoverty alleviation: A bottom-up approach can be adopted\u00a0to better understand unique challenges faced by the urban poor and worked upon.\n\nAs we move forward in the 21st century, the global population is likely to continue growing. Urban areas will continue to grow with the population. By 2050, it is projected that two-thirds of the urban population will be living in urban areas, that are close to 7 billion people in cities alone.\n\nThis continual growth presents complex challenges as we prepare for the cities of the future. How we choose to manage urbanization will have consequences for our world for many years to come.\n\nPrevious year question\n\nUPSC Mains-GS 1, 2017\n\nThe growth of cities as I.T. hubs has opened up new avenues of employment but has also created new problems.

And in modern times, women started fighting for their rights and equality.\n\nWomen in pre-historic times\nDuring the period of Indus Valley civilization, the status of women was equal in honour. The worship of the mother goddess demonstrates that they were respected in the form of a mother.\nDuring the Rig Vedic period, women had superior status and they got more liberty and equality. The position of wife was a privileged one in the household and women had enhanced status in performing religious rites.\nIn terms of education, both boys and girls were given equal opportunities. After observing Upanayana Samskar, girls were permitted to spend their lives in Gurukul.\u00a0 The education of girls was considered an important qualification for marriage.\nDuring the age of Upanishads also women had a superior role in society and widows had freedom of remarriage as well. The presence of women teachers, many of whom possessed the highest spiritual knowledge was also a feature of this period.\nThe later years saw a decline in the role and status of women in public life. Early marriage started hindering education and women slowly started diminishing from away from political and educational spheres.\nThe Maurya and later, the Gupta period saw the practice of Sati increasing, and women\u2019s lives were dictated by the men in their life. The upper-class women were much more confined to their homes and were not allowed to be out in public life.\nWomen in the Medieval period\nThis period saw many social evils like female infanticide, sati, child marriages, the Purdah system, and widow\u2019s condition were more miserable.\nThe inflexibility of the caste system deprived of them the right to freedom and social movement.\nShe was forced to lead a life away from society as well as family.\nThe inhuman practice of Sati had become forced and predominant.\nWomen in Modern India\n\nThe modern period saw the start of the fight by women to gain their position and stature back slowly.\n\nMany movements and organisations were led by both men and women for the upliftment of women in society.\n\nEarly Women\u2019s organizations by social reformers\n\nThe early Indian society was plagued by various social evils against women such as Sati, polygamy, poor conditions of widows, child marriage, female infanticide, etc.\n\nRaja Ram Mohan Roy (1772-1833) was one of the earliest social reformers to focus and work on issues of women. He condemned sati pratha, and polygamy, and spoke in favour of property rights for women.\nIshwar Chandra Vidyasagar is well known for his efforts for widow remarriage. He and Rani Roshmoni\u2019s efforts helped in the passing of the Widows\u2019 Remarriage Act in 1856, which was drafted by Dalhousie and passed by Canning.\nKeshab Chandra Sen of Brahmo Samaj also worked for the upliftment of widows, held educational programs, and started a women\u2019s journal. Similar work was done by the Prarthana Samaj in Gujarat and Maharashtra.\nJyotirao Phule and Savitribai Phule worked immensely to educate girls and established girls\u2019 schools for the same.\nM.G Ranade, Narayan Ganesh Chandavarkar, and R.G Bhandarkar in Pune started organizations for ending child marriage, to encourage widow remarriage and women\u2019s education.\n\nThis male-guided organization and reform efforts were not truly liberating in many areas. The earlier reformers wanted women to be educated but did not want them to step out of their homes into public life.\n\nThe Age of Consent Act. 1891: The cases of death of 11-year-old Phulmoni Dasi due to marital rape (1887) and child-bride Rukmabai led to the enactment of the age of consent act.\n\nThis act raised the age of consent for sexual intercourse for all girls, married or unmarried, from ten to twelve years in all jurisdictions, and its violation was subject to criminal prosecution as rape.\nThough this act was supported by reformers like Behramji Malabari and women\u2019s social organizations, national leaders like Tilak and revivalist groups were vocal against it.\nThey were against the interference of the British in the social customs and believed that educated women were turning their backs on societal and cultural norms.\nWomen\u2019s organizations by women\nThe Ladies Society in Calcutta (1882) was started by Swarnakumari Devi (sister of Rabindranath Tagore), for educating and imparting livelihood skills to widows. She was also the editor of the women\u2019s journal Bharati making her the first Indian woman editor.\nArya Mahila Samaj was started by Ramabai Saraswati in Pune to provide education to women and to discourage and fight against the practice of child marriage. She later opened Sharada Sadan in Mumbai in 1889 for the education of child widows.\nIn 1905, Bharat Mahila Parishad, the women\u2019s wing of the National Conference (part of the Indian National Congress) was inaugurated to work for the betterment of the social conditions of women. It focused on child marriage, the condition of widows, dowry, and other evil customs.\nThe Stri Zarthosti Mandal (Parsi Women\u2019s Circle) was the Parsee community\u2019s major organization for women\u2019s social work, which emerged from plague relief work done by the family of Naoroji Patuck. The organization expanded its agenda to include medical care, and education and successfully sought funding from the wealthy Parsi philanthropist Sir Ratan Tata.\nMany such associations were formed in Calcutta, Bombay, and Madras by small urban educated families.\nNational women\u2019s organizations\n\nIn 1910, Bharat Stree Mahamandal was formed by Sarala Devi Chaudharani (Daughter of Swarnakumari Devi) to bring together women of all castes and creeds together. They targeted the purdah system to liberate women from openly working in public life. They opened many other branches all over the country to promote female education.\n\nThe three major national women\u2019s organizations which thus trace their origin to the decade between 1917-1927 were:\n\nThe Women\u2019s Indian Association (WIA)\n\nThe WIA was founded by Irish woman, Margaret E. Cousins on 8 May 1917 in Adyar, Madras with a secular agenda for women of all creeds, classes, and castes. Annie Besant became the first President of WIA later on.\nThe other founding women included S. Ambujammal, Dr. Muthulaksmi Reddy, Mangalammal Sadasivier, Saralabai Naik, Herabai Tata, Dr. Poonen Lukhose, Kamaladevi Chattopadhyaya, Begam Hasrat Mohani, and Dhanavanti Rama Rao.\n\nThe National Council of Women in India (NCWI)\n\nThe NCWI was formally formed in 1925, with the efforts of Bombay, Calcutta, and Madras\u2019s dedicated and influential women who had contributed commendably to the war efforts.\nIt came to be accepted as the national branch of the International Council of Women.\n\nThe All India Women\u2019s Conference (AIWC)\n\nAIWC was an organization dedicated to the upliftment and betterment of women and children.\nThe first President of the AIWC, the Maharani Chimanbai Gaekwad of Baroda, underlined the need for a special type of education for women, compatible with their nature.\nMargaret Cousins was the Secretary. Renowned women like Sarojini Naidu, Kamla Devi Chattopadhyay, Renuka Roy, Rajkumari Amrit Kaur, Rameshwari Nehru, Begum Hamid Ali, Dr. Muthulakshmi Reddy, etc. were in the leadership of this organization.\nImpact of Women\u2019s Organizations\n\nThe result of these organizations was that the Montague-Chelmsford Reform Act of 1919 gave women the right to vote in elections to all state legislatures but not to the Council of State for Governor-General.\n\nThe princely state of Travancore-Cochin was the first to give voting rights to women in 1920.\nIn 1921, Madras and Bombay Province granted the Right to vote to wealthy and educated women, under the same terms as men.\nIn 1925, in Punjab, the Sikhs granted women equal voting rights irrespective of their educational qualifications or being wealthy or poor. Bengal legislation also passed a similar resolution.\nWith the demand of women, in 1926 women were given the right to membership of provincial legislatures. This was of course to be achieved only through government nomination.\nIn 1926, Kamala Devi Chattopadhyay stood for Madras legislative council elections from Mangalore but was defeated. The Madras government later nominated Dr. Muthulakshmi Reddy to the legislative council.\nSarda Act of 1929 raised the marriage age for both girls and boys to 14 and 18 respectively.\nBy 1932, however, the AIWC had become involved with women\u2019s political rights and all questions that affected women and children as well as with social problems such as untouchability.\nIn the Government of India Act 1935, the British Raj set up a system of separate electorates and separate seats for women. Most women\u2019s leaders opposed it and demanded adult franchises.\n\nAlso read: WUEGA (Women\u2019s Urban Employment Guarantee Act)\n\nWomen in the national and labour movements\n\nThe Swadeshi movement after the Bengal partition of 1905 and the Home Rule movement saw the participation of women in limited numbers. They also attended sessions of INC during this time.\n\nThe really large number of women participation was seen in the Non-cooperation movement launched by Gandhiji in 1920 where women played a vital role in organizing processions, picketing shops selling foreign clothes and liquor, and even went to jail.\nThe peasant women wholeheartedly participated in Borsad and Bardoli Satyagraha.\nWomen from all walks of life took part in Salt Satyagraha, the Civil Disobedience Movement, and the Quit India Movement. Many of these women faced lathi charges and went to jail.\n\nThere were women involved in the revolutionary and extremist activities also:\n\nKalpana Dutta, Chittagong, Bengal, was part of the Chittagong armoury raid\nNonibala Devi was associated with the jugantar party and was arrested for transporting weapons.\nPreetilata Waddedar was also a Chittagong revolutionary.\nCaptain Laxmi Sehgal was a commander of the \u2018Rani of Jhansi regiment\u2019 in the Indian National Army (INA) under Subhash Chandra Bose.\nWomen also actively took part in labour and trade unions, since they also were part of the workforce later on-\nAnusuya Sarabai led the Ahmedabad textile workers to strike in 1917 and started the Ahmedabad textile mill workers union, the Majdoor Mahajan in 1920.\nManiben Kara was a socialite leader of railway workers; Ushabai Dange and Paravai Bose were communist leaders of textile leaders.\n\nSEWA (self-employed women\u2019s association) was formed in 1972 by Ela Bhat in Ahmedabad. It aimed to improve the condition of poor women who worked in an unorganized sector by providing training and technical aides.\n\nThe women\u2019s movement in pre-independent India has been called the first wave of feminism. In this phase, women blamed tradition and social structure for their suffering and sought redress through education and legal change.\nThe women\u2019s organizations had brought women\u2019s issues to the forefront. These organizations helped women to come out from domestic boundaries, assemble, and fight for their cause. This prepared the base of women\u2019s active participation in the struggle for freedom.\nPrevious year question (UPSC CSE 2013)\nQ. Defying the barriers of age, gender, and religion, Indian women became the torchbearers during the struggle for freedom in India. Discuss. (10 marks-200 words)"
