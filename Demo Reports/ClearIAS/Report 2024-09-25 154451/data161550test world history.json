Read here to know more about their types and how they affect society.\u00a0\n\nPolitical philosophies are the ideals that help us to understand the reasons for the actions taken up by the people in a particular course of time, which impacted the global political setup.\n\nThe great political thinkers like Aristotle, Plato, Karl Marx, Hobbes, Locke, etc. have propounded various political theories or philosophies. Indian political thinkers from Chanakya to Ambedkar have shaped the political arena of the modern world as we see it today.\n\nPolitical philosophy is concerned with the concepts and arguments involved in political opinion. Many types of political ideologies have taken shape over hundreds out of which we will be discussing three philosophies that have played significant roles in the modern world- communism, socialism, and capitalism.\n\nThese political philosophies have impacted society in major ways and resulted in pertinent historical changes in the world.\n\nTable of Contents\n\nPolitical Philosophies: Capitalism\nTypes of capitalism\nEffect of capitalism on society\nPolitical Philosophies: Socialism\nTypes of socialism\nEffect of socialism on society\nPolitical Philosophies: Communism\nTypes of communism\nEffect of communism on society\nConclusion\nPolitical Philosophies: Capitalism\n\nIn a capitalist system, the factories fuel the economy, and a wealthy few own the factories. This created the need for a large number of people to work for the factory owners. In this environment, the wealthy few exploited the labourers, who had to labour to live.\n\n\ud83d\udc49 Which year are YOU targeting for success in the IAS/IPS/IFS Exam? \ud83d\ude80\n\n(1) \u21d2 UPSC 2025: Prelims cum Mains\n\n(2) \u21d2 UPSC 2026: Prelims cum Mains\n\n(3) \u21d2 UPSC 2027 Prelims cum Mains\n\nTip: Know more about ClearIAS Courses (Online/Offline)\n\nFrom a political perspective, capitalism is a system of laissez-faire (freedom). Lawfully, it is a system of objective laws that is rule of law, in contrast, to the rule of man. In financial terms, when such freedom is applied to the domain of production its result is the free market.\n\nCapitalism was first used by novelist William Makepeace Thackeray, in 1854 in his novel \u2018The Newcomes\u2019, where he described capitalism as \u201chaving ownership of capital and not as a system of production\u201d.\n\nCapitalism has three-level systems:\n\nOn the first level, the markets, firms compete to secure their labour and capital as well as to serve their customers.\nIn the second level, there are basic institutional foundations, including physical and social infrastructure; physical infrastructure includes, among other things, transportation and communications, and social infrastructure includes the educational, public health, and legal systems.\nThe third level comprises a political authority typically one with specialized functions such as executive, legislative, and judicial branches. In turn, a set of political institutions connect the political authority to the political markets and ultimately to civil society, to which such authority is finally responsible.\nTypes of capitalism\nMercantilism is a nationalist system that was practised in the later phase of the 16th century.\nIt is characterized by the mixing of national business interests with state interest and imperialism, and eventually, the state is utilized to improve national business interests abroad.\nMercantilism was determined by the belief that the prosperity of a nation is increased through a positive balance of trade with other nations.\nIt relates to the phase of capitalist development and is sometimes called the Primitive accumulation of capital.\nA free-market economy is described as a capitalist economic system where prices for goods and services are set freely by the forces of supply and demand and are allowed to reach their point of equilibrium without interference by government plans.\nA social market economy is a free-market system where government involvement in price formation is kept to a minimum but the state provides substantial services in the area of social security, unemployment benefits, and recognition of labour rights through national collective bargaining arrangements.\nRhine capitalism is described as the modern model of capitalism and adaptation of the social market model that exists in continental Western Europe today.\nState capitalism includes state ownership of the means of production within a state, and the organization of state enterprises as commercial, profit-seeking businesses.\nCorporate capitalism refers to a free or mixed-market economy categorized by the supremacy of hierarchical, bureaucratic corporations.\nA mixed economy is a mainly market-based economy consisting of both private and public ownership of the means of production and economic interventionism through macroeconomic policies intended to correct market failures, reduce unemployment and keep inflation low.\nEffect of capitalism on society\nCapitalism ensures economic growth as it empowers both manufacturers and consumers and keeps money in rotation.\nIt ensures the accessibility of goods and services at a competitive price and helps to improve the standard of living in the country.\nCapitalism paved the wave for LPG reforms in the world and provided opportunities for the labor force to opt for global employment opportunities, which have further shrunk the global boundaries.\nBut capitalism leads to unequal distribution of wealth- rich get richer and poor get poorer.\n\nAlso read: Crony Capitalism\n\nPolitical Philosophies: Socialism\n\nSocialism is a political and economic ideology that believes in the public ownership of means of production and distribution based on a plan formulated by a central authority.\n\nIn socialism, the class that produces the wealth can jointly decide how it will be used for the benefit of all. Real socialism is characterized as democratic and it is economic as well as political.\n\nSocialism depends altogether upon the history of mankind for a record of its growth in the past and bases its future upon knowledge of that history in so far as it can be accurately traced up to the present time.\n\nSocialism was initiated in the late 18th century by a knowledgeable and working-class political movement that disapproved of the effects of industrialization and private ownership on civilization.\n\nThe main features of socialism are:\n\nPublic ownership\nCentral planning\nDefinite socio-economic objectives\nFreedom of consumption\nEqual income distribution\nRegulated pricing process\nTypes of socialism\nDemocratic Socialism promotes the principles of Socialism as an economic principle which signifies that the means of production should be in the hands of ordinary working people and equality as a governing principle.\nMarxian socialism denotes a particular historical phase of financial development and its corresponding set of social relations that ultimately overtake capitalism in the plan of historical materialism.\nFrom this perspective, socialism is described as a mode of production where the principle for production is use-value, where production for use is coordinated through conscious economic planning and the law of value no longer directs economic activity.\nRevolutionary Socialism supports the need for essential social change through revolution or revolution instead of gradual reform as a strategy to attain a socialist society.\nUtopian Socialism describes the first streams of modern socialist thought in the first quarter of the 19th Century. It was used by later socialist thinkers to define early socialist, or quasi-socialist, intellectuals who created hypothetical visions of perfect egalitarian and communalist societies without actually concerning themselves with how these societies could be created or sustained.\nLibertarian Socialism develops a society without political, economic, or social hierarchies, in which every person would have free, equal access to tools of information and production.\nMarket Socialism is a type of economic system in which there is a market economy directed and guided by socialist developers, and where prices are set through trial and error rather than relying on a free price tool.\nEco-Socialism is a philosophy that combines aspects of Marxism, Socialism, Green politics, ecology, and the anti-globalization movement. They focus on collective ownership of the means of production, to alleviate the social barring, poverty, and environmental deprivation brought about by the capitalist system, globalization, and colonialism.\nEffect of socialism on society\nCreates a welfare society where all the basic needs of people (food, clothes, and shelter) are fulfilled by the State at very affordable prices.\nProviding employment is the State\u2019s responsibility based on capabilities, education, and skills.\nAll the profits go to the State, which utilizes them for the well-being of the society by providing them with free education, improving public health amenities, ensuring social security, etc.\nEstablishes the supremacy of the State, which may lead to authoritarianism.\nLack of checks and balances in the bureaucracy leads to increased corruption in society.\nPeople lack the fundamental right of freedom to choose what they want to consume and what and where they want to work.\nSocialism demeans their ability to grow economically in careers as people do not work for personal growth but under the fear of the State.\nPolitical Philosophies: Communism\n\nIn layman\u2019s terms, communism is the political system in which the community owns and controls entities like factories, farms, services, etc. intending to treat everyone equally.\n\nCommunism is based on the goal of eliminating socioeconomic class struggles by creating a classless and stateless society in which everyone shares the benefits of labour and the community controls all property and wealth.\n\nIt is a form of government most closely associated with the ideas of Karl Marx, a German philosopher, which he outlined in\u00a0The Communist Manifesto (1848).\n\nMarx believed that capitalism, with its emphasis on profit and private ownership, led to inequality among citizens. Thus, his goal was to encourage a system that promoted a classless society in which everyone shared the benefits of labour and the community (communes) controlled all property and wealth. No one would strive to rise above others, and people would no longer be motivated by greed. Then, communism would close the gap between rich and poor, end the exploitation of workers, and free the poor from oppression.\n\nThe basic ideas of communism did not originate with Marx. Plato and Aristotle discussed them in ancient times, but Marx developed them into a popular doctrine following modern times, which was later put into practice.\n\nMarx\u2019s ideal society ensured economic equality and fairness. Marx believed that private ownership of property promoted greed, and he blamed capitalism for society\u2019s problems. The problems, he claimed, stemmed from the Industrial Revolution. The rise of factories, the reliance on machines, and the capability of mass production created conditions that promoted oppression and encouraged the development of a proletariat or a working class.\n\nFor a large part of the 20th century, about one-third of the world lived in communist countries ruled by dictatorial leaders who controlled the lives of everyone else.\n\nThe communist leaders set the wages, they set the prices, and they distributed the wealth. Western capitalist nations fought hard against communism, and eventually, most communist countries collapsed.\n\nMarx\u2019s utopia was never achieved, as it required revolution on a global scale, which never became a reality. As of today, five proclaimed communist countries continue to exist: North Korea, Vietnam, China, Cuba, and Laos.\n\nTypes of communism\nMarxism is a perspective that involves several differing \u201csub-perspectives\u201d that is, whilst there tends to be a general agreement about the need to construct a critique of Capitalist society, there are major differences between theorists working within this viewpoint.\nMarxism-Leninism is the Communist philosophical field that emerged amongst Communist parties in the 1920s during the era of Joseph Stalin (1878 \u2013 1953), with whom it is mainly associated.\nThe term \u201cMarxism-Leninism\u201d is the extent to which it follows the principles of either Marx or Lenin.\nThe philosophy of Leninism was built upon and extended the ideas of Marxism, and served as the theoretical foundation for the ideology of Soviet Communism after the Russian Revolution of 1917 and the establishment of the Soviet Union.\nStalinism is a more judgemental phrase for Joseph Stalin\u2019s vision of Communism. Supporters of this ideology argue that it includes widespread use of publicity to establish a personality cult around an absolute ruler, as well as extensive use of secret police to maintain social proposals and silence political opposition, all of which are trappings of totalitarianism.\nTrotskyism is the philosophical model of Marxism that was supported by Leon Trotsky (1879 \u2013 1940), who considered himself a conformist Marxist and Bolshevik-Leninist and squabbled for the establishment of a frontline party.\nHis politics differed from the Marxism-Leninism of Joseph Stalin, concerning support for an international proletarian revolution and firm support for a true dictatorship.\nThe most dominant characteristic of Trotskyism is the theory of permanent uprising to explain how socialist revolutions could happen in societies.\nLuxemburgism is a theoretical model of Communism, which is based on the texts of Rosa Luxemburg (1870 \u2013 1919). Her politics deviated from those of Lenin and Trotsky mainly in her discrepancy with their concept of \u201cdemocratic centralism\u201d, which she visualized as unsatisfactorily democratic.\nLuxemburgism looks like Anarchism in its averting of an authoritarian society by relying on the people themselves as opposed to their leaders.\nMaoism is slightly different from Communism and is derived from the teachings of the Chinese leader Mao Zedong (or Mao Tse-tung) (1893 \u2013 1976), and practised in the People\u2019s Republic of China after the Chinese Revolution of 1949.\nMaoism evolved from the Marxism-Leninism of Stalin but introduced new ideas such as social imperialism (Mao accused the Soviet Union of dominating and exploiting the smaller countries in its sphere by organizing their economies around Soviet, not domestic, needs), the Mass Line (a method of leadership that seeks to learn from the masses and immerse the political headship in the concerns and conditions of the masses \u201cfrom the masses to the masses\u201d), people\u2019s war and new democracy.\nEffect of communism on society\nThe philosophy of communism supports a society without rulers, but until it is achieved all the power will lie with the dictator government, which will lead to oppression. For example, the Rule of Hitler and the event of the holocaust during World War\u00a0II.\nIn communist nations, the difference between the official claims and societal realities is different. The dictatorial government controls the information and every sort of communication channel that cut-offs the society from the outside world.\nConclusion\n\nToday, the historical words\u00a0capitalism,\u00a0socialism, and\u00a0communism\u00a0do not fully capture the economic systems of nations. New words are also used to describe economic systems-\u00a0free market system;\u00a0mixed economy;\u00a0command economy. In other words, communism, socialism, and capitalism are in sync with modern national economics falling somewhere in the middle, or mixed zone of the different types of economies.\n\nUltimately, nations and citizens of nations must decide how much government regulation of the economy is appropriate. Therefore, a clear understanding of the historical developments, meanings, political associations, and synonyms of these three words is essential.\n\nAlso read:\u00a0Economic nationalism; Neo-Fascism"

Germany and Italy also entered the scene towards the end of the nineteenth century.\n\nThey stumbled upon the Americas (Columbus, 1492) and realised the huge potential of controlling colonies through which they can source merchandise for trade cheaply.\n\nThis led to establishing trade routes with countries of Western Africa, India, Dutch East Indies (Indonesia) etc.\n\n\ud83d\udc49 Which year are YOU targeting for success in the IAS/IPS/IFS Exam? \ud83d\ude80\n\n(1) \u21d2 UPSC 2025: Prelims cum Mains\n\n(2) \u21d2 UPSC 2026: Prelims cum Mains\n\n(3) \u21d2 UPSC 2027 Prelims cum Mains\n\nTip: Know more about ClearIAS Courses (Online/Offline)\n\nSince they controlled the high seas, they were able to influence the trading policies of these countries.\n\nThis gave them the incentive to interfere in the domestic politics of these countries.\n\nPhases of Colonisation:\n\nIt is broadly divided into two phases \u2013 Mercantile and Industrial phases.\n\nMercantile Phase:\nThis is called as Mercantilism because the major motto of colonial powers was to establish supremacy in trading relationships. They sought to source merchandise cheaply and sell it at a premium in European markets.\nThey controlled high seas and used this as a means for \u2018Gunboat diplomacy\u2019 and later establishing extensive empires in the Americas, East Indies (present-day Indonesia) etc.\nThe technological superiority of Colonialists wasn\u2019t as much as in the later industrial phase. So they were able to subjugate only relatively primitive peoples. Countries with well-established state systems and cultures were able to repel colonialists. (For example, in India, Mughal emperor Aurangzeb defeated British East India Company in Child\u2019s War, 1686. China wasn\u2019t attacked till the Opium Wars of the nineteenth century).\nGoods from the east were still in great demand across Europe. So they worked under the trading systems laid by the strong states of India and China.\nIndustrial Phase:\nThis coincided with the Industrial Revolution in Western Europe and the United States of America. The relative technological supremacy and decadence in the Eastern states meant that Europe could interfere in the internal affairs of these states.\nEuropean states used gunboat diplomacy (Opium Wars in China) as well as vile political machinations (Bengal in India, leading to the Battle of Plassey, 1757) to secure their aims.\nApart from trade, they sought to secure vast markets for the new industrial goods produced through the Industrial revolution in these countries. Political influence gained in these countries were used to destroy traditional industries and promoted cheap, mass-produced European goods. Eg: Destruction of the famed textile industry of Bengal by the British to promote cheap cotton from the textile mills of England.\nColonies were used to source cheap raw materials and value-added manufactured goods were dumped in the colonies under the banner of \u201cFree trade\u201d.\nThe colonial powers controlled foreign, monetary and trade policies. This meant an advantage to the industrialists at home. This led to the famous drain of wealth from the colonies.\n\nColonialism reached its logical conclusion with the rise of new industrial powers in Europe \u2013 Germany and Italy. This lead to a competition for accruing larger and larger empires that meant more power and prestige to these countries. This was most pronounced in the tragic event of Scramble for Africa.\n\nScramble for Africa:\nAfrica in 1912\nWhat happened?\nThis happened during the period of New Imperialism (1881-1914). Increasing rivalry between European powers \u2013 Britain, France, Germany etc \u2013 meant that they needed more and more markets and sources for cheap raw material.\nTechnological progress \u2013 mapping of inland Africa in the middle decades of the nineteenth century, advances in treating deadly diseases like malaria etc \u2013 meant that the European powers could finally move inland from the well established coastal colonies.\nBut this would require costly wars against the native population. So they reached a political settlement where they divided the territory of Africa within themselves with no regard for the wishes of the indigenous people of these lands!\nThe settlement was reached in the Berlin conference of 1884. In 1870, less than 10% of African territory was under European control. By 1914, it had increased to almost 90%! This is known as the scramble of Africa.\nDecolonization of Africa\n\nIt was the cultural, economic and political process through which colonies broke free from the colonial empires and integrated themselves to the new \u2018world order\u2019.\n\nCultural:\nColonial empires were generally founded on principles of Racism and \u2018right to rule\u2019 over \u2018inferior races\u2019. These narratives had to be challenged.\nAn image of benevolent and modernising influence was used as a pretext for colonial exploitation. However, this was later broken. (Eg: Indian National Congress popularised the theory of drain of wealth to demolish the claim of the civilising influence of British Raj)\nThe self-confidence of people had to be boosted. Exercises of cultural integration and the creation of national identities and a shared past were emphasised. Eg: Ancient Greek (Hellenistic) culture was emphasised in the Greek War of Independence, 1829 against the Ottoman Empire. In India, achievements of our ancient civilisation were popularised.\nMost states were successful in this regard, though deep-rooted tribal differences and prejudices led to problems in Africa (see below).\nPolitical:\nNewly freed states had to be allowed to follow an independent foreign policy. They had to raise resources and build stable institutions (Eg: An Army subject to strict civilian control).\nRepresentative and democratic institutions needed to be built. This needed an enlightened citizenry and an empowered leadership.\nEconomic:\nThe old European powers sought to exert influence in newly independent trades through biased trade policies. This came to be known as Neo-Colonialism.\nMost of the investment in these countries came from the erstwhile colonizers. So they were able to control new governments through lobbying and other informal (often corrupt) means.\nColonial powers were technologically advanced. So they used it as a leverage in directing foreign investment and hence controlling the new states. They sought to guard their technological supremacy through tight Intellectual property regimes.\n\nIn this article, we look at how the newly formed states underwent the process of Decolonisation in Africa.\n\nWhat forced European powers to abandon their empires?\n\nNationalist movements \u2013 Through the effects of westernisation and opening up, colonies acquired enlightened leadership and many developed strong nationalist movements. Most colonies were extensive police states. Massive unrest made them simply unviable.\nSecond World War: It weakened most European powers and they couldn\u2019t keep up with the maintenance of their empires. The most powerful among victorious powers \u2013 The USA and the USSR took a firm anti-colonial stance. This further weakened the Europeans.\nPan-Africanism: A feeling of brotherhood was growing within the indigenous people of Africa. This meant a pooling of resources and external support in the struggle for independence. As more and more countries attained freedom, the entire process was hastened.\nOutside Pressures: The USA and USSR actively pressurised colonial powers. Eg: President Truman of the US pressurised British government to make India independent. Newly formed United Nations and other powerful international associations like the Non-Alignment Movement built up firm international opinions against colonialism.\nChallenges to Africa:\n\nAfrica faced many unique challenges which made Decolonisation a very difficult process. These were common to most of the new states in Africa.\n\nTribal differences: Many countries were brought together by the sheer military forces of the colonizers. Lack of a common cultural past and tribal belligerence meant that they slaughtered each other inside these artificial boundaries imposed upon them. This led to worst genocides in Nigeria, Congo (Zaire), Burundi and Rwanda.\nCold war rivalry: Since most of them were resource-rich, the two major blocs didn\u2019t want more states slipping into the orbit of its rival power. This led to prolonged civil wars. Eg: Angola, Uganda, Burundi etc.\nEconomic underdevelopment: Colonisers used them as sources of raw materials. So lack of industries and primitive agriculture made them susceptible to Neo-Colonialism. Also, most of their economies were entirely dependent upon the export of one or two commodities. When international prices fell, they plunged into political instability and civil wars. Eg: Nigeria, Ghana, Tanzania, Burundi etc.\nPolitical and Social problems: Most colonial powers refused education to Africans. This led to the deficiency in enlightened leadership and a general faith in democratic means. This meant that most countries plunged into corruption and civil war soon after independence.\nEconomic and Natural Disasters: Devastating famines of the 1980s and ongoing famines due to climate change are spelling disaster to these countries. These events end up ruining economies and destabilising governments. Through the 90s, the spread of the HIV/AIDS epidemic also posed a grave threat to these countries. During the last two decades, climate change-induced disasters are seen to affect third world countries, especially those in Africa.\nEthnic conflict: In some countries with an influential white settler population, Decolonisation was a more complex affair. They offered firm resistance because they were privileged under the old system. Eg: Rhodesia (Zimbabwe) and the erstwhile Apartheid regime of South Africa. Sometimes, as in Zimbabwe, forced taking away of estates from the white minority led to an overall fall in productivity and caused economic crises.\nReligious Extremism: This is a fairly recent phenomenon in which Islamist ideologies taking over Muslim populations of these countries. Eg: Boko Haram in Nigeria, Al-Shabab in Somalia.\nAftermath of Decolonisation:\n\nDue to these challenges and specific conditions in different countries, Decolonisation turned out different results for these countries.\n\nGeneral trends:\nArmy coups were common in countries with weak leadership and limited mass base in democratic processes. Eg: Ghana, Nigeria, Uganda, Burundi, Rwanda, Congo etc.\nComplete export dependency on one or two commodities leading to instability at times of falling prices. Eg: Nigeria, Ghana, Tanzania, Burundi etc.\nExtreme poverty was the characteristic of most states due to lesser human development and corruption.\nRampant corruption \u2013 most states fell into the hands of a corrupted elite that exploited social fissures to enrich itself. Recently we saw popular movements against Robert Mugabe of Zimbabwe and Jacob Zuma of South Africa succeeding in removing them.\nGreat power rivalry has affected many states like Angola badly. At the same time, these powers failed to interfere in places where their interests were not involved. Eg: Failure to stop the Rwandan genocide of 1994. This points to the need for a pan-African movement to ensure democracy and rule of law.\nResource-rich countries falling prey to Neo-colonialism and sectarian violence. Eg: Sierra Leone is locked in a perpetual civil war over its gold, diamond and iron ore deposits. China is accused of adopting Neo-colonial policies to exert influence over resource-rich Western Africa. The recent effort by India and Japan to build an Asia-Africa Growth corridor is seen as an effort to counter this.\nMany North African countries saw widespread protests at the time of \u2018Arab Spring\u2019 of 2011. Eg: Morocco, Tunisia, Libya and Egypt. But due to lukewarm responses from the outside world, many of them either fell under the influence of Islamist ideologies or were quelled through extreme violence. This was an opportunity lost in bringing democratic governance to entire northern Africa.\nRole of India:\n\nAfter Indian independence, India supported Decolonisation strongly in International fora through the leadership of Non-Alignment movement. India actively mobilised international opinion in favour of Decolonisation. In Indonesia and Africa, it was vocal in support. It also sent troops to solve the Congo Crisis of the 1960s. Besides, India contributes actively to the UN peacekeeping forces that operate in different parts of Africa.\n\nRead: India-Tanzania relations\n\nConclusion:\n\nDecolonization was a force of good that helped liberate billions of people across the globe from exploitation under oppressive foreign rule. As a cultural process, it is continuing to date. It ended up with the majority of the world achieving self-determination and self-rule. Though the hegemonic nations still exert large influence through international trade, investment, and technology control, these countries are free to script their own destiny. The majority of the so-called \u201cThird World\u201d is still mired in extreme poverty.\n\nThe way forward is through human development, the spread of education, and the building of institutions through regional (Pan-African, Pan-South Asian collaboration, etc.) cooperation. The work of UN agencies is commendable in this regard. UN General Assembly has emerged as a potent forum where world opinion is mobilized in favor of third-world countries. Its powers and influence have to be enhanced. The democratization of international order will help the third world more in getting its grievances addressed and in building a more equitable world.\n\nAlso read: Coup in Niger\n\nArticle by:\u00a0Hashin Jithu"

It contained the whole of the world\u2019s landmass without the Americas. There is no land route available to the New World. So it remained isolated from the major cultures and civilisations of the old world.\n\nThis changed when the sea route to America was discovered by Christopher Columbus in 1492. After that, various European powers established colonies in North America, prominent among them being Spain, Holland, France and England.\n\nThe colonies were populated mainly by European migrants who were landless peasants, people facing religious persecution, traders, explorers, and others seeking adventure and profit in these new found lands.\n\nThere were constant clashes between the hegemonic powers to establish control over as much land as possible and control trade supply lines. Since these powers were locked in conflicts across the globe, a new theatre of war was inaugurated in the Americas.\n\nThe rivalry was especially strong between England and France, which culminated in the seven years war (1756-63). It is known as the \u201cfirst true world war\u201d and was fought in Europe, West Africa, the Americas, India and the Philippines.\n\nThe war concluded with the Battle of Wandiwash (1760) with the decisive British victory. This ushered in an era of British supremacy across the globe.\n\nBoth parties signed the Treaty of Paris (1763), bringing an end to the war. (You may note that this treaty had a profound impact on India in the sense that French was subdued completely and this led to the consolidation of British power in India.)\n\nIn North America, Britain consolidated all colonies lining the Atlantic coast and drove the French out of Canada. She was also successful in taking many Dutch territories, most important being New Netherlands, renaming it to New York.\n\nAmerican Colonies \u2013 Conditions\n\nThe colonies of England lined the Atlantic coast and were thirteen in number. The colonies had a diverse population, but the majority of them were independent farmers. With time, new industries were set up producing wool, flax and leather, mostly for European markets.\n\nHowever, the nature of economies was varied within them. Fishing, shipbuilding, and allied industries grew in the north while plantation agriculture thrived in the south. Later, the divide grew into the north industrializing further and the south lapsing into a feudal economy powered by slaves brought from Africa. (You may note that this divide later led to the American civil war (1861-65) as well).\n\nPolitically, the colonies were governed by a locally elected assembly. They enacted laws and levied taxes. Though they enjoyed some independence, they were ultimately answerable to the mother country (Britain).\n\nThough Britan was ruled by the Parliament, secondary treatment was meted out to the people of America. This led to widespread discontentment and provided a fertile ground for rebel ideas to grow and prosper.\n\nThe ideas from the age of enlightenment influenced the Americans profoundly and the idea of staying as an independent nation gained traction.\n\nCauses of the American war of Independence\n\nThere were various Political, Economical and Ideological reasons that led to the growth of discontentment that led to the American war of independence.\n\nPolitical causes of the American Revolution\nNo Representatives of Colonies in the British Parliament \u2013 The colonies were given no representation in the British parliament.\nResource draining of the colonies \u2013 The seven years war (1756-63), though ended in the British victory, had drained her resources. She turned to colonies to offset the losses. Since the major colonies were in North America, they suffered the most. The fledgeling industries of the colonies were especially penalised. This was under the lobbying of native industrialists in Britain.\nTaxation without representation \u2013 since the colonies were not represented in the British parliament, many people asserted that the British government had no rights to tax the colonies. They used the slogan \u2018No Taxation without Representation\u2019.\nProtests \u2013 Through protests like Boston Tea Party (1773), where tea cartons carried by British ships were thrown at the sea, Britain\u2019s right to levy taxes was eroded over time. This power was assumed by respective local governments.\nEconomic causes of the American Revolution\nEngland\u2019s policies prevented the economic development of colonies.\nLaws were enacted that mandated them to use only British ships for international trade.\nExport limitations \u2013 products like tobacco, sugar and cotton could only be exported to England.\nHeavy import duties for products from other colonies and outside England.\nRestrictions on Industrialisation \u2013 development of industries like iron, steel and textiles were prohibited in the colonies.\nGoods from England were forced upon the colonies.\nPolicies were adopted to impede the growth of industries and commerce in the colonies.\nStamp duty \u2013 In 1765, the British Parliament enacted the Stamp Act. It was made mandatory to affix stamps on every legal document. This led to widespread protest, many of them turning violent.\nRent \u2013 The aristocrats from England bought most of the land in North America and prohibited land ownership rights of the colonisers in the west. They wanted to keep the colonisers as rentiers for perpetuity.\nThe British attempts to levy taxes were resisted. Upon on objection, Britain was forced to withdraw most taxes except that for the tea. This led to protests like Boston Tea Party (see below).\nSince the British parliament had no representation from the colonies, it was held that it had no right to tax the colonies. This was deemed seditious by the British but didn\u2019t deter the colonists.\nIdeological causes of the American Revolution\nThe enlightenment philosophers like Locke, Harrington and Milton caught popular imagination.\nThey believed that all people had certain inalienable rights that no government should be allowed to infringe. This was in direct contrast with the oppressive British rule.\nInequalities of British society was despised by many philosophers like Thomas Paine and Thomas Jefferson.\nThey asserted the right to rebellion and emphasised on the absurdity of a continent being governed by an island.\nThe American Revolutionary War and the Declaration of Independence\nThe representatives of 13 colonies met at Philadelphia (1774) for the first continental congress. Their appeal for just treatment was rejected by the king and their actions declared as mutiny.\nThe War started in 1775 with colonial militias clashing against British troops for the first time.\nThe congress met again in Second continental congress (1776) and declared independence on July 4.\nThe declaration, among other things, asserted the inalienable rights of men that had to be protected. This was later elaborated in the Bill of rights. Indian constitution adopted fundamental rights from the Bill of rights of the USA.\nPeople were seen as the source of authority. This would pave way for the first modern democratic state with a written constitution.\nThe Americans were aided by the French, who were looking for an opportunity to strike at Britain.\nThe trouble brewing at home (Irish rebellion) also made things difficult for the British.\nOther enemies of the British like Spain and Holland also started fighting them at different locations of the continent.\nWar ended with English commander Lord Cornwallis surrendering to George Washington in 1781.\nThe treaty of Paris was signed in 1783 between England and USA which formally brought an end to the war.\nThe significance of the American Revolution\n\nThe revolution led to the establishment of a republic based on the first written constitution in the world.\nThis was a marked contrast to the other states were Monarchies were still in power. This inspired people across the world to struggle for democratic and republican forms of government.\nIt established a federal state with powers divided between the federal government and states. This provided a nice template for power-sharing in diverse countries that needed complex polities.\nBesides, there was a separation of powers between various organs of the state.\nCertain inalienable rights were given to the people \u2013 this limited the government against the authority of people and reduced government interference in their lives.\nDemocracy was established, but it was far from perfect. Sections like Negroes and women were denied voting rights. But the journey to democracy had begun.\nIt led to many uprisings in Europe, with the French revolution being the biggest. Many generals who participated in the war was instrumental in the French revolution.\nThinkers like Thomas Paine also participated in the revolution. This led to a spread of modern ideas in Europe.\nConclusion\n\nThe American revolution had a profound impact on the history of the modern world. It provided a template through which modern ideas could defeat oppressive regimes.\n\nThe subsequent success of the USA in world arena is a testimony to how powerful is the idea of liberal democracy and emancipation of the populace. This model was successfully emulated by many countries (especially in Europe) post World War II.\n\nIndia also has learned a lot from the American experience and adopted many of these democratic principles, adding to our own democratic socialist principles.\n\nArticle by:\u00a0Hashin Jithu"

Colonies expanded from east coast to west forming 34 states by 1861. There were differences between states in the north and states in the south \u2013 which resulted in the American Civil War.\n\nCauses of the American Civil War\n\nThe difference in the attitude towards slavery can be seen as the root cause of the American Civil War. This had repercussions in the economic and political sphere too. The factors which led to the outbreak of the Civil War in America can be consolidated as below.\n\n1. Economic Disparity between Northern and Southern States\nNorthern states were industrialized while southern states where primarily agricultural.\nNorthern states wanted a tax on imports from Britain while southern states wanted tax-free trade with Britain.\n2. The issue with the attitude towards slavery\nIndustrialized northern states preferred paid labourers while agricultural southern states which had large plantations were dependent on slave labour.\nSlavery was abolished in northern states in 1804 and they became \u2018free states\u2019.\n3.\u00a0Movement for the abolition of slavery\nA strong movement for the abolition of slavery began in the north. It called for the repeal of the controversial Fugitive Slave Act of 1850 (this act had mandated the return of runaway slaves to their masters).\n4. The fear of reforms by Abraham Lincoln and the Republican party\nThe immediate cause of the civil war was the American Presidential election in which the Republican Party candidate, Abraham Lincoln, won (1860).\nWhile Abraham Lincoln stood for freedom of slaves, the Democratic candidate Stephan Arnold Douglas wanted slavery to continue.\nThe course of the American Civil War\nSeven southern states declared their secession from the Union and established a Southern government \u2013 the Confederate States of America on February 9, 1861.\nThe Confederacy adopted its own Constitution.\nJefferson Davis was its President.\nWar broke out in April 1861 when the\u00a0Confederates\u00a0attacked a U.S. fortress (Fort Sumter) at South Carolina.\n4 more states joined the Confederacy, making the total number of states 11.\nIn September 1862, Lincoln issued the Proclamation of Emancipation, which freed millions of slaves.\nIn the Gettysburg battle, almost 50,000 soldiers were killed.\nLincoln gave the famous Gettysburg Address \u2013 where he set before the nation the task of preserving the Union and democracy. His vision was a government of the people, by the people and for the people.\nThe war ended with the surrender of all the Confederate armies and the collapse of the Confederate government in 1865. General Lee surrendered his Confederate army to General Ulysses S Grant.\nSignificance\u00a0of the American Civil War\nThe war put an end to the institution of slavery.\nThe war abolished the secession of states for all times to come.\n\u00a0In the economic sphere, the war led to the growth of large scale manufacturing industries.\nMore area came under cultivation \u2013 particularly in the western regions on North America.\nUse of more machines \u2013 which enhanced production.\nRegulation of banking system ((National Banking Act) and use of paper currency contributed to the growth of the nationwide business.\nNew weapons were used.\nImprovement in transport and communication\nInspiration to other countries \u2013 to abolish slavery.\nWhile the Revolution of 1776-1783 created the United States, the Civil War of 1861-1865 determined what kind of nation it would be.\nHow did Abraham Lincoln make a difference in history?\n\nAbraham Lincoln was born in a humble background in 1809, in the state of Kentucky.\nHis mother died when he was nine years old.\nHe became a distinguished lawyer and great orator.\nIn 1847 he was elected to the Congress.\nIn 1860, Lincoln was elected as the 16th President of the USA as a Republican Candidate.\nLincoln played a great role in keeping the USA united.\nHe refused to give southern states the right to secede from the Union.\nHis greatest contribution to humanity was the abolition of slavery.\nAfter the civil war, citizens of all states of the USA were granted citizenship and equal rights.\nIt was Abraham Lincoln who gave the famous principle of democracy \u2013 ie. government of the people, by the people and for the people."

Read to know more.\n\nThe French Revolution was the watershed event in modern European history that brought about the enlightenment principles and democracy, creating a rational and egalitarian society. It started in 1789 and ended in 1799.\n\nThe French Revolution was a time of social and political upheaval in France and its colonies. The liberal and radical ideas overthrew the Monarchy and influenced the decline of absolute Monarchies in other parts of Europe.\n\nThis was the revolution that led to the rise of Napoleon Bonaparte as well.\n\nTable of Contents\n\nFrance in 1789:\nThe major causes that led to the French Revolution:\nTimeline of the French Revolution:\n1789: The meeting of the Estate Generals\n1789-92: The revolution\n1789: The Declaration of Rights of the Man\n1793-95: The Reign of Terror\n1795: The end of the French Revolution\nRole of women in the French Revolution:\nImpact of the French Revolution:\nGlobal impact of the French Revolution:\nFrance in 1789:\n\nFrance was the most populated nation in Europe during this time and had been growing in wealth and prestige since the time of King Louis XIV. But this economic growth wasn\u2019t visible as the country was still very backward socially and politically.\n\nThe social divide was because it was still divided into feudal classes of people clergy, those who pray, nobles, those who fight, and the peasants, the working class. And political backwardness was because they were still ruled by an absolute monarch who believed in the divine right of kings.\n\nBut the French involvement in the American Revolution of 1776 was a costly affair and the extravagant lifestyle of King Louis XVI and the royal family was draining the coffers. The empty royal coffers, poor harvests, and rise in food prices had created feelings of unrest among the poor rural and urban populace. The matter was further worsened by the imposition of taxes that provided no relief. As a result rioting, looting and general strikes became the norm.\n\n\ud83d\udc49 Which year are YOU targeting for success in the IAS/IPS/IFS Exam? \ud83d\ude80\n\n(1) \u21d2 UPSC 2025: Prelims cum Mains\n\n(2) \u21d2 UPSC 2026: Prelims cum Mains\n\n(3) \u21d2 UPSC 2027 Prelims cum Mains\n\nTip: Know more about ClearIAS Courses (Online/Offline)\n\nThe major causes that led to the French Revolution:\nSocial inequality was very prevalent in French society of 18th\nThe clergy and the nobility formed the first two Estates and were the most privileged classes. They were exempted from payment of taxes to the State.\nThe Third Estate consisting of peasants and workers formed the majority of the population. They were burdened with excessive taxes with no political and social rights. As a result, they were extremely discontent.\nThe economic drain was falling heavy n the shoulders of the working class increasing the hostility:\nLouis XVI waged many wars making the State coffers were empty.\nThe situation was made even more complex by France\u2019s involvement in the American War of Independence and the faulty system of taxation.\nThe extravagant lifestyle of the royals added to the financial burden.\nThe unstable political situation: The situation was very unstable because the Bourbon king of France, Louis XVI was an extremely autocratic and weak-willed king who led a life of excessive luxury. This caused anger among the masses who were leading lives of extreme poverty and widespread hunger.\nThe 18th century brought a conscious change in the French thinkers who refused the \u2018Divine Rights Theory\u2019:\nPhilosophers like Rousseau rejected the paradigm of absolute monarchy and promulgated the doctrine of equality of man and sovereignty of people.\nThey played a pivotal role in exposing the fault lines of the old political system- \u2018the ancien regime\u2019, thus adding to the popular discontent.\nThe American Revolution also triggered the ideas of enlightenment and liberty among the intellectuals of the French society.\nTimeline of the French Revolution:\n1789: The meeting of the Estate Generals\nThe Estates-General was an assembly that represented the French nobility clergy and the middle class. They were called by Louis XVI to discuss the new tax measures in May 1789.\nThe third estate was already gathering support for their involvement in the decision-making body and voting rights during this time.\nThe middle class was in favour of the political and judicial reforms while the nobles did not want to give up their privileges. The talks with the third estate also failed.\nThe Tennis court oath: The third estate and their support formed the National Assembly and took an oath of office in June 1789 and vowed not to disperse until reforms have been initiated.\nSeeing no other option Louis XVI had to absorb the three assemblies into the new order.\n1789-92: The revolution\nThe national assembly continued in Versailles as the nation was gripped in fear and uncertainty which led to the insurgency.\nThis resulted in the taking of Bastille fortress on July 14, 1789. This event marked the beginning of the French Revolution.\nThe peasants revolted, attacked the houses of nobles and tax collectors, and the upper class was forced to flee for their lives. This period is called the period of Great Fear.\n1789: The Declaration of Rights of the Man\nThe National Assembly adopted the Rights of Man and of the Citizen on August 4, 1789. The charter was based on democratic principles, drawing from philosophical as well as political ideas of Enlightenment thinkers like Jena-Jacques Rosseau.\nThe French constitution was adopted on September 3, 1791. It was moderate in its stance by limiting the powers of the king, but it was not enough for the more radical members of the assembly, Robespierre who wanted Louis XVI to stand trial.\n1793-95: The Reign of Terror\nA group of insurgents attacked the royal residence in Paris and arrested\u00a0 Louis XVI on August 10, 1792\nThe following month many who were accused of being the \u2018enemies of the revolution\u2019 were massacred in Paris. The Legislative Assembly was replaced by the National Convention which proclaimed the establishment of the Republic of France and the abolition of the Monarchy.\nKing Louis XVI was condemned to death on January 21, 1793, and executed for treason. His wife, Marie Antoinette was also executed nine months later.\nThe execution of the king marked the beginning of the most violent and turbulent phase of the French Revolution \u2013 the Reign of Terror.\nThe National Convention was under the control of an extremist faction led by Robespierre. Under him, thousands were executed for suspected treason and counter-revolutionary activities.\nThe Reign of Terror ended after Robespierre\u2019s execution on July 28, 1794.\n1795: The end of the French Revolution\nOn August 22, 1795, the National Convention composed of moderates approved the creation of a new constitution that created France\u2019s bicameral legislature.\nA Directory, a five-member group was formed by the parliament, and an army was groomed under General Napoleon Bonaparte.\nThe Directory became corrupt and the army had more powers with them. A coup d\u2019\u00e9tat was staged by Napoleon himself, toppling them from power.\nNapoleon appointed himself \u201cfirst consul\u201d. The French Revolution was over and the Napoleonic era was about the begin.\nRole of women in the French Revolution:\n\nWomen in the Third Estate worked for a living and didn\u2019t have access to education or training. Only daughters of the noblewomen and richer sections of society had access to any education. The wages for women were lower than those of men. Women were also mostly homemakers, hence they had to do all the housework, care for children.\n\nBut during the Revolution, women played an active role in revolutionary activities. They started their own clubs and newspapers. One of the most famous political clubs was the Society of Revolutionary and Republican Women and they were disappointed by the Constitution of 1791 which designated them, passive citizens. This Society demanded equal political rights as men. They wanted to vote and stand in elections for political office.\n\nAfter the end of the revolution, the early revolutionary governments introduced many laws that improved the lives and status of women in society. Schools were created, and education was made compulsory for all girls. Marriage without consent was made illegal and divorce was made legal. Women were also allowed to be artisans and run small businesses.\n\nImpact of the French Revolution:\n\nThe French revolution brought fundamental social, political, and economic changes in the history of France.\n\nEnd of the social divide: The French Revolution destroyed the social discriminative class system in France and declared equality for all. This led to the rise of the middle class who had acquired education to positions of responsibility.\nDeclaration of rights of man: The constitutional assembly came out with the document of human rights which granted political liberty, like freedom of speech, press, association, worship, and ownership of property.\nRevolutionary ideas: The revolution gave birth to the revolutionary ideas of liberty, equality, and fraternity. These ideas started in France and spread to other areas like Italy, Germany, etc. promoting equality, freedom and democracy, and good governance. France became the birthplace of democracy.\nEnd of Monarchy: The Bourbon monarch that had ruled France for over 400 years came to end by the French revolution. The monarchy rule was abolished in 1792 and replaced it with the Republican form of Government. Although the Bourbon monarch was restored by the great powers after the\u00a0downfall of Napoleon, it could not survive beyond 1830 because the monarchs were already weakened by the changes caused by the French revolution.\nPolitical Parties: France became a multiparty state as a result of the revolution. The freedom of association led to the rise of political clubs such as the Jacobins, Cordeliers, etc that competed for power. These parties kept the government under check and balance by criticizing bad policies.\nParliamentary Democracy: The French revolution led to the revival of the parliament which was abandoned for a period of over 175 years. The revolution gave France a functional parliament with representatives who are democratically elected.\nConstitution and Rule of Law: The French revolution introduced the rule of law. Before 1789, France had no constitution to safeguard people\u2019s rights and freedom. The constitution clearly separated the executive, the judiciary, and the legislature.\nLand ownership: The revolution brought new reforms and changes to land ownership in France. Before the revolution, the land was dominated by the clergy and the nobles who exploited the peasants. The working class was given equal rights to possess the land.\nNational Guard: There was the formation of the National Guard that replaced the royal guard of the Bourbon monarchy. National Guard was the revolutionary army whose role was to protect the achievements of the French revolution.\n\nThe revolution achieved the good through a path of negatives nevertheless. There were losses of lives and properties, the reign of terror saw violence, the economy further declined to make the poor even poorer. The relationship between the church and the state deteriorated as the radical new laws and nationalization of church properties became a sour page.\n\nThe revolution also led to poor relationships between France and other states. Revolutionary ideas of the french revolution were threats to other powers and monarchs in Europe, hence, Britain, Russia, Prussia, Austria, and other countries allied against France in order to prevent the spread of revolutionary ideas to their countries.\n\nAlso read: Bastille Day\n\nGlobal impact of the French Revolution:\n\nThe French Revolution changed modern history forever and many nations took inspiration from the ideologies it gave birth to.\n\nThe suppressive monarchies were being challenged everywhere by the people.\n\nThe ideas of liberty and equality spread all around the world over the years through the French armies.\n\nThe French became the dominant force to be reckoned with as it radicalized the political and social system of the 18th century.\n\nThe French Revolution ended feudalism and made a path for future advances in individual freedoms, democratic principles, and equality of life."

The Tsar or czar was the head of the monarchy along with his wife the Tsarina.\n\nWhat led to the Russian Revolution?\nThe oppressive rule of most 19th-century tsars caused widespread social unrest for decades. Anger over social inequalities and the ruthless treatment of peasants grew.\nThe tsars\u2019 unfair governing sparked many violent reactions like the Army officers revolted in 1825, and hundreds of peasants rioted.\nSecret revolutionary groups formed who plotted to overthrow the government. In 1881, the angry student revolutionaries assassinated the reform-minded tsar, Alexander II.\n\nRussia was heading towards a full-scale revolution.\n\n\ud83d\udc49 Which year are YOU targeting for success in the IAS/IPS/IFS Exam? \ud83d\ude80\n\n(1) \u21d2 UPSC 2025: Prelims cum Mains\n\n(2) \u21d2 UPSC 2026: Prelims cum Mains\n\n(3) \u21d2 UPSC 2027 Prelims cum Mains\n\nTip: Know more about ClearIAS Courses (Online/Offline)\n\nAlso read: Japanese Revolution\n\nRussian Revolution of 1905:\n\nCenturies of unchallenged Russian expansion in Asia ended with an embarrassing defeat in the Russo-Japanese War (1904\u201305). This military defeat broke Russia\u2019s dream of establishing dominance over the whole of Asia, and also contributed to a wave of domestic unrest leading to the Russian revolution of 1905.\n\nDuring this time the industrial revolution also reached Russia doubling the population and workforce in the nation. It started putting a strain on the infrastructure of the cities leading to overcrowding and pollution. The result was a new level of destitution of the urban working class.\n\nThe population boom did not have the food supply to sustain it for a long time, as decades of economic mismanagement and costly wars lead to chronic shortages in the vast country.\n\nBloody Sunday Massacre: In protest of the poor conditions, the working class marched to the winter palace of Tsar Nicholas II. The Russian troops were given orders by the Tsar to not shoot, but the large scale crowd intimidated the troops and they opened fire killing and wounding hundreds of protestors. This came to be called the Bloody Sunday massacre.\n\nThe massacre sparked the Russian revolution of 1905, as angry workers responded with a series of crippling strikes throughout the country. The strikes further threatened Russia\u2019s already fragile economy. Left with no choice, Nicholas II agreed to implement reforms, which would be known as the October manifesto.\n\nThough the autocracy became a constitutional monarchy, the Tsar had the final decision-making power which he misused. He repeatedly kept dismissing the Duma (Russian parliament) to delay reforms.\n\nWorld War I and decline of the Russian empire:\n\nRussia joined its Serbian, French, and British allies against the Central Powers of Austria, Germany, and Ottoman Turkey in August 1914 during World War I.\n\nRussia had not modernized its army even after the defeat in Russo Japanese war, and as a result, the war proved disastrous for Russia. Its casualties were far more than any other nation in the war.\n\nThe Russians were not enthusiastic about the war and the tension grew further when Tsar Nicholas decided to personally command the Eastern front in the war, Tsarina Alexandra was in charge of the governance and her German heritage made her unpopular among the people.\n\nAbove all, she was greatly under the influence of the self-styled \u2018holy man\u2019\u00a0Grigori Rasputin. She dismissed elected officials on his advice and governance fell into disarray along with mounting war causalities.\n\nRasputin was murdered by the nobles in 1916, but people\u2019s resentment against the monarchy was at its peak.\n\nFebruary Revolution (March, according to New style calendar):\n\nThe women textile workers in Petrograd led a citywide strike followed by riots over shortages of bread and fuel. Nearly 200,000 workers swarmed the streets. At first, the soldiers obeyed orders to shoot the rioters but later sided with them. The soldiers fired at their commanding officers and joined the rebellion.\n\nIt forced Tsar Nicholas II to abdicate his throne. A year later revolutionaries executed Nicholas and his family. The Tsarist rule of the Romanovs, which spanned over three centuries, had finally collapsed.\n\nThe leaders of the Duma established a temporary government under Alexander Kerensky, who decided to continue with the war. This decision to continue with the war cost him support from the army as well as civilians. Meanwhile, the Social revolutionaries, competing for power, formed soviets i.e. the local councils which consisted of workers, peasants, and soldiers.\n\nThe political scenario:\n\nVarious revolutionary movements grew in the Russian Society inspired the thoughts of Karl Marx. They had a belief that the industrial class of workers would overthrow the Tsar and then would form a\u00a0dictatorship of the\u00a0proletariat.\n\nIn 1903, the revolutionaries got split into two groups- Mensheviks and Bolsheviks.\n\nMenshevikswanted a broad base of popular support for the revolution.\nBolsheviks\u00a0wanted a small number of committed revolutionaries who could sacrifice everything for a Radical change.\n\nThe leader of the Bolsheviks was Vladimir Lenin. In the early 1900s, Lenin fled to Western Europe to avoid arrest by the Tsarist regime but maintained contact with other Bolsheviks.\n\nOctober Revolution (November, according to New style calendar):\n\nVladimir Lenin returned to Russia and led the communist revolutionaries to launch a coup against Kerensky\u2019s government.\n\nThe new government under Lenin was composed of a council of soldiers, peasants, and workers. The Bolsheviks and their allies occupied key locations across St. Petersburg and Russia as a whole and soon formed a new government with Lenin as its head and renamed themselves as the \u2018communist party\u2019. Lenin became the dictator of the world\u2019s first communist state.\n\nBolshevik government also decided to withdraw from the war.\u00a0 In March 1918 Russia and Germany signed the\u00a0Treaty of Brest-Litovsk in which Russia surrendered a large portion of its territory to Germany and its allies. The humiliating terms of this treaty caused widespread anger and objection to the policies of the Bolsheviks.\n\nThe Civil War (1918-1920):\n\nThe opponents of the Bolsheviks formed the White army and a civil war was waged between them and the Red Army of the Bolsheviks. Several countries of the West including the United States sent military aid and forces to Russia to help the White Army. The civil war and the famine that followed claimed 15 million lives in a three-year struggle.\n\nIn the end, the Red Army of the Bolsheviks won and formed a stronger government and a superstate called the Soviet Union.\n\nReforms by Lenin:\n\nIn March 1921, Lenin launched the New Economic Policy (NEP) in which he\u00a0temporarily put aside his plan for\u00a0a state-controlled economy and resorted to a\u00a0small-scale\u00a0version of capitalism.\n\nThe reforms under the NEP allowed peasants to sell their surplus crops instead of turning them over to the government. Individuals could buy and sell goods for profit.\nThe government kept control of major industries, banks, and means of communication, but it let some small factories, businesses, and farms operate under private ownership.\nLenin also tried to encourage foreign investment.\n\nRussia was a mixture of many nationalities and this was seen as an obstacle to national unity by the Communists. The Communist leaders also saw nationalism as a threat to unity and party loyalty.\n\nTo check nationalism, Lenin organized Russia into several self-governing republics (Soviets) under the central government.\nIn 1922, Russia was named the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics (USSR), in honour of the councils that helped launch the Bolshevik Revolution.\nThe new capital of the union was Moscow.\n\nIn 1924, the Communists created a constitution based on socialist and democratic principles with the Communist Party holding all the power. The new policies and peace that followed helped USSR slowly recover and by 1928, the country\u2019s farms and factories were producing as before World War I. The Soviet Union became a formidable player during the events of the Cold war in the coming decades."

In times of depression, consumer confidence and investments decrease, causing the economy to shut down.\n\nWhat is the difference between a Depression and a Recession?\n\nDepression is different from a recession.\n\nDuring the depression, the real GDP decreased, and not just the rate of GDP growth. This means the production of goods and services in an economy (in a year) will be less than of the previous year.\nBut on the other hand, recession denotes a lowering of the GDP growth rate. Recession as per usual definitions is a negative GDP growth rate for two consecutive quarters.\n\nThere is an old joke among economists that states: A recession is when your neighbor loses his job. Depression is when you lose your job.\n\nAlso read: Bank Run: Cause and Prevention\n\nThe Great Depression (1929-1945)\n\n\ud83d\udc49 Which year are YOU targeting for success in the IAS/IPS/IFS Exam? \ud83d\ude80\n\n(1) \u21d2 UPSC 2025: Prelims cum Mains\n\n(2) \u21d2 UPSC 2026: Prelims cum Mains\n\n(3) \u21d2 UPSC 2027 Prelims cum Mains\n\nTip: Know more about ClearIAS Courses (Online/Offline)\n\nThe depression originated in the U.S., after the fall in stock prices that began around September 4, 1929, and became worldwide news with the stock market crash of October 29, 1929 (known as Black Tuesday).\n\nAmericans view Great Depression of the 1930s among the most defining experiences they ever faced since the American War of Independence and the American Civil War.\n\nHighlights of Great Depression\nAlmost all nations affected except USSR.\nBegan in the USA.\nSpread to Europe.\nBegan on Oct 24,1929 with fall in prices of shares.\nCause of Great Economic Depression\nSpeculation on borrowed money, which led to the collapse of American Share Market.\nRapid selling created further fall.\nFailure of banks to provide credit to agriculture and industries.\nEconomic inactivity due to First World War.\nRemedial Measures by US Presidents:\nHerbert Hoover (1932- US President) \u2013 Reconstruction Finance Corporation.\nFranklin Roosevelt (1932 \u2013 US President) \u2013 New Deal.\nWhat was New Deal?\n\nRelief, Recovery, Reforms.\nTennessee Valley Authority: for construction works.\nFederal Emergency Relief Administration (FERA) : funds for states and local governments.\nFederal Reserve Bank: for providing loans.\nSecurity Exchange Act 1934: license to the stock exchange.\nNational Industrial Recovery Act (NIRA : Raise worker wages, lower working hours.\nAgricultural Adjustment Act (AAA): compensation to farmers, raise agriculture prices.\nCollective bargaining between employer and workers.\nRestriction of work hours.\nFederal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC): to protect depositors\u2019 accounts.\nSecurities and Exchange Commission (SEC): to regulate the U.S. stock markets.\nEffects of New Deal: Combating Great\u00a0Depression\nStrengthened the American Economy.\nRestored Confidence among people.\nIncreased production and thus industrial prosperity.\nBy 1940, there was normal economic activity in the USA.\nWas it the New Deal or the World War II which ended the Great Depression of the 1930s?\nThe New Deal\u00a0expanded the regulatory power of the federal government and the government\u2019s role in the economy.

Germany was divided into four occupation zones controlled by the Allies (the U.S., the UK, France, and the Soviet Union), eventually leading to the creation of West Germany and East Germany.\nRise of the United States and the Soviet Union as Superpowers: The United States and the Soviet Union emerged as the two dominant superpowers in the post-war world, leading to the Cold War. Their ideological conflict between capitalism and communism shaped global politics for the next several decades.\nDecolonization: The war weakened the colonial powers, particularly Britain and France, leading to a wave of decolonization in Asia, Africa, and the Middle East.

The UN played a central role in shaping the post-war international order.\nCold War and Division of Europe: The ideological and political rivalry between the United States and the Soviet Union led to the division of Europe, with Eastern Europe falling under Soviet influence and Western Europe aligning with the United States. This division was symbolized by the Iron Curtain and culminated in the fall of the Berlin Wall (1961-1989).\nHolocaust and Genocide Awareness: The Holocaust, in which six million Jews were murdered by Nazi Germany, highlighted the horrors of genocide. This led to increased global awareness of human rights and the establishment of conventions against genocide and crimes against humanity.\nNuclear Arms Race: The use of atomic bombs by the United States on Hiroshima and Nagasaki in 1945 introduced nuclear weapons to the world, leading to an arms race during the Cold War.

The failure of the early Communist strategy of urban warfare led to the rise of Mao Zedong who advocated guerrilla warfare.\n\nThe Second United Front (1937-1941)\n\nThe Second United Front was the brief alliance between the Chinese Nationalists Party (Kuomintang, or KMT) and Communist Party of China (CPC) to resist the Japanese invasion during the Second Sino-Japanese War, which suspended the Chinese Civil War from 1937 to 1941.\n\nChinese Civil War (1927-1950)\n\nThe Chinese Civil War was fought between forces loyal to the Kuomintang-led government of the Republic of China, and forces loyal to the Communist Party of China (CPC).\n\nThe war began in August 1927, with Chiang Kai-Shek\u2019s Northern Expedition, and essentially ended when major active battles ceased in 1950.\nThe conflict eventually resulted in two de facto states, the Republic of China (ROC) in Taiwan and the People\u2019s Republic of China (PRC) in mainland China, both claiming to be the legitimate government of China.\n\nThe war represented an ideological split between the Communist CPC and the KMT\u2019s brand of Nationalism.\n\nThe civil war continued intermittently until late 1937 when the two parties came together to form the Second United Front to counter a Japanese invasion. China\u2019s full-scale civil war resumed in 1946, a year after the end of hostilities with Japan.\nAfter four more years, 1950 saw the cessation of major military hostilities, with the newly founded People\u2019s Republic of China controlling mainland China (including Hainan), and the Republic of China\u2019s jurisdiction being restricted to Taiwan, Penghu, Quemoy, Matsu, and several outlying islands.\nChinese Communist Revolution (1921-1949)\n\nThe Chinese Communist Revolution or The 1949 Revolution was the culmination of the Chinese Communist Party\u2019s drive to power since its founding in 1921 and the second part of the Chinese Civil War (1946\u20131949). In the official media, this period is known as the War of Liberation.\n\nThe major black marks in China\n\nThe major black marks on the PRC after 1949 are the mass killings that happened during the Cultural Revolution (1966-1976) and the Tiananmen Square Protests.\n\nCultural Revolution (1966-1976)\n\nThe Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, commonly known as the Cultural Revolution, was a social-political movement that took place in the People\u2019s Republic of China from 1966 until 1976.\n\nSet into motion by Mao Zedong, then Chairman of the Communist Party of China, its stated goal was to preserve \u2018true\u2019 Communist ideology in the country by purging remnants of capitalist, and traditional elements from Chinese society, and to re-impose Maoist thought as the dominant ideology within the Party.\nThe Revolution marked the return of Mao Zedong to a position of power after the Great Leap Forward. The movement paralyzed China politically and significantly affected the country economically and socially.\nTiananmen Square protests of 1989\n\nThe Tiananmen Square protests of 1989, commonly known as the June Fourth Incident or \u201989 Democracy Movement were student-led popular demonstrations in Beijing which took place in the spring of 1989 and received broad support from city residents, exposing deep splits within China\u2019s political leadership.\n\nThe protests were forcibly suppressed.\n\nThe crackdown that was initiated on June 3\u20134 became known as the Tiananmen Square Massacre or the June 4 Massacre as troops with assault rifles and tanks inflicted casualties on unarmed civilians trying to block the military\u2019s advance towards Tiananmen Square in the heart of Beijing, which student and other demonstrators had occupied for seven weeks.\n\nModern China\n1949\u20131976: Socialist transformation under Mao Zedong.\n1976\u20131989: Economic reforms under Deng Xiaoping.\n1989\u20132002: Economic growth under the third generation.\n2002\u2013present: Fourth generation reforms.\n\nRead: Ancient civilizations of the world"

The period is sometimes called the Autumn of Nations. There were many revolutions in the period 1989 to 1992, against the existing communist governments in Europe.\n\nAs we discussed in the last post on this section, there were mass protests, many communist governments started to fall in countries like Poland, Hungary, etc (1989). Revolutions in East Germany resulted in the fall of Berlin Wall in 1989 November. Revolutions didn\u2019t end there, they went on disintegrating the mighty USSR (1991).\n\nPoland \u2013 The Solidarity Movement:\n\nThe revolution began in Poland in the 1980s with the emergence of the Solidarity movement, led by Lech Wa\u0142\u0119sa. Solidarity, initially a trade union, evolved into a broad-based political and social movement that called for political reform and workers\u2019 rights.\nIn 1989, negotiations between the Polish government and Solidarity led to the first partially free elections in the Eastern Bloc. Solidarity won a landslide victory, signaling a shift in the political landscape.\n\nHungary \u2013 The Opening of the Iron Curtain:\n\nHungary played a crucial role in the events of 1989. In May 1989, the Hungarian government began dismantling the barbed wire fence on its border with Austria, effectively opening the Iron Curtain.\nThis move allowed East Germans to travel to the West through Hungary, setting in motion a wave of emigration that eventually led to the fall of the Berlin Wall.\n\nEast Germany \u2013 The Fall of the Berlin Wall:\n\nOn November 9, 1989, after weeks of peaceful protests, the East German government announced that its citizens were free to travel to West Germany. This announcement led to a massive celebration at the Berlin Wall.\nThe fall of the Berlin Wall symbolized the end of the division between East and West Germany and became an iconic moment in the Revolution of 1989.\n\nCzechoslovakia \u2013 The Velvet Revolution:\n\nIn Czechoslovakia (now the Czech Republic and Slovakia), the Velvet Revolution unfolded in late 1989. Led by dissident figures like V\u00e1clav Havel, mass protests and strikes forced the communist government to resign.\nHavel became the country\u2019s first post-communist president, and Czechoslovakia transitioned to democracy.\n\nBulgaria, Romania, and Other Countries:\n\nBulgaria and Romania also experienced anti-communist protests and changes in leadership during 1989. In Romania, the revolution turned violent, resulting in the overthrow of dictator Nicolae Ceau\u0219escu.\nOther countries in the region, such as East Germany, Poland, and Hungary, underwent rapid political transformations, transitioning from communist rule to democratic governance.\n\nImpact on the Cold War:\n\nThe events of 1989 had a profound impact on the global stage. The end of communist rule in Eastern Europe signaled the weakening of the Soviet Union\u2019s influence in the region and marked the beginning of the end of the Cold War.\n\nReunification of Germany:\n\nThe reunification of Germany on October 3, 1990, was a significant outcome of the Revolution of 1989. East and West Germany officially became a single nation again, ending decades of division.\nAnti-communist sentiments\n\nEconomic inefficiency and stagnation plagued many communist countries. Centralized planning, state ownership of industries, and lack of incentives for innovation led to economic problems, including shortages, low productivity, and a declining standard of living for citizens.\n\nAnti-communist movements in the period 1989-1992 in many nations \u2013 Poland, Bulgaria, Czechoslovakia, Hungary, Romania, Russia, and even China \u2013 toppled many of the authoritarian regimes in Europe, establishing capitalist, liberal democracies.\n\nMost of the mass movements were non-violent. Romania was an exemption. The anti-communist movements gained success in most countries, but it was suppressed in China.\n\nFall of Communism-Events\n\nPeaceful transfer of power to non-Communist governments in Poland, Hungary, East Germany, Czechoslovakia, Bulgaria, and Albania.\nGerman reunification: East Germany with West Germany.\nViolent transfer of power to a non-Communist government in Romania.\nThe breakup of the Soviet Union.\nEnd of the Soviet Union as a superpower.\nFormation of the Russian Federation.\nBreakup of Czechoslovakia:\u00a0\u00a0Czech Republic and Slovakia.\nBreakup of Yugoslavia:\u00a0Bosnia and Herzegovina, Croatia, Macedonia, Slovenia, Serbia and Montenegro.\nViolent suppression of the Chinese democracy movement:\u00a0Tiananmen Square protests of 1989.\nDissolution of the Warsaw Pact.\nAll Soviet military troops withdrew from Afghanistan.\nIntensification of the process of European integration.\nSkepticism about Communism all over the world is associated with decreasing support for communist parties, especially in Europe.\nChanges in dozens of other countries, especially involving the rise of consumerism.\nYemeni reunification.\nNew states were created from the former Soviet Union.\nThe collapse of Communism in Mongolia, Ethiopia, and Yemen.\nVietnamese occupation of Cambodia ends.\nEnd of the Cold War.\nThe spread of American culture and capitalism to previously sealed-off Communist countries.\nIntegration of most former Warsaw Pact members into NATO.\nUnited States sphere of influence grows.\nNew World Order.\nSpread of electoral democracy.\nCommunism: Current Scenario\n\nThough there are few Communist party representations in ruling coalitions in democratic countries, at present there are only five countries, where the communist party rules the state.\n\nChina.\nVietnam.\nLaos.\nCuba.\nNorth Korea.\n\nPS: Apart from North Korea, and to an extent in Cuba, all the present communist nations initiated market reforms under their single-party communist rule.\n\nQuestions for UPSC Mains\nQn: The \u2018Autumn of Nations\u2019 achieved what the \u2018Springtime of Nations\u2019 couldn\u2019t achieve.

They were a series of republican revolts against European monarchies in France, Germany, Italy, and the Austrian Empire. They all ended in failure and repression, and were followed by widespread disillusionment among liberals.)\nQn: Even though the revolutions of 1989 toppled many communist regimes it was not successful in China.

Fall of the Berlin Wall (1989) is a major event in European History. The policies of restructuring and openness initiated by Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev paved way for the destruction\u00a0of the symbolic physical barrier. Within two years, the mighty USSR too disintegrated. As\u00a09th November, 2014 is the 25th anniversary of the fall of the Berlin Wall (1989), let\u2019s analyse some of the questions related to this\u00a0topic, connecting current affairs.\n\nTable of Contents\n\nBerlin Wall: a symbol of division between East and the West\nWhy Berlin Wall?\nEvents which led to the Fall of Berlin\nConsequences of the Fall of Berlin\nWas it all smooth and well under the market economy?\nDiscrimination towards Eastern Europe countries\nPresent situation in Europe: Euro-skepticism and rise of nationalism\nSignificance of NATO after the disintegration of USSR\nBerlin Wall: a symbol of division between East and the West\n\nBerlin Wall not only represented division between West Germany and East Germany, but also division between the East and the West as a whole.\nWest = Democratic Capitalist Countries.\nEast = Communist Regime.\nAlso, that was the period of Cold War.\nWhy Berlin Wall?\n\nThe Berlin Wall was officially referred to as the \u201cAnti-Fascist Protection Rampart\u201d by GDR authorities, implying that the NATO countries and West Germany in particular were \u201cfascists.\u201d The West Berlin city government sometimes referred to it as the \u201cWall of Shame\u201d while condemning the Wall\u2019s restriction on freedom of movement.\n\nEvents which led to the Fall of Berlin\n\nThe changes started in the mid-\u201980s when Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev started his policies of glasnost (openness) and perestroika (restructuring). This took away the threat of Soviet intervention in other socialist countries.\nThe Polish communist regime was the first to collapse when it signed an agreement with the Solidarity movement and paved the way for free elections. By June 1989, the Polish people had elected their first non-communist head of government.\nNext was Hungary, where soldiers dismantled barbed wire and fencing along its borders with Austria. Hundreds of East Germans went to Hungary on a holiday and crossed over to Austria.\nIn August, two million people in the Baltic republics of Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania formed a human chain against the Soviet rule.\nIn October, during his visit to East Berlin, Gorbachev advised East German leader not to delay reforms. After days of mass protests, the East German government on November 9th declared that citizens were free to go the West.\nThis led to thousand of East Germans moving into the West, and literally tearing off the wall.\nConsequences of the Fall of Berlin\n\nFall of Berlin\u00a0led to further changes in other socialist countries, the unification of Germany, and finally the collapse of Soviet Union itself in 1991.\nMarked the end of Soviet supported authoritarian regimes in Eastern Europe.\nImmediately after these changes about 30 countries in the former Soviet Union and Central-Eastern Europe started their political and economic transition towards democracy and market economy.\nLiberal, capitalist and democratic system emerged as the major doctrine across the world.\nSome of these countries have become members of Western institutions and organizations like the European Union (EU), North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) and Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD).\nIn most of these countries, citizens enjoy higher living standards and broader political and personal rights.\nThe majority of citizens in the former socialist countries do not want to go back to earlier economic and political system.\nWas it all smooth and well under the market economy?\nWhile it was better governance and standard of life of many countries, for some others like the former Soviet Union and Yugoslavia, the process has been much more difficult as these changes also led to a break up of old nations into many new independent countries.\nThe civil war in former Yugoslavia and Tajikistan in the 1990s and the current crisis in Ukraine shows that the process of change which started through peaceful revolutions in 1989 has not been truly peaceful.\nMoreover, a large number of vulnerable people in many of these countries also faced serious economic difficulties due to a steady decline of state support and subsidies.\nThere are still significant differences between East and West Europe, even between East and West Germany.\nDiscrimination towards Eastern Europe countries\nThe 1989 vision of partnering prosperous Europe didn\u2019t realize all on a sudden. Economic decline throughout Eastern Europe in the 1990s and then long delays in getting the EU membership created tensions.\nMany Eastern Europeans thought that they will become members of the EU within a few years. The first group of countries was admitted to the EU only in 2004, almost 15 years of after the fall of Berlin wall.\nA few others like Bulgaria, Romania and Croatia joined later in 2006 and 2013 respectively.\nCountries like Albania and Serbia are still waiting.\nPresent situation in Europe: Euro-skepticism and rise of nationalism\n\nWhen many countries joined the EU, they also committed to join the single currency whenever they are ready and fulfilled convergence criteria of low inflation, low interest rates, low fiscal deficit and stable exchange rate. A few smaller countries viz. Estonia, Latvia, Slovenia and Slovakia have even joined the Eurozone. However, crisis in some of the Eurozone countries in the last few years have made many others skeptical. When the EU itself is facing one of the biggest crises since its inception, the earlier assumption that deepening integration with the EU institutions would automatically mean rising living standards and social security may no longer be valid easily. Euro-Skepticism, once a British decease has now entered even in some former socialist countries. Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orban argues, however, that his country \u201cis not Euro-Skeptic But \u201cEuro-Realistic.\u201d There is a talk of authoritarianism in a country which used to practice liberal \u201cgoulash socialism\u201d even during the Soviet period. Moreover, nationalism is on the rise in many parts of Europe. Across the continent, nationalist parties or movements gaining ground in recent years.\n\nSignificance of NATO after the disintegration of USSR\n\nThe fall of the Berlin wall also coincided with the collapse of the USSR and end of the Cold War. Even in changed circumstances, NATO did not disappear. It found new justifications and adapted itself to new challenges. Many old Warsaw Pact countries also became its members.\n\n\ud83d\udc49 Which year are YOU targeting for success in the IAS/IPS/IFS Exam? \ud83d\ude80\n\n(1) \u21d2 UPSC 2025: Prelims cum Mains\n\n(2) \u21d2 UPSC 2026: Prelims cum Mains\n\n(3) \u21d2 UPSC 2027 Prelims cum Mains\n\nTip: Know more about ClearIAS Courses (Online/Offline)\n\nBut now when old super powers the US and Russia are threatening each other again, NATO has found a renewed sense of purpose. At the recent NATO summit in September, it declared that \u201cRussia\u2019s aggressive actions against Ukraine have fundamentally challenged our vision of a Europe whole, free, and at peace.\u201d It also declared that the NATO \u201cremains an essential source of stability in this unpredictable world\u201d. So even 25 years after communism\u2019s fall, NATO is still active even in European security.\n\nReference:\n\nIDSA \u2013 Fall of the Berlin Wall: Marking 25 years by Gulshan Sachdeva\nWikipedia"

Without the right intervention from USSR at the right time, communist governments in the second world collapsed one after the other.\nThe fall of Berlin Wall: Germany was divided after the second world war \u2013 among the socialist USSR and the capitalist western regimes. The fall of Berlin led to a series of events including the disintegration of the USSR.\nEconomic and political reforms in USSR : Gorbachev identified the economic and political problems of USSR, and started a series of reforms, with the intention to revive economy. This was a deviation from the communist policies, and was more closely associated with the market economy.\u00a0Many communist leaders in USSR opposed reforms\u00a0initiated\u00a0by Gorbachev. \u00a0They encouraged a coup in 1991.\nCoup: The coup of 1991.\nOpposition against the coup : Boris Yelsin who won popular election in Russian Republic, protested against the coup and central control of USSR.

Was it the ambition of republics inside which led to the disintegration of Soviet Union?\n\n1.Economic Weakness\n\nThe weakness of the economy was the major cause of dissatisfaction among the people in USSR. There was sever shortage of consumer items. The reason for economics weakness were the following.\n\nHuge military spending.\nMaintenance of satellite states in Easter Europe.\nMaintenance of the Central Asian Republics within the USSR.\n2. Political Un-accountability\n\nThe communist party regime (single party rule) for around 70 years turned authoritarian. There was widespread corruption, nepotism and lack of transparency.\u00a0Gorbachev\u2019s decision to allow elections with a multi-party system and create a presidency for the Soviet Union began a slow process of democratization that eventually destabilized Communist control and contributed to the collapse of the Soviet Union.\n\n3. Gorbachev\u2019s reforms\n\nOnce people started to enjoy freedom under Micheal Gorbachev\u2019s reforms, they demanded more. The demand grew into a big force which turned difficult to control. The people wanted to catch up with the west quickly.\n\n4. Rise of nationalism\n\nThe rise of nationalism among countries like Russia, Baltic republics (Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania), Ukraine, Georgia etc. is the most important and immediate cause of the disintegration of the USSR. The national feeling was strong among the more prosperous areas in the USSR and not in Central Asian republics.

This decision had a profound impact on the spread of Christianity in Europe and beyond.\nAncient Mesoamerica (Eg: The Maya Civilization)\n\nParts of today\u2019s Mexico and Central America were once home to several Indigenous cultures, beginning with the Olmec around 1200 BCE., followed by the Zapotec, Maya, Toltec, and, ultimately, the Aztecs.\n\nPyramid-style temples, intricate pottery, stone monuments, turquoise jewelry, and other fine arts have been uncovered.\nScholars believe the Zapotec developed Mesoamerica\u2019s first written calendar and writing system, while the Mayans are noted for their advancements in mathematics, hieroglyphics, architecture, and astronomy.\nThe nomadic Aztecs founded Tenochtitlan (today\u2019s Mexico City) in 1325 on small islands in Lake Texcoco, and the city became a booming trade market.\nThe Aztecs used a 365-solar calendar along with a 260-day ritual calendar, practiced human sacrifice and bloodletting, used a form of picture writing, and created works of art with terracotta, feathers, mosaics, and stone.\nThe Hern\u00e1n Cort\u00e9z-led 1519 Spanish invasion, aided by Mesoamerican foes of the Aztecs, brought the Aztec civilization to an end by 1521.\n\nThe Maya Civilization\n\nThe Mayans were spread across southeastern Mexico, Guatemala, Belize, and parts of Honduras and El Salvador.\n\nPeriod: Circa 2000 BCE to 1500 CE.\n\nThe Mayans were notable for their hieroglyphic script, the only known fully developed writing system in the pre-Columbian Americas, as well as for their art, architecture, mathematical, and astronomical systems.\n\nPreclassic Period (c. 2000 BCE to 250 CE): The Maya began as agricultural communities, with the formation of early settlements and the development of their distinctive culture.\nClassic Period (c. 250 CE to 900 CE): Marked by the peak of their culture, the Maya built great cities, made significant advancements in mathematics and astronomy, and developed a complex social and political order.\nPostclassic Period (c. 900 CE to 1500s CE): Characterized by the decline of the great lowland cities and the rise of power in the northern Yucat\u00e1n Peninsula, until the arrival of the Spanish conquistadors.\nThe Maya script is a sophisticated combination of phonetic symbols and logograms, enabling them to record historical events, astronomical observations, and rituals.\nThey developed a vigesimal (base-20) numeral system, which included the concept of zero\u2014an innovation not present in many contemporary cultures.\nTheir understanding of astronomy was highly advanced, reflected in the accuracy of their calendars. The Maya calendar included the Tzolk\u2019in (a 260-day ritual calendar), the Haab\u2019 (a 365-day solar calendar), and the Long Count calendar, which could track vast expanses of time.\nThe Maya built impressive cities like Tikal, Cop\u00e1n, Palenque, and Chichen Itza, featuring grand pyramids, palaces, plazas, and ball courts. Their architectural skills were also evident in their sophisticated water management systems, including reservoirs and aqueducts.\nThe Inca Empire\n\nThe Incas were centered in modern-day Peru, extending into Ecuador, Bolivia, Chile, and Argentina.\n\nPeriod: Early 13th century to 1532 CE.\n\nThe Inca Empire, also known as Tawantinsuyu, was the largest in pre-Columbian America.\n\nIt emerged in the early 13th century from the highlands of Peru and, at its peak, extended across western South America, including large parts of modern Ecuador, Peru, Bolivia, Argentina, and Chile.\nThe Inca civilization is renowned for its unique social structure, innovative agricultural techniques, and impressive architectural achievements, such as Machu Picchu.\nThe empire was ruled by the Sapa Inca, considered both a political leader and a divine figure.\nThe empire was divided into four provinces (suyus), each governed from a regional capital. Cusco, the capital, was at the center. The empire was highly organized, with a complex system of roads and communication networks.\nThe Incas implemented a labor tax system called mit\u2019a, requiring subjects to contribute labor to state and religious projects, including the construction of roads, temples, and agricultural terraces.\nThe Incas used a unique system of knotted strings known as quipu for keeping records and communication. This system was vital for managing the empire\u2019s economy and administration.\nThe Inca Empire fell to Spanish conquistadors led by Francisco Pizarro in the 16th century.\nThe conquest was facilitated by internal strife within the Inca Empire, including a civil war between the brothers Atahualpa and Hu\u00e1scar, as well as diseases brought by Europeans.\nConclusion\n\nThese ancient civilizations, among others, have profoundly influenced human history, laying the groundwork for societal development and cross-cultural exchanges that have shaped the modern world.\n\nTheir achievements in governance, science, art, and philosophy continue to be studied and admired to this day.\n\nFor more world history notes click here.\n\n-Article by Swathi Satish"

According to the biblical narrative, Moses received the Ten Commandments and other laws from God on Mount Sinai.\nThis event is central to the formation of the Jewish identity and the establishment of a covenant between God and the Israelites.\n\nThe Israelites transitioned from a confederation of tribes to a monarchy under King Saul, David, and Solomon. Solomon built the First Temple in Jerusalem, becoming the center of Jewish worship. However, the kingdom eventually split into the northern kingdom of Israel and the southern kingdom of Judah.\n\nIn 586 BCE, the Babylonians, under King Nebuchadnezzar, destroyed the First Temple and took many Jews into exile in Babylon. This period is known as the Babylonian Exile, and it had a profound impact on Jewish identity, fostering a sense of unity and a commitment to the covenant.\n\nAfter the Persian king Cyrus (A follower of Zoroastrianism) conquered Babylon, he allowed the Jews to return to their homeland. The Second Temple was built in Jerusalem, marking a period of reconstruction and re-establishment of Jewish religious practices.\n\nHellenistic and Roman Periods\n\nDuring the Hellenistic period, Alexander the Great\u2019s conquests spread Greek influence throughout the region. Later, the Roman Empire exerted control over Judea.\n\nThe Second Temple was eventually destroyed by the Romans in 70 CE, leading to a period of dispersion and the beginning of the Jewish Diaspora.\nThe Jewish people were scattered throughout the Roman Empire and beyond, forming communities in various regions. The Diaspora led to the development of different cultural and religious traditions among Jews in different locations.\nPersecution in the Middle Ages\n\nDuring the Middle Ages, Jews lived in various Islamic and Christian societies, facing periods of relative tolerance and persecution. Jewish communities contributed significantly to science, philosophy, and commerce during this time.\n\nIn medieval and early modern Europe, Jews faced expulsion from various countries, and the Inquisition targeted those who converted to Christianity but were suspected of secretly practicing Judaism.\n\nThroughout history, Jewish people have been persecuted for their religious beliefs. Some well-known events include:\n\n1066 Granada Massacre: On December 30, 1066, a Muslim mob stormed the royal palace in Granada and killed more than 1,000 Jewish families. The group also kidnapped and crucified Joseph ibn Naghrela, the Jewish vizier to the Berber king.\nThe First Crusade: In the first of the Crusades, a series of medieval holy wars involving Christians and Muslims, thousands of Jews were killed, and many were forced to convert to Christianity.\nThe Spanish Expulsion: In 1492, Spain\u2019s rulers issued a royal edict that declared all Jews who refused to convert to Christianity would be expelled from the country. Experts estimate about 200,000 people were ousted and tens of thousands died while trying to reach safety.\nThe Holocaust: In the Holocaust, the most infamous of modern-day atrocities, the Nazis murdered more than 6 million Jews.\n\nThe Enlightenment brought about ideas of religious tolerance and the emancipation of Jews in many European countries. Jews began to achieve greater integration into society, contributing to various fields.\n\nZionism and the State of Israel\n\nIn the late 19th and early 20th centuries, the Zionist movement emerged, advocating for the establishment of a Jewish homeland. In 1948, the State of Israel was established, marking a significant event in Jewish history.\n\nThe Zionist movement is often associated with Theodor Herzl, an Austro-Hungarian journalist who is considered the father of modern political Zionism.\nHerzl\u2019s influential book, \u201cDer Judenstaat\u201d (The Jewish State), published in 1896, argued for the creation of a national homeland for the Jewish people.\n\nBalfour Declaration (1917): During World War I, the Zionist movement gained international recognition with the issuance of the Balfour Declaration in 1917. In this statement, British Foreign Secretary Arthur Balfour expressed support for the establishment of a \u201cnational home for the Jewish people\u201d in Palestine. After the war, the League of Nations granted Britain the mandate to administer Palestine.\n\nJewish Immigration and Arab Opposition: Jewish immigration to Palestine increased during the mandate period, leading to tensions with the Arab population. The conflicting national aspirations of Jews and Arabs in the region contributed to ongoing hostilities.\n\nUnited Nations Partition Plan (1947): After World War II and the Holocaust, international sympathy for the Zionist cause grew. The United Nations proposed a partition plan in 1947, recommending the establishment of separate Jewish and Arab states in Palestine. The Jewish leadership accepted the plan, but the Arab leadership rejected it.\n\nEstablishment of the State of Israel (1948): On May 14, 1948, David Ben-Gurion, the head of the Jewish Agency, declared the establishment of the State of Israel. This declaration marked the fulfillment of the Zionist movement\u2019s primary objective. The declaration triggered the Arab-Israeli War, as neighboring Arab states opposed the establishment of Israel.\n\nThe newly established state faced immediate challenges, including military conflicts with neighboring Arab states, waves of Jewish immigration, and the absorption of Holocaust survivors. The influx of Jewish immigrants significantly shaped the demographic makeup of Israel.\n\nRead: Israel-Palestine Conflict\n\nJudaism in India\n\nThe presence of Jews in India dates back to ancient times, and their history is marked by a rich tapestry of cultural, religious, and economic interactions.\n\nThere are primarily two distinct Jewish communities in India: the Bene Israel and the Baghdadi Jews.\n\nBene Israel: The Bene Israel is believed to be one of the oldest Jewish communities in India. According to their tradition, they are descendants of Jews who shipwrecked off the Konkan coast of western India over two thousand years ago. Over the centuries, the Bene Israel developed a unique blend of Jewish customs with local Indian traditions. Their historical presence is notable in cities like Mumbai, Pune, and Ahmedabad.\n\nIn the 18th and 19th centuries, the Bene Israel community attracted the attention of the Baghdadi Jews, who played a role in connecting them with the broader Jewish world. The Bene Israel community has contributed significantly to Indian society in various fields, including education, medicine, and the armed forces.\n\nBaghdadi Jews: The Baghdadi Jews arrived in India during the 19th century, particularly in the cities of Mumbai and Kolkata. They were primarily involved in trade and commerce and left a visible mark on the economic landscape of these cities. Prominent Baghdadi Jewish families, such as the Sassoons and Kadoories, played key roles in business and philanthropy.\n\nThe Magen David Synagogue in Kolkata and the Keneseth Eliyahoo Synagogue in Mumbai are examples of synagogues built by the Baghdadi Jewish community, showcasing their cultural and religious heritage.\n\nCochin Jews: There is also a historic Jewish community in the southern Indian state of Kerala known as the Cochin Jews. They have a unique history, with roots tracing back to ancient times. The Paradesi Synagogue in Kochi is one of the oldest existing synagogues in India, reflecting the presence of the Cochin Jewish community.\n\nOver the years, the Jewish communities in India have dwindled in size due to migration, interfaith marriages, and other factors. However, India has generally been a hospitable place for Jews, and they have lived in relative harmony with their neighbors, contributing to the diverse cultural fabric of the country.\n\nThe Indian government has been supportive of preserving Jewish heritage, and there are efforts to maintain and restore synagogues and other historical sites associated with the Jewish community.\n\nAdditionally, India has diplomatic relations with Israel, and there is a small but active Jewish community in the country today.\n\nBeliefs of Judaism\n\nJewish people worship in holy places known as synagogues, and their spiritual leaders are called rabbis. The six-pointed Star of David is the symbol of Judaism.\n\nThe Jewish sacred text is called the Tanakh or the \u201cHebrew Bible.\u201d It includes the same books as the Old Testament in the Christian Bible, but they\u2019re placed in a slightly different order.\n\nThe Torah, the first five books of the Tanakh, outlines laws for Jews to follow. It\u2019s sometimes also referred to as the Pentateuch.\n\nJewish people observe several important days and events in history, such as:\n\nYom Kippur: This \u201cDay of Atonement\u201d is considered the holiest day of the year for Jews who typically spend it fasting and praying. It also falls during September or October.\nHanukkah: This Jewish celebration, also known as the \u201cFestival of Lights,\u201d lasts eight days during late November or December. Hanukkah commemorates the rededication of the Jewish Temple in Jerusalem after the Maccabees defeated the Syrian Greeks over 2,000 years ago.\nConclusion\n\nThe Zionist movement played a pivotal role in the establishment of the State of Israel, reshaping the geopolitical landscape of the Middle East and providing a national homeland for the Jewish people. The movement remains a complex and debated topic, encompassing various ideologies and perspectives within Israel and the broader Jewish community.\n\nJudaism continues to evolve and adapt to changing historical, cultural, and social contexts, with its rich history shaping the beliefs and practices of Jewish communities worldwide.\n\n-Article by Swathi Satish"

            "[CONTENT]": "Zoroastrianism has a long history, and its presence in India dates back over a millennium. The followers of Zoroastrianism are known as Zoroastrians or Parsis. Here is a brief overview of the history of Zoroastrianism in India.\n\nZoroastrianism originated in ancient Persia (modern-day Iran) in the 6th or 7th century BCE, founded by the prophet Zoroaster (or Zarathustra).\n\nAround the 8th century CE, due to various reasons such as the Arab-Muslim conquest of Persia and the ensuing persecution of non-Muslims, a group of Zoroastrians migrated to the Indian subcontinent.\n\nIt is arguably the world\u2019s first monotheistic faith, it\u2019s one of the oldest religions still in existence. Zoroastrianism was the state religion of three Persian dynasties.\n\nZoroastrianism now has an estimated 100,000 to 200,000 worshipers worldwide and is practiced today as a minority religion in parts of Iran and India.\n\nTable of Contents\n\nOrigin of Zoroastrianism\nSpread of Zoroastrianism\nDecline and Islamization\nSurvival in India\nZoroastrian Symbols and beliefs\nConclusion\nOrigin of Zoroastrianism\n\nZoroaster is traditionally believed to have lived around the 6th or 7th century BCE, though the dating is not entirely precise. His life is shrouded in some mystery, and there are debates among scholars about the exact historical period in which he lived.\n\n\ud83d\udc49 Which year are YOU targeting for success in the IAS/IPS/IFS Exam? \ud83d\ude80\n\n(1) \u21d2 UPSC 2025: Prelims cum Mains\n\n(2) \u21d2 UPSC 2026: Prelims cum Mains\n\n(3) \u21d2 UPSC 2027 Prelims cum Mains\n\nTip: Know more about ClearIAS Courses (Online/Offline)\n\nAccording to tradition, Zoroaster received revelations from the divine entity Ahura Mazda, who is considered the supreme god in Zoroastrianism.\n\nSome scholars believe he was a contemporary of Cyrus the Great, a king of the Persian Empire in the sixth century BCE, though most linguistic and archaeological evidence points to an earlier date sometime between 1500 and 1200 BCE.\n\nZoroaster\u2019s teachings, hymns, and prayers were compiled into a collection known as the Gathas, which are part of the larger holy scripture called the Avesta. The Avesta consists of hymns, rituals, and philosophical discussions that form the foundation of Zoroastrian beliefs.\n\nCentral to Zoroastrianism is the belief in Ahura Mazda as the supreme and benevolent deity.\n\nZoroastrianism also introduces the concept of dualism, with Ahura Mazda representing the force of good and Angra Mainyu (Ahriman) as the force of evil. The struggle between these two forces is a key aspect of Zoroastrian cosmology.\nSpread of Zoroastrianism\n\nZoroastrianism shaped one of the ancient world\u2019s largest empires mighty Persian Empire. It was the state religion of three major Persian dynasties.\n\nZoroastrianism became the official religion of the Persian Empire under the Achaemenid dynasty (6th to 4th centuries BCE) through the efforts of rulers like Cyrus the Great and Darius I.\nThe religion continued to flourish under subsequent Persian empires, including the Parthian and Sassanian dynasties.\n\nThe Achaemenid Persian Empire\u2019s founder, Cyrus the Great, was a devoted Zoroastrian.\n\nAccording to most accounts, Cyrus was a liberal king who permitted his subjects who were not Persians to follow their faiths.\nHe did not force Zoroastrianism on the inhabitants of Persia\u2019s acquired lands; instead, he governed according to the Zoroastrian code of asha (truth and justice).\n\nThe Silk Road, a network of trade routes that extended from China to the Middle East and into Europe, is credited for spreading Zoroastrian ideas throughout Asia.\n\nThe Jewish population of Babylonia, where inhabitants from the Kingdom of Judea had been held captive for decades, may have been the first to adopt Zoroastrian ideas, such as the concept of a single deity, heaven, hell, and a day of judgment.\n\nCyrus freed the Babylonian Jews upon his conquest of Babylon in 539 BCE. Numerous of them went back to Jerusalem, where their progeny contributed to the composition of the Hebrew Bible.\n\nZoroastrianism would rule over two more Persian dynasties, the Parthian and Sassanian Empires, throughout the ensuing millennia, until the Muslim invasion of Persia in the seventh century CE.\n\nSome academics contend that Zoroastrian principles, influenced by the Persian Empire, influenced the development of the main Abrahamic religions, including Judaism, Christianity, and Islam.\n\nDecline and Islamization\n\nWith the Arab-Muslim conquest of Persia in the 7th century CE, Zoroastrianism began to decline in its place of origin. Many Zoroastrians faced persecution, and the religion lost its status as the state religion.\n\nThe Muslim conquest of Persia between 633 and 651 CE led to the fall of the Sassanian Persian Empire and the decline of the Zoroastrian religion in Iran.\nThe Arab invaders charged Zoroastrians living in Persia taxes for retaining their religious practices and implemented laws to make life difficult for them. Over time, most Iranian Zoroastrians converted to Islam.\n\nHowever, a significant number of Zoroastrians sought refuge in regions like Gujarat in western India, where they continued to practice their faith.\n\nSurvival in India\n\nThe migration of Zoroastrians to India played a crucial role in the survival and continuation of Zoroastrianism. The community that settled in India became known as the Parsis.\n\nAccording to Parsi tradition, a group of Iranian Zoroastrians emigrated from Persia to escape religious persecution by the Muslim majority after the Arab conquest.\nExperts speculate that the group sailed across the Arabian Sea and landed in Gujarat, a state in western India, sometime between 785 and 936.\n\nThe majority of Zoroastrians who migrated to India settled in the western state of Gujarat. They arrived on the shores of Gujarat in the 8th and 10th centuries, seeking refuge from religious persecution.\n\nThe town of Sanjan is traditionally believed to be the first settlement of Zoroastrians in India.\n\nOver the centuries, Zoroastrians in India, known as Parsis, integrated into Indian society while maintaining their distinct identity. They contributed significantly to trade, industry, and philanthropy in India.\n\nZoroastrians worship in fire temples, and several such temples were constructed in India. The fire in these temples is considered sacred and represents the divine presence. The most famous fire temple in India is the Iranshah Atash Behram in Udvada, Gujarat.\n\nParsis have made notable contributions to various fields in India, including business, education, science, and the arts. Prominent Parsi figures like Jamsetji Tata, the founder of the Tata Group, and Dadabhai Naoroji, the first Asian to be elected to the British Parliament, Bhikaiji Cama played significant roles in shaping India\u2019s development.\n\nZoroastrian Symbols and beliefs\n\nThe Faravahar is an ancient symbol of the Zoroastrian faith. It depicts a bearded man with one hand reaching forward. He stands above a pair of wings that are\u00a0outstretched from a circle representing eternity.\n\nFire is another important symbol of Zoroastrianism, as it represents light, and warmth and has purifying powers. Some Zoroastrians also recognize the evergreen cypress tree as a symbol of eternal life.\n\nFire along with water are seen as symbols of purity in Zoroastrian religion.\n\nZoroastrian places of worship are sometimes called fire temples. Each fire temple contains an altar with an eternal flame that burns continuously and is never extinguished.\n\nAccording to legend, three ancient Zoroastrian fire temples, known as the great fires, were said to have come directly from the Zoroastrian god, Ahura Mazda, at the beginning of time.\n\nZoroastrians gave their dead \u201csky burials.\u201d They built circular, flat-topped towers called dakhmas, or towers of silence. Their corpses were exposed to the elements and local vultures until the bones were picked clean and bleached. Then they were collected and placed in lime pits called ossuaries.\n\nDakhmas have been illegal in Iran since the 1970s. Many Zoroastrians today bury their dead beneath concrete slabs, though some Parsi in India still practice sky burials. A dakhma remains in operation near Mumbai, India, for example.\nConclusion\n\nDespite their contributions, the Parsi community in India has faced challenges, including a declining population. Factors such as low birth rates, inter-community marriages, and emigration have contributed to a decrease in the Parsi population.\n\nEfforts have been made within the community to address the declining population, including initiatives to encourage marriage and family planning. Additionally, there are ongoing endeavors to preserve Zoroastrian heritage, traditions, and religious practices.\n\nZoroastrianism in India continues to be a vibrant community with a rich cultural and historical legacy. While the population may be small, the Parsis have left an indelible mark on the social, economic, and cultural landscape of India.\n\n-Article by Swathi Satish"

On July 16, 1945, he was present at the Trinity test of the first atomic bomb.\nIn August 1945, the weapons (Little Boy and Fat Man) were used in the bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki in Japan, which remain the only use of nuclear weapons in an armed conflict.\n\nOppenheimer assumed leadership of the important General Advisory Committee of the recently established United States Atomic Energy Commission in 1947 while serving as the head of the Princeton, New Jersey-based Institute for Advanced Study.\n\nTo stop nuclear proliferation and a nuclear weapons race with the Soviet Union, he advocated for global nuclear power regulation.\n\nDuring a 1949\u20131950 federal discussion on the subject, he was opposed to the creation of the hydrogen bomb.\n\nSubsequently, he adopted stances on defense-related matters that infuriated several U.S. government and military groups.\n\nAfter World War II, Oppenheimer faced scrutiny during the \u201cRed Scare\u201d era due to his left-leaning political affiliations and past associations with communists.\n\nHe was subjected to a security clearance hearing in 1954 and was eventually stripped of his security clearance.\n\nThis action effectively ended his government career and led to his exclusion from further nuclear research and policymaking.\n\nLater life\n\nDespite the controversies and setbacks, Oppenheimer continued to contribute to physics, teaching at the Institute for Advanced Study in Princeton, New Jersey.\n\nHe was a chain smoker and was diagnosed with throat cancer in 1965.\n\nHe remained a respected figure in the scientific community until his death on February 18, 1967.\n\nAlso read: Weapons of Mass Destruction\n\nLegacy of Robert Oppenheimer\n\nOppenheimer was a brilliant physicist, and his interests ranged from nuclear physics to quantum thermodynamics.\n\nHe has made significant contributions to various scientific theories like Oppenheimer-Phillips theory, Born-Oppenheimer approximation, and so on.\n\nDuring the Trinity explosions, Oppenheimer mentioned that he was thinking of verses from the Bhagavat Gita, famously quoted by him \u201cI become death, the destroyer of the worlds.\u201d\n\nAfter the bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki, the Manhattan Project\u2019s top-secret nature came to light, and Oppenheimer rose to prominence as a national spokesperson for science and a symbol of a new kind of technocratic authority.\n\nRobert Oppenheimer was more concerned about the threat that scientific advancements may bring to humanity.\n\nAlong with other illustrious scholars and scientists, he founded what would ultimately become the World Academy of Art and Science in 1960. These individuals included Albert Einstein, Bertrand Russell, Joseph Rotblat, and others.\nNotably, following his public humiliation, he refused to sign the most important open protests against nuclear weapons in the 1950s, such as the Russell-Einstein Manifesto of 1955, and he also declined an invitation to the inaugural Pugwash Conferences on Science and World Affairs in 1957 despite being invited.\n\nIn September 1957, France made him an Officer of the Legion of Honor, and on May 3, 1962, he was elected a Foreign Member of the Royal Society in Britain.\n\nPresident John F.

Also, while Bastille Day is often seen as the symbol of the end of monarchy, kings, and queens continued in France till long after that.\n\nBastille Day is celebrated throughout France with various activities and festivities.\n\nThe day typically begins with a military parade on the Champs-\u00c9lys\u00e9es in Paris, showcasing the French Armed Forces.\n\nThe parade is followed by concerts, street parties, fireworks, and public gatherings across the country. Many people attend communal meals known as \u201cfiremen\u2019s balls\u201d organized by local fire departments.\n\nThe Story of Bastille Day\n\nThe French Revolution, which lasted for ten years and fundamentally altered French political and social life, can be said to have begun on Bastille Day.\n\nThe French Revolution popularised phrases like \u201cLibert\u00e9, Egalit\u00e9, Fraternit\u00e9\u201d (Liberty, Equality, and Fraternity), and it also influenced the foundational ideas of democracy around the world.\n\nOn this day, commoners seized the Bastille, a 14th-century fortress prison in Paris that housed political prisoners (the notorious Marquis de Sade and well-known philosopher Voltaire having both been detained there at various points in their lives).\n\nBoth social and economic tensions had been brewing in Paris for a while before the Bastille Day uprising.\n\nThe French economy was in shambles in the 1780s, and King Louis XVI and Queen Marie Antoinette did not make matters any better with their reputation as careless, extravagant spenders.\nFamine and poor harvests brought additional blows, and by 1788, even bread had become out of reach for the great majority of people.\nUnder duress, Louis XVI called a meeting of the Estates-General, a body that had been in existence for over 400 years at that point but that the King may call, hear, or disregard.\nThe clergy (First Estate), the nobles (Second Estate), and the ordinary people (Third Estate) made up this body.\nCommoners predominated the body at Louis XVI\u2019s summons, but not in terms of influence.\nOne party split out and created a brand-new organization called the National Assembly when their requests for more influence for commoners were disregarded.\nThis group swore the Tennis Court Oath on June 20, 1789, promising to stick together until they had written a new Constitution for France.\nLouis XVI, meanwhile, began bringing in additional troops, heightening the unrest and tensions in Paris.\nHe fired Jacques Necker, his sole non-high-born minister, on July 11. When protests started, they quickly became violent.\nStorming of Bastille\n\nA massive, armed mob then started moving towards the Bastille on July 14.\n\nAlthough on July 14, 1989, the jail only had seven convicts, of no great concern, the crowd selected the Bastille because individuals imprisoned only because the King ordered so, without trial and publicly stated motives, were frequently confined here.\n\nThe governor of the Bastille, Bernard-Ren\u00e9 de Launay, first sought to negotiate and assured the mob that he would not open fire.\nThe mob, however, became agitated as the discussions went on and no news was released. The drawbridge was dropped, and the crowd started to march in. De Launay, seeing this, gave the order to fire.\nAlthough the Bastille defenders could stop the demonstrators, the armed and trained French Guards quickly joined them.\nThe Bastille fell, and the public showed what commoners were capable of.\n\nThe storming of the Bastille signaled the first victory of the people of Paris against a symbol of the \u201cAncien R\u00e9gime\u201d (Old Regime). Indeed, the association was razed to the ground in the months that followed.\n\nConclusion\n\nThe tremendous political turbulence in France after the Revolution caused Bastille Day celebrations to fizzle away. But by the 1870s, a national holiday honoring France and the French was believed to be necessary.\n\nAlthough July 14, 1789, was a solid candidate for the date to mark the event, the day also saw acts of violence and death. As a result, it was decided that the nation would observe July 14 as National Day.\n\nFormer French colonies also celebrate the day around the world. In India, Pondicherry, a former French colony celebrates the day.\n\n-Article by Swathi Satish"

In the later years, the brothers would only be put in prison and not killed.\n\n1520: Suleiman the Magnificent ruled the Ottoman Empire from 1520 until 1566 when it was at its height.\n\nIn 1555, the Caucasus became officially partitioned for the first time between the Safavids and the Ottomans, a status quo that would remain until the end of the Russo-Turkish War (1768\u20131774).\n\nDuring this time, there was a lot of authority, stability, and money.\n\nSuleiman embraced many types of art and literature while establishing a unified legal framework.\nHe was regarded by many Muslims as both a political leader and a spiritual figure.\nDuring Sultan Suleiman\u2019s reign, the empire grew and came to encompass parts of Eastern Europe which included Hungary, Venetian, and Spanish areas of the Adriatic coast.\nOttoman government\n\nTurkish, Mongol, Persian, Mesopotamian, and Islamic political traditions were all passed down to the Ottomans by a diverse range of ethnic groups.\n\nThe Ottoman state, like the Turkish, Mongol, and Mesopotamian governments, was founded on the idea that the monarch had unquestionable power.\n\nAs the highest temporal ruler of Islam, the Sultan also adopted the title of Caliph.\nThe Ottoman Empire claimed this title for numerous reasons, including the fact that the two most important holy cities, Mecca and Medina, were a part of the Empire and that the security of Muslims worldwide, and in especially the security of the Islamic pilgrimage to Mecca, was the government\u2019s top priority.\n\nTo ensure absolute justice, the Ottomans set up several practices and institutions in the central government surrounding the Sultan.\n\nThe first was the establishment of a bureaucracy drawn from Sultan\u2019s inner circle. This bureaucracy in turn controlled local governments.\nThe Sultan monitored local officials through a vast, complex, and elaborate system of spies who would report back to the central bureaucracy.\nPeriodically, the Sultan was required to tour local governments in disguise to ensure that magistrates and justices were operating justly.\n\nPublic agents and officials that abused their power and the peasantry were subjected to a special jurisdiction called the Siyaset.\n\nThe Siyaset were a set of severe punishments imposed by the Sultan on corrupt officials.\n\nThe most important aspect of the Ottoman centralized government was universal access to centralized authority.\n\nThe highest reaches of power \u2013 except the person of the Sultan \u2013 were available to every citizen of the Empire.\n\nThe Sultan was believed to be personally accountable for every government choice, a sizable bureaucracy ran the government, and a strict and intricate set of regulations governed this bureaucracy, and the Sultan himself was subject to them.\n\nThe Divan, which acted as Sultan\u2019s cabinet for making decisions, was at the head of the administrative structure.\nThe Grand Vizier (a modern-day equivalent of the prime minister) presided over all of the executive responsibilities of Sultan\u2019s administration and was its most powerful official.\nNo one was arbitrarily appointed to these roles; rather, precise guidelines were followed.\n\nThe devshirme system was developed in the fourteenth century.\n\nThe conquered Christians had to provide the state with 20% of their male offspring. The young people were made slaves and coerced into Islam.\nSome of the converts rose to prominence and acquired fortune despite being used as slaves.\nMany received training for careers in the Ottoman military or administration.\nMost of the elite military unit, the Janissaries, were Christian converts.\nThe devshirme system persisted till the 17th century\u2019s conclusion.\nOttoman Art and Science\n\nThe Ottoman Empire was renowned for its contributions to art, science, and medicine. Istanbul and other important cities around the empire were regarded as centers of the arts, particularly under Suleiman the Magnificent rule.\n\nCalligraphy, painting, poetry, textile and carpet weaving, pottery, and music were a few of the most well-liked creative genres.\nThe architecture of the Ottoman Empire also influenced the way people lived. During this time, elaborate mosques and civic structures were built.\n\nIt was thought that science was an important subject to study.\n\nAdvanced mathematics, astronomy, philosophy, physics, geography, and chemistry were studied and practiced by the Ottomans.\n\nThe Ottomans also contributed to some of the greatest medical advancements. They created several modern surgical tools, including forceps, catheters, scalpels, pincers, and lancets.\n\nDecline of the Ottoman Empire\n\nThe Ottoman Empire started to lose its hegemony over Europe\u2019s economies and militaries in the 1600s.\n\nAround this period, the Renaissance and the beginning of the Industrial Revolution greatly strengthened Europe.\n\nThe decline of the empire was caused by several other circumstances, including inadequate leadership and having to compete with commerce from the Americas and India.\n\nThe Battle of Vienna in 1683 resulted in the Ottoman Turks\u2019 defeat making the situation worse.\n\nThe empire lost important land areas throughout the ensuing century.\n\nIn 1830, Greece overthrew the Ottoman Empire and gained freedom.\nRomania, Serbia, and Bulgaria were granted independence in 1878 by the Congress of Berlin.\nThe Ottoman Empire lost almost all of its European lands during the Balkan Wars (1912-1913).\n\nThe Ottoman Empire was already in decline when World War I began.\n\nThe Ottoman army joined the war in 1914 as an ally of the Central Powers, which included Germany and Austria-Hungary.\nArmenian genocide: In 1915, Ottoman leaders made a plan to massacre Armenians living in the Ottoman Empire. Most scholars believe that about 1.5 million Armenians were killed.\nIn October 1918, the Ottoman army was defeated.\n\nThe majority of Ottoman territory was partitioned among Britain, France, Greece, and Russia after the Armistice of Mudros.\n\nWhen the Ottoman Sultan\u2019s position was abolished in 1922, the Ottoman Empire came to an end.\n\nThe independent Republic of Turkey was established on October 29, 1923, by army commander Mustafa Kemal Atat\u00fcrk (1881\u20131938). Then, from 1923 until he died in 1938, he served as Turkey\u2019s first president, ushering in changes that quickly secularised and westernized the nation.\n\nConclusion\n\nThe Ottoman Turks, who ruled for more than 600 years, are well-known for their formidable military, ethnic variety, creative endeavors, religious tolerance, and magnificent architectural achievements.\n\nThe current, largely secular Turkish Republic, which many academics consider to be a continuation of the Ottoman Empire, is still very much under the influence of the once-powerful empire.\n\n-Article written by Swathi Satish"

food and resources.\n\nAn endless string of empires shaped the history of ancient China, western Asia, and the Mediterranean.\n\nThe more socially liberal and long-lasting Persian Empire replaced the tyrannically repressive Assyrian Empire in the 6th to 4th centuries BCE.\nThe imperialism of ancient Greece eventually replaced the Persian Empire, which peaked under Alexander the Great from 356 to 323 BCE.\nWhile Alexander succeeded in uniting the eastern Mediterranean with western Asia, his ideal of a \u201ccosmopolis\u201d in which all people lived in peace remained a pipe dream until the Romans expanded their empire from Britain to Egypt.\nAfter the fall of Rome in 476 BCE, the idea of imperialism as a force for unification faded quickly.\n\nThe European and Asian countries that emerged from the ruins of the Roman Empire followed their imperialist strategies.\n\nThree eras of extensive imperialism and aggressive colonization would characterize the modern age-\n\nEngland, France, the Netherlands, Portugal, and Spain established empires in the Americas, India, and the East Indies between the 15th and the middle of the 18th centuries.\nEmpire building saw a nearly century-long period of relative quiet as a result of strong opposition to imperialism.\nOnce more, the years between the middle of the 19th century and World War I (1914\u2013 1918) were marked by the fast expansion of the empire.\n\nFollowing World War I, the League of Nations\u2019 vision of a world at peace caused imperialism to temporarily halt once more.\n\nWhen Japan attacked China in 1931, it revived its empire-building efforts.\nThe 1930s and 1940s saw the rise of a new era of imperialism, dominated by nations like the Soviet Union under Joseph Stalin, Nazi Germany under Adolf Hitler, and Japan and Italy under Benito Mussolini\u2019s Fascist Party.\nThe Ages of Imperialism\n\nThe Age of Imperialism spanned the year 1500 to 1914.\n\nOld imperialism\n\n15th-17th century: Colonial empires of European powers such as England, Spain, France, Portugal, and Holland.\n\nThe \u2018new world\u2019 exploration by European nations seeking trade routes is termed old imperialism.\nThey violently established settlements in the Americas and Southeast Asia.\nWorst human atrocities were performed- the Spanish Conquistadors\u2019 conquest of Central and South America in the 16th century, and an estimated eight million indigenous people died in the era of imperialism\u2019s first large-scale act of genocide.\n\n18th century: The old imperialism began to end but the colonial powers had already become dominant by this time.\n\nBritish lost the American colonies in 1776 but they gained more territory in India, Australia, and Latin America.\nBy the 1840s, Great Britain had become the dominant colonial power with territorial holdings in India, South Africa, and Australia.\nFrance controlled the Louisiana territory in North America as well as French New Guinea.\nHolland had colonized the East Indies and Spain had colonized Central and South America.\nNew imperialism\n\n1870s: The age of new imperialism saw the Europeans establishing vast empires in Africa, Asia, and the middle east.\n\nThe industrial revolution in Europe led to overproduction and under-consumption- the colonizers pursued aggressive empire-building plans due to this.\nThey started controlling the local governments as well to use the colonies to their benefit.\nThe \u201cSecond Industrial Revolution\u201d between 1870 and 1914 further boosted the economies of the European powers and thus their need for overseas expansion.\nBy 1914, the British controlled the largest number of colonies worldwide, thus the phrase- \u201cThe sun never sets on the British Empire\u201d was born.\nAmerican imperialism saw its peak with the 1898 annexation of the Kingdom of Hawaii as a territory.\n\n1914-48: \u00a0The decline of imperialism started during this time with the wave of nationalism spreading through the colonies.\n\nWorld War I erupted due to the increasing conflicts between competing nations.\nBy the 1940s, former World War I participants Germany and Japan, regaining their imperialistic power, sought to create empires across Europe and Asia, respectively.\nDriven by the desire to expand their nations\u2019 spheres of world influence, Hitler of Germany and Emperor Hirohito of Japan would join forces to launch World War II.\nThe second world war weakened the old imperialistic nations economically as well as due to human lives lost- thus ending the classic trade-driven imperialism.\n\n1950-1990s: The late 1900s saw scaled-back versions of imperialism poking their head in the middle east and Western Europe.\n\nBritish imperialism continued with its involvement in the Iranian coup d\u2019\u00e9tat of 1953.\nThe United States and the Soviet Union emerged as superpowers after World War II- they got involved in Egypt during the 1956 Suez Crisis.\nThe cold war (1947-1991) economically weakened the Soviet Union leading to its disintegration in 1991 and the birth of the Russian Federation.\nThe United States became the global superpower and source of modern imperialism.\nModern imperialism\n\nModern imperialism involves growing corporate presence and promoting the political ideology of the dominating nation.\n\nThis process is often derisively referred to as \u201cnation-building\u201d or, especially in the case of the United States, \u201cAmericanization.\u201d\n\nThe US started its fight against communism in the wake of the end of the cold war leading to numerous mostly failed attempts by the nation.\nThe United States failed in the 1961 Bay of Pigs Invasion attempt to overthrow the communist regime of Fidel Castro in Cuba.\nPresident Ronald Regan\u2019s Reagan Doctrine intended to stop the spread of communism.\nS. involvement in the Vietnam War is also often cited as an example of modern imperialism.\nThe U.S. currently retains five permanently populated traditional territories or commonwealths: Puerto Rico, Guam, the Virgin Islands, the Northern Mariana Islands, and American Samoa.\n\nOther emerging nations also tried to employ modern imperialistic ways to expand their global influence.\n\nCountries like Saudi Arabia and China have sought to spread their global influence.\nSmaller nations like Iran and North Korea have been aggressively building their military capabilities including nuclear weapons to gain an economic and strategic advantage.\nWhat justified imperialistic expansion?\n\nWithout sufficient reason in their leaders\u2019 eyes, empires do not incur the costs and risks of imperialistic growth.\n\nOne or more of the following five hypotheses have been used to justify imperialism throughout recorded history.\n\nConservative Economic Theory: The more developed country views imperialism as a way to preserve its social order and already prosperous economy. This argument includes a historical presumption of racial and ideological supremacy inside the ruling nation.\nLiberal Economic Theory: The dominating nation produces more things than its populace can consume as a result of growing prosperity and capitalism. By balancing production and consumption, its leaders believe that imperialist growth will lower their costs and boost their profits.\nMarxist-Leninist Economic Theory: Liberal legislative solutions to under-consumption were rejected by socialist leaders like Karl Marx and Vladimir Lenin because they would ultimately rob the middle class of the dominant state of its resources and create a world of rich and poor nations. Lenin advocated for the establishment of a Marxist type of imperialism in place of the capitalist-imperialist aims that he claimed were the root of World War I.\nPolitical Theory: Imperialism is nothing more than the natural outcome of powerful countries\u2019 attempts to hold onto their positions in the global power structure. According to this idea, imperialism\u2019s true goal is to lessen a country\u2019s political and military vulnerabilities.\nWarrior Class Theory: The warrior class was first developed to meet a legitimate need for national defence, but to maintain its existence, it eventually creates problems that can only be resolved by imperialism.\nImperialism vs Colonialism\n\nThe political and economic dominance of one nation over another is a common outcome of both colonialism and imperialism, although there are some small but significant variations between the two systems.\n\nIn a nutshell, colonialism and imperialism are two different aspects of the same process of global expansion. Imperialism may be viewed as the cause and colonialism as the outcome in a simple cause-and-effect connection.\n\nColonialism\n\t\nImperialism\n\n\nThe practice of a nation conquering and governing over other areas is known as colonialism.\n\nIt refers to using the captured nation\u2019s resources for the conqueror\u2019s gain.\n\n\t\nImperialism refers to the establishment of an empire and its subsequent expansion into surrounding nations and spheres of influence.\n\n\nPeople are moved to a new area as permanent settlers as part of colonialism.\n\t\nBy contrast, imperialism is simply the use of armed force and brutality to impose political and economic authority over a conquered nation or nation.\n\n\nColonialism characterizes the settlement of regions under European authority, such as India, Australia, North America, Algeria, New Zealand, and Brazil.\n\n\u00a0\n\n\t\nExamples of imperialism include the late 19th-century race for Africa and American rule over Puerto Rico and the Philippines.\n\n\u00a0\n\nConclusion\n\nThe effects of Western imperialist expansion are extremely complicated and challenging to categorize. Native Americans witnessed a foreign culture being imposed on their own, and the economic and human loss repercussions were detrimental.\n\nHowever, the advancement of Western science and technology helped colonized peoples either directly or indirectly.\n\nThis led to improvements in health, access to education for the local elite, and the building of ports, railroads, and other infrastructure in a few places.\nBut it came by destroying traditional practices that were apt for the nation, thus destroying the balance and culture.\n\nThroughout history, many cultures suffered under the domination of their imperialist conquerors, with many indigenous societies being unintentionally or deliberately destroyed.\n\n-Article written by Swathi Satish"

The idea originated among the elite and educated Arabs of the middle east. Read here to learn more about Arab nationalism and its role in Arab integration.\n\nThe fundamental tenet of Arab nationalism is that all Arabs, from the Atlantic to the Indian Oceans, are members of a single country united by a shared ethnicity, language, culture, history, identity, geography, and politics.\n\nOne of the main objectives of Arab nationalism is the removal of those Arab governments seen as being dependent on Western power as well as the end of Western influence in the Arab world, which is seen as a \u201cnemesis\u201d of Arab strength.\n\nIt gained popularity after the Ottoman Empire was demolished and defeated in the early 20th century and faded away when the Arab troops were defeated in the Six-Day War.\n\nTable of Contents\n\nOrigin of Arab Nationalism\nThe growth of Arab Nationalism\nDiversion to Pan-Islamism\nThe decline of Arab Nationalism\nArab Integration\nOrigin of Arab Nationalism\n\nArabia had been under the Ottoman rule since the sixteenth century.\n\nThe Arabian Peninsula in the nineteenth century, however, remains an isolated and peripheral domain of the Ottoman empire.\nIt was virtually untouched by the cultural and artistic developments in Istanbul.\nOttoman influence is seen only in the holy cities of Mecca and Medina, with the Ottoman restoration and enlargement of the Mosque of the Prophet and Haram Mosque.\nIn the Arabian Peninsula and the Gulf countries, Western aesthetics and modern art training do not appear until the second half of the twentieth century.\n\nDuring the 19th century, Iraq, Palestine (renamed the state of Israel in 1948), Jordan, Syria, and Cyprus are all part of the Ottoman empire.\n\n\ud83d\udc49 Which year are YOU targeting for success in the IAS/IPS/IFS Exam? \ud83d\ude80\n\n(1) \u21d2 UPSC 2025: Prelims cum Mains\n\n(2) \u21d2 UPSC 2026: Prelims cum Mains\n\n(3) \u21d2 UPSC 2027 Prelims cum Mains\n\nTip: Know more about ClearIAS Courses (Online/Offline)\n\nEuropean powers, primarily the British and French, move into the region as the Ottoman power loosens.\nAs a result, Arab culture yields increasingly to Western art forms and styles.\nLebanon is among the first Arab countries to adopt Western art, which infiltrates the country through European missionaries, who open convents and schools and introduce lithography and printing.\nThe missionaries in Lebanon are responsible for establishing the basis for a cultural, social, and political life centered on Christianity, which leads to a flowering of art and culture and the evolution of the Gothic school of religious painting.\nThe first Arab reaction against the Ottoman government is witnessed in this region at the end of the nineteenth century.\n\nThe intellectual Circles among the Arabs developed a sense of loyalty towards the Arab fatherland during the 1860s.\n\nThis developed from observance of the technological successes of Western Europe which they attributed to the prevailing patriotism in those countries.\n\nThe arrival of Christian missionaries and educators from the west in a way helped revive the Arab political zeal and numerous secret societies were established.\n\nIn 1911, Arab intellectuals and politicians from throughout the Levant formed al-Fatat (\u201cthe Young Arab Society\u201d), a small Arab nationalist club, in Paris.\nIts initial aim was to raise the level of the Arab nation to the level of modern nations.\nThey sought greater autonomy within a unified Ottoman state rather than Arab independence from the empire\n\nLevant: A historical region consisting of present-day Syria, Lebanon, Jordan, Israel, Palestine, and most of Turkey.\n\nThe growth of Arab Nationalism\n\nThe British, for their part, incited the Sharif of Mecca to launch the Arab Revolt during the First World War, primarily as a weapon to use against the Ottoman power.\n\nThe League of Nations gave Britain trusteeship for Palestine, Iraq, and Transjordan. France gained Syria and Lebanon.\n\nThe Ottomans were defeated and the rebel forces, loyal to the Sharif\u2019s son Faysal ibn al-Husayn entered Damascus in 1918.\nDamascus became the coordinating center of the Arab nationalist movement as it was seen as the birthplace of the ideology, the seat of Faysal, the first Arab \u201csovereign\u201d after nearly 400 years of Turkish suzerainty.\n\nThe resentment towards European powers grew as the French and British divided the Ottoman empire among themselves after the end of world war I.\n\nThe Iraqi revolt of 1920-21 was carried out by the urban population as well as the rural tribes of Iraq against the British mandate.\n\nThis started the rapid growth of the Arab nationalist feeling among the Arab population.\n\nThe 1936-1939 Arab revolt in Palestine led to the foundation of the Arab nationalist Ba\u2019ath Party, which asserts that the Arab nation is the group of people who speak Arabic, inhabit the Arab world, and feel they belong to the same nation.\n\nThe events of the region influenced the creation of the Arab Union Club in Egypt in 1942 which called for developing stronger ties between Egypt and the Arab world.\n\nGamal Abdel Nasser, the president of Egypt, had a crucial role in the emergence of Arab nationalism after the Second World War.\n\nNasser sought an Arab security alliance within the framework of the Arab League because he was against British control of the Suez Canal Zone and worried that Egypt would turn into a Cold War battleground.\nA crucial component of this was the requirement for economic assistance that wasn\u2019t contingent on a deal with Israel and the installation of British or American bases in Arab nations.\n\nThe defeat of Arabs in the 1948 Arab-Israeli war further strengthened the Arabs\u2019 resolve to unite in favor of a pan-Arab nationalist ideal.\n\nMajor events like the Algerian independence movement and the Suez crisis of 1956, all played further roles in growing Arab nationalism and resentment of Europeans.\n\nBy 1971, UAE gained independence from Great Britain, the last of Arabic nations to do so. This completed the decolonization of the middle -east.\n\nDiversion to Pan-Islamism\n\nArab nationalism was a secular and political movement in the beginning. But the question of Palestine and opposition to Zionism became a rallying point for Arab nationalism from both a religious perspective and a military perspective.\n\nGradually, the fact that most Arabs were Muslims was used by some as an important building block in creating a new Arab national identity.\n\nPan-Islamism was promoted by King Faisal of Saudi Arabia as a counterweight to the regional effects of Arab nationalism and communism.\n\nHe advocated for the creation of the Muslim World League by traveling to numerous Muslim nations. With Egypt\u2019s Nasser, he also waged a propaganda and media war.\nThe decline of Arab Nationalism\n\nThe conflicting identities and competing loyalties to tribe, sect, region, and religion was major obstacle to the unity of the movement first of all.\n\nSecond, there was always tension between Iraqi, Syrian, Egyptian, and other regional identities and the larger, all-encompassing Arab identity.\n\nThe third, and perhaps most ironic, the obstacle to the concept of a clear Arab nation was the linguistic diversity in the Arabic region.\n\nBut the most powerful competing alternative to the idea of a secular Arab nation was the concept of a united Muslim community or pan-Islamism.\n\nThe Arab nationalism movement is believed to have experienced an irreversible fall following Israel\u2019s victory over the Arab coalition during the 1967 Six-Day War.\n\nFactional divisions and ideological infighting greatly damaged the movement starting in the middle of the 1960s.\n\nAfter officially rejecting Nasserism in favor of Marxism-Leninism, the once-pro-Nasser Arab Nationalist Movement disintegrated.\n\nArab Integration\n\nGamal Abdel Nasser, the Egyptian president when Arab nationalism reached its pinnacle in terms of political and social expression, was its most charismatic and successful proponent.\n\nAfter Nasser\u2019s passing, Islamism emerged as a viable option due to dissatisfaction with Arabism to bring about long-lasting prosperity in the Arab world.\n\nSaddam Hussein of Iraq, Fi al-Assad of Syria, and Muammar al-Qaddafi of Libya were among those who attempted to succeed Nasser as the Arab leader despite waning support for the pan-Arabist policy.\n\nIslamist revival replaced Pan-Arabism in the region, but the Pan-Arab ideology led to Arab integration eventually.\n\nLate in the 1960s, fresh initiatives for Arab regional integration were launched, mostly abandoning the notion of Arab unification through political fusion as an urgent objective.\n\nThis included creating organizations that supported inter-Arab commerce, cultural interaction, joint economic endeavors, coordinated educational initiatives, and military cooperation.\nTo promote commerce and political collaboration, Arab governments also established many subregional organizations and signed numerous bilateral agreements.\nThe Gulf, Cooperation Council, Arab Common Market, the Arab Maghreb Union, and the Arab Organization for Industrialization were the most noteworthy of these groups.\n\nThe Persian Gulf War of 1990-91 created deeper political divisions among the Arab countries and marginalized the Arab nationalist treatise.\n\nThe idea of Arab integration has been resurrected within a different setting since the mid-1990s.\n\nArab economies were forced to remove trade restrictions and liberalize monetary policy as a result of the wave of economic liberalization that was sparked by many Arab states and supported by international lending institutions.\nInternational organizations, particularly the World Bank and the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP), promoted more regional integration and commerce in parallel with those changes in economic governance as a step towards economic integration on a global scale.\n\n-\u00adArticle written by Swathi Satish"

He took control of all the coastal cities to deny the Persian naval bases.\n\nAs legend has it, at the ancient Phrygian capital of Gordium, Alexander \u201cundid\u201d the hitherto unsolvable Gordian Knot, a feat said to await the future \u201cking of Asia\u201d.\n\nAccording to the story, Alexander proclaimed that it did not matter how the knot was undone and hacked it apart with his sword.\n\n333 BCE: Alexander marched towards Syria, and defeated the Achaemenid army of Darius III in the Battle of Issus.\n\nDarius fled the battle, and Alexander took control of Syria and most of the coast of the Levant.\n\n332 BCE: He proceeded towards Egypt, and was met with resistance at Gaza.\n\nAlexander made sacrifices to the gods at Memphis and traveled to the Siwa Oasis to visit the renowned oracle of Amun-Ra to establish himself as the heir apparent to the long line of pharaohs.\n\nIn the Oracle of Siwa Oasis in the Libyan desert, he was declared to be the son of the god Amun.\nFrom that point on, Alexander frequently referred to Zeus-Ammon as his real father, and after his passing, coins showed him with the Horns of Ammon as a sign of his divinity.\n\nDuring his stay in Egypt, he founded Alexandria, which would become the prosperous capital of the Ptolemaic Kingdom after his death.\n\nControl of Egypt passed to Ptolemy I, the founder of the Ptolemaic Dynasty (305-30 BC) after the death of Alexander.\n\n331 BCE: Alexander marched eastward into Achaemenid Assyria in Upper Mesopotamia (now northern Iraq) and defeated Darius again at the Battle of Gaugamela.\n\nHe also captured Babylon while chasing Darius to the mountains.\n\nFrom Babylon, Alexander went to Susa, one of the Achaemenid capitals, and captured its treasury.\n\nCentral Asian Campaign\n\nAlexander chased Darius to Parthia where he was taken by Bessus, his Bactrian satrap and kinsman, and later murdered.\n\nBessus declared himself Darius\u2019s successor as Artaxerxes V, before retreating into Central Asia to launch a guerrilla campaign against Alexander.\nAlexander buried Darius\u2019s remains next to his Achaemenid predecessors in a regal funeral.\nHe claimed that, while dying, Darius had named him as his successor to the Achaemenid throne.\nThe Achaemenid Empire is considered to have fallen with Darius but Alexander upheld the general structure of governance and community life under his rule.\n\nAlexander set out on a campaign to defeat Bessus. It turned out to be a grand campaign of central Asia.\n\nHe founded a series of new cities, all called Alexandria, including modern Kandahar in Afghanistan, and Alexandria Eschate in modern Tajikistan.\nThe campaign took Alexander through Media, Parthia, Aria (West Afghanistan), Drangiana, Arachosia (South and Central Afghanistan), Bactria (North and Central Afghanistan), and Scythia.\n\nDuring this time, Alexander adopted some elements of Persian dress and customs at his court, notably the custom of proskynesis, symbolic kissing of the hand, or prostration on the ground, that Persians showed to their social superiors.\n\nAlexander\u2019s Invasion of India\n\nIn the early summer of 327 BCE, Alexander left Bactria with a reinforced army under a reorganized command.\n\nHe crossed the Hindu Kush mountains via Bamiyan and Ghorband valleys, and further through Khyber Pass. He advanced through Swat and Gandhara and stormed the forts.\n\n326 BCE: Crossing the Indus near Attock, Alexander entered Taxila, whose ruler, Ambhi, furnished elephants and troops in return for aid against his rival Porus, who ruled the lands between the Hydaspes (modern Jhelum) and the Acesines (modern Chenab).\n\nThe Battle of Hydaspes was his last great battle on the banks of the Jhelum river.\nHe founded two cities there, Alexandria Nicaea (to celebrate his victory) and Bucephala (named after his horse Bucephalus, which died there); and Porus became his ally.\n\nThe Nanda Empire of Magadha, located close to the Ganges River to the east of Porus\u2019s realm, and the Gangaridai Kingdom of Bengal to the east were both parts of the Indian subcontinent.\n\nAlexander\u2019s army mutinied at the Hyphasis River (Beas), refusing to advance farther east, due to fatigue from years of fighting and fear of coming up against other powerful forces of Nandas.\nHence, the Beas River designates Alexander\u2019s conquests\u2019 easternmost boundary as he decided to return.\n\nHe dispatched a large portion of his army with general Craterus to Carmania (modern-day southern Iran) and ordered a fleet to explore the Persian Gulf shore under his admiral Nearchus.\n\nAlexander led the remainder of his army back to Persia via the more challenging southern route through the Gedrosian Desert and Makran.\nBy the time Alexander arrived at Susa in 324 BCE, the harsh desert had already claimed many of his troops.\nLater life and death\n\nTo further his strategy of uniting Macedonians and Persians into one master race, Alexander held a feast in Susa to commemorate the conquest of the Persian empire.\n\nAt this feast, he and his officers took Persian wives; he and Hephaestion wed Darius\u2019s daughters Barsine (also known as Stateira) and Drypetis, respectively; and many of his soldiers who had native wives received generous dowries.\n\nThis policy of racial fusion brought increasing friction to Alexander\u2019s relations with his Macedonians. But eventually, the situation was surmounted.\n\nIn 324 BCE, Hephaestion died in Ecbatana, and Alexander indulged in extravagant mourning for his closest friend; he was given a royal funeral in Babylon.\n\nIn 323 BCE, Alexander was taken ill after a prolonged banquet and drinking bout; 10 days later, on June 13, 323, he died in his 33rd year; he had reigned for 12 years and eight months.\n\nHis body, received in Egypt by Ptolemy, the later king, was eventually placed in a golden coffin in Alexandria.\n\nAs no heir had been named, his generals divided the satrapies among themselves and crowned Alexander IV, Roxana\u2019s son by Alexander, and Philip Arrhidaeus, Philip II\u2019s dimwitted illegitimate son, as kings.\n\nThe empire could hardly survive Alexander\u2019s death as a unit. Both kings were murdered by 309 BCE.\n\nThe provinces became independent kingdoms, and the generals, following Antigonus\u2019s lead in 306 BCE, took the title of king.\n\nMacedonian unity collapsed, and 40 years of war between \u201cThe Successors\u201d (Diadochi) ensued, known as the Wars of Diadochi.\nThe Hellenistic world settled into four stable power blocs: Ptolemaic Egypt, Seleucid Mesopotamia and Central Asia, Attalid Anatolia, and Antigonid Macedon.\nLegacy of Alexander the Great\n\nAlexander earned the epithet \u201cthe Great\u201d due to his unparalleled success as a military commander; he never lost a battle, despite typically being outnumbered.\n\nHis empire stretched from Greece in the west to Punjab in India it was one of the largest empires the ancient world had seen, even outshining the Roman Empire which would emerge later.\n\nIt contributed to the popularisation of Greek culture, creating a new line of thinking among the empire\u2019s many civilizations.\n\nAlexandria of Egypt is one of the cities that Alexander created during his conquest and where his impact is still felt today.\n\nAlexander\u2019s short reign marks a decisive moment in the history of Europe and Asia. His expedition and his interest in a scientific investigation brought many advances in the knowledge of geography and natural history.\n\n-Article written by Swathi Satish"

Illegal opium imports were also eroding what had once been a favorable balance of trade.\n\nSome 1,400 tonnes of opium were seized and burned by the Chinese authorities in the spring of 1839 from British merchants\u2019 storage facilities in Canton (Guangzhou).\n\nChinese efforts to end the trade were initially successful.\n\n1839: Some drunken British sailors killed a Chinese villager.

The treaty ended the state of war that had existed between Germany and the Allies from 1914 and brought World War I to an end.\n\nThe controversial War Guilt clause blamed Germany for World War I and imposed heavy debt payments on Germany. The treaty gets its name from the Palace of Versailles where it was signed.\nThe Treaty of Versailles was a major contributing factor in the outbreak of the\u00a0Second World War.\n\nEnding the First World War: the Paris Peace Conference and Signing of the Treaty of Versailles\nExactly five years after the assassination of Archduke Franz Ferdinand\u2014the event that tipped Europe into world war\u2014the Treaty of Versailles was signed in Paris on June 28, 1919.\nThe armistice signed on November 11, 1918 officially ended the hostilities, but the negotiations between the Allied victors at the Paris Peace Conference lasted six months and involved diplomatic delegations from over thirty-two countries.\nUS President Woodrow Wilson had delivered a speech in January 1918, in which he laid out his vision for the postwar world. The\u00a0Fourteen Points elaborated Wilson\u2019s plan for the comprehensive overhaul of international relations. He called for an immediate end to the war, the establishment of an international peacekeeping organization, international disarmament, open diplomacy, the explicit disavowal of war, and independence for formerly colonial territories.\nWilson\u2019s Fourteen Points were hugely influential in shaping the contours of the postwar world and in spreading the language of peace and democracy around the world.\nIn addition to negotiating the Treaty of Versailles, the Paris Peace Conference established the\u00a0League of Nations, an international peacekeeping organization tasked with resolving international disputes without resorting to military force.\nTerms of the Treaty of Versailles\nThe Treaty of Versailles established a blueprint for the postwar world. One of the most controversial terms of the treaty was the War Guilt clause, which explicitly and directly blamed Germany for the outbreak of hostilities.\nThe treaty forced Germany to disarm, to make territorial concessions, and to pay reparations to the Allied powers in the staggering amount of $5 billion.\nAlthough US President Woodrow Wilson was opposed to such harsh terms, he was outmaneuvered by French Prime Minister Georges Clemenceau.\nFrance was the only Allied power to share a border with Germany, and therefore suffered the bulk of the devastation and casualties from the German war machine. The French aimed to weaken Germany to the greatest extent possible.\nThe peace negotiations were helmed by Woodrow Wilson of the United States, Lloyd George of Britain, Georges Clemenceau of France and Vittorio Orlando of Italy. They were collectively known as the \u201cBig Four\u201d, all through the role played by Italy was limited.\nGermany and other defeated parties of the Central Powers were not represented. Nor was Russia which had concluded a peace treaty in secret with Germany despite being a part of the Allied camp\nIn retrospect, the \u2018Big Four\u2019 were not on the same page regarding the peace treaty. Each had their own objectives which were in conflict with that of the other.\nThe French wanted to prevent any future attacks by Germany and for this, they sought to economically weaken it by paying heavy reparations.\nThe British wanted to rebuild Germany in order to gain a strong trading partner\nThe Italians wanted to expand their power and influence in post-war Europe so that they would be at an equal footing with that of other European powers\nThe Americans opposed any territorial changes and sought to implement a world order that was in line with the Fourteen Points. Other European leaders considered the Fourteen Points as too unrealistic to translate into policy\nUltimately the European Allies imposed a harsh treaty by forcing Germany to surrender all of its overseas colonies and 10 % of its land. Other aspects of the treaty are as follows:\nGermany would limit the size of its army and navy and was not allowed to maintain an air force.\nIt called for Kaiser Wilhelm II, ruler of Germany, to stand trial for war crimes\nAbove all, it included the \u201cwar guilt clause\u201d which held Germany solely responsible for starting the war and required it to pay reparations for Allied war losses.\nImpact of the Treaty of Versailles\nWorld War I had begun when a Serb nationalist, Gavrilo Princip, assassinated Archduke Franz Ferdinand and his wife in Sarajevo. Gavrilo was a member of the Black Hand, a Serb nationalistic group with the aim of uniting Serbs living outside the kingdom of Serbia. This had prompted the Austro-Hungarian Empire to declare war on Serbia and in return Serbia\u2019s allies declared war on the Austro-Hungarian Empire, thus sparking the war.\nThe German people were furious that this fact was ignored by the Allies and Germany was made the sole party responsible for all the horrors of World War I. The nation\u2019s burden of reparations crossed 132 billion gold Reichsmarks. It was a sum so huge that economists like John Maynard Keynes pointed out that Germany would not be able to pay it in full and even if, by chance that it did, the European economy would collapse.\nThe economic hardship and the resentment of the treaty within Germany were fertile grounds for ultra-nationalist sentiments, which were exploited by Hitler and his Nazi Party to seize power and laid the groundwork for World War II, a conflict far deadlier and devastating than World War I had ever been.\nConsequences of the Treaty of Versailles\nAlthough President Wilson was heavily involved in negotiating the treaty, which reflected his vision for the postwar world, isolationists in the US Congress proved a major stumbling block to ratification. The so-called \u201cIrreconcilables,\u201d mostly Republicans but also some Democrats, opposed the treaty, particularly Article X, which committed member-states of the League of Nations to go to war on each other\u2019s behalf in the event of an unprovoked act of aggression.\nThe Irreconcilables saw this as a violation of US sovereignty and some believed that it would commit the United States to an alliance system that could lead to another war. Due to the opposition of the Irreconcilables, the Treaty of Versailles was never ratified by Congress, and the United States never became a member of the League of Nations\nWhen Adolf Hitler came to power in Germany in 1934, his government began to violate many of the terms of the Treaty of Versailles. Not only did Hitler announce a moratorium on all debt payments and cease making reparations, but he began to build up the German armed forces in earnest.\nSome historians believe that the onerous terms of the treaty laid the psychological and economic groundwork for the rise of the Nazi party, which capitalized on German resentment of the burdens imposed by the Allied powers after the First World War.\nRelated posts\nFirst World War (1914-1918): Causes and Consequences\nSecond World War (1939-1945): Causes and Consequences\n\nArticle written by Aseem muhammed\n\n\ud83d\udc49 Which year are YOU targeting for success in the IAS/IPS/IFS Exam? \ud83d\ude80\n\n(1) \u21d2 UPSC 2025: Prelims cum Mains\n\n(2) \u21d2 UPSC 2026: Prelims cum Mains\n\n(3) \u21d2 UPSC 2027 Prelims cum Mains\n\nTip: Know more about ClearIAS Courses (Online/Offline)"

How well the restoration transforms Japan? Read further to know more.\n\nThe Japanese revolution or Meiji restoration was a crucial period of transition of Japan from a pre-modern to a modern society. The Meiji restoration affected all the social, political, and economic aspects of Japan as well as its military.\n\nDuring this time Japan rapidly industrialized and adopted Western ideas and production methods, which led to unprecedented changes in the economy, social fabric, and military of Japan. This furthered an impact not just on the country but on the whole world at large.\n\nTable of Contents\n\nThe Japanese revolution or The Restoration\nReforms of the Meiji Government in the Japanese revolution\nTransformation of Japan after Meiji restoration/Japanese revolution\nImpact of the Industrial Revolution on Japan\nWhat are the negative impacts of the industrial revolution on Japan?\nConclusion\nThe Japanese revolution or The Restoration\nThe Japanese revolution or Meiji Restoration is a political revolution in 1868 that brought about the final demise of the Tokugawa shogunate (military government), thus ending the Edo (Tokugawa) period (1603\u20131867) \u00a0at least nominally, returned control of the country to direct imperial rule under Mutsuhito (the emperor Meiji).\nIn a wider context, however, the Meiji Restoration of 1868 came to be identified with the subsequent era of major political, economic, and social change. This period brought about the modernization and Westernization\u00a0of the country.\nThe restoration event itself consisted of a coup d\u2019\u00e9tat in the ancient imperial capital of Kyoto on January 3, 1868.\nThe perpetrators announced the ouster of\u00a0Tokugawa Yoshinobu (the last shogun) who by late 1867 was no longer effective in power and proclaimed the young Meiji emperor to be the ruler of Japan. Yoshinobu mounted a brief civil war that ended with his surrender to imperial forces in June 1869.\nReforms of the Meiji Government in the Japanese revolution\nA number of reforms were started by the Meiji Government to promote capitalism in Japan. A feudal system of post stations, merchant guilds, and checkpoints that served as impediments to industrial expansion was one of them.\nIn 1869, the first telegraph line between Tokyo and Yokohama was constructed as part of the new infrastructure.\nThe previous courier system was superseded by the modern postal service in 1871, and post offices were put up all over the nation to sell stamps and postcards for predetermined rates. When Japan joined the Universal Postal Services in 1877, its postal services were connected to those across the globe. Japan would import its first telephone sets that same year.\nIn 1872, the first rail services between Tokyo and Yokohama will begin. with the opening of new linkages in 1874 and 1877. The majority of Japan had Rail networks at the turn of the century.\nMajor roads in the nation were also renovated by the government, ensuring efficient delivery of products throughout Japan.\nThe Meiji administration promoted the formation of private businesses through patronage that would later compete with Western corporations. Government assistance would flow to corporations like Mitsubishi, Mitsui, and Ono. These businesses would establish and run numerous plants that would produce both industrial and agricultural products.\nFor example, The Tomioka Silk Mill in the Gunma Prefecture, the most well-known of these, is a UNESCO World Heritage site. It was constructed in 1872 and would have 300 French-imported silk reeling machines. French technicians instructed the mill workers on how to operate these devices. The local employees would then impart their knowledge to other mills around the nation.\nThe Japanese light industry and the country\u2019s economy as a whole would change as cotton and silk production increased. Japan\u2019s capitalist economy was well established by 1898.\nTransformation of Japan after Meiji restoration/Japanese revolution\nThe Meiji Restoration was successful in establishing a centralized, bureaucratic administration.\nBy the end of the century, the light industry will have undergone a revolution, and the country\u2019s communication and transportation systems will have improved.\nAlong with it, the rigid class system that characterized the feudal era was destroyed.\nIn Japan, universal education was first adopted. Western and Japanese cultural concepts were integrated in education. Japan\u2019s populace was suddenly well-educated and had greater social mobility.\nA conscript military, modeled after the west, was established after the traditional samurai system was abolished. The military began to modernize, which contributed to its success in the Sino-Japanese and Russo-Japanese Wars.\nAdopted the slogan \u201cWealthy Country and Strong Arms\u201d which proved to be a cardinal doctrine of Japan\u2019s imperialist expansion\nContact with the Europeans was encouraged. Even the govt was organized on Western lines. A Japanese Parliament called the Diet was set up along the lines of the Dutch parliament\nTrade also increased which led to the development of the Banking and financial system\nImpact of the Industrial Revolution on Japan\nJapan\u2019s quick industrialization aided in the modernization of its military to the point where it could compete with major European powers. These would start with Russia. The Japanese army and navy invaded Korean territory held by the Russian Empire in 1904 and dealt the Russian Empire a number of setbacks.\nThe battle of Tsushima in 1905, in which the Japanese navy completely annihilated the Russian Baltic fleet, would prove to be the turning point of the war. For the first time ever, an Asian fleet completely destroyed a European navy.\nThe world powers of the era would view Japan in a new light, shifting from one of an agricultural backwater to one of a significant superpower, with astonishment and trepidation.\nWith its increased confidence in handling global affairs, Japan fought alongside the Allies during World War I, but it was still disregarded when Germany lost the conflict and its colonies were divided among the war\u2019s winners. Frustrated, Japan would build the Axis coalition by forming new relationships with its previous adversaries.\nTo the dismay of the League of Nations, Japan would invade China in 1936 as its confidence in its own industrial strength grew. By attacking the US naval base at Pearl Harbour in December 1941, Japan launched World War II in the Pacific, but this time it would face the foe that had first opened its doors to the industrial revolution. Japan believed that no one would stand in the way of it becoming its own colonial empire.\nThere was a new Constitution put in place.

Read further to know more.\n\nThe \u201cfirst industrial revolution\u201d refers to the changes in the industry and the economy that occurred in Britain during the 1780s and 1850s.\n\nLater, similar changes occurred in European countries and the USA. These were anticipated to have a significant effect on both the economies and societies of those countries as well as the rest of the world.\n\nThis phase of industrial development in Britain is strongly associated with new machinery and technologies. Compared to the handcraft and handloom industries, these allowed for the mass production of items.\n\nTable of Contents\n\nModern Industrialisation\nWages and Salaries\nGrowing Population and Increase in Number of Towns\nNetwork of Transportation\nStrong Financial System\nRich Source of Staple Materials for Mechanisation\nTechnological Inventions for Cotton Spinning and Weaving\nSteam Power\nEmergence of Railway\nFirst Industrial Revolution: 1765\nSecond Industrial Revolution: 1870\nThird Industrial Revolution: 1969\nFourth Industrial Revolution (Industry 4.0): Present\nIndustry 4.0 and India\nConclusion\nModern Industrialisation\n\nBritain was the first country to experience modern industrialization.\n\nWages and Salaries\nBy the end of the 17th century, money was widely used as a medium of exchange and a large section of the people received their income in the form of wages and salaries rather than in goods.\nAs a result, people had more options for how to spend their money, and the market for goods increased.\nGrowing Population and Increase in Number of Towns\nFrom the eighteenth century, many towns in Europe were growing in area and population, nearly doubling between 1750 and 1800.\nThe largest of them was London, which served as the hub of the country\u2019s markets, with the next largest ones located close to it.\nBy the eighteenth century, the centre of global trade had shifted from the Mediterranean ports of Italy and France to the Atlantic ports of Holland and Britain.\nNetwork of Transportation\nIn England, the movement of goods between markets was helped by a good network of rivers, and an indented coastline with sheltered bays.\nUntil the spread of railways, transport by waterways was cheaper and faster than by land.\nStrong Financial System\nThe Bank of England served as the central focus of the country\u2019s financial system (founded in 1694).\nIn England, there were over a hundred provincial banks by 1784; over the following ten years, their numbers tripled.\nThese banks provided the capital necessary to start and support large industrial enterprises.\nRich Source of Staple Materials for Mechanisation\nThe availability of coal, iron ore, and other industrial minerals like lead, copper, and tin made England fortunate because these elements were essential for mechanization.\nBy 1848, Britain was smelting more iron than the rest of the world put together.\nTechnological Inventions for Cotton Spinning and Weaving\nFrom the seventeenth century, the country had been importing bales of cotton cloth from India at great cost. As the East India Company\u2019s political control of parts of India was established, it began to import, along with cloth, raw cotton, which could be spun and woven into cloth in England.\nA series of technological inventions successfully closed the gap between the speed of spinning raw cotton into yarn or thread, and of weaving the yarn into fabric.\nTo make it even more efficient, production gradually shifted from the homes of spinners and weavers to factories.\nRaw cotton had to be entirely imported and a large part of the finished cloth was exported. This sustained the process of colonization so that Britain could retain control over the sources of raw cotton as well as the markets.\nSteam Power\nThe ability of steam to provide enormous amounts of power was a key factor in large-scale industrialization. In 1840, British steam engines were generating more than 70 per cent of all European horsepower.\nEmergence of Railway\nRailways emerged as a new means of transportation that was available throughout the year, both cheap and fast, to carry passengers and goods. The invention of the railways took the entire process of industrialization to a second stage.\nFirst Industrial Revolution: 1765\n\nThe first Industrial revolution began\u00a0in Great Britain and spread to Europe and North America.\n\n\ud83d\udc49 Which year are YOU targeting for success in the IAS/IPS/IFS Exam? \ud83d\ude80\n\n(1) \u21d2 UPSC 2025: Prelims cum Mains\n\n(2) \u21d2 UPSC 2026: Prelims cum Mains\n\n(3) \u21d2 UPSC 2027 Prelims cum Mains\n\nTip: Know more about ClearIAS Courses (Online/Offline)\n\nKey Features:\n\nThe transition from hand production methods to machines.\nNew chemical manufacturing and iron production processes.\nIncreased use of steam power and water power.\nDevelopment of the machine tools industry.\nSignificant growth in the textile industry.\nExpansion of the canal and railway networks.\n\nImpact: This led to urbanization as people moved to cities for work, marked the beginning of significant environmental changes, and established the factory system of production.\n\nSecond Industrial Revolution: 1870\n\nThe Second Industrial Revolution gained momentum in Western Europe, the United States, and later Japan.\n\nKey Features:\n\nAdvancements in steel production became the backbone of infrastructure and manufacturing.\nWidespread adoption of electricity led to new inventions like the light bulb and electric motors.\nIntroduction of the internal combustion engine, fueling the development of automobiles and aeroplanes.\nInnovations in communication technology, such as the telegraph and telephone.\nExpansion of chemical, electrical, and petroleum industries.\nThe birth of mass production techniques was epitomized by Henry Ford\u2019s assembly line.\n\nImpact: Accelerated global trade and urbanization, contributed to the rise of big business and significantly improved standards of living. However, it also led to environmental degradation and contributed to social inequalities.\n\nThird Industrial Revolution: 1969\n\nThe third Industrial revolution emerged from the United States and spread globally.\n\nKey Features:\n\nThe rise of digital technology, including computers, the Internet, and information technology.\nThe transition from analog to digital technologies.\nDevelopment of renewable energy sources and more efficient use of energy.\nAutomation of manufacturing through robotics and computer-aided design (CAD).\nThe emergence of biotechnology and genetic engineering.\n\nImpact: This has led to the globalization of the economy, profound changes in communication and access to information, and the creation of entirely new industries. It has also raised concerns about privacy, cybersecurity, and the displacement of workers by automation.\n\nFourth Industrial Revolution (Industry 4.0): Present\n\nA fourth industrial revolution, known as Industry 4.0, which is based on a recent technological development called digitalization, is set to take place in the world due to tremendous advancements in the sectors of hardware and information technology.\n\nWhile Industry 3.0 focuses on the automation of single machines and processes, Industry 4.0 concentrates on the end-to-end digitization of all physical assets and their integration into digital ecosystems with value chain partners.\nDriven by the power of big data, high computing capacity, artificial intelligence, and analytics, Industry 4.0 aims to completely digitize the manufacturing sector.\nIndustry 4.0 is the next phase in bringing together conventional and modern technologies in manufacturing to create \u201csmart factories\u201d.\nIndustry 4.0 and India\n\nA huge number of MSMEs have just started to enter the automation phase.\n\nTo achieve the ambitious target of making India a global hub for manufacturing, design, and innovation, and augmenting the share of manufacturing in GDP from the current 16% to 25% by 2025, the adoption of Industry 4.0 technologies becomes imperative to increase competitiveness and build efficient value chains.\nIn its pursuit to foster best-in-class manufacturing infrastructure in India, the \u201cMake in India\u201d initiative is spearheading wider adoption of \u2018Industry 4.0\u2019.\nConclusion\n\nIndia has a robust ecosystem that has the potential to use emerging technologies like Artificial Intelligence (AI), Machine Learning (ML), Internet of Things (IoT), Blockchain, and Big Data, and it can catapult India\u2019s development to new heights by creating millions of new opportunities of employment.\n\nIndia has already developed a national strategy to prepare for the development of an AI research-based robbers ecosystem\u00a0in India.\n\nFollowing the vision of inclusive growth \u201csabka sath, sabka vikas\u201d, the government has now given a call for \u201cArtificial Intelligence for all\u201d.\n\nIndia not only sees this as a change in the industrial scenario but as a catalyst to change its social fabric. While Industry is a platform, production is a process and technology is a tool, its ultimate goal is to benefit and transform the marginalized and the outliers of society.\n\nRelated article: Changes in industrial policy and their effects on industrial growth\n\nArticle Written By: Priti Raj"

It took place between 1939 and 1945.\n\nFrom 1939 through 1945, almost the whole world was engaged in World War II, often known as the Second World War.\n\nThe main combatants were the Allies, which included France, Great Britain, the United States, the Soviet Union, and, to a lesser extent, China, and the Axis forces, which included Germany, Italy, and Japan.\n\nAfter an uneasy 20-year respite, the war was in many ways a continuation of the World War I-era conflicts.\n\nIt\u2019s arguable that the most important part of the 20th century was the Second World War (Dennis Cove, 2002). When Nazi Germany invaded Poland on September 1, 1939, the European War officially began. It lasted until Japan, the final member of the Axis, formally surrendered on September 2, 1945. However, the war in Asia started earlier due to Japanese involvement in China, while the war in Europe concluded earlier due to Germany\u2019s unconditional capitulation on May 8, 1945.\n\nIn addition to spilling over into Africa and the Americas, the conflict resulted in numerous significant naval engagements. It led to significant technological advances and created the groundwork for post-war social reforms like the end of European colonialism, the American civil rights movement, the modern women\u2019s rights movement, and plans for space exploration.\n\nThe primary combatants were the Allied countries, commanded by Britain (and its Commonwealth members), the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics, and the United States of America, as well as the Axis nations (Nazi Germany, Fascist Italy, Imperial Japan, and their minor allies).\n\nCauses of World War 2\n\nThe major causes of World War II were as follows:\n\nGerman Invasion of Poland\nGerman Invasion of the Soviet Union\nThe Holocaust\nJapanese Imperialism\nAttack on Pearl Harbour\nNormandy Landings in Europe\nDropping of Atomic Bombs on Japan\n\nNewfoundland and Labrador had a number of quick and significant social changes as a result of the Second World War.

Read the article to know more about decolonization.\n\nDecolonization is defined as the end of colonialism or the demand for independence and self-determination by formerly colonised people. Independence movements in colonised territories contributed to decolonization in part.\n\nAdditionally, it was the outcome of a deliberate economic choice taken by colonial rulers.\n\nFor the European nations, the expense of maintaining colonial empires had started to outweigh their worth.\n\nDecolonization is defined as \u201cthe departure of a colonial power from its colonies; the acquisition of political or economic independence by such colonies\u201d in the Oxford English Dictionary.\n\nTable of Contents\n\nWhat is Decolonization?\nImportant Factors in the decolonization process\nImpact On Economy\nTechniques and Phases\u00a0 involved\nDecolonization Process After the Second World War\nDecolonization\u2019s root causes\nDecolonization\u2019s after-effects\nWhat is Decolonization?\n\nAccording to other experts, decolonization is the transition of a polity from a state of formal dependence or subordination to one of formal autonomy or sovereignty.\n\nIn current practice, it is typically assumed that the two civilizations are culturally distinct and that the regal or metropolitan centre is physically separate from the dependence.\n\n\ud83d\udc49 Which year are YOU targeting for success in the IAS/IPS/IFS Exam? \ud83d\ude80\n\n(1) \u21d2 UPSC 2025: Prelims cum Mains\n\n(2) \u21d2 UPSC 2026: Prelims cum Mains\n\n(3) \u21d2 UPSC 2027 Prelims cum Mains\n\nTip: Know more about ClearIAS Courses (Online/Offline)\n\nDecolonization is the process by which western overseas empires are broken up and replaced with independent governments in the Americas, Asia, and Africa.\n\nPolitically (achieving independence, self-government, union with the metropole, or joining another state), culturally, or both (removal of pernicious colonial effects).\n\nThe term mostly alludes to the global colonial empires that had been built prior to World War I being destroyed in the years after that conflict.\n\nThe dissolution of the Spanish Empire in the 19th century, the collapse of the German, Austro-Hungarian, Ottoman, and Russian Empires after World War I, the collapse of the British, French, Japanese, Portuguese, Belgian, and Italian colonial empires after World War II, and the collapse of the Soviet Union (the successor to the Russian Empire) after the Cold War are a few examples.\n\nStudies have demonstrated that decolonization refers to the capacity to observe and analyse non-Western civilizations from a neutral, non-Western perspective.\n\nThere are many different ways that decolonization might take place.\n\nThe dependency most frequently develops into a new independent state, a political organization acknowledged in the international community as independent of other states and as having final control over a certain territory and population.\nLess frequently, decolonization might take place when a dependency is fully assimilated into an existing state and ceases to be independent and subordinate.\n\nThe relationship between Puerto Rico and the United States can be categorized as either one of colonial dependence or free association. Portugal asserted in the 1960s that it had no colonies and that only foreign areas had been constitutionally merged into a single Portuguese state.\n\nAnd where political ties are not strained, it is difficult to determine whether independence has been attained because there is no overt fighting.\n\nImportant Factors in the decolonization process\n\nThree main factors were extremely important in this decolonization process.\n\nFirst and foremost, the desire for independence among colonised peoples, followed by the Second World War\u2019s demonstration of the vulnerability of colonial powers, and finally, the United Nations\u2019 renewed emphasis on anti-colonialism.\nThe release of Britain\u2019s thirteen continental colonies under the name United States of America marked the beginning of the first wave of decolonization.\nThe French colony of Saint Domingue became Haiti after a slave insurrection that was sparked by the French Revolution. After the Napoleonic Wars, which had cut off Latin America from the Iberian peninsula, Portuguese Brazil and Spanish Central and South America gained independence.\nWhile the initial phase of decolonization was only applicable to the Americas. Decolonization took place worldwide in the 20th century.\nMost of the Indian subcontinent, Southeast Asia, Australasia, the Middle East, Africa, and the Caribbean were all included in its scope, as well as independence. Between the two world wars, a few of Britain\u2019s colonial outposts and a few loosely governed protectorates attained full independence.\nMajor Asian colonies including India, Indonesia, Indochina, and the Philippines attained independence following World War II. During the 1960s, when roughly all of Africa was decolonized, this transition accelerated quickly.\nNearly every Western colony had achieved self-government or had been entirely assimilated into sovereign states by the 1980s.\nWho desired independence throughout each of the two stages of decolonization was a key distinction. Creole revolutions marked the early stages of American decolonization as the descendants of European settlers sought political independence from their motherland.\nPolitical revolutions, as opposed to social revolutions, were the American Revolution and the Spanish Wars for Independence. The only exception to the disgust of loyalists and creole nationalists abroad was the slave uprising in Haiti.\nContrarily, as decolonization came to signify freedom from ethnically foreign domination, it was deeply based on aboriginal rather than creole campaigns for independence.\nAfter World War II, settler factions resisted decolonization because it would remove their privileged social, political, and economic status. A racialist minority administration only managed to survive decolonization in South Africa.\nThe degree of violence engaged also differed significantly between the first and second effects of decolonization. Early American decolonization was achieved by armed conflict between colonial and imperial troops. In the thirteen continental colonies of Great Britain, in Spanish Central and South America, and in Haiti, wars for independence raged.\nDue to Brazil\u2019s greater wealth and population than Portugal\u2019s, only Portuguese Brazil was able to achieve independence without a fight.\nProtracted battles for independence were fought in Algeria, Angola, Indochina, and Indonesia during the 20th century. But these were rare instances.\nWithout organised conflict between the imperial state and colonial nationalists, the majority of colonies achieved independence.\nImpact On Economy\n\nThe economics of the recently constituted states have been significantly impacted by decolonization.\n\nNewly independent African states were found to need to upgrade their economic systems. Additionally, even though the former colonies were now legally independent, they remained largely reliant on the West for assistance in building their political and economic institutions. As a result, western corporations continued to exert considerable influence over the new states.\nIn order to finance their own growth, newly independent republics borrowed money from Western nations, which led to the creation of a new debt system.\nPolitically, many countries have been unable to pay off this debt for decades, therefore it still persists. Decolonization\u2019s effects on broader ideas of international dominance or injustice are hotly debated. Dependency and world systems theorists envisioned decolonization as causing the change in the mere form, but not the content, of core-periphery connections.\nThe major point of contention is that, even in the absence of explicit governmental controls, the interaction between more and less developed economies tends to accentuate the gap between them.\nDependence on foreign money has been argued to impede long-term economic growth and, more broadly, to influence the social, political, and economic makeup of the dependent country.\nDespite these concerns, it is clear that decolonization entails a fundamental shift in the systems that govern international trade, particularly in the post-World War II era.\nModern states have widely recognised rights to regulate economic activity within their borders, including the ability to nationalise industries with foreign ownership and renegotiate agreements with multinational businesses.\nThird-world countries rally around these rights, and when the bordering state is powerful, the detrimental effects of economic dependence appear to decrease.\nTechniques and Phases\u00a0 involved\n\nTechniques and Phases\u00a0 involved in decolonization are the following:\n\nFollowing the conclusion of World War I, decolonization became more popular around the world. The League of Nations, which was disbanded on April 20, 1946, was the first organisation on the international stage to make a concerted attempt to decolonize. The division of German colonies in Africa between France and Britain is one famous example of a mandate that was formed for this reason but was later viewed as a mere allocation of sovereignty over the former colonies to other colonial powers at the time.\nThe colonial nations started moving toward decolonization on their own initiative after the devastation of World War II. There was little funding or enthusiasm for military action to hold into overseas regions against their will because they had other priorities, such as rebuilding their own countries.\nThe dependent territories have made the decision to maintain their dependence through referendums, as was the case with Gibraltar and French Guiana. In response to the emergence of independence movements in the colonies, colonial powers have occasionally supported decolonization in order to free themselves of financial and military responsibilities.\nThe transfer of control over foreign policy, security, and the pursuit of de jure recognition for the new sovereignty may be the primary goals of the final stage of decolonization. However, even after statehood is acknowledged, some continuity can be preserved through bilateral agreements between newly equal administrations, such as pacts for mutual defence and military training.\nDecolonization Process After the Second World War\n\nAfter the Second World War, the decolonization process quickened.\n\nAs a result of enemy conquest, some colonial regions, like French Indochina, Dutch Indonesia, British Malaya, and Italian East Africa, were essentially cut off from their colonial masters.\nVietnam and Indonesia both declared their independence from Dutch rule.\nThe 1947 declaration of India\u2019s independence is the most significant event. In different sections of the country, there were several peasant and tribal uprisings against British and local landlords, which helped to fuel the growth of a nationalist movement using Gandhi\u2019s tools of nonviolence and non-cooperation.\nOf the former British colonies in Africa, only Nigeria and Ghana attained independence.\nIn 1934, the Union of South Africa acquired dominion status and eventually developed into a sovereign independent state within the boundaries of the British empire. In 1961, it severed ties with the United Kingdom and left the Commonwealth to become a republic.\nThe racist apartheid regime in South Africa deprived Africans of even the most fundamental human rights. The increased international pressure from the third world and the UN in the 1980s and early 1990s led the western countries to negotiate with African opposition. After the parliamentary elections, the black majority received power after all the discussions.\nAfter the League of Nations was replaced by the UN, South Africa asserted trusteeship over southwest Africa, extending the apartheid territory that the UN had deemed unconstitutional.\nThe Namibian council was founded by the UN in 1967 to run the country. Namibia was created when South Africa gained its independence.\nDecolonization\u2019s root causes\nThe emergence of modern nationalism shook colonial imperialism, and a sense of pride in one\u2019s nation-state and affiliation with it led to the creation of national groups with the aim of upending the colonial system.\nThe advent of European culture and authority disrupted traditional living, which eventually led to the psychological roots of nationalism and decolonization.\n\u00a0The elite was impacted by missionary education and the principles of the French Revolution, which helped them internalise the virtues of democracy and freedom.\n\u00a0Marxism, another ideology that strengthened nationalist movements in the colonies and steered them steadily in the direction of socialism.\n\u00a0The imperialist powers were forced to leave their colonies as a result of the United Nations extensive involvement in the post-second World War period.\nAsiaticism: The centuries-long subjugation of Dutch and British colonial powers in India and Indonesia resulted in nationalist emotions among the populace, as well as a sense of shared identity.\nPan-Africanism: Africans began to question European dominance by the end of the 19th century. Pan-Americanism served as a vehicle for the values and ambitions of the African people.\nAfter the First World War, the victorious powers, in an innovative move, subjected the colonial territories to the League of Nations\u2019 mandatory system, which gradually liberated them.\nIn certain nations, such as some of the former French colonies in Africa, such as Senegal and the Ivory Coast in West Africa, as well as some of the former British colonies, such as Nigeria and Ghana, the process was rather calm.\nInternational institutions like the League of Nations and the United Nations intervened to help some of the countries get independence. Some of them, like the liberation of Algeria, took a brutal turn.\nDecolonization\u2019s after-effects\nThe nature of international interactions becomes really global.\nThe colonial powers\u2019 ruthless exploitation was reduced, and democracy and equality were established.\nThe last nail was placed in the coffin of crimes against humanity like slavery and apartheid.\n\u00a0New, independent nations appeared in Asia, Africa, and Latin America as a result of decolonization, and these regions became the scene of ideological conflict and the Cold War.\nAs a strategy, decolonized countries adopted neutralism and adhered to nonalignment as a mark of respect and decency.\nThe presence of Afro-Asian countries drastically altered how the UN operated and functioned.\nThe third world was created as a result of decolonization.\n\nTo sum up, colonialism often involved the transfer of people to a new environment where they settled permanently while retaining political allegiance to their home nation. The practice of colonialism includes the subjugation of one person by another. The act of rejecting colonialism is called decolonization. Through this procedure, one country secures its independence from the state it had just emerged from and becomes self-governing.\n\nArticle Written By: Atheena Fathima Riyas"

As such, it belongs to the historical spectrum of intergroup oppression, subjugation, and exploitation.\n\n\ud83d\udc49 Which year are YOU targeting for success in the IAS/IPS/IFS Exam? \ud83d\ude80\n\n(1) \u21d2 UPSC 2025: Prelims cum Mains\n\n(2) \u21d2 UPSC 2026: Prelims cum Mains\n\n(3) \u21d2 UPSC 2027 Prelims cum Mains\n\nTip: Know more about ClearIAS Courses (Online/Offline)\n\nFrom the perspective of global systems, a large portion of the history of the capitalist world economy can be viewed as a history of colonialism, consisting of repeated and generally successful attempts by the core to establish a periphery and control it politically to exploit it economically.\n\nColonial empires have existed in both the capitalist and pre-capitalist world systems. The colonies now have an entirely different way of life because of colonialization. Unfamiliar cultural groups are forced to communicate and coexist when they are brought together.\n\nCharacteristics of Colonization\n\nNumerous positive and harmful changes have occurred, particularly in the colonies, due to the subjugation of regions and the forced coexistence of peoples from various origins and philosophical and religious perspectives.\n\nOther characteristics of the \u201ccolonial situation\u201d include the rule of an alien minority over a native majority who is materially inferior, the assertion of racial and cultural superiority, contact between a machine-oriented civilization with Christian origins, a powerful economy, and a rapid pace of life and a non-Christian civilization who lacks machines and is characterized by a backward economy and a slow pace of life, as well as the imposition of the first civilization upon the second.\n\nHistory of Colonization\n\nRecords reveal that the modern era of colonialism began about the year 1500, following the European discovery of America (in 1488) and a sea route around southern Africa (1492). With the occurrence of these events, the maritime dominance switched from the Mediterranean to the Atlantic and to the newly emerging nation-states of Portugal, Spain, the Dutch Republic, France, and England.\n\nThe desire for economic growth frequently drives colonization. European colonization of Africa throughout the sixteenth century played a vital part in the growth of the European economy.\n\nAlso read: Imperialism and its History\n\nReasons for Colonization\nAs Europeans created galleons or other ships that could cruise more readily all the way to Africa, European colonisation was strengthened.\nBecause foreign nations were so easily accessible, European aristocracies and merchants were motivated to explore new areas in an effort to find raw materials and establish new markets.\nThe Industrial Revolution and the use of slavery were both influenced by the need for raw materials from distant regions. As a result, Europeans now have access to fresh labour resources.\n\nThe most notable colonial powers are known to have been Britain, France, Spain, Portugal, the Netherlands, Belgium, and Denmark, whose shared empires at various points included most of the countries in between as well as all of North, Central, and South America, Africa, Australia, much of Indonesia, the countries in the Levant, and much of the Indian subcontinent. Basically, the majority of the world. Germany\u2019s role as a colonial power is frequently viewed as a minor development in Europe\u2019s imperialist history.\n\nImpacts of Colonization\n\nThrough exploration, conquest, and colonization, these nations expanded and conquered the globe, bringing European institutions and culture with them.\n\nColonialism is now acknowledged as the practice of ruling over people of various races in areas that are separated from the imperial center by saline water. It specifically denotes direct governmental dominance over people of other races, particularly over Asians and Africans, by European states or those founded by Europeans, such as the United States or Australia.\n\nReligion\n\nReligion is one of the benefits of colonialism, especially the Christian religion, which has helped to expand. The European missionaries introduced Christianity to their colonies and did an excellent job of evangelising the colonial populations. The colonial masters forced the population to learn new skills along with religion.\n\nThe people underwent a change as a result of being freed from the illiteracy that had kept them in the dark for so long. The introduction of the Christian religion resulted in numerous changes in the colonies. For instance, Christianity\u2019s emphasis on equality and advocacy for universal education helped put an end to the twin killings in Southern Nigeria.\n\nModernization and Technological Development\n\nColonialism helped undeveloped areas become more modern. The construction of railroads and other contemporary modes of transportation, advancements in medical and healthcare services, and current educational institutions have all contributed to the advancement of the colonies.\n\nThe colonies\u2019 standing worldwide has improved as a result of these advancements. The advancements in education have made it possible to compete in a variety of fields, including science, math, literature, and art. African writers like Wole Soyinka, Chinua Achebe, Ngugi wa Thiongo, and other communities are living proof of this.\n\nNatural resource exploration\n\nNatural resource exploration is made possible by colonization.\u00a0 Introduction of new technology made available to the colonies by their colonial rulers. Utilizing new technology facilitated and improved the study of natural resources. The colonies grew and advanced as a result of this.\n\nEven if these were low-paying occupations, it also expands employment chances for people, which benefits them because it broadens their experience and helps them learn new skills and gain information. The colonial lords benefited from cheap labour as a result.\n\nLand expansion\n\nColonialism also resulted in the addition of land for their colonies. For instance, there was no such place as Nigeria before colonisation. There were just a few cities and villages that were more or less contained within their own regions.\n\nThe beginning of colonisation resulted in the expansion of the land for all towns, villages, and ethnic groups. Anyone from any ethnic group can now relocate to any location in the nation, live there, and call it home.\n\nLanguage\n\nIn the majority of multilingual and multicultural countries, the use of the colonial masters\u2019 language by the colonies has helped to foster unity to some extent.\n\nNigeria, which boasts well over 500 languages, is a clear example. It would be challenging to make any of the original languages the lingua franca because no language is seen as being superior to the others.\n\nSince English is a foreign language and does not belong to any one ethnic group or people in Nigeria, its adoption has made life easier for the country\u2019s citizens.\n\nNegative aspects of Colonization\nWhile this form of colonialism benefited European economies, it also had negative effects on African economies. Terrains that had been colonised were compelled to rely on colonisers for trade.\nLocal political and institutional frameworks were destroyed and replaced with ones imposed by colonial forces.\nNew and unfamiliar systems of government were introduced by the colonial overlords, which the locals were unfamiliar with. These political structures gave the political structures of the colonies less weight and consideration. The new forms of government that were brought to the colonies were totally unrelated to those that the locals were accustomed to.\nColonialism played a significant role in the erosion and destruction of the native population\u2019s cultural norms and values. First, the native tongues of the colonies were degraded in importance relative to those of the colonial masters. People started dressing differently.\nBecause colonial natives were led to believe that their colonial masters were superior human beings, they began to dress and speak like their colonial masters.\nThe Consequences of Colonization\n\nColonialism had a significant impact on the political, economic, and social realms.\n\nThe Political Impact of Colonialism\n\nAlthough dominance took diverse forms, colonialism impacted pre-colonial leaders in the political sphere. One result of colonialism was the establishment of foreign rule or foreign takeover of pre-colonial central governments in areas where there was existing centralization.\n\nThe Economic Impact of Colonialism\n\nThe \u2018drain of wealth,\u2019 expropriation (mostly of land), control over production and trade, exploitation of natural resources, and infrastructure development are the main arguments for the economic consequences of colonialism. By the last quarter of the nineteenth century, India was the largest consumer of British goods, a considerable employer of high-paid British civil officials, the source of half of the Empire\u2019s military might, all financed by domestic revenues, and a significant beneficiary of the British capital.\n\nThere was a considerable loss of financial resources as a result of colonialism. The finest example of this is British India, where there is still a disagreement between Indian historians and those who support British colonialism.\n\nAlso read: Fourth Industrial Revolution \u2013 ClearIAS\n\nThe Social Effects of Colonialism\n\nAs colonialism spread throughout India, a new middle class emerged, made up of people interested in public services and receiving a modern education. A group of trained professionals, such as doctors, attorneys, teachers, and journalists, was another important group that emerged.\n\nFollowing the loss of the British East India Company, the British influence on education in the nation allowed for the development of this group, which eventually rose to prominence in society. Because this class\u2019s position and support came from professional talent rather than an inherited privilege, it had a more liberal outlook.\n\nReviewing the colonialism process reveals that colonialism is a tactic by which one nation extends and occupies its influence over other terrains.\u00a0 The other nations outside of Europe got weaker as a result of their failure to industrialise in the 18th and 19th centuries, during the Industrial Revolution, as European countries grew stronger and wealthier through industrialization. The colony\u2019s cultural, political, religious, economic, and social components were significantly impacted by colonialization.\n\nArticle Written By: Atheena Fathima Riyas"

The treaty resulted in the Swiss independence from Austria, the Netherlands\u2019 independence from Spain, the German principalities protected their autonomy and several other states also emerged.\n\nUp to the time of Napoleon, Europe was largely at peace. However, The French (and its allies) under Napoleon Bonaparte fought a series of wars against a confederation of European governments during the Napoleonic Wars.\n\nThus, to bring about peace and reorganize Europe, the Congress of Vienna (1814\u20131815) took place.\n\n\ud83d\udc49 Which year are YOU targeting for success in the IAS/IPS/IFS Exam? \ud83d\ude80\n\n(1) \u21d2 UPSC 2025: Prelims cum Mains\n\n(2) \u21d2 UPSC 2026: Prelims cum Mains\n\n(3) \u21d2 UPSC 2027 Prelims cum Mains\n\nTip: Know more about ClearIAS Courses (Online/Offline)\n\nThe Congress of Vienna (1814-15)\n\nThe goal of the Vienna Congress was to redistribute the map of Europe, which had previously been defaced by Napoleon\u2019s indiscriminate conquest.\n\nMajor decisions:\n\nThe German confederacy of 39 states was not disturbed.\nThe Netherlands included Belgium and Genoa was given to Piedmont.\nNorthern parts of Italy were placed under the control of Austria.\nRussia gained control over Poland and Saxony came under Prussia.\n\nAs a result, except for one or two revisions, the political boundaries established by the Congress of Vienna persisted till World War I.\n\nIt resulted in the growth of nation-states, which led to both the dissolution of empires and the emergence of new nations or nation-states.\n\nMajor events before the First World War\n\nThe battle for national independence and unification was a defining characteristic of 19th-century Europe. This century saw the independence of Greece and Belgium as well as the rise of Germany and Italy as united independent states.\n\nUnification of Italy\nFor many centuries, the Italian peninsula was a politically fragmented conglomeration of states. For instance, In 1792, when a conflict erupted between Austria and the Revolutionary French Government, the French invaded the Italian peninsula, unified many of the Italian states, and turned them into republics.\nAfter Napoleon\u2019s rise to power, the Italian peninsula was once again conquered by the French.\nThe period of French invasion and occupation was important in many ways such as revolutionary ideas about government and society, the ideals of freedom and equality, etc.\nWith the downfall of Napoleon in 1814 and the redistribution of territory by the Congress of Vienna (1814-15), most of the Italian states were reconstituted.\nHowever, the Italian peninsula remained fragmented through the mid-1800s, and the concept of a united Italy began to take root. Secret societies were formed to oppose the conservative regimes in Italian states.\nOne such society(Carbonaris) was the group Young Italy, founded in 1831 by Guiseppe Mazzini.\nHe was a fervent supporter of the idea that Italy must be united through the desires and deeds of its people. Thus, by the middle of the twentieth century, the campaign for Italian unity, also known as the Risorgimento (resurgence), had become popular.\nHis plan for creating a free, independent, republican and united country with Rome as its capital was developed while he was imprisoned.\nMazzini used secret propaganda to awaken the people from their lethargy and motivate them to engage in a war for independence and unity. That is why he is referred to as the \u201cHeart\u201d of unification.\nThe revolutions of 1848 ignited nationalist sentiment throughout the Italian peninsula mostly by the professional classes (such as doctors, lawyers, and shopkeepers) as well as students.\nAlthough these Italian uprisings were unsuccessful, the idea of the Risorgimento continued to gain adherents after 1848.\nThe final push for Italian unification came in 1859, led by the Kingdom of Piedmont (especially by Piedmont\u2019s Prime Minister, Count Camillo di Cavour).\nFor unification, he tried with the help of military, diplomacy, and international cooperation.\nHe is known as the \u2018Brain\u2019 and \u2018Hand\u2019 of unification.\nThe northern Italian states held elections in 1859 and 1860 and voted to join the Kingdom of Piedmont-Sardinia, a major step towards unification.\nGiuseppe Garibaldi, a native of Piedmont-Sardinia, was instrumental in bringing the southern Italian states into the unification process.\nHe was a nationalist and a republican.\nHe committed himself after hearing praise from his people that he would free and unite Italy before he passed away.\nHe served as Italy\u2019s \u201cSword\u201d in the process of unification.\nIn 1866, Italy joined Prussia in a campaign against Austria (the 1866 Austro-Prussian War) and thus won Venetia.\n\nThe Italian army reached Rome during the Franco-Prussian War (1870\u20131871). Rome and the Papal States were united with Italy that year, and the Risorgimento was finished. The Italian capital shifted from Florence to Rome in the summer of 1871.\n\nUnification of Germany\nBefore the German unification of 1871, the German states existed as a loose confederation that had limited economic and political cooperation. Germany was split into 39 tiny states by the Vienna Congress.\nOtto von Bismarck, Prussia\u2019s prime minister, played a clever game of combining diplomacy and war to bring the German states together under its rule by the middle of the 1800s when Prussia had grown to be the more powerful of the two.\nThe 1860s saw a string of wars that culminated in the Prussian defeat of France in 1871, leading to the unification of Germany in 1871 under Prussian rule.\nBismarck\u2019s Iron and Blood policy\u2019s objective was to bring down the German Confederation to unite Germany under the Prussian Monarchy.\nBismarck\u2019s Prussia first fought a war in 1864 in alliance with Austria against Denmark, annexing most of the territory of the German Confederation.\nPrussia gave Austria a humiliating loss at the Battle of Sadowa (1886), also referred to as the \u201cBattle of Six Weeks.\u201d\nBismarck established the North German Confederation in 1867. It brought together 22 German states but left aside independent Southern German states like Bavaria.\nAlthough the Southern states had a pro-Austrian stance, they were compelled to come together after Germany\u2019s victory in the Franco-Prussian War of 1870(Prussia defeated France in the Battle of Sedan in 1870).\nThe Franco-Prussian War of 1870 was the catalyst for Germany\u2019s complete unification.\nIst Balkan War (1912)\nIn the First Balkan War (1912), the Balkan League (Montenegro, Serbia, Greece, and Bulgaria) attacked Turkey and seized the majority of the European possessions of the Ottoman Empire.\nThe land of the Ottoman Empire in Europe was split among the Balkan States as part of the peace agreement.\nIInd Balkan War(1913)\nGreece, Romania, Turkey, and Serbia engaged in this conflict with Bulgaria. All the territory Bulgaria had captured during the First Balkan War was lost to it after the war.\nHence, Germany and Italy\u2019s birth changed the political landscape of Europe and eventually sparked the most significant global catastrophe in human history, World War I.\nWorld War I and National Boundaries\nThe Treaty of Frankfurt (1871) caused France and Germany to be in hostilities constantly. Therefore, German Chancellor Bismarck made an effort to exclude France from European politics as a preventative step.\nThis resulted in the establishment of both allies and adversaries. Consequently, up until the early 20th century a diplomatic revolution already took place in Europe.\nEurope\u00a0in 1914\n\nThe First World War was a global conflict in true nature because the battle was fought not just in trenches of the western front but in Africa, the Middle-east and Asia. World war changed the map of the world in general and Europe in particular to a certain extent.\n\nHow WWI changed the map\nAustro-Hungarian, Russian, and Ottoman empires that had endured for centuries eventually disintegrated after four years of bloodshed, more than 16 million killed soldiers and citizens, and several new states arose.\nAlsace-Lorraine went to France, and Eupen-Malm\u00e9dy went to Belgium. Silesia and Northern Schleswig were given to Poland and Denmark, respectively, as a result of plebiscites.\nPoland was reconstituted in the East(created from lands lost from Austria, Russia, and Germany); Ukraine, the Baltic republics of Latvia, Lithuania, and Estonia were established.\nTrieste was acquired by Italy.\nThe Austro-Hungarian Empire, this vast zone to the southern part of Europe, split into separate entities based on nationality: Czechoslovakia and Yugoslavia were created; Galicia went to Poland; Transylvania went to Romania.\nSykes-Picot Agreement \u2013 After World War I, Britain and France secretly agreed to build \u201cspheres of influence\u201d that would eventually give rise to modern Western Asia. The major goals of the agreement were to divide the Ottoman Empire\u2019s territories between England and France and to protect each country\u2019s colonial interests.\nOne of the 14 points Woodrow Wilson was self-government for the non-Turkish people of the Ottoman empire and the permanent opening of Dardanelles.\nTreaty of Versailles-\nAlsace-Lorraine was transferred to France, costing Germany territory in Europe.\nThe nations of Estonia, Latvia, and Lithuania became independent. Poland, Lithuania, Belgium, Denmark, and other countries received portions of German territory.\nDespite Austria\u2019s sizable German population, union with Germany was forbidden.\nWith the signing of the Treaties of St. Germain (1919) and Trianon (1920) with Austria and Hungary, respectively, Austria and Hungary were reduced in size in contrast to the size of the Habsburg empire.\nThe Treaty of Sevres (1920) with Turkey, was signed.\nSignificant land was lost to Greece, including Eastern Thrace and Smyrna.\nThe colonies of the Ottoman Empire were changed into mandates and given to Britain and France. France got Syria, while British mandates included Palestine, Iraq, and Transjordan.\nWorld War II and Redrawal of National Boundaries\n\nThe following were the events post World War II.\n\nInterwar period\nThe old international order was destroyed after World War I, and a new one was established when Europe had been reorganized. The Great War left its economic and social effects on the European countries that had participated in it.\nThe League of Nations was an attempt to end the pattern of conventional power politics and bring about an open and cooperative platform for discussing international relations in the interest of peace and stability. The League of Nations, however, was a fruitless effort.\nThe extreme nature of these fundamentally opposed ideas transformed European politics into a scene for violent confrontation. When Adolf Hitler\u2019s authoritarian Nazi Party took control of Germany in the 1930s, it once again prepared to wage war on Europe.\n\nThe road to World War II was clear since both Britain and France were preoccupied with internal issues.\n\nEurope after World War II\n\nThe expansionist policies of Hitler and Mussolini were one of the primary causes of World War II. The war caused the redrawing of country borders, especially in Europe.\n\nAfter the devastation caused by the war, the nations that fought in them placed a high priority on domestically reorganizing.\nThe border of Poland changed completely and a decision was taken at the Potsdam Conference held in 1945.\nThe Prussian Kingdom fell apart. It was absorbed into Germany. Later Germany was split into two parts: East Germany and West Germany. The Soviet Union was in charge of East Germany. It was transformed into a communist nation. A republic existed in West Germany also known as the Non-Communist West.\nThe Baltic nations and portions of Czechoslovakia and Romania were seized by Russia.\nMajor Events after WWII\n\nThe following were the other major events:\n\nUnited Nations\nTo replace the unsuccessful League of Nations, the United Nations Organization was established in the USA in 1945. The United Nations Organization\u2019s mission was to uphold world peace, promote international harmony, and foster international collaboration.\nThe UN mandate is to respect and secure the sovereignty of nations.\nThe Trusteeship Council, one of the main organs of the UN, was established to supervise the administration of trust territories as they transitioned from colonies to sovereign nations.\nIn several boundary-related wars, including those in the Middle East, the Middle East and the Korean War, the UN has stepped in.\nThe era of the Cold War (1945-1990)\nTogether, the Soviet Union, the UK, and the USA battled against Fascist aggression during World War II, and this display of power was what led to the victory of the Allied troops. However, tensions between these two parties started to grow after the war.\nEven though there was no overt aggression, the Cold War was triggered by the policies employed.\nDecolonization and boundary resettlement\nDecolonization aims to give Indigenous people \u201ccultural, psychological, and economic freedom\u201d to realize Indigenous sovereignty, which is the right and capacity of Indigenous people to exercise self-determination over their lands, cultures, and political, and economic systems.\nDecolonization entails either nonviolent revolution or national liberation battles conducted by pro-independence groups.\nWhat led to decolonization?\nIt was declared in the Atlantic Charter (1941) that people should have the right to choose their government.\nThe United Nations has defined the fundamental right to self-determination as central to decolonization.\nThe colonial powers suffered a significant hit as a result of World War II, losing their former prominence. The Netherlands, Belgium, and France, for example, had been defeated and conquered, while the United Kingdom had been severely depleted.\nThe rise of two anti-colonialist superpowers, the United States and the Soviet Union, as well as the changing international climate following 1945, encouraged the colonies to seek independence.\nLack of resources- Following World War II, several governments had a financial crisis, ran out of financial resources, and experienced poor management, making it impossible for them to maintain colonies.\nIndependence movements- Many independence movements began in colonial states.\nImpact of newly decolonized countries \u2013 Many states were inspired by neighbouring countries to decolonize, and they were mutually supportive.\nEstablishment of Non-Aligned Movement (NAM)\nThe emergence of New Nations\n\nBetween 1945 and 1960, three dozen new states in Asia and Africa achieved autonomy or outright independence from their European colonial rulers. There was no one process of decolonization.\n\nIn some areas, it was peaceful and orderly. In many others, independence was achieved only after a protracted revolution.\n\nAsia\n\nAsia\u2019s decolonization was a gradual process, with various areas of Asia decolonized during 50 years between 1945 and 1997.\n\nS.no.\n\t\nCountry\n\t\nColonial power\n\t\nYear of independence\n\t\nRemarks\n\n\n1.\n\t\nIndia\n\t\nBritain, France, Portugal\n\t\n1947\n\t\nPakistan born as new nation which further divided and Bangladesh emerged in 1947, 1954 from france and 1961 from Portugal\n\n\n2.\n\t\nIndonesia\n\t\nNetherlands\n\t\n1945\n\t\nIndependence from the Kingdom of the Netherlands following their unilateral Proclamation of Indonesian Independence on 17 August 1945\n\n\n3.\n\t\nMalaysia\n\t\nBritain\n\t\n1957\n\t\nMalayan independence from the United Kingdom was declared in Dataran Merdeka\n\n\n4.\n\t\nBrunei\n\t\nBritain\n\t\n1984\n\t\n\n\n5.\n\t\nMyanmar\n\t\nBritain\n\t\n1948\n\t\n\n\n6.\n\t\nAfghanistan\n\t\nBritain\n\t\n1919\n\t\nThe Treaty of Rawalpindi ends British control of foreign policy\n\n\n7.\n\t\nLebanon\n\t\nFrance\n\t\n1941\n\t\nIn 1943, Independence from France recognized\n\n\n8.\n\t\nHongkong\n\t\nBritain\n\t\n1997\n\t\nHandover to China\n\n\n9.\n\t\nCambodia\n\t\nFrance\n\t\n1953\n\t\n\n\n10.\n\t\nJordan\n\t\nBritain\n\t\n1946\n\t\nEnd of the British Mandate for Palestine\n\n\n11.\n\t\nSri Lanka\n\t\nBritain\n\t\n1948\n\t\n\n\n12.\n\t\nVietnam\n\t\nFrance and Japan\n\t\n1945\n\t\nWithdrawal of the Japanese after World War II\n\n\n13.\n\t\nPhilippines\n\t\nSpain\n\t\n1898 and 1946\n\t\nThe United States recognizes independence under the provisions of the Treaty of Manila (1946)\n\n\n14.\n\t\nYeman\n\t\nBritain\n\t\n1918 and 1967\n\t\nNorth Yemen\u2019s independence from the Ottoman Empire and South Yemen\u2019s independence from the United Kingdom\n\n\n15.\n\t\nSingapore\n\t\nBritain\n\t\n1959\n\t\n\n\n16.\n\t\nMaldives\n\t\nBritain\n\t\n1965\n\t\n\nDespite the emergence of new nations, boundary disputes remain in Asia, especially in the West Asian region.\n\nMiddle east\nSince the 14th century AD, the Ottoman Empire has ruled over the majority of Western Asia. The empire had a multi-racial, religious, and culturally diverse populace.\nIt was difficult to rule such a large number of people without incident, but the Ottomans created an effective administrative structure that rewarded the meritorious and loyal, guaranteeing regional peace.\nHowever, this position changed following the end of World War I in the early twentieth century.\nThe Sykes-Picot Agreement was an unofficial pact signed in 1916 by the United Kingdom and France, with approval from the Russian Empire and Italy, to outline mutually agreed-upon zones of influence and governance in the event of the Ottoman Empire\u2019s split.\nThe British- and French-controlled countries were divided by the Sykes-Picot line. The agreement allocated to Britain control of what is today southern Israel and Palestine, Jordan and southern Iraq, and an additional small area that included the ports of Haifa and Acre to allow access to the Mediterranean.\nIsrael -Palestine conflict\nThe Balfour Declaration was a public statement issued by the British government in 1917 during the First World War announcing support for the establishment of a \u201cnational home for the Jewish people\u201d in Palestine.\nAccording to a history written by the University of Central Arkansas, over 60,000 Jews departed in 1935 and approximately 75,000 Jews went to Palestine between 1922 and 1926.\nIt also states that Palestinian Arabs urged the UK to stop Jewish emigration, but that the UK disregarded their requests. There were violent episodes that resulted in 500 fatalities.\nIn 1936, the UK government recommended the partition of Palestine into Jewish and Arab states.\nThe UN developed a partition plan after receiving a referral from Britain over Palestine in 1947.\nIsraeli independence was proclaimed in May 1948.\nEgypt, Lebanon, Syria, and Syria were the first Arab nations to invade the newly constituted nation.\nAfter the conflict, Israel reclaimed some of the territories that had been given to Palestinian Arabs by the 1947 UN decision.\nThe two-state solution refers to an arrangement where Israeli and Palestinian states co-exist in the region.\nHowever, such a solution has not materialized over the decades.\nAfrica\nAfrica was decolonized between the mid-to-late 1950s and 1975. The changes that occurred during the process were abrupt and radical, as the colonies forged their way toward independence, which was sometimes marred by political violence.\nThe Second World War, like Asian decolonization, was a critical component in the independence of African states.\n\nScramble of Africa:\n\nThe Colonization of Africa: During the 19th-20th century, the African continent was colonized mainly by European powers like Britain, France, Spain, Portugal, and Russia.\n\nColonialism reached its logical conclusion with the rise of new industrial powers in Europe \u2013 Germany, and Italy. This led to a competition for accruing larger and larger empires that meant more power and prestige to these countries.\n\nThis was most pronounced in the tragic event of Scramble for Africa.\n\nThis happened during the period of New Imperialism (1881-1914). The increasing rivalry between European powers \u2013 Britain, France, Germany, etc \u2013 meant that they needed more and more markets and sources for cheap raw materials.\nThe starting point of the Scramble for Africa was the Berlin Conference in 1884. The conference regulated European colonization and trade in Africa.\nThe settlement was reached at the Berlin Conference of 1884. In 1870, less than 10% of African territory was under European control. By 1914, it had increased to almost 90%! This is known as the scramble of Africa.\nDecolonization of Africa\nNationalist movements \u2013 Through the effects of westernization and opening up, colonies acquired enlightened leadership and many developed strong nationalist movements.\nMost colonies were extensive police states. Massive unrest made them simply unviable.\nSecond World War\nA feeling of brotherhood was growing within the indigenous people of Africa. This meant a pooling of resources and external support in the struggle for independence. As more and more countries attained freedom, the entire process was hastened.\nThe USA and USSR actively pressured colonial powers. Eg: President Truman of the US pressured the British government to make India independent.\nS.N.\n\t\nCountry\n\t\nColonial power\n\t\nYear of Independence\n\t\nRemarks\n\n\n1.\n\t\nLibya\n\t\nItaly\n\t\n1951\n\t\n\n\n2.\n\t\nKenya\n\t\nBritain\n\t\n1952\n\t\nMau-Mau insurgency in Kenya begins\n\n\n3.\n\t\nCongo\n\t\nBelgium\n\t\n1960\n\t\n\n\n4.\n\t\nGhana\n\t\nBritain\n\t\n1957\n\t\nGhana is the first British colony to gain independence\n\n\n5.\n\t\nmorocco\n\t\nFrance\n\t\n1956\n\t\n\n\n6.\n\t\nTunisia\n\t\nFrance\n\t\n1956\n\t\n\n\n7.\n\t\nAlgeria\n\t\nFrance\n\t\n1962\n\t\n\n\n8.\n\t\nSouth Africa\n\t\nBritain\n\t\n1910\n\t\nSouth Africa Act 1909\n\n\n9.\n\t\nKenya\n\t\nBritain\n\t\n1963\n\t\n\n\n10.\n\t\nMalawi\n\t\nBritain\n\t\n1964\n\t\n\n\n11.\n\t\nZambia\n\t\nBritain\n\t\n1964\n\t\n\n\n12.\n\t\nTanzania\n\t\nBritain\n\t\n1961\n\t\n\n\n13.\n\t\nZimbabwe\n\t\nBritain\n\t\n1980\n\t\n\n\n14.\n\t\nAngola\n\t\nPortugal\n\t\n1975\n\t\n\n\n15.\n\t\nMozambique\n\t\nPortugal\n\t\n1975\n\t\n\n\n16.\n\t\nEgypt\n\t\nBritain\n\t\n1922\n\t\nThe Egyptian revolution of 1919\n\n\n17.\n\t\nLibya\n\t\nItaly\n\t\n1951\n\t\nTreaty of Peace with Italy, 1947 U.N.

Kim led a surprise invasion of South Korea on June 25, 1950.\nIn 1950, At the head of a United Nations force made up of more than a dozen nations, the United States assisted South Korea.\nIn November 1950, Communist China sided with North Korea in the conflict, launching a large Chinese military attack against American forces. Additionally, the Soviet Union secretly backed North Korea.\nThe border between North and South Korea(38 parallel) was nearly where it had been at the start of the war when the three years of warfare came to an end in a standoff.\nThe United States demonstrated its continued commitment to containment during this first heated conflict of the Cold War (the idea that the US would ultimately defeat communism by containing its spread).\n\nThe Truman Doctrine, which pledged support for the \u201cfree peoples of the world\u201d who sought to prevent communist aggression, was put into action in Korea by the United States.\n\nThe United States and its allies did succeed in stopping communism from taking over South Korea, even if the war came to a conclusion where it started.\n\nThe Vietnam war\nWhen World War II first broke out, Japan threatened to invade Indochina (an Area comprised of the presence of Vietnam, Laos, and Cambodia). By 1938, France and Japan had both organized their armies to seize control of the area. When World War II started, the Japanese took control of the nation. Political leader Ho Chi Minh founded the Viet Minh to push\u00a0out both the Japanese occupiers and the French colonial authorities.\nThe communism of the Soviet Union and China, however, had a significant impact on the Viet Minh.\nEmperor Bao Dai was left in charge of the government after the Japanese were defeated in 1945, but his position was not particularly strong. Taking advantage of the situation, the Viet Minh revolted, took over North Vietnam, and established the Democratic Republic of Vietnam, which is centred in Hanoi.\n. Both Bao and Ho Chi Minh, who were currently in power in North Vietnam, favoured the unification of Vietnam but with a different approach. Ho desired a communist state, whereas Bao wanted better ties with the Western capitalist powers.\nA treaty dividing Vietnam in two was signed in July 1954 during a conference in Geneva. Ho maintained sway over the North, and Bao held the South. But in the meantime, the anti-communist politician Ngo Dinh Diem toppled Bao\u2019s government to become the President of South Vietnam.\nA prolonged military fight between free-market democracy and international communism, the Vietnam War began as an anti-colonial conflict against the French and developed into one throughout the Cold War.\nThe Soviet Union, China, and other communist nations backed the Democratic Republic of Vietnam (DRV) in the north, while the Republic of Vietnam (ROV) in the south was backed by the United States and its anticommunist allies.\nThe conflict was intensified by the ongoing Cold War between the United States and the Soviet Union. More than 3 million people (including over 58,000 Americans) were killed in the Vietnam War, and more than half of the dead were Vietnamese civilians.\nThe more conventionally trained army of South Vietnam was no match for the guerrilla tactics of the North, so in February 1965 America decided to get involved with Operation Rolling Thunder.\nAgent Orange, a potent herbicide, was used by US military forces during the Vietnam War to clear crops and forest cover out of the way of North Vietnamese and Viet Cong troops.(During the tenure of US President Lyndon Johnson)\nThe North Vietnamese army unexpectedly attacked US forces in the South in 1968. The American public was shocked by the attack\u2019s sudden severity.\nNixon(Who won the election after defeating Johnson) started a slow withdrawal of US forces to calm public opposition to the Vietnam War, but he kept up the bombing campaigns started by his predecessor.\nIn January 1973, North Vietnam and the United States reached their final peace accord. Ho Chi Minh City replaced the name Saigon.\n\nPolitical and economic changes in the communist nation started in 1986, assisting Vietnam\u2019s slow but steady integration into the world economy. It joined the World Trade Organization (WTO) in 2007.\n\nThe Vietnam War had an ongoing impact on US foreign policy. In a clear attempt to reestablish some kind of control over the formulation of foreign policy and to place limits on presidential power, Congress approved the War Powers Act in 1973.\n\nThe idea of foreign intervention was opposed by the American public for well over ten years. The \u201cVietnam syndrome\u201d was the term used for this.\n\n1971 War and rise of Bangladesh\n\nThe south-central Asian nation of Bangladesh, officially the People\u2019s Republic of Bangladesh with\u00a0 Dhaka as the Capital. Bengalis make up the large majority of the population.\n\nEast Bengal became a part of Pakistan known as East Pakistan after the British left the subcontinent in 1947.\nAfter Pakistan became an independent nation, Bengali nationalism grew.\nIn 1948, Jinnah declared that Urdu would be the official language and the people of East Pakistan who were bangle speaking, will have to comply. This led to widespread protests in East Pakistan.\nThe language movement was led by Sheikh Mujibur Rehman, who joined the Awami League party.\nThe 1954 provincial elections saw a landslide victory of Mujibur Rehman\u2019s Awami League over the Muslim league. However, west Pakistan was not willing to let a leader from its eastern provincial wing rule the country.\nTheir six demands of Sheikh Mujibur Rehman for more autonomy were: a federal state; all subjects, excluding defence and foreign affairs; independent fiscal and monetary policies; taxing powers; commerce and foreign exchange reserves; and separate navies and armed forces.\nThe 1970 election again saw a sweeping victory by the Awami League, but Zulfikar Bhutto-led PPP who won in West Pakistan refused to acknowledge Mujibur Rahman\u2019s win\nViolence broke out in 1971, killing about a million Bengalis and forcing millions more to flee to India.\nOn 25th March 1971 (Operation Searchlight), the Pakistan army struck at the Bengali independence movement at night.\nMujibur Rahman was arrested and flown to West Pakistan, and many Bengali students and intellectuals were fired upon and arrested at Dhaka University.\nThe Bengali armed resistance Mukhti Bahini arose against the Pakistan army and the Indian forces helped them with arms and training.\nOn 16 December, Pakistan surrendered to India, and 93000 soldiers of Pakistan laid down their arms in Bangladesh.\nMujirbur Rahman was released from prison in January and went on to become the first Prime Minister of Bangladesh.\n\nThe Shimla Agreement was signed between India and Pakistan on 2nd July 1972- The LoC was recognized, and India gave occupied land back to Pakistan.\n\nOn a global scale, the U.S \u2013Soviet tensions were high. India had signed a Friendship treaty in 1971 with Russia hence the U.S. was supporting Pakistan throughout all this.\n\nReunification of Germany\n\nAfter World War II, Germany was divided and emerged as two republics in 1949\u00a0 \u2013 West Germany\u2014officially known as the Federal Republic of Germany (FRG)\u2014and East Germany\u2014officially known as the German Democratic Republic(GDR).\n\nIn 1961, when the Berlin Wall was built by the East Germans as a barrier between itself and the West.\nThe West was strongly in favour of reunification but as long as the Soviet Union was able to pursue its ideological war with the West, the authorities in the East were not about to give up.\nDespite having the most successful economy in the Soviet Union, East Germany\u2019s citizens yearned for the freedoms experienced by their compatriots in the West.\nWhen Mikhail Gorbachev visited East Berlin in October 1989, he urged the East German government to embrace change.\nAlmost 1 million East Germans took part in a demonstration on November 4th, 1989 in East Berlin. The Berlin Wall eventually came down five days later, allowing civilians to enter West Berlin without restriction. East Germany began breaking down the Berlin Wall on November 12.\nThis helped pave the way for the first free elections in East Germany, which were held on March 18, 1990.\n\nOn September 12, the two German States, the Soviet Union, the United States, France, and Great Britain signed the Treaty on the Final Settlement About Germany.\n\nOn October 3, 1990, East Germany joined West Germany, uniting the two countries politically.\n\nThe disintegration of the Erstwhile Soviet Union and the Rebirth of Central Asian republicans\n\nThe Russian Empire was overthrown in the 1917 Russian Revolution. The Russian Civil War resulted in the establishment of the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics (USSR) in 1922.\n\nMajor reasons for the disintegration of the USSR:\n\nThe fall of the Berlin Wall and the reunification of Germany\nPeople in many East European countries(socialist bloc) started to protest against their governments and the USSR.\nPolitical and Economic reforms proposed by Mikhail Gorbachev \u2013 he presented two measures to address the economic crisis that, in his estimation, would turn the Soviet Union into a prosperous nation.\nGlasnost \u2013 The political openness \u2013 gave a degree of freedom to citizens of the USSR. For instance, Now, Newspaper could print criticism of government policies\n\u2018Perestroika\u2019 or economic restructuring \u2013 By enabling private property ownership and business establishment while promoting foreign investment in Soviet businesses, it renounced the former command economy doctrine.\nHowever, these changes were too little, too late. Gorbachev\u2019s new policies appeared to have no effect other than rationing, food shortages, and long lines for necessities, fueling discontent with his regime.\nThe rise of nationalism among countries like Russia, Baltic republics (Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania), Ukraine, Georgia etc is the most important and immediate cause of the disintegration of the USSR.\nCommunist Party members put Gorbachev under house arrest on August 18, 1991, citing \u201cbad health\u201d as their justification. State of emergency was proclaimed by the coup leaders.\nAfter some time, Gorbachev was released and he travelled to Minsk to negotiate a separation agreement( Belavezha Accords) from the USSR with the presidents of Belarus and Ukraine. After a summit in Alma-Ata, modern-day Kazakhstan, additional Soviet Republics in Central Asia joined them a few weeks later.\nOn December 25, 1991, Mikhail Gorbachev tendered his resignation as the last premier of the Soviet Union.\n\nThere was no longer a Union of Soviet Socialist Republics. From 1991 to 1999, Boris Yeltsin presided as Russia\u2019s first president.\n\nConsequences of the disintegration of the USSR:\n\nBirth of 15 new republics including Central Asian countries \u2013 Kazakhstan, Kyrgyz Republic, Tajikistan, Turkmenistan, and Uzbekistan.\nEnd of the Cold War: End of the arms race, end of ideological confrontations.\nChange in power equations: Unipolar world, capitalist ideology, IMF, World Bank etc.\n\nIt was in 1991 that the Cold War came to an end with the disintegration of the USSR.\n\nContemporary Boundary Problems\n\nIn the world, there are still several ongoing boundary disputes, including:\n\nEthiopia \u2013 Eritrea issue was solved in 2012 and The birth of South Sudan in 2012.\nFrance \u2013 Madagascar dispute in the Indian Ocean\nBorder disputes between India and China, China and Taiwan, China and Hong Kong, China in the South China Sea (9-dash line dispute), and\nThe boundary conflicts between India and Pakistan and India and Nepal\nThe conflict between the UK, Mauritius, Maldives, and Seychelles regarding Chagos Island.\nConflict in Lebanon, Syria, Iraq, and numerous more Middle Eastern nation\nThe Israeli-Palestinian conflict\nThe Nagorno-Karabakh conflict between Azerbaijan and Armenia.\nA territorial dispute sparked the Russia-Ukraine war.\nThe Kuril Islands: Russia and Japan, etc\n\nSouth Sudan, which separated from Sudan in 2011, is the youngest state in the world. Bavaria, North Cyprus, Belize, Tibet, French-speaking Quebec in Canada, and other places also claim to have had an independence movement.\n\nSeparatist movements can be found across three continents.\n\nThe number of countries in the United Nations has grown from 51 recognized states in 1945 to 193 states today. Hence redrawing of the boundaries of and demand for new separate countries is still ongoing.\n\nRelated Articles:\n\nSecurity Challenges and Their Management in Border Areas\nCross-Border Insolvency\nIndia\u2019s Connectivity Projects\nCarbon Border Adjustment Mechanism (CBAM)\nIndia-China Border Disputes \u2013 What is the Doklam Issue?\n\nArticle written by: Ankit Sharma"

In historical context, the term renaissance refers to the significant changes in Europe during the transition period between the medieval and modern periods.\u00a0\n\nThe term renaissance was first used in the 16th century in Italy, referred to the changes seen in architecture and sculpture and, in the 18th century, it was used for new creations in art and architecture.\n\nAccording to J.E.S. Swain, the word Renaissance is a collective term used to include all the intellectual changes that were in evidence at the close of the Middle ages and at the beginning of modern times.\n\nAccording to the historian Jules Micilate, Renaissance referred to two such factors that incorporate all the informative efforts of the Renaissance. Those two factors are \u201d The discovery of the world\u201d and \u201d The discovery of the man\u201d.\n\nFrom the different views of different historians, it is clear that the Renaissance was such an intellectual and cultural movement that liberated man from medieval bondage and became free to express their independent thinking.\n\nTable of Contents\n\nItaly: The birthplace of Renaissance\nRenaissance in Europe\nThe Renaissance Period\nCharacteristics of Renaissance\nCauses of Renaissance in Europe\nImpact of Renaissance\nResult of Humanism\nItaly: The birthplace of Renaissance\n\nThe idea of the Renaissance originated from Italy.

But certain circumstances held during the 13th to 16th century enlightened the men and this enlightenment and consciousness are called Renaissance.\n\nThe growth of logic changed the approach of people towards life and they rejected the conservatism of the church, and the exploitation of feudal lords and began to breathe freely. The man with this consciousness gave importance to the ideals and values, which was neglected during the medieval period.\n\nThe Renaissance Period\n\nIt is considered that it is between 1350 A.D. to 1550 A.D. period that cultural and intellectual changes were seen.\n\nCharacteristics of Renaissance\n\nThere are several characteristics associated with Renaissance.\n\nRenaissance encouraged logical and rational thinking and redeemed people from the grip of the religious tradition of the medieval period.\nThe importance of human life was accepted.\nShowed development in regional languages and worldly literature.\nDuring this period, new geographical discoveries took place.\nA new experiment was emphasized to verify the ideology which led to the inventions of human utilities.\nThe worship of natural beauty was an attribute of the Renaissance.\nCauses of Renaissance in Europe\n\nRenaissance was an impact of several impacts that took place in European countries from time to time. Some of the important events were:\n\nCrusades: The wars between the Muslim world (Seljuk Turks) and the Christian world that took place between the 11th Century and to 13th Century on the issue of the holy pilgrimage Jerusalem are called the crusades. As a result, European came in touch with the East and saw the rich civilization and culture of the East. The Arabs enriched their civilization with their contact with the Greeks and Indians. The contact with Arabians inspires Europeans to change their lifestyle based on religion and also encouraged them to travel and study geography.\n\nCommercial Prosperity: The biggest cause of the Renaissance was the expansion of trade.\n\nDiscovery of Paper and Printing Machines: The Europeans learned paper-making art from the Arabians in the Medieval Period and the invention of the typing machine paved the path of intellectual development.\n\nGrowth of Humanism: The humanist writers of this age were more interested in the pleasure and sorrow of living beings rather than the church. The main aim was not only to serve god or to show any military achievement but to live for the welfare of the people. Francisco Petrarch (1321-1374 A.D.) who wrote love songs in the local dialect Tucson, was the first to represent Renaissance as a humanist, so he is begin called the \u201cFather of Humanism\u201d.\n\nImpact of Renaissance\n\nThe renaissance period not only influenced literature, art, and science but every aspect of human life.\n\nIn the field of Literature: Prior to Renaissance, the creation of literature was only in Latin and Greek language. But the regional languages, literature, teaching, and learning were developed during the Renaissance period. Moreover, religious themes were also replaced by human activities.\n\nIn the Field of Art: The independent style was developed leaving behind the old traditions. During this period, the painters did not overlook the religious themes but their representation of painting was humanist and worldly.\n\nIn the Field of Science: Renaissance provided an opportunity to be free from the control of the church and to think independently. As Francis Bacon said, knowledge can be gained only by observation and experiments. The age of the Scientific Revolution came in Europe in the 16th Century.\u00a0 As Isaac Newton astonished the world with his \u201cTheory of Gravity\u201d. The French Mathematician and Philosopher Descartes brought the use of mathematics in Geometry and the Italian Galileo (1564-1642) discovered the theory of the pendulum, barometer, and telescope.\n\nHumanism: The influence of the Renaissance was more on the attitude of man. Now the interest of man changed from the god to the man. The humanist thinkers rejected the asceticism and spiritualism of the religious texts and accepted beauty, human love, and material pleasure as the essence of life.\n\nResult of Humanism\n\nThere were several outcomes of this period.\n\nGrowth of the Spirit of Expression: Renaissance made man free to listen and convey his own voice and not to be bound and work according to the orders of the king and the pope.\n\nGrowth of Materialistic Vision: Renaissance made the man materialistic as the religious centralised civilization changed to modern human centralized civilization.\n\nGrowth of Scientific Approach: The profound impact of religion on the human mind was thrown out by the Renaissance and compelled him for future reforms. The development of the intellectual approach tested the beliefs and prevailing practices of Christianity on the basis of logic and rationality.\n\nDisenchantment with the Past: Now there was no interest in past knowledge among the people of the medieval period.\n\nGrowth of Nationalism: It reduced the impact of the pope and church, which led to the growth of a nationalistic feeling among the people. This national feeling increased the interest to raise the power of their nation.\n\nArticle Written By: Priti Raj"

Read here to know the concepts of fascism and nazism, as well as a comparison between the two ideologies.\n\nThe ideologies of Fascism and Nazism were fueled by the deep-seated anxieties of the ruling elites as well as significant portions of the middle and lower classes about social and political collapse and political revolution.\n\nFascism and Nazism were also characterized by the worship of certain personalities, the use of violence, and the rejection of both communism and democracy.\n\nTable of Contents\n\nFascism\nRise of fascism in Italy\nBenito Mussolini\nNazism\nRise of Nazism in Germany\nAdolf Hitler\nDifference between Fascism and Nazism\nFascism\n\nThe word fascism is an Italian word that means \u201cbundle.\u201d\n\nIn politics, it denotes a \u201cUnion\u201d or \u201cLeague.\u201d It is a political ideology that supports a dictatorial, hierarchical system of administration as opposed to democracy or liberalism.\n\nExtreme nationalism, ethnic discrimination, support for violence and war, gender discrimination against women, and unrepentant hate of socialism were all characteristics of this far-right style of governance.\n\n\ud83d\udc49 Which year are YOU targeting for success in the IAS/IPS/IFS Exam? \ud83d\ude80\n\n(1) \u21d2 UPSC 2025: Prelims cum Mains\n\n(2) \u21d2 UPSC 2026: Prelims cum Mains\n\n(3) \u21d2 UPSC 2027 Prelims cum Mains\n\nTip: Know more about ClearIAS Courses (Online/Offline)\n\nThe tenets of fascism are:\n\nNationalism with or without expansionism:\n\nOne of fascism\u2019s main pillars is nationalism. The fascist idea of a nation is that it is a single organic entity that unites individuals by their shared lineage.\nTo achieve a millenarian national rebirth that exalts the nation above all else and fosters attributes of unity, strength, and purity, the philosophy attempts to overcome economic, social, and political issues.\n\nTotalitarianism:\n\nFascism is characterized by the state\u2019s totalitarian rule. It opposes liberal democracy and favors one-party governments because they believe they will be better for the country than multi-party ones.\nA fascist regime pursues policies of societal indoctrination through propaganda in the media and schools, and it controls the creation of educational and media content to accomplish this.\nSuch measures are taken to eliminate viewpoints that conflict with those of the state.\n\nEconomy:\n\nBoth socialism and free-market capitalism were rival ideologies that fascism offered as alternatives. Self-sufficiency was a key goal of the economic control that was promoted by fascism.\nTo ensure national solidarity, it promoted resolving domestic class struggles within a country.\nFascist economics encouraged a state-run system of production that accepted a mix of private and public ownership.\nBoth the public and private sectors were subject to economic planning, and the success of the former hinged on its willingness to align its objectives with those of the latter.\nThe national interest was prioritized over private profit in fascist economic theory, which backed the profit motive.\n\nAction:\n\nFascism has a strong emphasis on direct action, which encourages and accepts political violence as a legitimate form of protest.\nSocial Darwinism, which holds that a perceived superior race has the right to rule over races who are seen to be weaker, is the foundation of fascism\u2019s support for violent action.\n\nIt was first used for the movement which started in Italy under the leadership of Benito Mussolini. He had organized armed gangs against socialists and communists in 1919.\n\nRise of fascism in Italy\n\nWeak governance and economic hardship characterized the time following World War I in 1919.\n\nEconomic prosperity in post-World War Europe had become even further of a pipe dream as a result of events like the Russian Revolution and the Great Depression. The effects were more obvious in Germany and Italy. Fascism and Nazism were born out of this aftermath.\n\nThe well-being of the agricultural and industrial workers, whose working circumstances were abject misery, was not given much attention by the Italian government. Instead, to win colonies, it dragged Italy into the First World War.\n\nThe peace treaties fell short of Italian expectations. During the war, almost 7 lakh Italians perished and the people\u2019s circumstances had gotten even worse.\n\nThe current system was in danger due to the Italian socialist movement\u2019s growing power. And the Capitalists and landlords controlled Italian politics at the time.\n\nTo fulfill their colonial desires and protect themselves from the dangers of socialism, these segments started to support anti-democratic movements.\n\nBenito Mussolini\n\nMussolini returned after serving in the Italian army during World War I in search of a means of bringing the Italian people together.\n\nHe started giving stirring speeches in 1918, pleading for a dictator to rule the nation. He maintained that Italy\u2019s post-war widespread unemployment, tumultuous political party rivalries, and socialist and communist strikes could only be solved by a strong leader who could unite the populace.\n\nMilan, a city in northern Italy, was where Mussolini organized his fascist movement in 1919.\n\nHe organized groups of black-shirted street combatants.\nHis \u201cBlackshirts\u201d attacked socialists and communists, removing them from local governments, and then beating them up.\n\nOnly two years prior, Russia underwent a communist revolution. Anti-communist businessmen, property owners, and middle-class professionals like teachers and doctors swiftly joined Mussolini\u2019s fascist organization.\n\nMussolini founded the National Fascist Party in 1921. He still lacked a definite fascist platform, though. He was certain of one thing only: he desired to dominate Italy.\n\nIn October 1922, he organized a march on Rome. The government of Italy did not show any sign of resistance against the volunteers of Mussolini.\n\nInstead, the king of Italy invited Mussolini to join the government. Thus without firing a shot, fascists under Mussolini\u2019s leadership came to power in Italy.\n\nAt age 39, Mussolini became Italy\u2019s youngest prime minister on October 29, 1922.\nThe takeover of the government by fascists was followed by a reign of terror.\n\nMussolini was now Il Duce (ihl DOO chay), or the leader.\n\nHe abolished democracy and outlawed all political parties except the Fascists.\nSecret police jailed his opponents.\u00a0Government censors forced radio stations and publications to broadcast or publish only Fascist doctrines. Mussolini outlawed strikes.\nHe sought to control the economy by allying the Fascists with the industrialists and large landowners.\nIn 1935, Mussolini ordered the invasion of Ethiopia, a poor African country that had once humiliated Italy in battle.\n\nIn 1939, Mussolini and Hitler signed the so-called \u201cPact of Steel,\u201d which committed each country to come to the aid of the other in war.\n\nA few months later, Hitler invaded Poland and set off World War II. Mussolini, however, delayed joining Hitler until Nazi troops were just about to defeat France in June 1940.\n\nThen, Mussolini decided to attack Greece. However, his army suffered a terrible defeat and needed German forces to rescue it.\n\nHe dispatched 200,000 of his forces in 1941 to assist Hitler in invading the Soviet Union. Numerous German and Italian soldiers were slain by the brutal winter and Soviet guerilla fighters.\n\nBy 1943, Mussolini\u2019s army had been routed in North Africa, Sicily had been seized, and Rome had been destroyed. The Italian people gave up on Il Duce because they had had enough.\n\nAfter Mussolini\u2019s own Grand Council decided to call for his resignation, King Victor Emmanuel issued an order for his arrest and incarceration. However, German commandos assisted him in making his escape to Germany.\n\nHe returned to the north of Italy, close to Milan, a region that the Germans had seized, and formed a new fascist government. He was, however, nothing more than a Nazi puppet.\n\nMussolini attempted to flee as the Allies drew close to Milan. However, on April 28, 1943, Italian anti-fascist fighters arrested and killed him. Crowds rejoiced as Mussolini\u2019s body was hung by its heels the following day in Milan, where he had launched the fascist movement 25 years before.\n\nUnder His Leadership, Italy became the model for Fascists in other countries. However, Mussolini never had total control achieved by Joseph Stalin in the Soviet Union or Adolf Hitler in Germany.\n\nNazism\n\nNazism is a common word for National Socialism and is a far-right ideology.\n\nAdolf Hitler\u2019s National Socialist German Workers\u2019 Party promoted the far-right ideology of nazism, which emphasizes racial superiority and a totalitarian state.\n\nIt began in the 1920s and continued until 1945 when World War II concluded.\n\nNazism had many characteristics in common with Italian fascism, including passionate nationalism, widespread popularity, and authoritarian authority.\n\nNazism is a type of fascism that despises parliamentary government and liberal democracy. Hence, Fascism and Nazism are two sides of the same coin.\n\nIts ideology includes ardent anti-Semitism, anti-Communism, scientific racism, and the application of eugenics.\n\nPan-Germanism and the ethnic-nationalist neopagan V\u00f6lkisch movement, which had been a significant component of German nationalism since the late 19th century, were the origins of its extreme nationalism.\n\nIt was also greatly influenced by the paramilitary Freikorps groups that arose following Germany\u2019s defeat in World War I, from which the party\u2019s underlying \u201ccult of violence\u201d emerged.\n\nRise of Nazism in Germany\n\nThe outbreak of revolution in Germany towards the end of the First World War led to the collapse of the German monarchy.\n\nHowever, even though Germany became a republic, the forces behind the monarchy the industrialists, the big landowners, and the officers of the army remained quite powerful.\n\nThe government of the German republic was not able to destroy its power.\n\nThese forces began to turn to the anti-democratic forces represented by Nazism to extend their power and check the power of the socialist movement\n\nNazis capitalized on the sense of humiliation that many Germans felt at their defeat in the war and the unjust provisions of the Treaty of Versailles.\n\nThey also exploited the misery of the people which had worsened due to the reparations that Germany was made to pay to the Allied powers.\n\nIn 1929 occurred the most serious economic crisis affected all the capitalist countries of the world.\n\nAdolf Hitler\n\nHitler relocated to Munich at the end of the war. He joined a small right-wing political organization at the start of 1920. This group agreed with him that Germany needed to revoke the Versailles Treaty and fight communism.\n\nThe National Socialist German Workers\u2019 Party, or simply Nazi, was the group\u2019s later name. As a result of its policies, which were backed by members of the lower and middle classes, Nazism developed throughout Germany.\n\nThe swastika, or hooked cross, was chosen as the party\u2019s emblem. The stormtroopers, also known as Brownshirts, were a private militia established by the Nazis.\n\nHitler was appointed der F\u00fchrer, or the leader of the Nazi party, very quickly as a result of his prowess as a speaker and organizer. These abilities also contributed to the Nazis becoming a stronger political power.\n\nHitler and the Nazis planned to overthrow the government in Munich in 1923 after being inspired by Mussolini\u2019s march on Rome.\n\nHitler was detained after the failed attempt. He was tried for treason, but lenient judges only gave him a five-year prison term. He was there for fewer than nine months.\n\nHitler penned Mein Kampf imprisoned (My Struggle). His ideals for Germany were outlined in this book. It evolved into the Nazis\u2019 action plan or blueprint. Hitler claimed that the Germans were a \u201cmaster race,\u201d especially the blond and blue-eyed Germans, whom he mispronounces as \u201cAryans.\u201d He proclaimed the inferiority of non-Aryan \u201craces\u201d like Jews, Slaves, and Gypsies.\n\nBy 1932, the Nazis became the dominant political force. It was a mistake for conservative leaders to think they could control Hitler and manipulate him.\n\nThey encouraged President Paul von Hindenburg to appoint Hitler as chancellor in January 1933. They said that only Hitler was capable of defeating Germany\u2019s powerful Communist party. Hitler, therefore, gained power legitimately.\n\nHitler utilized his newfound authority to establish totalitarianism in Germany.\n\nAll opposition parties were outlawed, and he had opponents incarcerated. In the meantime, the SS (Schutzstaffel, or protection squad), an elite, all-black military force, was established. It only had loyalty to Hitler.\nHundreds of Hitler\u2019s opponents were detained and killed by the SS in 1934.\nThe majority of Germans were stunned into complete obedience by this horrific deed and the intimidation used by the Gestapo, the Nazi secret police.\n\nAnti-Semitism, or the hatred of Jews, played a significant role in Nazi philosophy. The Nazis exploited Jews as scapegoats for all of Germany\u2019s problems after the war, even though they made up less than one percent of the population.\n\nAnti-Semitism erupted as a result in Germany. The Nazis began passing legislation in 1933 that deprived Jews of the majority of their privileges.\nJews were increasingly being attacked. Nazi crowds attacked Jews on the night of November 9, 1938, destroying thousands of Jewish-owned structures while attacking them in their homes and the streets.\n\nIn 1939 Hitler attacked Poland and started World war II. As the defeat of Germany grew nearer in 1945, Hitler shot himself dead in his bunker.\n\nDifference between Fascism and Nazism\n\nFascism and Nazism have numerous similarities as they are ideologically the same, but they have differences too like:\n\nFascism\n\t\nNazism\n\n\nFascism advocates corporatizing all aspects of society to create an \u201cOrganic State.\u201d The state was a minor component of fascist ideas.\n\t\nRacism was a focus of Nazism. The concept promoted the idea that a state headed by members of a specific race\u2014in this case, the \u2018Aryan\u2019 race\u2014would be superior.\n\n\nThe class system was valued by fascism and preserved for a better social structure.\n\t\nA class-based society was seen by Nazism as a barrier to racial unification and was actively seeking to be eradicated.\n\n\nThe state was seen by fascism as a method of furthering nationalism.\n\t\nNazism saw the government as a means of preserving and advancing the master race.\n\n\nBenito Mussolini and Oswald Mosley are the notable leaders of Fascism\n\t\nAdolf Hitler and Joseph Mengele are famous Nazis\n\nRead: Neo-Fascism\n\n-Article written by Swathi Satish"

Lawfully, it is a system of objective laws that is rule of law, in contrast, to the rule of man. In financial terms, when such freedom is applied to the domain of production its result is the free market.\n\nCapitalism was first used by novelist William Makepeace Thackeray, in 1854 in his novel \u2018The Newcomes\u2019, where he described capitalism as \u201chaving ownership of capital and not as a system of production\u201d.\n\nCapitalism has three-level systems:\n\nOn the first level, the markets, firms compete to secure their labour and capital as well as to serve their customers.\nIn the second level, there are basic institutional foundations, including physical and social infrastructure; physical infrastructure includes, among other things, transportation and communications, and social infrastructure includes the educational, public health, and legal systems.\nThe third level comprises a political authority typically one with specialized functions such as executive, legislative, and judicial branches. In turn, a set of political institutions connect the political authority to the political markets and ultimately to civil society, to which such authority is finally responsible.\nTypes of capitalism\nMercantilism is a nationalist system that was practised in the later phase of the 16th century.\nIt is characterized by the mixing of national business interests with state interest and imperialism, and eventually, the state is utilized to improve national business interests abroad.\nMercantilism was determined by the belief that the prosperity of a nation is increased through a positive balance of trade with other nations.\nIt relates to the phase of capitalist development and is sometimes called the Primitive accumulation of capital.\nA free-market economy is described as a capitalist economic system where prices for goods and services are set freely by the forces of supply and demand and are allowed to reach their point of equilibrium without interference by government plans.\nA social market economy is a free-market system where government involvement in price formation is kept to a minimum but the state provides substantial services in the area of social security, unemployment benefits, and recognition of labour rights through national collective bargaining arrangements.\nRhine capitalism is described as the modern model of capitalism and adaptation of the social market model that exists in continental Western Europe today.\nState capitalism includes state ownership of the means of production within a state, and the organization of state enterprises as commercial, profit-seeking businesses.\nCorporate capitalism refers to a free or mixed-market economy categorized by the supremacy of hierarchical, bureaucratic corporations.\nA mixed economy is a mainly market-based economy consisting of both private and public ownership of the means of production and economic interventionism through macroeconomic policies intended to correct market failures, reduce unemployment and keep inflation low.\nEffect of capitalism on society\nCapitalism ensures economic growth as it empowers both manufacturers and consumers and keeps money in rotation.\nIt ensures the accessibility of goods and services at a competitive price and helps to improve the standard of living in the country.\nCapitalism paved the wave for LPG reforms in the world and provided opportunities for the labor force to opt for global employment opportunities, which have further shrunk the global boundaries.\nBut capitalism leads to unequal distribution of wealth- rich get richer and poor get poorer.\n\nAlso read: Crony Capitalism\n\nPolitical Philosophies: Socialism\n\nSocialism is a political and economic ideology that believes in the public ownership of means of production and distribution based on a plan formulated by a central authority.\n\nIn socialism, the class that produces the wealth can jointly decide how it will be used for the benefit of all. Real socialism is characterized as democratic and it is economic as well as political.\n\nSocialism depends altogether upon the history of mankind for a record of its growth in the past and bases its future upon knowledge of that history in so far as it can be accurately traced up to the present time.\n\nSocialism was initiated in the late 18th century by a knowledgeable and working-class political movement that disapproved of the effects of industrialization and private ownership on civilization.\n\nThe main features of socialism are:\n\nPublic ownership\nCentral planning\nDefinite socio-economic objectives\nFreedom of consumption\nEqual income distribution\nRegulated pricing process\nTypes of socialism\nDemocratic Socialism promotes the principles of Socialism as an economic principle which signifies that the means of production should be in the hands of ordinary working people and equality as a governing principle.\nMarxian socialism denotes a particular historical phase of financial development and its corresponding set of social relations that ultimately overtake capitalism in the plan of historical materialism.\nFrom this perspective, socialism is described as a mode of production where the principle for production is use-value, where production for use is coordinated through conscious economic planning and the law of value no longer directs economic activity.\nRevolutionary Socialism supports the need for essential social change through revolution or revolution instead of gradual reform as a strategy to attain a socialist society.\nUtopian Socialism describes the first streams of modern socialist thought in the first quarter of the 19th Century. It was used by later socialist thinkers to define early socialist, or quasi-socialist, intellectuals who created hypothetical visions of perfect egalitarian and communalist societies without actually concerning themselves with how these societies could be created or sustained.\nLibertarian Socialism develops a society without political, economic, or social hierarchies, in which every person would have free, equal access to tools of information and production.\nMarket Socialism is a type of economic system in which there is a market economy directed and guided by socialist developers, and where prices are set through trial and error rather than relying on a free price tool.\nEco-Socialism is a philosophy that combines aspects of Marxism, Socialism, Green politics, ecology, and the anti-globalization movement. They focus on collective ownership of the means of production, to alleviate the social barring, poverty, and environmental deprivation brought about by the capitalist system, globalization, and colonialism.\nEffect of socialism on society\nCreates a welfare society where all the basic needs of people (food, clothes, and shelter) are fulfilled by the State at very affordable prices.\nProviding employment is the State\u2019s responsibility based on capabilities, education, and skills.\nAll the profits go to the State, which utilizes them for the well-being of the society by providing them with free education, improving public health amenities, ensuring social security, etc.\nEstablishes the supremacy of the State, which may lead to authoritarianism.\nLack of checks and balances in the bureaucracy leads to increased corruption in society.\nPeople lack the fundamental right of freedom to choose what they want to consume and what and where they want to work.\nSocialism demeans their ability to grow economically in careers as people do not work for personal growth but under the fear of the State.\nPolitical Philosophies: Communism\n\nIn layman\u2019s terms, communism is the political system in which the community owns and controls entities like factories, farms, services, etc. intending to treat everyone equally.\n\nCommunism is based on the goal of eliminating socioeconomic class struggles by creating a classless and stateless society in which everyone shares the benefits of labour and the community controls all property and wealth.\n\nIt is a form of government most closely associated with the ideas of Karl Marx, a German philosopher, which he outlined in\u00a0The Communist Manifesto (1848).\n\nMarx believed that capitalism, with its emphasis on profit and private ownership, led to inequality among citizens. Thus, his goal was to encourage a system that promoted a classless society in which everyone shared the benefits of labour and the community (communes) controlled all property and wealth. No one would strive to rise above others, and people would no longer be motivated by greed. Then, communism would close the gap between rich and poor, end the exploitation of workers, and free the poor from oppression.\n\nThe basic ideas of communism did not originate with Marx. Plato and Aristotle discussed them in ancient times, but Marx developed them into a popular doctrine following modern times, which was later put into practice.\n\nMarx\u2019s ideal society ensured economic equality and fairness. Marx believed that private ownership of property promoted greed, and he blamed capitalism for society\u2019s problems. The problems, he claimed, stemmed from the Industrial Revolution. The rise of factories, the reliance on machines, and the capability of mass production created conditions that promoted oppression and encouraged the development of a proletariat or a working class.\n\nFor a large part of the 20th century, about one-third of the world lived in communist countries ruled by dictatorial leaders who controlled the lives of everyone else.\n\nThe communist leaders set the wages, they set the prices, and they distributed the wealth. Western capitalist nations fought hard against communism, and eventually, most communist countries collapsed.\n\nMarx\u2019s utopia was never achieved, as it required revolution on a global scale, which never became a reality. As of today, five proclaimed communist countries continue to exist: North Korea, Vietnam, China, Cuba, and Laos.\n\nTypes of communism\nMarxism is a perspective that involves several differing \u201csub-perspectives\u201d that is, whilst there tends to be a general agreement about the need to construct a critique of Capitalist society, there are major differences between theorists working within this viewpoint.\nMarxism-Leninism is the Communist philosophical field that emerged amongst Communist parties in the 1920s during the era of Joseph Stalin (1878 \u2013 1953), with whom it is mainly associated.\nThe term \u201cMarxism-Leninism\u201d is the extent to which it follows the principles of either Marx or Lenin.\nThe philosophy of Leninism was built upon and extended the ideas of Marxism, and served as the theoretical foundation for the ideology of Soviet Communism after the Russian Revolution of 1917 and the establishment of the Soviet Union.\nStalinism is a more judgemental phrase for Joseph Stalin\u2019s vision of Communism. Supporters of this ideology argue that it includes widespread use of publicity to establish a personality cult around an absolute ruler, as well as extensive use of secret police to maintain social proposals and silence political opposition, all of which are trappings of totalitarianism.\nTrotskyism is the philosophical model of Marxism that was supported by Leon Trotsky (1879 \u2013 1940), who considered himself a conformist Marxist and Bolshevik-Leninist and squabbled for the establishment of a frontline party.\nHis politics differed from the Marxism-Leninism of Joseph Stalin, concerning support for an international proletarian revolution and firm support for a true dictatorship.\nThe most dominant characteristic of Trotskyism is the theory of permanent uprising to explain how socialist revolutions could happen in societies.\nLuxemburgism is a theoretical model of Communism, which is based on the texts of Rosa Luxemburg (1870 \u2013 1919). Her politics deviated from those of Lenin and Trotsky mainly in her discrepancy with their concept of \u201cdemocratic centralism\u201d, which she visualized as unsatisfactorily democratic.\nLuxemburgism looks like Anarchism in its averting of an authoritarian society by relying on the people themselves as opposed to their leaders.\nMaoism is slightly different from Communism and is derived from the teachings of the Chinese leader Mao Zedong (or Mao Tse-tung) (1893 \u2013 1976), and practised in the People\u2019s Republic of China after the Chinese Revolution of 1949.\nMaoism evolved from the Marxism-Leninism of Stalin but introduced new ideas such as social imperialism (Mao accused the Soviet Union of dominating and exploiting the smaller countries in its sphere by organizing their economies around Soviet, not domestic, needs), the Mass Line (a method of leadership that seeks to learn from the masses and immerse the political headship in the concerns and conditions of the masses \u201cfrom the masses to the masses\u201d), people\u2019s war and new democracy.\nEffect of communism on society\nThe philosophy of communism supports a society without rulers, but until it is achieved all the power will lie with the dictator government, which will lead to oppression. For example, the Rule of Hitler and the event of the holocaust during World War\u00a0II.\nIn communist nations, the difference between the official claims and societal realities is different. The dictatorial government controls the information and every sort of communication channel that cut-offs the society from the outside world.\nConclusion\n\nToday, the historical words\u00a0capitalism,\u00a0socialism, and\u00a0communism\u00a0do not fully capture the economic systems of nations. New words are also used to describe economic systems-\u00a0free market system;\u00a0mixed economy;\u00a0command economy. In other words, communism, socialism, and capitalism are in sync with modern national economics falling somewhere in the middle, or mixed zone of the different types of economies.\n\nUltimately, nations and citizens of nations must decide how much government regulation of the economy is appropriate. Therefore, a clear understanding of the historical developments, meanings, political associations, and synonyms of these three words is essential.\n\nAlso read:\u00a0Economic nationalism; Neo-Fascism"

The princely states were autonomous and others were directly ruled by the Holy Roman emperor.\n\nThe system of having small states within the empire was called \u201cpractice of\u00a0kleinstaaterei\u201d or \u201cpractice of small states\u201d. The onset of the Industrial Revolution improved transportation and communication, bringing far-flung regions in close contact with each other.\n\nThe Holy Roman Empire was dissolved in 1806 with the abdication of Emperor Francis II during the Napoleonic Wars. But the administrative disruption has little effect on German-speaking regions which were connected by the linguistic and cultural basis.\n\nBut the Napoleonic wars introduced liberal and nationalistic thoughts to the intellectuals and slowly the wave of nationalism began to spread.\n\nRise of German nationalism\n\nAfter Napoleon\u2019s defeat, the Congress of Vienna (1815) established a new European political-diplomatic system based on the balance of power.\n\nIt established a confederation of German states under the leadership of the Austrian Empire. The Austrians maintained their own influence over the German states and suppressed any expression of German nationalism.\n\nDuring the early nineteenth century, Prussia and Austria were rivals;\u00a0this is because Prussia was the only German state that could match the power and influence of the Austrian Empire.\n\nAnother institution key to unifying the German states, the\u00a0Zollverein, helped to create a larger sense of economic unification in 1834.\n\nAustria opposed the idea of German unification as it saw this as a threat to its own empire. But Austria eventually joined the Zollverein in 1853.\n\nThe Berlin Revolution of 1848\n\nFrom 1830 to 1848, there was going on persistent agitation in the smallest States of Germany.\n\nThe object of the agitation was two-fold, viz., the unification of Germany and the establishment of constitutional and liberal governments in the States.\n\nOn 27 March 1849, the\u00a0Frankfurt Parliament\u00a0passed the\u00a0Constitution of St. Paul\u2019s Church) and offered the title of\u00a0Kaiser\u00a0(Emperor) to the Prussian king\u00a0Frederick William IV.\n\nThe Frankfurt Parliament did manage to draft a constitution and reach an agreement on the\u00a0kleindeutsch\nWhile the liberals failed to achieve the unification they sought, they did manage to gain a partial victory by working with the German princes on many constitutional issues and collaborating with them on reforms.\n\nThe failure of the Frankfurt Parliament convinced the Germans that some other method had to be followed to bring about the unification of the country.\n\nIn the Seven Weeks War (1866) Prussia dealt a heavy blow to Austria and its German allies. So profound was the victory that it ended Austrian interference in German matters and allowed Prussia to lay the foundations of its own empire.\n\nCongress of Princes 1868 (German Bund)\n\nIn 1868, Austria summoned a Congress of the German prince to consider proposals for the reform of the German Confederation, and Prussia was also invited.\n\nIf the move of Austria had been successful, the Austrian influence in Germany would have continued. Bismarck prevailed upon the King of Prussia not to attend the conference and the latter ended in failure.\n\nFranco-Prussian War of 1870-1871\n\nFrance was ruled by Napoleon III, the nephew of Napoleon Bonaparte. Otto von Bismarck as the Prime Minister of Prussia provoked France to attack Prussia.\n\nThe resulting war would prove devastating for France with the most notable defeat being at Sedan in September 1870.\n\nThe Treaty of Frankfurt: As a result of the Franco-Prussian war, France lost the territory of\u00a0Alsace-Lorraine\u00a0on its border with Germany. It also had to pay Germany \u00a3200 million in compensation. A new imperial constitution was set up within the now unified German states, with William I as Emperor (Kaiser) and Prussia firmly in control.\n\nIn the build-up to war, the southern confederate German states voluntarily joined the Prussian-controlled Northern German Confederation. Germany was now unified.\n\nSignificance of Unification of Germany\n\nThe Unification of Germany was a watershed moment in European history. With the arrival of a new unified German nation onto European politics, the political scenario of the region was seeing a major change in balance, and other powers became cautious.\n\nUnified Germany boasted of a powerful army and the fact that it successfully brought together a legion of quarreling states under one state in a short span of time.\n\nThe new German state expanded its reach to colonizing regions in Africa and Asia which brought it in conflict with other European powers.\n\nThe animosity between Germany, Britain, France, and Russia parked fires during the First world war which eventually ended the German Empire through the Treaty of Versailles (1919)."

Napoleon\u2019s fall in 1815 again divided the city-states and the empire of Austria began to accumulate power.\n\nThe Italian intellectuals\u2019 fuelled by nationalism by the revolution began to raise their voices again the foreign involvement in Italy and a series of insurrections began to drive out foreign rule.\n\nCongress of Vienna (1815):\n\nThe Congress of Vienna was an international diplomatic effort to reconstitute Europe after the fall of Napoleon.\n\nThey restored the pre-Napoleonic system of several independent governments and again the Austrians and Hapsburgs became powerful.\n\nThe Italian people were not happy with this restoration of absolute monarchy hence leading to underground movements for freedom.\n\nSeveral ideas of unification appeared during this time like a confederation of states under the Pope; Giuseppe Mazzini wanted unification under a federal republic and confederation of states led by Piedmont and so on.\n\nUnification of Italy\n\nDuring the 1820s the Carbonari secret society tried to organize revolts in Palermo and Naples but with very little success, mainly because the Carbonari did not have the support of the peasants.\n\nGiuseppe Mazzini, a patriotic writer set up a national revolutionary movement known as Young Italy (1831).\u00a0Mazzini was in favor of a united republic.\u00a0His ideas spread quickly among large segments of the Italian population. Young Italy\u2019s revolutionary cells formed throughout the Italian peninsula.\n\nAfter 1830, revolutionary sentiment in favor of a unified Italy began to experience a resurgence, and a series of insurrections laid the groundwork for the creation of one nation along the Italian peninsula.\n\nRevolution of 1848:\n\nThe first revolt took place in the Kingdom of Sicily, which resulted in a constitution for the whole kingdom. A revolt in Rome forced Pope Pius IX to flee Rome and a republic was proclaimed.\n\nGiuseppe Garibaldi (1807-1848) was a revolutionary who had taken part in the 1848 insurrection but had to go into exile when it failed. Garibaldi would later emerge as the face of Italian unification during this period.\n\nFirst Italian War of Independence:\n\nThe\u00a0First Italian War of Independence\u00a0was fought by the\u00a0Kingdom of Sardinia\u00a0(Piedmont) and Italian volunteers against the\u00a0Austrian Empire\u00a0and other conservative states from 23 March 1848 to 22 August 1849 in the\u00a0Italian Peninsula.\n\nNumerous insurrections took place all over the peninsula, but in the end, they were all crushed by the monarchical powers.\n\nBut the idea and spirit of the resurgence did not die with this defeat.\n\nCount Cavour provided the leadership needed at this time. He was a modernizer interested in agrarian improvements, banks, railways, and free trade. He opened a newspaper as soon as censorship allowed it.\n\nHe became prime minister of Sardinia-Piedmont in 1852 and introduced modern ideologies of development. He encouraged trade and commerce, built railways, introduced the modern postal system and banking, patronized shipping, organized a new taxation system, curbed the power of the church, and reorganized the army on modern lines.\n\nIn 1855, the kingdom became an ally of Britain and France in the\u00a0Crimean War, which gave Cavour\u2019s diplomacy legitimacy.\n\nHe allied with Napoleon III and provoked the second Italian independence war of 1859 against Austria.\n\nRevolution of 1860:\n\nBy early 1860, only five states remained in Italy: the Austrians in Venetia, the Papal States (now minus the Legations), the newly expanded Kingdom of Piedmont-Sardinia, the Kingdom of the Two Sicilies, and San Marino.\n\nThe insurrection in 1860 became a success as Garibaldi and his army of Redshirts conquered the islands of Sicily and Naples.\n\nMeanwhile, the northern states had joined up with Piedmont-Sardinia and accepted Victor Emmanuel II as their King.\n\nGaribaldi handed Naples and Sicily to him in November 1860 and by 1861 Italy was declared a kingdom.\n\nVenetia\u00a0was added to Italy in 1866 when Prussia defeated Austria in the Seven Weeks\u2019 War. In that war, Italy sided with Prussia and Venetia was its reward.\n\nWhen the Franco-Prussian War broke out in 1870, Napoleon III had to withdraw his troops from Rome. The Italian government sent troops at once to take over Rome from the Pope. The citizens of Rome voted for a union with Italy which was declared the new capital city of Italy in 1871.\n\nThus, the Unification of Italy was completed.\n\nThe aftermath of the unification of Italy\n\nThe unification and governance were achieved entirely in terms of Piedmont\u2019s interest.\n\nThe new Kingdom of Italy was structured by renaming the old Kingdom of Sardinia and annexing all the new provinces into its structures. The first king was Victor Emmanuel II, who kept his old title.\n\nThe new constitution was Piedmont\u2019s old constitution. The document was generally liberal and was welcomed by liberal elements.\n\nIts anticlerical provisions were disliked in the pro-clerical regions such as Venice, Rome, Naples, and the island of Sicily. Cavour had promised there would be regional and municipal, local governments, but all the promises were broken in 1861.\n\nThe first decade of the kingdom saw savage civil wars in Sicily and in the Naples region, which were all suppressed.\n\nMany native Italians still showed dissatisfaction with the arrangement and there was always unrest in the kingdom which is also called Italian irredentism.\n\nItaly entered the First World War in 1915 to complete national unity. It remained neutral at first but eventually agreed to join the war against central powers after the Treaty of London was signed in 1915.\n\nItaly did not receive other territories promised by the Treaty of London, so this outcome was denounced as a \u201cMutilated victory\u201d. The expression \u201cMutilated victory\u201d was adopted by Benito Mussolini\u00a0which led to the\u00a0rise of\u00a0Italian Fascism, becoming the\u00a0propaganda of Fascist Italy.\n\nAfter World War II, the irredentism movement faded away in Italian politics.\n\nThe anniversary of the unification of Italy is celebrated every fifty years, on 17 March (the date of the proclamation of the Kingdom of Italy). The anniversary occurred in 1911 (50th), 1961 (100th), 2011 (150th), and 2021 (160th) with several celebrations throughout the country.\n\nRead:\u00a0India-Italy relations\n\n-Article by Swathi Satish"

This victory made Napoleon the first consul of the three-member group called the consulate that rules France.\n\nNapoleon I, the Emperor of France:\n\nThe constitutional amendment of 1802 made Napoleon the first consul for life, which was nothing less than a dictator. And then later in 1804, he crowned himself the emperor of France in an elaborate ceremony in the Notre Dame cathedral.\n\nNapoleonic wars (1803-1815):\n\nThese were a series of wars fought between France and a coalition of European powers. \u00a0The peace Napoleon had negotiated in 1802 was short-lived as by 1803 Britain had resumed war with France and they were later joined by Russia and Austria.\n\nBattle of Trafalgar (1805): Britain\u2019s naval victory at Trafalgar forced Napoleon to abandon his plans to invade England, and he turned his attention to Austro-Russian forces, which he defeated at the Battle of Austerlitz later that year in one of his greatest victories.\n\nTo defeat his British rivals through economic means, Napoleon came up with the Continental System in 1806, which blockaded European ports from British Trade. This combined with consequent victories over Russian and Austrian forces reinforced napoleon\u2019s fame as a great general.\n\nNapoleon gained new territories in the following years which gave him control of much of Europe. The Holy Roman Empire was ended, and Napoleon\u2019s relatives and loyalists were appointed as reigns in Italy, Naples, Spain, and Sweden, along with the Confederation of the Rhine, the new territories created by Napoleon.\n\nAdministrative reforms by Napoleon:\n\nHe tried to restore stability by centralizing the government and introducing reforms in education, banking, encouraging arts and sciences.\n\nNapoleonic code (21st\u00a0March 1804) Napoleon instituted the Napoleonic Code, also known as the French Civil Code.\n\nIt forbade privileges based on birth, allowed freedom of religion, and stated that government jobs must be given to the most qualified\nIt included criminal code, military code & code of civil procedure, and commercial code.\nThe Napoleonic Code followed Napoleon\u2019s new constitution, which had created the first consul.\nHe abolished serfdom and feudalism.\n\nNapoleon established an elaborate education system called lyc\u00e9es, which promoted universal education without class and creed bias.\n\nPersonal life:\n\nHe married Josephine, a 32-year widow at the age of 26, though he later annulled the marriage as it was childless.

But when later he crowned himself the emperor of France, the public became wary of his ways.\n\nThe Continental system devised by him to blockade British trade wasn\u2019t very successful and in the end, backfired.\n\nPeninsular War (1807\u20131814): It was the war between coalition Spain, the United Kingdom, and Portugal against the invading and occupying forces of France for control of the\u00a0Iberian Peninsula\u00a0during the\u00a0Napoleonic Wars. Napoleon was defeated here.\n\nInvasion of Russia:\u00a0 The\u00a0great French dominion collapsed\u00a0rapidly after the disastrous invasion of Russia in 1812. Napoleon failed to conquer Russia in 1812 for several reasons: faulty logistics, poor discipline, disease, and not the least, the weather.\n\nNapoleon\u2019s forces were again defeated in 1813 during the Battle of Leipzig by a coalition force of Austrian, Prussian, Russian, and Swedish troops. He was forced to abdicate his throne when the coalition forces captured Paris.\n\nHe was exiled to the island of Elba off the coast of Italy while his wife and son were sent to Austria.\n\nBattle of Waterloo, 1815:\n\nOn February 26, 1815, Napoleon escaped to mainland France, where he was welcomed to Paris by cheering crowds.

It started in 1789 and ended in 1799.\n\nThe French Revolution was a time of social and political upheaval in France and its colonies.

But this economic growth wasn\u2019t visible as the country was still very backward socially and politically.\n\nThe social divide was because it was still divided into feudal classes of people clergy, those who pray, nobles, those who fight, and the peasants, the working class. And political backwardness was because they were still ruled by an absolute monarch who believed in the divine right of kings.\n\nBut the French involvement in the American Revolution of 1776 was a costly affair and the extravagant lifestyle of King Louis XVI and the royal family was draining the coffers. The empty royal coffers, poor harvests, and rise in food prices had created feelings of unrest among the poor rural and urban populace. The matter was further worsened by the imposition of taxes that provided no relief.

They were exempted from payment of taxes to the State.\nThe Third Estate consisting of peasants and workers formed the majority of the population. They were burdened with excessive taxes with no political and social rights. As a result, they were extremely discontent.\nThe economic drain was falling heavy n the shoulders of the working class increasing the hostility:\nLouis XVI waged many wars making the State coffers were empty.\nThe situation was made even more complex by France\u2019s involvement in the American War of Independence and the faulty system of taxation.\nThe extravagant lifestyle of the royals added to the financial burden.\nThe unstable political situation: The situation was very unstable because the Bourbon king of France, Louis XVI was an extremely autocratic and weak-willed king who led a life of excessive luxury. This caused anger among the masses who were leading lives of extreme poverty and widespread hunger.\nThe 18th century brought a conscious change in the French thinkers who refused the \u2018Divine Rights Theory\u2019:\nPhilosophers like Rousseau rejected the paradigm of absolute monarchy and promulgated the doctrine of equality of man and sovereignty of people.\nThey played a pivotal role in exposing the fault lines of the old political system- \u2018the ancien regime\u2019, thus adding to the popular discontent.\nThe American Revolution also triggered the ideas of enlightenment and liberty among the intellectuals of the French society.\nTimeline of the French Revolution:\n1789: The meeting of the Estate Generals\nThe Estates-General was an assembly that represented the French nobility clergy and the middle class. They were called by Louis XVI to discuss the new tax measures in May 1789.\nThe third estate was already gathering support for their involvement in the decision-making body and voting rights during this time.\nThe middle class was in favour of the political and judicial reforms while the nobles did not want to give up their privileges. The talks with the third estate also failed.\nThe Tennis court oath: The third estate and their support formed the National Assembly and took an oath of office in June 1789 and vowed not to disperse until reforms have been initiated.\nSeeing no other option Louis XVI had to absorb the three assemblies into the new order.\n1789-92: The revolution\nThe national assembly continued in Versailles as the nation was gripped in fear and uncertainty which led to the insurgency.\nThis resulted in the taking of Bastille fortress on July 14, 1789. This event marked the beginning of the French Revolution.\nThe peasants revolted, attacked the houses of nobles and tax collectors, and the upper class was forced to flee for their lives. This period is called the period of Great Fear.\n1789: The Declaration of Rights of the Man\nThe National Assembly adopted the Rights of Man and of the Citizen on August 4, 1789. The charter was based on democratic principles, drawing from philosophical as well as political ideas of Enlightenment thinkers like Jena-Jacques Rosseau.\nThe French constitution was adopted on September 3, 1791. It was moderate in its stance by limiting the powers of the king, but it was not enough for the more radical members of the assembly, Robespierre who wanted Louis XVI to stand trial.\n1793-95: The Reign of Terror\nA group of insurgents attacked the royal residence in Paris and arrested\u00a0 Louis XVI on August 10, 1792\nThe following month many who were accused of being the \u2018enemies of the revolution\u2019 were massacred in Paris. The Legislative Assembly was replaced by the National Convention which proclaimed the establishment of the Republic of France and the abolition of the Monarchy.\nKing Louis XVI was condemned to death on January 21, 1793, and executed for treason. His wife, Marie Antoinette was also executed nine months later.\nThe execution of the king marked the beginning of the most violent and turbulent phase of the French Revolution \u2013 the Reign of Terror.\nThe National Convention was under the control of an extremist faction led by Robespierre. Under him, thousands were executed for suspected treason and counter-revolutionary activities.\nThe Reign of Terror ended after Robespierre\u2019s execution on July 28, 1794.\n1795: The end of the French Revolution\nOn August 22, 1795, the National Convention composed of moderates approved the creation of a new constitution that created France\u2019s bicameral legislature.\nA Directory, a five-member group was formed by the parliament, and an army was groomed under General Napoleon Bonaparte.\nThe Directory became corrupt and the army had more powers with them. A coup d\u2019\u00e9tat was staged by Napoleon himself, toppling them from power.\nNapoleon appointed himself \u201cfirst consul\u201d. The French Revolution was over and the Napoleonic era was about the begin.\nRole of women in the French Revolution:\n\nWomen in the Third Estate worked for a living and didn\u2019t have access to education or training. Only daughters of the noblewomen and richer sections of society had access to any education. The wages for women were lower than those of men. Women were also mostly homemakers, hence they had to do all the housework, care for children.\n\nBut during the Revolution, women played an active role in revolutionary activities. They started their own clubs and newspapers. One of the most famous political clubs was the Society of Revolutionary and Republican Women and they were disappointed by the Constitution of 1791 which designated them, passive citizens. This Society demanded equal political rights as men. They wanted to vote and stand in elections for political office.\n\nAfter the end of the revolution, the early revolutionary governments introduced many laws that improved the lives and status of women in society. Schools were created, and education was made compulsory for all girls. Marriage without consent was made illegal and divorce was made legal. Women were also allowed to be artisans and run small businesses.\n\nImpact of the French Revolution:\n\nThe French revolution brought fundamental social, political, and economic changes in the history of France.\n\nEnd of the social divide: The French Revolution destroyed the social discriminative class system in France and declared equality for all. This led to the rise of the middle class who had acquired education to positions of responsibility.\nDeclaration of rights of man: The constitutional assembly came out with the document of human rights which granted political liberty, like freedom of speech, press, association, worship, and ownership of property.\nRevolutionary ideas: The revolution gave birth to the revolutionary ideas of liberty, equality, and fraternity. These ideas started in France and spread to other areas like Italy, Germany, etc. promoting equality, freedom and democracy, and good governance. France became the birthplace of democracy.\nEnd of Monarchy: The Bourbon monarch that had ruled France for over 400 years came to end by the French revolution. The monarchy rule was abolished in 1792 and replaced it with the Republican form of Government. Although the Bourbon monarch was restored by the great powers after the\u00a0downfall of Napoleon, it could not survive beyond 1830 because the monarchs were already weakened by the changes caused by the French revolution.\nPolitical Parties: France became a multiparty state as a result of the revolution. The freedom of association led to the rise of political clubs such as the Jacobins, Cordeliers, etc that competed for power. These parties kept the government under check and balance by criticizing bad policies.\nParliamentary Democracy: The French revolution led to the revival of the parliament which was abandoned for a period of over 175 years. The revolution gave France a functional parliament with representatives who are democratically elected.\nConstitution and Rule of Law: The French revolution introduced the rule of law. Before 1789, France had no constitution to safeguard people\u2019s rights and freedom. The constitution clearly separated the executive, the judiciary, and the legislature.\nLand ownership: The revolution brought new reforms and changes to land ownership in France. Before the revolution, the land was dominated by the clergy and the nobles who exploited the peasants. The working class was given equal rights to possess the land.\nNational Guard: There was the formation of the National Guard that replaced the royal guard of the Bourbon monarchy. National Guard was the revolutionary army whose role was to protect the achievements of the French revolution.\n\nThe revolution achieved the good through a path of negatives nevertheless. There were losses of lives and properties, the reign of terror saw violence, the economy further declined to make the poor even poorer. The relationship between the church and the state deteriorated as the radical new laws and nationalization of church properties became a sour page.\n\nThe revolution also led to poor relationships between France and other states. Revolutionary ideas of the french revolution were threats to other powers and monarchs in Europe, hence, Britain, Russia, Prussia, Austria, and other countries allied against France in order to prevent the spread of revolutionary ideas to their countries.\n\nAlso read: Bastille Day\n\nGlobal impact of the French Revolution:\n\nThe French Revolution changed modern history forever and many nations took inspiration from the ideologies it gave birth to.\n\nThe suppressive monarchies were being challenged everywhere by the people.\n\nThe ideas of liberty and equality spread all around the world over the years through the French armies.\n\nThe French became the dominant force to be reckoned with as it radicalized the political and social system of the 18th century.\n\nThe French Revolution ended feudalism and made a path for future advances in individual freedoms, democratic principles, and equality of life."

The result was a new level of destitution of the urban working class.\n\nThe population boom did not have the food supply to sustain it for a long time, as decades of economic mismanagement and costly wars lead to chronic shortages in the vast country.\n\nBloody Sunday Massacre: In protest of the poor conditions, the working class marched to the winter palace of Tsar Nicholas II. The Russian troops were given orders by the Tsar to not shoot, but the large scale crowd intimidated the troops and they opened fire killing and wounding hundreds of protestors. This came to be called the Bloody Sunday massacre.\n\nThe massacre sparked the Russian revolution of 1905, as angry workers responded with a series of crippling strikes throughout the country. The strikes further threatened Russia\u2019s already fragile economy. Left with no choice, Nicholas II agreed to implement reforms, which would be known as the October manifesto.\n\nThough the autocracy became a constitutional monarchy, the Tsar had the final decision-making power which he misused. He repeatedly kept dismissing the Duma (Russian parliament) to delay reforms.\n\nWorld War I and decline of the Russian empire:\n\nRussia joined its Serbian, French, and British allies against the Central Powers of Austria, Germany, and Ottoman Turkey in August 1914 during World War I.\n\nRussia had not modernized its army even after the defeat in Russo Japanese war, and as a result, the war proved disastrous for Russia. Its casualties were far more than any other nation in the war.\n\nThe Russians were not enthusiastic about the war and the tension grew further when Tsar Nicholas decided to personally command the Eastern front in the war, Tsarina Alexandra was in charge of the governance and her German heritage made her unpopular among the people.\n\nAbove all, she was greatly under the influence of the self-styled \u2018holy man\u2019\u00a0Grigori Rasputin. She dismissed elected officials on his advice and governance fell into disarray along with mounting war causalities.\n\nRasputin was murdered by the nobles in 1916, but people\u2019s resentment against the monarchy was at its peak.\n\nFebruary Revolution (March, according to New style calendar):\n\nThe women textile workers in Petrograd led a citywide strike followed by riots over shortages of bread and fuel. Nearly 200,000 workers swarmed the streets. At first, the soldiers obeyed orders to shoot the rioters but later sided with them. The soldiers fired at their commanding officers and joined the rebellion.\n\nIt forced Tsar Nicholas II to abdicate his throne. A year later revolutionaries executed Nicholas and his family. The Tsarist rule of the Romanovs, which spanned over three centuries, had finally collapsed.\n\nThe leaders of the Duma established a temporary government under Alexander Kerensky, who decided to continue with the war. This decision to continue with the war cost him support from the army as well as civilians. Meanwhile, the Social revolutionaries, competing for power, formed soviets i.e. the local councils which consisted of workers, peasants, and soldiers.\n\nThe political scenario:\n\nVarious revolutionary movements grew in the Russian Society inspired the thoughts of Karl Marx. They had a belief that the industrial class of workers would overthrow the Tsar and then would form a\u00a0dictatorship of the\u00a0proletariat.\n\nIn 1903, the revolutionaries got split into two groups- Mensheviks and Bolsheviks.\n\nMenshevikswanted a broad base of popular support for the revolution.\nBolsheviks\u00a0wanted a small number of committed revolutionaries who could sacrifice everything for a Radical change.\n\nThe leader of the Bolsheviks was Vladimir Lenin. In the early 1900s, Lenin fled to Western Europe to avoid arrest by the Tsarist regime but maintained contact with other Bolsheviks.\n\nOctober Revolution (November, according to New style calendar):\n\nVladimir Lenin returned to Russia and led the communist revolutionaries to launch a coup against Kerensky\u2019s government.\n\nThe new government under Lenin was composed of a council of soldiers, peasants, and workers. The Bolsheviks and their allies occupied key locations across St. Petersburg and Russia as a whole and soon formed a new government with Lenin as its head and renamed themselves as the \u2018communist party\u2019. Lenin became the dictator of the world\u2019s first communist state.\n\nBolshevik government also decided to withdraw from the war.\u00a0 In March 1918 Russia and Germany signed the\u00a0Treaty of Brest-Litovsk in which Russia surrendered a large portion of its territory to Germany and its allies. The humiliating terms of this treaty caused widespread anger and objection to the policies of the Bolsheviks.\n\nThe Civil War (1918-1920):\n\nThe opponents of the Bolsheviks formed the White army and a civil war was waged between them and the Red Army of the Bolsheviks. Several countries of the West including the United States sent military aid and forces to Russia to help the White Army. The civil war and the famine that followed claimed 15 million lives in a three-year struggle.\n\nIn the end, the Red Army of the Bolsheviks won and formed a stronger government and a superstate called the Soviet Union.\n\nReforms by Lenin:\n\nIn March 1921, Lenin launched the New Economic Policy (NEP) in which he\u00a0temporarily put aside his plan for\u00a0a state-controlled economy and resorted to a\u00a0small-scale\u00a0version of capitalism.\n\nThe reforms under the NEP allowed peasants to sell their surplus crops instead of turning them over to the government. Individuals could buy and sell goods for profit.\nThe government kept control of major industries, banks, and means of communication, but it let some small factories, businesses, and farms operate under private ownership.\nLenin also tried to encourage foreign investment.\n\nRussia was a mixture of many nationalities and this was seen as an obstacle to national unity by the Communists. The Communist leaders also saw nationalism as a threat to unity and party loyalty.\n\nTo check nationalism, Lenin organized Russia into several self-governing republics (Soviets) under the central government.\nIn 1922, Russia was named the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics (USSR), in honour of the councils that helped launch the Bolshevik Revolution.\nThe new capital of the union was Moscow.\n\nIn 1924, the Communists created a constitution based on socialist and democratic principles with the Communist Party holding all the power. The new policies and peace that followed helped USSR slowly recover and by 1928, the country\u2019s farms and factories were producing as before World War I. The Soviet Union became a formidable player during the events of the Cold war in the coming decades."

Congress was ruling as the major voice of diverse India and till the second general elections, no major party was seen to emerge as a major opposition to Congress until the formation of Swantatra Party in 1959.\n\n\ud83d\udc49 Which year are YOU targeting for success in the IAS/IPS/IFS Exam? \ud83d\ude80\n\n(1) \u21d2 UPSC 2025: Prelims cum Mains\n\n(2) \u21d2 UPSC 2026: Prelims cum Mains\n\n(3) \u21d2 UPSC 2027 Prelims cum Mains\n\nTip: Know more about ClearIAS Courses (Online/Offline)\n\nIt can be considered as the first major liberal party of independent India that rose to prominence. It was formed on 4 June 1959, shortly after the Nagpur session of the Indian National Congress, C. Rajagopalachari, along with Murari Vaidya and Minoo Masani, a classical liberal and critic of socialist Nehru.\n\nTill the rise of Swatantra Party, right-wing groups and parties had existed earlier at the local and regional levels only. Swatantra\u2019s formation, however, was the first attempt to bring these highly fragmented right-wing forces together under the umbrella of a single party. The provocation for the formation of such a party was the left turn which the Congress took at Avadi (the Congress party itself adopted a resolution to establish a \u2018socialistic pattern of society\u2019 in its Avadi session as early as in 1955 and took measures accordingly.) and Nagpur sessions.\n\nAs Swatantra stood for a market-based economy with the \u201cLicence Raj\u201d dismantled, they formed a major voice against the socialist functioning of the then government. It was founded on the conviction that social justice and welfare can be attained through the fostering of individual interest and individual enterprise in all fields better than through State ownership and Government control.\n\nBy the next general election in 1967, Swatantra had become a significant force in some parts of India; it won 8.7%of votes and became the single largest opposition party in the 4th Lok Sabha (1967-1971) helping to balance the parliamentary democracy.\n\nTransfer and annexation of land between India and other foreign countries\n\nThe transfer of lands after the partition and inclusion of many foreign territories into India had not yet been done with. In 1960 we face an issue regarding the cessation of Beru-bari union.\n\nBeru-Bari Union Case\n\nWe know that India and Pakistan boundary was fixed by Sir Radcliffe and the line was called Radcliffe Line. However, some disputes arose because of the erroneous depiction of the maps by the Radcliffe Award. One of such disputes was Berubari Dispute. Radcliffe had divided the district of Jalpaigudi between India and Pakistan by awarding some thanas to one country and others to the other country. The boundary line was determined based on the boundaries of the thanas. In describing this boundary, Radcliffe omitted to mention one Thana. Berubari Union No. 12 lies within Jalpaigudi thana which was awarded to India. However, the omission of the Thana Boda and the erroneous depiction on the map enabled Pakistan to claim that a part of Berubari belonged to it. This dispute was resolved by Nehru-Noon Agreement of 1958, whereby half of Berubari Union No. 12 was to be given to Pakistan and the other half adjacent to India was to be retained by India. In addition, four Cooch Behar enclaves contiguous of this part would also have gone to Pakistan.\n\nNow the question arose, regarding the power of the parliament to transfer the territory of Berubari to Pakistan. This is where we come to learn about the Beru-Bari union case of 1960. And also, the famous 9th Constitutional Amendment Act. The matter whether parliament has the power to cede a region to a foreign country was brought to the supreme court. It declared that cessation to a foreign country would require special constitutional amendment procedures under Article 368 than the otherwise mentioned simple constitutional procedure mentioned in Article 4.\n\nYet another internal struggle that India had to face was regarding the inclusion of regions which were still under the foreign power.\n\nDadra and Nagar Haveli\n\nThe Portuguese ruled this territory until its liberation in 1954. Subsequently, the administration was carried on till 1961 by an administrator chosen by the people themselves. It was converted into a union territory of India by the 10th Constitutional Amendment Act, 1961.\n\nAnnexation of Goa\n\nIn 1961, after continual petitions for a peaceful handover, India invaded and annexed the Portuguese colony of Goa on the west coast. India acquired the three territories of Goa, Daman& Diu and formed them into a union territory.\n\nIndo-China War (1962)\n\nWhile integration and cessation of territories were going on one side, on the other side there were other major issues erupting to be faced by India. In the last video, we had discussed the Tibetan uprising and fleeing of Dalai Lama as one of the triggers for Indo-China war. Well, the year had finally come when things between us and China were to get worse. But before getting into that let us look into the actual matters leading to Indo-China War.\n\nThe battle was over the disputed borderland areas of Aksai chin and Arunanchal Pradesh. India claimed Aksai Chin to be a part of Ladakh (it is a huge desert of a salt flat which has been under Chinese occupation since the 1950s). Though not demarcated, these borders were well defined by various treaties and usage right from the seventeenth century. Yet another sign of discord between India and China was the invasion of Tibet by China. The Tibetans looked up to India for help but India\u2019s feeble protest (considering our Panchsheel Policy) merely antagonised the Chinese without helping the Tibetans. On the contrary, China illegally occupied the Aksai Chin and completed construction of its Western Highway through it in 1957.\n\nTo counter continued Chinese aggression, India embarked on a policy, called \u2018Forward Policy\u2019, of establishing a series of small posts all along its Northern and Eastern borders with China, to prevent further incursions. However, most posts were not capable of giving a fight to the Chinese and were logistically unsustainable.\n\nIn 1962 China\u2019s People\u2019s Liberation Army invades India in Ladakh, and across the McMahon Line in the then North-East Frontier Agency (now Arunachal Pradesh), inflicting heavy damage on Indian forces.\n\nOn 10th October The Sino-Indian War, a border dispute involving two of the world\u2019s largest nations (between India and the People\u2019s Republic of China) begins.\n\nOn 20th October Chinese troops invade Kashmir and capture Aksai Chin.\n\nWorld affairs\n\nWhile India and China were busy fighting each other, serious intervention of soviet and the US in this matter was halted because of another major event happening simultaneously in the timeline which was the Cuban Missile Crisis.\n\nBut before we start to discuss the Cuban missile crisis, let us quickly go through a few world events in the past that needs mentioning here to connect to things upcoming. One of such events was the Suez Crisis.\n\nSuez Crisis\n\nThe Suez Crisis began on October 29, 1956, when Israeli armed forces pushed into Egypt toward the Suez Canal after Egyptian president Gamal Abdel Nasser (1918-70) nationalized the canal, a valuable waterway that controlled two-thirds of the oil used by Europe. The Israelis were soon joined by French and British forces. At the same time, the Soviets, eager to exploit Arab nationalism and gain a foothold in the Middle East, supplied arms from Czechoslovakia to the Egyptian government beginning in 1955 and eventually helped Egypt construct the Aswan Dam on the Nile River after the United States refused to support the project. \u00a0This nearly brought the Soviet Union into the conflict and damaged their relationships with the United States. In the end, Egypt emerged victoriously, and the British, French and Israeli governments withdrew their troops in late 1956 and early 1957. The event was a pivotal event among Cold War superpowers.\n\nIn the aftermath of the Suez Crisis, Britain and France, once the seat of empires, found their influence as world powers weakened as the United States and the Soviet Union took a more powerful role in world affairs. British Prime Minister Anthony Eden resigned two months after withdrawing British troops\n\nThe crisis made Nasser a powerful hero in the growing Arab and Egyptian nationalist movements. Israel, while it did not gain the right to utilize the canal, was once again granted rights to ship goods along the Straits of Tiran.\n\nTen years later, Egypt shut down the canal following the Six-Day War (June 1967 to be discussed in the following section). For almost a decade, the Suez Canal became the front line between the Israeli and Egyptian armies.\n\nInternational India\nIndia too had voiced its opinion during this crisis. In 1956, when the Suez Canal Company was seized by the Egyptian government, an international conference voted 18\u20134 to take action against Egypt. India was one of the four backers of Egypt, along with Indonesia, Sri Lanka, and the USSR.\nIndia had opposed the partition of Palestine and the 1956 invasion of the Sinai by Israel, the United Kingdom and France, but did not oppose the pro-democracy movement in Hungary by the Soviet Union.\nIndia\u2019s prominent stand on various international events brought it under the limelight as the voice of the emerging voice of the third world countries. Which reminds us of an important contribution that India and other emerging countries had for the world divided into two blocs. i.e. NAM.\nNon-Aligned Movement\nDrawing on the principles agreed at the Bandung Conference in 1955, the NAM was established in 1961 in Belgrade, SR Serbia, Yugoslavia through an initiative of the Indian Prime Minister Jawaharlal Nehru, Egyptian President Gamal Abdel Nasser and the Yugoslav president Josip Broz Tito. It showcased the stand of these countries regarding their neutral stand and willingness to keep away from super-bloc politics and alignments.\nThe term non-aligned movement first appears in the fifth conference in 1976, where participating countries are denoted as \u201cmembers of the movement\u201d.\nThe purpose of the organization was to ensure \u201cthe national independence, sovereignty, territorial integrity and security of non-aligned countries\u201d in their \u201cstruggle against imperialism, colonialism, neo-colonialism, racism, and all forms of foreign aggression, occupation, domination, interference or hegemony as well as against great power and bloc politics\nCuban Missile Crisis of 1962\n\nMeanwhile, NAM was speaking about the spirit of keeping neutral the two main power blocs were busy in the Cuban missile crisis.\n\nAfter seizing power in the Caribbean island nation of Cuba in 1959, leftist revolutionary leader Fidel Castro (1926-2016) aligned himself with the Soviet Union. Under Castro, Cuba grew dependent on the Soviets for military and economic aid. During this time, the U.S. and the Soviets (and their respective allies) were engaged in the Cold War (1945-91), an ongoing series of largely political and economic clashes. The two superpowers plunged into one of their biggest Cold War confrontations after an American pilot photographed a Soviet SS-4 medium-range ballistic missile being assembled for installation in Cuba. They took this as an alarming situation for nuclear missiles were being installed too close to the US, leading to a crisis and stand-off.\nBack to India\n\nSo, let\u2019s come back to the point where we had left. While we were discussing Indo-China war another side by side happening was the incorporation of Pondicherry into India (officially).\n\nTill 1962 the territory of Pondicherry was administered as an \u2018acquired territory\u2019 and was made a union territory by the 14th Constitutional Amendment Act. The territory of Puducherry comprising the former French establishments in India known as Puducherry, Karaikal, Mahe and Yanam was handed over to India in 1954. However, their official incorporation happened only in 1962.\nIn 1963 (13th Constitutional Amendment Act), the Naga Hills district became the 16th state of India under the name of Nagaland. Part of Tuensang was added to Nagaland. Nagaland became a state on 1 December 1963.\nThe economic situation in India\nThe introduction of modern production techniques, which require proportionately greater capital, was the main feature of the development of the Indian economy during the decade, 1950-60. However, this modern sector had not yet become large enough to affect the overall structure of the economy.\nLargescale manufacturing industry was the only sector of the economy to adopt advanced modern techniques to a marked extent to affect the capital structure of the sector as a whole. In other sectors, despite there being a rise in the incremental capital-output ratios, the overall capital-output structure remained largely unchanged.\nThe quest to quickly industrialize had caused a large reallocation of funds away from the farm sector.\nAgriculture outlay was nearly halved to 14% in the Second Plan. Food shortages worsened, and inflation spiked. Imports of food grains depleted precious foreign exchange reserves.\nBeginning in 1950, India had faced trade deficits that increased in the 1960s. The Government of India had a major budget deficit and therefore could not borrow money internationally or privately.\nAs a result, the government issued bonds to the Reserve Bank of India, which increased the money supply, leading to inflation.\nThe war with China had exposed India\u2019s economic weakness. Chronic food shortages and price rise convinced him that India needed to move away from centralized planning and price controls.\n\nThis was a huge pressure to handle for a nascent economy emerging out of colonial deprivations.\n\nInstitutional and legislative advancements in the 1960s\n\nMeanwhile, we discuss the Indian economic scenario after the war, many institutional and important legislative developments had happened on the way.\n\nBefore we move on to specific legislative details of the 1960s let us quickly go through a few important legislations of 1950s that we missed in the previous video.\n\nthe establishment of Khadi and Village Industries Commission Act, 1956 \u2013 It is an apex organisation under the Ministry of Micro, Small and Medium Enterprises, concerning khadi and village industries within India, which seeks to \u2013 \u201cplan, promote, facilitate, organise and assist in the establishment and development of khadi and village industries in the rural areas in coordination with other agencies engaged in rural development wherever necessary\nMines and Minerals (Development and Regulation) Act, 1957\u2013 The Mines and Minerals (Regulation and Development) Act (1957) is an Act of the Parliament of India enacted to regulate the mining sector in India. It was amended in 2015 and 2016. This act applies to all mineral except minor minerals and atomic minerals. It details the process and conditions for acquiring a mining or prospecting licence in India. Mining minor minerals come under the purview of state governments.\nArmed Forces (Special Powers) Act, 1958\u2013 to grant special powers to the Indian Armed Forces the power to maintain public order in \u201cdisturbed areas\u201d.\nThe new idea of bringing justice not just to humans but also animals was mentioned via the prevention of cruelty act, 1960\nWelfare measure via maternity benefit Act, 1961\u2013 protects the employment of women during the time of her maternity and entitles her of a \u2018maternity benefit\u2019 \u2013 i.e. full paid absence from work \u2013 to take care for her child. The act applies to all establishments employing 10 or more employees. Recently major amendments were introduced into this act like increasing the maternity leave to 26 weeks, providing work from home options, creche facility for institutions employing more than 50 employees and compulsory education about maternity benefits.\nIIT Act, 1961:In order to drive India\u2019s economic development and to build industry, the idea for India to have scientists and engineers was considered important. It was recommended to create higher technical institutions, based on the Massachusetts Institute of Technology model, following which five institutes of technology (IIT) were established at Kharagpur (1950), Bombay (1958, with assistance from UNESCO and the Soviet Union), Kanpur (1959, with a consortium of US universities), Madras (1959, with the government of West Germany) and Delhi (1961, with the UK). Later, the IIT Act was enacted on 19 December 1961 to \u201cdeclare certain institutions of technology to be institutions of national importance. The list also includes NITs and AIIMS, in addition to the IITs. The Institute of technology Act, 1961 was passed.\n1963: the establishment of CBI\nPolitical scenario in India (after Nehru)\n1964: Jawaharlal Nehru died on 27 May 1964.\n\nLal Bahadur Shastri succeeded Nehru as Prime Minister. Soon after his taking over of prime ministership, he had to face another major trouble of 2nd Indo-Pak War.\n\n1965: 2nd Indo-Pak war\nThe Indo-Pakistani War of 1965 was a culmination of skirmishes that took place between April 1965 and September 1965 between Pakistan and India.\nThe conflict began following Pakistan\u2019s Operation Gibraltar, which was designed to infiltrate forces into Jammu and Kashmir to precipitate an insurgency against Indian rule.\nIndia retaliated by launching a full-scale military attack on West Pakistan.\nHostilities between the two countries ended after a United Nations-mandated ceasefire was declared following diplomatic intervention by the Soviet Union and the United States, and the subsequent issuance of the Tashkent Declaration.\nMuch of the war was fought by the countries\u2019 land forces in Kashmir and along the border between India and Pakistan.\nThe economic and social side\nBy the time Shastri took over as PM, the failure of the third Five-Year Plan was clear.\nGrowth in national income barely kept pace with population growth, the prices rose substantially, and food grain became scarce.\nHe tried to lower the role of Planning Commission whose five-year plans and involvements in the Indian economy was not paying better results than expected.\nConsidering the economic stagnation that India was in Shastri wanted to promote agrarian growth in contrast to the earlier focus on heavy industries.\nIt was him who brought the technocrat minister Subramaniam to obtain suggestions for improving current stagnant scenario. Subramaniam emphasised on promoting the private sector, technological innovation, and foreign investment amidst a hostile leftist consensus.\nSubramaniam proposed the market-oriented approach to increase production and also favoured use of chemical fertilizers. Based on his intervention the Food Corporation of India Act was passed in 1964.\nThere was a shift from social to technological reform in agriculture.\nAfter the 1965 India-Pakistan war, Subramaniam came up with a three-pronged plan to improve the agrarian economy. He advocated the use of High Yielding Variety seeds, price incentives to farmers and focused use of improved farming inputs into irrigated areas and this ultimately led to the green revolution in India.\nSoon after the war, which ended with the Tashkent Agreement in 1966, huge efforts were laid to restore the falling economic parameters.\nAfter the war, a shaky economy forced annual plans in place of the five-year plan. India suspended five-year plans briefly, drawing up annual plans between 1966 and 1969 instead. This was done as the country was not in a position to commit resources over a longer period.\nThe war with China, the below-par growth outcomes of the third Plan, and the diversion of capital to finance the war with Pakistan had left the economy severely weakened.\nWorld: Major Happenings in the 1960s\n\nThe beginning of the next decade was marked with a great number of civil rights and human rights protests and movements at a bigger scale.\n\n1960\nBeginning of Anti-apartheid movement in the UK, against the discrimination policy of South Africa.\nCivil Rights Movement in the US:\nThe civil rights movement was the first of the 1960s-era social movements. This movement produced one of the most important American social activists of the 20th century, Martin Luther King, Jr.\nIt originated among black Americans in the South who faced racial discrimination and segregation, or the separation of whites and blacks, in almost every aspect of their lives.\n\u00a0In 1960 black Southerners often had to sit in the back of public buses, were refused service in most restaurants and hotels, and still went to racially segregated schools, despite the 1954 Supreme Court ruling, Brown v. Board of Education, which outlawed racially segregated education. Employment ads were separated into \u201cNegro\u201d and \u201cwhite\u201d categories, and black Southerners were openly restricted to the lowest paying and lowest status occupations. Besides, most black Southerners were effectively denied the right to vote.\nBlacks fought in the courts, lobbied elected officials, and began a sustained campaign of nonviolent direct action. Many blacks participated in major demonstrations.\nIn 1964, pressured by the civil rights movement and under the leadership of President Lyndon Johnson, Congress passed the Civil Rights Act of 1964, which prohibited segregation in public accommodations and made discrimination in education and employment illegal. In 1965 Congress passed the Voting Rights Act, which suspended the use of any voter qualification devices that prevented blacks from voting.\n\nThis is very important to remember considering the current escalation of black rights violation and demand for upholding human rights even now in this century where everyone believes that we have done away with old hard customs and practices.\n\n1961\nEstablishment of the World Food Programme: The world after world war II had yet to emerge from severe hunger and food shortage all across the globe. It was in 1961 that the first world food programme was launched. is the food-assistance branch of the United Nations and the world\u2019s largest humanitarian organization addressing hunger and promoting food security. WFP was established in 1961 after the 1960 Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) Conference and formally came into force in 1963. The WFP strives to eradicate hunger and malnutrition, with the ultimate goal in mind of eliminating the need for food aid itself.\n1962\nUN passes UN Resolution 1761 condemning apartheid.\nIncreased US presence and involvement in Vietnam\nThe Vietnam War was a long, costly and divisive conflict that pitted the communist government of North Vietnam against South Vietnam and its principal ally, the United States. The Vietnam War and active U.S. involvement in the war began in 1954, though ongoing conflict in the region had stretched back several decades. In 1954, after the battle of Dien Bien Phu (where the communist north won), at the Geneva Conference Vietnam was splitted along the 17th parallel as North and south Vietnam. However, by 1960 many opponents (both communist and non-communist) rose in South Vietnam, opposing the current system. From 1961 onwards America started building\u2013up its military, technical and economic aid to suppress such a threat against the US favoured ally Diem in S. Vietnam. Soon after a coup rose in South and Diem was executed. The US soon retaliated with bombing raids across N. Vietnam (codenamed Operation Rolling Thunder). This bombing was not just limited to Vietnam but it bombed the neutral state of Laos too. By 1965, US combats were sent to Vietnam.\nBy 1966, large areas of South Vietnam had been designated as \u201cfree-fire zones,\u201d from which all innocent civilians were supposed to have evacuated and only enemy remained. In all of this, a huge number of civilian lives were lost.\nThis also resulted in a major protest led mostly by students against the US intervention in Vietnam. the student movement worked primarily to fight racism and poverty, increase student rights, and to end the Vietnam War.\n1966\nIn China: While this was happening in the US and SE Asia, in China under Mao Zedong another major cultural revolution was taking place. The Cultural Revolution was launched in China in 1966 by Communist leader Mao Zedong in order to reassert his authority over the Chinese government. Mao called on the nation\u2019s youth to purge the \u201cimpure\u201d elements of Chinese society and revive the revolutionary spirit that had led to victory in the civil war 20 years earlier and the formation of the People\u2019s Republic of China. A personality cult quickly sprang up around Mao. Some 1.5 million people were killed during the Cultural Revolution, and millions of others suffered imprisonment, seizure of property, torture or general humiliation.\n1967\nMeanwhile, in INDIA we see the Naxalbari uprising in the year the following year of 1967 under the leadership of Charu Majumdar. The details of which will be discussed later in the following section.\nSix-day War:\n\nAnother major incident that was happening meanwhile in 1967 was the Six-Day War between Israel and Egypt.\n\nSix-Day War, also called June War or Third Arab-Israeli War or Naksah, brief war that took place June 5\u201310, 1967, and was the third of the Arab-Israeli wars.\nRelations between Israel and its neighbours were not normalised after the 1948 Arab\u2013Israeli War.\nIn 1956 Israel invaded the Sinai-peninsula in Egypt, with one of its objectives being the reopening of the Straits of Tiran that Egypt had blocked to Israeli shipping since 1950.\n\u00a0Israel was eventually forced to withdraw but was guaranteed that the Straits of Tiran would remain open.\nA United Nations Emergency Force was deployed along the border, but there was no demilitarisation agreement.\nIn the months before June 1967, tensions became dangerously heightened. Israel reiterated its post-1956 position that the closure of the Straits of Tiran to Israeli shipping would be a cause for war.\nThis was not taken heed of and Egypt proceeded with the closing and ultimately war broke out. Read more about the Israel-Palestine conflict here.\nThe environmental scenario in the 1960s\n1961: WWF (World Wide Fund for Nature) is created. Living Planet Index (since 1998, once in two years); earth hour and debt-for-nature-swap.\n1962: International Convention for the Prevention of Pollution of the Sea by Oil (1954), London was updated. Administered by IMO.\n1963: The Partial Nuclear Test Ban Treaty is signed by the U.S., the U.K. and the U.S.S.R.\nVienna Convention on Civil Liability for Nuclear Damage, Vienna 1963. It came into force in 1977.\nIndia \u2013 civil liability for nuclear damage Act, 2010 after making amendments in the Atomic Energy Act, 1962.\n1964: IUCN publishes its First Red Data Book.\nScience and technological advancement in India during the 1960s\nNuclear technology during this period\nThe roots of nuclear power in India lie in the early acquisition of nuclear reactor technology from several western countries, particularly the American support for the Tarapur Atomic Power Station.\nOn 11 October 1960, the Indian government issued a tender for India\u2019s first nuclear power station near\u00a0Tarapur, Maharashtra and consisting of two reactors, each generating around 150 MW of electricity and to be commissioned in 1965\nIn 1961 Indian and Canadian governments agreed on conducting a joint study on building Canada-India nuclear power plant- based on CANDU reactor\nSpace and telecom sector:\nThe Indian space program received only financial support from the Soviet Union, which helped the Indian Space Research Organisation achieve aims such as establishing the Thumba Equatorial Rocket Launching Station.\nThe Indian National Committee for Space Research (INCOSPAR) was established by Jawaharlal Nehru under the Department of Atomic Energy (DAE) in 1962, with the urging of scientist Vikram Sarabhai recognizing the need in space research. INCOSPAR grew and became ISRO in 1969, also under the DAE\nThe first attempt to develop an indigenous electronic exchange was initiated at the Telecom Research Centre in the 1960s and the first breakthrough was a 100 line electronic switch developed in 1973.\nDepartment of Electronics was established in 1970.\nIndia after Shastri\nAfter signing the Tashkent Agreement to end the Indo-Pak struggle. India faced another major loss in the form of death of Lal Bahadur Shastri, who died on the night after the signing ceremony. After this starts yet another era of Indian political history.\nAfter Shastri\u2019s death, a leadership election resulted in the elevation of Indira Gandhi, Nehru\u2019s daughter who had been serving as Minister for Information and Broadcasting, as the third Prime Minister. She defeated right-wing leader Morarji Desai.\nThe Congress Party won a reduced majority in the 1967 elections owing to widespread disenchantment over rising prices of commodities, unemployment, economic stagnation, and food crisis.\nIndira Gandhi had started on a rocky note after agreeing to a devaluation of the rupee, which created much hardship for Indian businesses and consumers, and the import of wheat from the United States fell through due to political disputes.\nMajor policies under Indira Gandhi\nGandhi inherited a weak and troubled economy\nFiscal problems associated with the war with Pakistan in 1965, along with a drought-induced food crisis that spawned famines, had plunged India into the sharpest recession since independence.\nShe started with the devaluing of money, in return for the restoration of foreign aid. It created hardship for Indian businesses and consumers.\nIndia also had a humiliating defeat in the 1962 war with China. It necessitated India to strengthen its defence. India had to import a lot of arms from foreign countries. This again depleted India\u2019s foreign exchange reserves to a dangerously low level of 625 million dollars in march 1966. To get out of this situation, the rupee was devalued from Rs. 4.76 to Rs. 7.50.\nThe devaluation was aimed at boosting exports and bringing in foreign capital into the country. It was a necessary measure to avoid a looming financial crisis in India. It was a step in the right direction of reforming the economy but the further process of liberalisation could not be carried out due to widespread opposition from left parties and even within the congress.\nThe importation of wheat from the United States fell through due to political disputes.\nFollowing the 1967 elections, Gandhi gradually began to move towards socialist policies.\nIn 1967 the Ten-point program of Gandhi is released. It emphasized greater state control of the economy with the understanding that government control assured greater welfare than private control.\nBy the end of the 1960s, the reversal of the liberalization process was complete, and India\u2019s policies were characterized as \u201cprotectionist as ever\u201d.\nThe Green Revolution in India subsequently culminated under her government in the 1970s and transformed the country from a nation heavily reliant on imported grains and prone to famine to being largely able to feed itself, and become successful in achieving its goal of food security.\nThe economy managed to recover in 1966 and ended up growing at 4.1% over 1966\u20131969\nIndira Gandhi and Agriculture\n\nGandhi\u2019s government resolved never again to become \u201cso vulnerably dependent\u201d on aid and painstakingly began building up substantial foreign exchange reserves. Gandhi had a personal motive in pursuing agricultural self-sufficiency, having found India\u2019s dependency on the U.S. for shipments of grains humiliating.\n\nFinally, except for devaluation, no other liberalising procedures could continue in the Indian economic scenario.\n\nPolitical turmoil during the mid-1960s\nSikh-Homeland Movement and formation of Punjab:\nDuring her tenure, another major internal or regional issue to the surface was the rising Sikh Homeland movement (which was building up since the time of Nehru).\nIn 1966, the State of Punjab was bifurcated to create Haryana, the 17th state of the Indian Union, and the union territory of Chandigarh. This followed the demand for a separate \u2018Sikh Homeland\u2019 (the demand for the sovereign Sikh state was on since the early 1940s) raised by the Akali Dal under the leadership of Master Tara Singh. On the recommendation of the Shah Commission (1966), the Punjabi- speaking areas were constituted into the unilingual state of Punjab, the Hindi-speaking areas were constituted into the State of Haryana and the hill areas were merged with the adjoining union territory of Himachal Pradesh.\nNaxalbari movement:\n\nMeanwhile, in the east, the Naxalbari uprising had happened in 1967. Naxalbari uprising was an armed peasant revolt in 1967 in the Naxalbari block of the Siliguri subdivision in Darjeeling district, West Bengal, India. It was mainly led by local tribals and the radical communist leaders of Bengal and further developed into Communist Party of India (Marxist\u2013Leninist) in 1969. The event became an inspiration to the Naxalite movement which rapidly spread from West Bengal to other states of India creating division within the Communist Party of India (Marxist) (CPI(M)) party.\n\nImportant economic measures (1965 onwards)\nMonopolies and Restrictive Trade Practice (MRTP) Act of 1969- The act came into force from 1st June 1970. The act aims to prevent the concentration of economic power, provide for control of monopolies, and protect consumer interest.\nNationalization of fourteen large commercial banks in 1969- the 14 banks held 85 per cent of bank deposits in the country at that time. The core objective for nationalization was to energize priority sectors at a time when the large businesses dominated credit profiles. Even though the banks lent credit, the disbursal to the rural areas and small scale borrowers was far less as compared to the industry despite the Banking Regulation Act, 1949.\nThe Patent Act of 1970- passed in 1970, came into force on 20th April 1972, replacing the Indian Patents and Designs Act 1911. The Patents Act was largely based on the recommendations of the Ayyangar Committee Report. One of the recommendations was the allowance of only process patents concerning inventions relating to drugs, medicines, food and chemicals.\nThe Industrial Licensing Policy of 1970\nThe policy defines a sector called heavy investment sector. It consisted of industries involving an investment of more than Rs 5 crore. All such industries were opened for private sector except those reserved for the public sector in IPR, 1956.\nIndustries involving investment between Rs 1 crore and 5 crores were included in the middle sector. The licensing policy was considerably liberalised and simplified for these industries\nThe setting up of Industries involving an investment of less than Rs 1 crore does not require any license.\nTo be continued\u2026\n\nThe timeline study of the current video ends here.\n\nThis is to be continued with another period of timeline studies via crossroads at CearIAS.\n\nSubscribe to ClearIAS YouTube Channel, and click on the \u2018bell icon\u2019 to receive notifications about the new updates.\n\nLecture by: Honey Mathew"

Hundreds of millions of civilians were also dragged into the conflict \u2013 as factory workers, as suppliers of food or entertainment, as prisoners, as slave labourers, and as targets. Every corner of the planet, even those far from the fighting, was affected by this global catastrophe. The end of the war is often remembered as an idealistic time, often referred to as the zero-year marking the beginning of new world order.\n\nAmerica emerged in 1945 as the undisputed victor of the war. It had the largest navy, the largest air force, and an army that was rivalled only by that of the Soviets.\n\nHence two great powers forming two super-power blocs US and the Soviet Union emerge with an undeclared Cold War between them. Their ideologies, communism and capitalism emerge as strong ideologies, fighting each other while expanding.\n\nCondition of other participants of the war\n\nThe main parties in the war had to pay their price after the Second world war came to a halt.\n\nGermany\n\nGermany started with the process of denazification. It was an Allied initiative to rid German and Austrian society, culture, press, economy, judiciary, and politics of the National Socialist ideology (Nazism), solidified by Potsdam Agreement.\n\nJapan\n\nAt the same time in Japan, the Zaibatsu system was being demolished. Zaibatsu is a Japanese term referring to industrial and financial vertically integrated business conglomerates in the Empire of Japan, whose influence and size allowed control over significant parts of the Japanese economy from the Meiji period until the end of World War II.\n\nAfter World War II they were dissolved by the Allied occupation forces and succeeded by the Keiretsu (groups of banks, manufacturers, suppliers, and distributors). However, complete dissolution of the zaibatsu was never achieved, mostly because the U.S. government rescinded the orders to reindustrialize Japan as a bulwark against communism in Asia. But their old influence and power had been destroyed.\n\nCondition in South America\n\nIn Latin America as elsewhere, the close of World War II was accompanied by expectations, only partly fulfilled, of steady economic development and democratic consolidation. Military dictatorships and Marxist revolution were among the solutions put forward, but none were truly successful. Military dictatorships fell like ninepins in Ecuador, Venezuela, Guatemala and Bolivia. Peru held its first-ever free elections in 1945.\n\nEffect of World War on advancement in the field of Science and Technology\n\nEven in the field of science and technology world war had a great impact. In fact, no war had as profound an effect on the technologies of our current lives than World War II (1939-45). And no war was as profoundly affected by science, math, and technology than WWII. We can point to numerous new inventions and scientific principles that emerged during the war. These include-\n\nAdvances in rocketry, pioneered by Nazi Germany. They developed the so-called \u201cV-weapons\u201d which were a particular set of long-range artillery weapons designed for strategic bombing during World War II. It included the V-1 or buzz bomb which was an automatic aircraft (today known as a \u201ccruise missile\u201d) and the V-2 which was a ballistic missile that flew into space before falling down on its target\nElectronic computers were developed by the British for breaking the Nazi \u201cEnigma\u201d codes, and by the Americans for calculating ballistics and other battlefield equations.\nThe entire technology of radar, which is the ability to use radio waves to detect objects at a distance, was barely invented at the start of the war but became highly developed in just a few years. It was this technology that later helped in the development of modern electronics especially television.\nWorld War II also saw advances in medical technology. Penicillin was not invented during the war, but it was the first mass-produced during the war. Pesticides like DDT came into being to protect the soldiers from mosquitoes.\n\nIn India, efforts had begun even before the independence to invest in science and technological advancements. Our leaders like Subhash Chandra Bose and Jawahar Lal Nehru etc. greatly emphasised on scientific temper and its development in society. Here, under the guidance of Dr. Homi Bhabha, a strong pursuit for nuclear researches and advancements were on since 1941. In 1948 the Atomic Energy Commission of India was formed with Dr. Bhabha as the chairman.\n\nTime of struggle for independence in many countries\n\nIn Asia, many countries were working on their independence during World War II. For instance, the future prime minister of India, Jawaharlal Nehru, frequently invoked the Second World War as one of the major factors in his country\u2019s rebirth as an independent nation.\n\nIndonesian struggle against Dutch (1945-50)\n\nThe Indonesian National Revolution or Indonesian War of Independence took place between Indonesia\u2019s declaration of independence in 1945 and the Netherlands\u2019 recognition of Indonesia\u2019s independence at the end of 1949. Indonesia\u2019s future president, Sukarno, went so far as to thank god for the recent years of violence, which had given birth to a \u201cfree Indonesia tempered in the fire of war\u201d. For these countries and many more across Asia and Africa, 1945 was presented as the dawn of a new age.\n\nVietnam war against France (1945-54)\n\nAlso known as the First Indochina War (generally known as the Indochina War in France, and as the Anti-French Resistance War in Vietnam) began in French Indochina on December 19, 1946, and lasted until July 20, 1954. In 1954, the Geneva Conference was held to settle outstanding issues resulting from the Korean and Indochina War.\n\nFreedom of Ceylon and Burma (1948)\n\nThe Burmese Declaration of Independence was officially promulgated on 4 January 1948, marking the end of British rule in Burma (now Myanmar).\n\nThe Sri Lankan independence movement was a peaceful political movement which was aimed at achieving independence and self-rule for the country of Sri Lanka, then British Ceylon, from the British Empire. The switch of powers was generally known as a peaceful transfer of power from the British administration to Ceylon representatives. Ceylon was granted independence as the Dominion of Ceylon on 4 February 1948.\n\nIndia\n\nIn India, the freedom struggle was on. In 1946, the cabinet mission plan was sent. An interim government was formed. First session of the constituent assembly was held on 9th Dec 1946. The Mountbatten Plan of India\u2019s partition is announced and the Indian Independence Act is passed in 1947.\n\nPost-independent India\n\nSo, when the entire world was undergoing a massive change. Let us deeply delve into the events that were shaping our nation formation. Let us see what all incidents were happening in India simultaneously during this period. Let us begin with the political situation.\n\nThe political situation in India\n\nAfter independence, our country faced major challenges like:\n\nThe division of assets\nThe Refugee Problem\nOrigin of the Kashmir Problem\nFoundation of the Indian Democracy\nLinguistic Reorganization\n\nThe country had to sort it out one by one. The foremost challenge of integration of princely states was taken up by Sardar Vallabhai Patel who along with V. P. Menon convinced the rulers of princely states contiguous to India to accede to India. British India then consisted of 17 provinces and 562 princely states.\n\nThere were three states that proved more difficult to integrate than others which were-\n\nJunagadh (Hindu-majority state with a Muslim Nawab) \u2013 With the independence of India in 1947, the princely states were left by the British to decide whether to accede to one of the newly independent states of India or Pakistan or to remain outside them. The then Nawab of Junagarh had announced that Junagarh would accede to Pakistan. The majority of the people of Junagarh revolted, leading to the near-collapse of the state government, and India had to send its military into Junagarh. In December 1947 plebiscite was conducted in Junagarh where 91% of the population of Junagarh voted to merge with India, annulling the controversial accession to Pakistan.\nHyderabad (Hindu-majority state with a Muslim nizam)\u2013 by 1948 when almost all states had acceded to either India or Pakistan, there was an exception of the principality of Hyderabad. The Nizam of Hyderabad chose independence and hoped to maintain this with an irregular army recruited from the Muslim aristocracy, known as the Razakars. With the rise of militant razakars, India found it necessary to station Indian troops and invaded the state (under an operation codenamed Operation Polo) in September 1948 to compel the Nizam. Subsequently, the Nizam signed an instrument of accession. It was incorporated as a state of India the next year.\nThe area of Kashmir (Muslim-majority state with a Hindu king) in the far north of the subcontinent quickly became a source of controversy that erupted into the First Indo-Pakistani War which lasted from 1947 to 1949. Eventually, a United Nations-overseen ceasefire was agreed that left India in control of two-thirds of the contested region. Jawaharlal Nehru initially agreed to Mountbatten\u2019s proposal that a plebiscite be held in the entire state as soon as hostilities ceased, and an UN-sponsored cease-fire was agreed to by both parties on 1 Jan. 1949. No statewide plebiscite was held, however, for in 1954, after Pakistan began to receive arms from the United States, Nehru withdrew his support. The Indian Constitution came into force in Kashmir on 26 January 1950 with special clauses for the state i.e. the article 370.\nDemand for linguistic reorganisation\n\nThe demand for states on a linguistic basis had started even before independence. This attained more strength after the initial political integration of provinces and princely states. However, the government got concerned that the state solely formed on a linguistic basis might be unsuitable and might pose some potential risk to the unity of the nation.\n\nOn June 17 1948, Dr Rajendra Prasad set up a linguistic provinces commission including SK Dhar, popularly known as the Dhar commission.\n\nThey recommended the reorganization on the basis of:\n\nGeographical continuity\nFinancial self-sufficiency\nAdministrative convenience\nAnd the capacity for future development\n\nHowever, resentment continued and the Dhar commission was followed up by JVP committee. Amidst all this, the first constitutional amendment is passed in 1951. It provided against abuse of freedom of speech and expression, validation of zamindari abolition laws, and clarified that the right to equality does not bar the enactment of laws which provide \u201cspecial consideration\u201d for weaker sections of society. It amended Article 19 for the purposes indicated above and to insert provisions fully securing the constitutional validity of zamindari abolition laws in general. Article 31A and 31B was introduced to validate enactments related to Zamindari Abolition. It brought in schedule 9 of the constitution to protect the land reform and other laws present in it from the judicial review.\n\nAnother major happening in this line is that in 1952 India conducts its first general election.\n\nThe economic situation of post-independent India\n\nBefore moving into further political advancements let\u2019s see what were the economic scenario in India during these initial years. While our country was busy integrating states and going on war with Pakistan, parallel efforts of boosting the Indian economy, expanding the welfare, income and industrial development were being worked upon, as discussed below-\n\n1947: \u00a0\u00a0 India\u2019s first finance minister, R.K. Shanmukham Chetty tabled the country\u2019s first Union budget in Parliament.\n1948:\nThe Industrial Policy Resolution of 1948 proposing a mixed economy- It envisaged a substantial public sector with state interventions and regulations in order to protect indigenous industries\nMinimum wages Act of 1948 -1. It declared that governments (both central and states) not economic agents would decide the amount of wages paid, even before industrialisation started in India.It aimed to set the minimum wages that must be paid to skilled and unskilled labours.\nFactories Act 1948- Laws on factories have been there since 1881. The Factories Act was comprehensively enacted on 23 September 1948 to protect workers in factories, by consolidating and amending the law that regulated condition of labour in factories (occupational safety and health).\nDevelopment finance institutions Act, 1948 \u2013 The first financial institution and development bank to be created after Independence, Industrial Finance Corporation of India (now IFCI Ltd), was formed on 27 March 1948\n\nThe Industrial Policy Resolution of 1948 defined the broad contours of the policy delineating the role of the State in industrial development both as an entrepreneur and authority. It made clear that India is going to have a Mixed Economic Model. The emphasis on mixed economy resulted in greater involvement of the state in different segments of the economy.\n\nThe Industries (Development and Regula\u00adtion) Act was passed in 1951 to implement the Industrial Policy Resolution, 1948.\n\nNationalising RBI:\n\nThe Reserve Bank of India, India\u2019s central banking authority, was established in April 1935\u00a0but was nationalized on 1 January 1949 under the terms of the Reserve Bank of India (Transfer to Public Ownership) Act, 1948 (RBI, 2005b). In 1949, the Banking Regulation Act was enacted, which empowered the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) to regulate, control, and inspect the banks in India. The Banking Regulation Act also provided that no new bank or branch of an existing bank could be opened without a license from the RBI, and no two banks could have common directors.\n\nFormation of Planning Commission:\n\nThis was followed up by setting up of a Planning Commission (the successor of planning committee formed by Subhash Chandra Bose under Jawahar Lal Nehru as the head). After India achieved independence, a formal model of planning was adopted, and accordingly, the Planning Commission, reporting directly to the Prime Minister of India, was established on 15 March 1950, with Prime Minister Jawaharlal Nehru as the Chairman. The first five-year plan comes into force.\n\nPassing Indian Industries Act, 1951-\n\nTo implement the industrial policy of 1948. The period is marked with the beginning of license raj.\n\nEstablishing ISI (Indian Standards Institution) in 1952-\n\nThe ISI was established in the year 1947. It has been renamed as the \u2018Bureau of Indian Standards \u2018. Its main objective is to lay down quality standards for consumer and industrial goods. Symbolic of the role, the Indian Standards Institution (I.S.I.) was to play the first standard drawn for independent India. It was legalised in 1952 by an act of parliament.\n\nNationalising Air India, 1953-\n\nIn 1952, the condition of all the airlines witnessed a general deterioration all over the world. To rescue the airline sector of the country, Planning Commission of India recommended the merger of all the scheduled airlines into a single integrated corporation. Parliament voted to nationalise nine airlines. The function of the corporations was to provide safe, efficient, adequate, economical and properly coordinated air 92 transport services, whether internal or international or both.\n\nIn 1953, the Government of India passed the Air Corporations Act and purchased a majority stake. However, this act of government is often criticised as leading to the under-development of the aviation sector in India instead.\n\nNationalising Imperial Bank in 1955-\n\nFurthering the nationalisation process anther major event was the nationalisation of Imperial Bank, forming State Bank of India. The Imperial Bank of India came into existence on 27 January 1921 through the reorganisation and amalgamation of the three Presidency Banks of colonial India into a single banking entity. The Imperial Bank of India performed all the normal functions which a commercial bank was expected to perform. In the absence of any central banking institution in India until 1935, the Imperial Bank of India also performed a number of functions which are normally carried out by a central bank. After RBI came into force it acquired a controlling interest in the Imperial Bank of India in 1955, which was renamed on 30 April 1955 to the State Bank of India and later legalised.\n\nSo, we know that many efforts were ongoing with the aim of transforming the Indian economy. Meanwhile, let us not forgot that our issue of linguistic reorganisation had not yet been finished. In 1953, in an effort to protect the interests of the Telugu people of Madras State, Potti Sreeramulu attempted to force the Madras state government to listen to public demands for the separation of Telugu-speaking districts (Rayalaseema and Coastal Andhra) from Madras State to form Andhra State. He went on a lengthy fast and only stopped when Prime Minister Jawaharlal Nehru promised to form Andhra State. While in 1954 Kashmir\u2019s constituent assembly ratifies its accession to India.\n\nContinuing with the institutional developments-\n\nSetting up of Oil and Gas division-\n\nAfter independence, the Central Government of India realized the importance of oil and gas for rapid industrial development and its strategic role in defence. Consequently, while framing the Industrial Policy Statement of 1948, the development of the petroleum industry in the country was considered to be of utmost necessity. Until 1955, private oil companies mainly carried out exploration of hydrocarbon resources of India. Later an Oil and Natural Gas Division was set up in October 1955 under the Geological Survey of India to explore and develop hydrocarbon resources of India. The same year, the division was converted into an Oil and Natural Gas Directorate then into a commission and finally, after three years, it was converted into a statutory body.\n\nEssential commodities Act 1955-\n\nIt was passed to regulate the production, supply and distribution of \u2018essential\u2019 commodities such as drugs, oils, kerosene, coal, iron, steel and pulses, considering the situation of the Indian economy that was ravaged by famine and food shortages.\n\nAfter all these necessary reforms time was up for the second five-year plan that was mandated in 1956. Related to it, the second industrial policy resolution was passed in 1956.\nNationalisation of LIC\n\nIt was conducted with an objective to prevent unfair trade practices. The act followed the Second Five Year Plan and the industrial policy resolution of 1956, both of which codified the Licence Raj and looked at all private enterprises with suspicion.\n\nSwitching to the world view\nTibetan uprising (1959):\n\nIt was an uprising against the presence of the People\u2019s Republic of China in Tibet. Well, the story goes like this that Buddhist Tibet, a vast Himalayan area of plateaus and mountains, declared independence from China in the early 20th century but Beijing took back control in 1951, having sent in thousands of troops. The Dalai Lama, chosen at the age of two in 1937 as the 14th incarnation of Tibetan Buddhism\u2019s supreme religious leader, was enthroned as the head of state after the Chinese invasion.\n\nHis co-existence with the Beijing authorities was tense and when the Chinese authorities summoned him to an event without his bodyguards on March 10, Tibetans feared a trap that could endanger their leader. To this Beijing responds by sending more troops. The failure of the armed rebellion ultimately resulted in a violent crackdown on Tibetan independence movements, and the flight of the Dalai Lama Tenzin Gyatso into exile. The Dalai Lama evaded Chinese authorities and slipped away dressed as a soldier, escaping to India with an entourage of supporters in a gruelling two-week trek through the Himalaya. This incident has an implication on the future Indo-China War of 1962.\n\nListening to the Tibetan story let me remind you there were other major happenings, that we need to remember, which were shaping the course of the current world. One among this was the formation of Israel.\n\nIsrael-Palestine\n\nIn 1947, the British Government referred to the question of the future of Palestine to the United Nations, following the huge influx of Jews to Palestine after the second world war. UN voted to split the land into two countries. Jewish people accepted the agreement and declared the independence of Israel. This was not liked by the Arab nations and they declared war against Israel. However, Israel emerges victorious in the war. In 1950 Israel passes the \u201claw of return\u201d, granting automatic citizenship to any immigrant Jew.\n\nKorean War:\n\nAnother important event happening around the same time was the Korean war that started in 1950. This happened when during the beginning of the cold war, the Soviet dispensation backed a communist regime in Korean peninsula\u2019s Northern region. And at the same time, US faction was backing a liberal government that eventually took control of the southern part of the peninsula.\n\nThe inter-Korean war lasted for three years between 1950 and 1953, which was a proxy war between USSR and the US. India under Nehru was actively involved in negotiating peace in the Korean peninsula by engaging all the major stakeholders \u2013 the US, USSR and China. In late 1952, the Indian resolution on Korea was adopted at the UN with unanimous non-Soviet support.\n\nThe situation in Taiwan\n\nThe next incident was the take-over of Taiwan by kai-shek. After the end of World War II, the Chinese Civil War resumed between the Chinese Nationalists (Kuomintang), led by Chiang Kai-shek, and the Communist Party of China, led by Mao Zedong. Through-out the months in 1949, the Chinese communist party gains control in the Chinese mainland leading to defeat of the nationalist army. The nationalist party then evacuates its office and shifts it to Taiwan then known as Formosa, forming the Republic of China. This is followed by a series of events. Eventually, the ROC loses its UN seat which is given to Peoples republic of china.\n\nWorld economic updates\nThe\u00a0post\u2013World War II economic expansion, also known as the\u00a0golden age of capitalism.\nIn 1945 the lending arm of World Bank, IBRD is established. The IBRD provides commercial-grade or concessional financing to sovereign states to fund projects that seek to improve transportation and infrastructure, education, domestic policy, environmental consciousness, energy investments, healthcare, access to food and potable water, and access to improved sanitation.\nIn 1956 the second member of world bank group IFC is established as the private-sector arm of the World Bank Group, to advance\u00a0economic development\u00a0by investing in for-profit and commercial projects for poverty reduction and promoting development.\nImportant Environmental Updates\nIn 1948 the World Conservation Union\u00a0or International Union for Conservation of Nature and Natural Resources (IUCN) is established. It is an international organization dedicated to natural resource conservation.\nIn 1954 the first\u00a0nuclear power plant\u00a0to generate electricity for a\u00a0power grid\u00a0started operations at\u00a0Obninsk,\u00a0Soviet Union.\nIn 1956 starts surfacing the Minamata disease, a neurological syndrome caused by severe mercury poisoning.\nTo be continued\u2026\n\nThe timeline study of the current video ends here.\n\nThis is to be continued with another period of timeline studies via crossroads at CearIAS.\n\nSubscribe to ClearIAS YouTube Channel, and click on the \u2018bell icon\u2019 to receive notifications about the new updates.\n\nLecture by: Honey Mathew"

As a result of the Iranian Revolution, Iran became an Islamic Republic.\n\nIranian Revolution, also known as the Islamic Revolution, is a\u00a0momentous development in the modern history of Islam.

Examples of Islamic Republics are Pakistan, Afganistan, Iran, and Mauritania.\n\nWhat was the Iranian Revolution for?\n\nThe Iranian Revolution was for the removal of\u00a0Mohamed Reza Shah Pahlavi, the country\u2019s monarch since 1941. The ruler \u2013 Shah Pahlavi was supported by Western Countries like the United States and the United Kingdom.\n\nEven though Iran (Persia) enjoyed periods of economic prosperity under Shah\u2019s rule, domestically, the regime was kind of a dictatorship. Besides, many fundamentalists were against the ruler\u2019s ambitious modernisation programme that redistributed land and pushed for social reforms in the 1960s. Many felt the King\u2019s initiatives undermined\u00a0Iran\u2019s Shia traditions and served only foreign interests.\n\n\ud83d\udc49 Which year are YOU targeting for success in the IAS/IPS/IFS Exam? \ud83d\ude80\n\n(1) \u21d2 UPSC 2025: Prelims cum Mains\n\n(2) \u21d2 UPSC 2026: Prelims cum Mains\n\n(3) \u21d2 UPSC 2027 Prelims cum Mains\n\nTip: Know more about ClearIAS Courses (Online/Offline)\n\nThe economic collapse of Iran in 1977 which caused high\u00a0unemployment\u00a0and rising inflation became a triggering factor to overthrow the monarchy and the western interests.\n\nWhy the Iranian Revolution is different?\n\nIranian Revolution 1979 may be the least talked about revolutions, unlike Russian or French Revolutions \u2013 probably because the Iranian Revolution had not contributed to an intellectual or ideological legacy like other Revolutions.\n\nIranian Revolution was relatively a non-violent revolution.\u00a0 The movement saw the end of\u00a02,500 years of Persian monarchy.\n\nThe western intelligentsia treated this Revolution merely as a religious upheaval. However, thinkers like Michel Foucault declared the Iranian revolution as the \u2018spirit of a world without spirit\u2019 and as the \u201cfirst great insurrection against global systems\u201c.\n\nThe Iranian Revolution lacked many of the customary causes of revolution (defeat at war, a\u00a0financial crisis,\u00a0peasant rebellion, or disgruntled military). It occurred in a nation that was experiencing relative prosperity.\n\nHowever, the revolution produced profound changes at great speed.\n\nIt replaced a\u00a0pro-Western\u00a0authoritarian monarchy\u00a0with an\u00a0anti-Western\u00a0totalitarian\u00a0theocracy\u00a0based on the concept of\u00a0Guardianship of the Islamic Jurists\u00a0(or\u00a0velayat-e faqih).\n\nAlso, the revolution\u00a0resulted in the exile of many Iranians.\n\nIranian Revolution \u2013 First Great Insurrection Against Global Systems\n\nThe revolution opened a new chapter for political Islam in the late 20th and early 21st centuries and had a deep impact on revolutionary movements across the globe, especially those that were using the Islamic frame of reference for political activism.\n\nIranian Revolution had led to fundamental geopolitical shifts in the Middle Eastern region. Examples \u2013 USSR invasion of Afghan, cold war between Saudi and Iran etc. Its repercussions are still felt throughout the region.\n\nAs the Revolution enters its 40th year in 2019, we will look at some of the significance and effects of it on Iran as well as on the regional and global politics. Even the ripples of this effect have and had been felt on India-Iran relations.\n\nHistory\n\nIran (also known as Persia) has a rich history. It was also\u00a0home to one of the world\u2019s oldest\u00a0civilizations. In this post, we shall, however, focus our study to the history of the Islamic revolution; in two heads \u2013 prelude and the actual revolution.\n\nPrelude to revolution\nThe 1979 Revolution had its roots in Iran\u2019s long history.\nHistorically the Shi\u2019a clergy (Ulema) had a significant influence on Iranian society. However, the society had\u00a0many different social groups including clergy, landowners,\u00a0intellectuals, and merchants.\nThese social groups earlier came together in 1905-11 Constitutional Revolution. But those efforts were stifled amid reemerging social tensions as well as foreign intervention from Russia, the United Kingdom, and, later, the United States.\nInsecurity and chaos created after the Constitutional Revolution led to the rise of General Reza Khan.\nThe United Kingdom helped Mohammad Reza Shah Pahlavi to establish a monarchy in 1921.\nAlong with Russia, the U.K. then pushed Reza Shah into exile in 1941, and his son Mohammad Reza Pahlavi took the throne.\nIn 1953, as Prime Minister Mohammad Mosaddeq\u00a0nationalized British-owned Anglo-Iranian Oil and his supporters ousted Mohammad Reza Shah, the U.S. and the U.K. orchestrated a coup against Mosaddeq\u2019s government and restored the Shah.\nMohammad Reza Shah dismissed the parliament and launched the \u201cWhite Revolution\u201d \u2014 modernization program that upended the wealth and influence of landowners and clerics, disrupted rural economies, led to rapid urbanization and Westernization, and prompted concerns over democracy and human rights.\nThe program was economically successful, but the benefits were not distributed evenly, though the transformative effects on social norms and institutions were widely felt.\nOpposition to the Shah\u2019s policies was accentuated in the 1970s when world monetary instability and fluctuations in Western oil consumption threatened the country\u2019s economy.\nIn addition to mounting economic difficulties, sociopolitical repression by the Shah\u2019s regime increased in the 1970s whereas outlets for political participation were minimal.\nThe cultural vacuum of modern urban Iran led people to turn to the ulama for guidance.\nAyatollah Ruhollah Khomeini, a former professor in Qom who had been in exile in 1964 after speaking out against the Shah\u2019s reform program, gained popular support.\nThe \u201creligious dimension\u201d of the Iranian Revolution, through its dependence on Islam, was well-established in the decades leading up to the uprisings of 1978. In the 1970s the notion was popularized that Iranians should return to their cultural roots by resisting the hegemonic influence of the West.\nSensing the support of Khomeini, secular intellectuals argued that, with the help of the ulama, the Shah could be overthrown.\nThe shah\u2019s dependence on the United States, his close ties with Israel and his regime\u2019s ill-considered economic policies fueled the protests.\nRevolution\nIn January 1978 thousands of youths, mostly unemployed, took to the streets to protest the regime\u2019s excesses. During his exile, Khomeini coordinated this upsurge of opposition.\nShah fled Iran and the armed forces declared their neutrality, effectively ousting the shah\u2019s regime.\nFollowing a national referendum, Khomeini declared Iran an Islamic republic.\nElements within the clergy excluded their former left-wing, nationalist, and intellectual allies from any positions of power in the new regime, and a return to conservative social values was enforced.\nThroughout most of 1979 the Revolutionary Guards, the then informal religious militia, repressed other political groups.\nThe militias and the clerics suppressed Western cultural influence and propounded anti-Imperialistic aim for the Revolution.\nThe new constitution created a religious government based on Khomeini\u2019s vision of vel\u0101yat-e faq\u012bh\u00a0(Persian for \u201cgovernance of the jurist\u201d) and gave sweeping powers to the\u00a0\u2018rahbar\u2018, or leader; the first \u2018rahbar\u2018 was Khomeini himself.\nIslamic political culture\nIt is said that there are attempts to incorporate modern political and social concepts into Islamic canon since 1950.\nThe attempt was a reaction to the secular political discourse like Marxism, liberalism, and nationalism.\nSome of the characteristics of this political culture were: the need for the clergy\u2019s independent financial organization, Islam as a way of life, advising and guiding youth and necessity of being a community.\nAyatollah Khomeini\n\nHe was the founder of the\u00a0Islamic Republic of Iran\u00a0and the leader of the 1979\u00a0Iranian Revolution.\nKhomeini has been described as the \u201cvirtual face of Shia Islam in Western popular culture\u201d.\nHe\u00a0considered the United States as the \u201cGreat Satan\u201d and\u00a0the Soviet Union\u00a0as the \u201cLesser Satan.\u201d\nKhomeini has been criticized for the human rights violations of Iranians. He ordered the execution of thousands of\u00a0political prisoners,\u00a0war criminals\u00a0and\u00a0prisoners\u00a0of the\u00a0Iran\u2013Iraq War.\nKhomeini was known for his support of the hostage takers during the\u00a0Iran hostage crisis.\nHe had issued a fatwa for the murder of\u00a0British Indian\u00a0novelist\u00a0Salman Rushdie.\nDid the revolution promised heaven, but created a hell on earth?\n\nThe events of 1979 are still being fought over four decades on.\n\nViews differ on the impact of the revolution. For some, it was the most significant, hopeful and profound event in the entirety of contemporary Islamic history, while others believe that the revolution promised heaven, but created a hell on earth.\n\nFor Washington, the ousting of Shah Mohammad Reza Pahlavi was a geopolitical wound that hasn\u2019t healed. Shah regime helped steer the oil-rich region away from Soviet influence. In its place emerged a hostile power that took U.S. citizens hostage, engaged in deadly attacks on U.S. forces in the region, and styled itself as an anti-imperial \u201cresister\u201d to a hegemonic America.\nFor the rest of the Middle East, the arrival of a theocratic regime in Iran was a political bombshell, giving life to religious movements long stifled or overshadowed by the region\u2019s secular, Pan-Arab authoritarians.\nThe Iranian revolution played a significant role in the birth and the growth of the jihadist movements in the Arab World, as it raised the awareness of the role of religion in political change in the region.\nThe Iranian revolution affected political thinking in the region in terms of introducing religion as a changing tool to fight oppression and corruption.\nCritics of Tehran blame it for all the ills of recent years \u2014 the deadly sectarianism inflaming the Middle East, the radicalism fueling its insurgencies etc. Thus Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman (MBS) said it was the 1979 Iranian revolution that strengthened religious orthodoxy and extremism in his own country. He argued that his program of changes, which includes a brutal crackdown on dissent, is necessary to unravel that Iranian legacy.\nHowever MBS\u2019s opponents contend that the kingdom has its own lengthy role in cultivating certain strains of political Islam and he is wrong to advance a new radicalism that, while seemingly more liberal and appealing to the West, is just as intolerant of dissent.\nInternational Impact of the Iranian Revolution\n\nInternationally, the initial impact of the revolution was immense.\n\nIn the non-Muslim world, it changed the image of Islam, generating much interest in Islam \u2013 both sympathetic and hostile \u2013 and speculation that the revolution might change \u2018the world\u2019s balance of power \u2018.\nThe Islamic Republic positioned itself as a revolutionary beacon under the slogan \u201cneither East nor West, only Islamic Republic (i.e. neither Soviet nor American/West European models), and called for the overthrow of capitalism, American influence, and social injustice in the Middle East and the rest of the world.\nRevolutionary leaders in Iran gave and sought support from non-Muslim causes like IRA in Ireland, anti-apartheid struggle in South Africa etc.\nAfter the US lost its most formidable ally in the region, it was wary of growing Soviet presence in Afghan. So the US, along with Pakistan, initiated a rebellion against the pro-Soviet government in Afghan. This led to USSR invasion in Afghan in 1979 and the ensuing instability of Afghan.\nThe Persian Gulf and the Iran\u2013Iraq War\nIn its region, Iranian Islamic revolutionaries called for the overthrow of monarchies and their replacement with Islamic republics, much to the alarm of its smaller Sunni-run Arab neighbours\u00a0Iraq, Saudi Arabia, Kuwait, and the other Persian Gulf States \u2013 most of whom were monarchies and all of whom had sizable Shia populations.\nIt led to the Iran\u2013Iraq War as Arab Nationalist and Sunni Muslim-dominated regime of Saddam Hussein of Iraq invaded Iran in an attempt to take advantage of revolutionary chaos and destroy the revolution in its infancy.\nThe war served as an opportunity for the Iranian government to strengthen revolutionary groups.\nIranian revolution led Persian Gulf states like Saudi, UAE to support Wahabhism in Afghan. Also, the revolution led to the closeness of the US and Saudi to counter Iran.\nAfter the Revolution, both Iran and Saudi competed for supremacy of the Muslim world. This led to a cold war between the two. This has also led to a tripartite struggle between Israel-Iran-Saudi, fueled by the Palestinian issue.\nWestern\u2013Iranian relations\n\nIran experienced difficult relations with some Western countries, especially the United States after the revolution. Iran was under constant US unilateral sanctions.\n\nThe American political scientist\u00a0Samuel P. Huntington (1992) argued that future wars would be fought not between countries, but between cultures (often based on religious identities). His hypothesis is called the \u201cThe Clash of Civilizations\u201c.\n\nIndia-Iran relations\nFollowing the 1979 revolution, Iran continued support for\u00a0Pakistan. India\u2019s close relations with Iraq during the Iran\u2013Iraq War\u00a0impeded further development of Indo\u2013Iranian ties.\nAs Iran was vying for the position of leadership of the Muslim world against Saudi, it supported Pakistan\u2019s claim on Jammu and Kashmir.\nIndia has always been wary of Iran\u2019s support for Pakistan in the Organisation of Islamic Cooperation (OIC) regarding Kashmir.\nIranian criticism of India\u2019s position on Kashmir has repeatedly sparked protests within the Indian government against Iranian interference.\nRecently Ayatollah Khomeini \u2013 the supreme leader of Iran- equated the Kashmir conflict with those in Yemen and Bahrain, much to the chagrin of India.\nIn Afghan, the strategic interests converge, as both are apprehensive of the Taliban.\nIn the 1990s, India and Iran supported the\u00a0Northern Alliance in Afghanistan against the Taliban regime.\nThey continued to collaborate in supporting the broad-based anti-Taliban government.\nHowever, whilst both nations continue to oppose the Taliban, India supports the presence of NATO forces in Afghanistan, unlike Iran.\nAs Iran is being isolated internationally after the Revolution, the relationship with India became important for Iran.\nIran and Other countries\nIn the Mideast and Muslim world, particularly in its early years, it triggered enormous enthusiasm and redoubled opposition to western intervention and influence.\nIslamist insurgents rose in Saudi Arabia (1979), Egypt (1981), Syria (1982), and Lebanon (1983).\nAlthough ultimately only the Lebanese Islamists succeeded, other activities have had a more long-term impact.\nHowever, some observer argues that despite great effort and expense, the only countries that the revolution had a lasting influence are Lebanon and Iraq.\nMoreover, Iran\u2019s pursuit of an ideological rather than a nationalist and pragmatic foreign policy has weakened its potential as a great regional power.\nIran \u2013 Current Scenario\n\nBeing an Islamic State, Iran has integrated religion into the state. However, there are many who wish to see religion and state as separate. This includes those who are true followers of Islam. They are advocating\u00a0secularization\u00a0of the state to preserve the purity of the Islamic faith.\n\nThe protests in 2018 in Iran were greatest since 2009 green movement. Many considered this as the manifestation of the anger and frustration felt by Iranian youth against the system.\n\nSince its inception, the Islamic Republic was dogged by tensions between two concepts of sovereignty \u2014 the divine and popular.\nThe concept of popular sovereignty in the Constitution mandates popular elections for the presidency and parliament.\nBut the concept of divine sovereignty, which is derived from God\u2019s will through the medium of the imam, is bestowed on the existing \u201cfaqih\u201d as the rightful ruler of the Shi\u2019ite community.\nHowever, in the past 40 years in Iran, the idea of the sovereignty of God on Earth has been about the theologization of politics.\nDespite the forceful post-revolutionary imposition of Islamic values and ways of living and the insertion of cultural politics into the everyday lives of young Iranians in the name of Islamic purity, the Iranian youth \u2014 especially young women \u2014 have not identified with the conservative values of the Islamic regime.\nMoreover, the Republican idea of popular sovereignty has found its place through social networks and is evident in the political activities of Iranian civil society like the women\u2019s rights movements, the students\u2019 movements etc.\nToday, more than 60 per cent of the Iranian population is under the age of 30. Lack of jobs and the absence of social freedoms and everyday opportunities are the principal reasons for their discontent and rebellion.\nIn the past 10 years, many protests in Iran \u2014 notably the Green Movement of 2009 \u2014 were products of the activities of the urban middle-class youth.\nBut more recently, the turmoil in Iranian cities has largely been driven by disaffected young people in rural areas and small towns.\nThey see it as a chance to express their frustration with the country\u2019s economic problems, which are a fallout of Iran\u2019s financial and military involvement in the conflicts in Syria and Yemen.\nThe ideology of the Iranian Revolution has burnt out. Iranian youngsters are disenchanted. The Islamic Reform Movement has failed to fulfil popular demands and spontaneous riots occur in major cities of Iran almost every year.\nIran as a Regional Power\nPost-Revolution, Iran has become a strong regional power having its influence over Iraq, Syria, Lebanon, and Yemen.\nIran\u2019s involvement in Syria and its alliance with Russia in Syria magnified its regional power status.\nIran\u2019s support for Iraq\u2019s war against IS has made Iraq politically, militarily, economically, culturally under Iran\u2019s influence.\nTo stabilize the region, the cooperation of Iran is needed. Because of this reason, the US under Obama tried to mend peace with Iran. Nuclear Deal was the result of this rapprochement between the US and Iran.\nHowever, the US under Trump sidelined Iran and sided with Saudi. Trump came out of Nuclear deal and imposed new sanctions on Iran because of its missile tests. The US also imposed immigration curbs on Iranian citizens and branded Iran as \u2018greatest sponsor of terrorists\u2019. Thus Trump tried to restore the bipolar balance between Saudi and Israel\u00a0in the region.\nMeanwhile, Iran stepped up its activities in other countries through Shia Corridor.\n\nReason for instability in the West Asian region is the cold war between Saudi-Iran, manifested in proxy wars in Syria, Yemen, Bahrain, which is a struggle for power in the garb of religion.\n\nShia Corridor\n\nShia crescent or Shia Corridor is a term that encompasses Shia areas of the Middle East.\nThe argument is that the common religion, that is Shia, gives a potential for cooperation between Iran, Iraq, Syria and the politically powerful Shia militia Hezbollah in Lebanon; and that they would be proxies for Iran in its regional power play.\nConclusion\n\nThe criticism that the Iranian revolution promised heaven, but created a hell on earth is not without grounds. Many hoped that Iran as a republic would emerge as a major regional power to counter-balance the global powers. However, in reality, the revolution bolstered Islamic orthodoxy and extremism. Islamic Jihadists and new Islamic States (like the\u00a0 the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant(ISIS) \u2013 even though its ideology is a puritanical form of\u00a0Sunni\u00a0Islam) draw inspiration from it.\n\nAt this 40th anniversary of the Islamic revolution, the regime is under serious global, regional and domestic pressure. Iran is under pressure with a weak economy and social tensions rising at a time when U.S. President Donald Trump is becoming increasingly hostile towards it. Iran definitely has converted challenges into opportunities and made substantial changes in certain sectors like education, health care etc.\u00a0But even as the Islamic Republic holds strong, discontent has risen.\n\nThe Western world interprets the Iranian Revolution as\u00a0backward and typically Islamic.\u00a0Many thinkers feel that the Iranian Revolution made a \u201cclash of civilizations\u201d \u2013 between raging Muslims and rational Westerners \u2013\u00a0 inevitable. The consequences of these are manifested today: catastrophically failed wars, and the implosion of large parts of the Middle East, North Africa, and South Asia.\n\nTehran will have to deal with the U.S.\u2019s unilateral and hostile policies with help from other countries. But it should also fix its system, tackle corruption, hold government departments accountable for the decisions they take and rethink its approach towards dissent and personal freedoms.\n\nAt the same time, the US has to understand the peculiar domestic situation of Iran while dealing with it. Moreover, as Fareed Zakaria argues, the US should also take into account Iran\u2019s influence in the region and its geopolitical and geostrategic importance in forging a solution to both Afghan and Syrian instability.\n\nArticle by \u2013\u00a0Sethu Krishnan M\n\nReferences: Washington Post, Wikipedia, Britannica, Bloomberg, Indian Express, The Hindu"

Despite repeated attempts to end the conflict between the two countries, there is no peace settlement in sight.\n\nTable of Contents\n\nThe History of Israel-Palestine Conflict\nArab\u2019s fight against the Israel (1948-49)\nIsrael\u2019s fight against the Arab countries (1967)\nUN Charter and return of the Sinai Peninsula\nHamas and Fatah\nIntifada (uprising) against Israel occupancy\nTensions between Hamas and Fatah\nIsrael-Palestine conflict and US\nWhat does Palestine want?\nWhat does Israel want?\nWhat is so special about Jerusalem?\nThe solution for the Israel-Palestine conflict\nThe History of Israel-Palestine Conflict\n\nJews have been persecuted throughout history due to their religious beliefs and foreign culture.\nIn 1897, Jews started a movement called a Zionist movement,\u00a0to escape persecution and establish their own state in their ancestral homeland, Israel. The World Zionist Organisation was created to advocate for the establishment of a Jewish homeland in Palestine.\nAs a result, a large number of Jews started flowing into Palestine and they bought land and started settling down there.\nBy 1916, Palestine came under British control after the Sykes-Picot Agreement (a secret agreement between Great Britain and France). This led to the division of the old\u00a0Ottoman Turkish Empire.\nLater through the Balfour Declaration, the British foreign secretary James Balfour agreed to the establishment of a Jewish homeland.\nAfter the Nazis gained power in Germany in the 1930s, the Jews influx to Palestine took a major turn with hundreds of thousands of them resettled from Europe to Palestine. Arabs saw this as a threat to their homeland and they fought bitterly with them. As the British Government remained as a mute spectator, violence reached its peak.\nIn 1947, the British Government referred the question of the future of Palestine to the United Nations. UN voted to split the land into two countries. Jewish people accepted the agreement and declared the independence of Israel.\nArab\u2019s fight against the Israel (1948-49)\nArabs saw the creation of Israel as a part of a conspiracy to move them out of their land. Consequently, in 1948, the Arab states of Egypt, Jordan, Iraq, and Syria declared war on Israel.\nNote: It\u2019s interesting to note here that India opposed the UN resolution and Gandhi called it as a crime against humanity. But India recognized Israel in 1950.\nAt the end of the war between Israel and Arab countries,\u00a0Israel emerged\u00a0victoriously. Moreover, it could increase its territory to a larger extent and it marked the beginning of the expansionist policy of Israel.\nAs a consequence of the war, a large number of Palestinians either flee or were forced to move out of Israel and settle in refugee camps near Israel\u2019s border. It was the beginning of Palestine refugee crisis which ultimately led to the creation of a terrorist organization PLO (Palestine Liberation Organization) in 1964.\nIsrael\u2019s fight against the Arab countries (1967)\n\nIn 1967,\u00a0Israel launched a preemptive strike against Egypt, Syria, and Jordan and at the end of this Six-Day War, Israel captured:\n\nGolan Heights from Syria.\nWest Bank and East Jerusalem from Jordan.\nSinai Peninsula and Gaza Strip from Egypt. (Refer to the map above)\nThe 1967 war is particularly important for today\u2019s conflict, as it left Israel in control of the West Bank and Gaza Strip, two territories home to a large number of Palestinians.\nGaza and Westbank are together known as \u2018Occupied Territories\u2019, after the 1967 war.\nUN Charter and return of the Sinai Peninsula\n\n\ud83d\udc49 Which year are YOU targeting for success in the IAS/IPS/IFS Exam? \ud83d\ude80\n\n(1) \u21d2 UPSC 2025: Prelims cum Mains\n\n(2) \u21d2 UPSC 2026: Prelims cum Mains\n\n(3) \u21d2 UPSC 2027 Prelims cum Mains\n\nTip: Know more about ClearIAS Courses (Online/Offline)\n\nUnder the UN Charter, there can lawfully be no territorial gains from war, even by a state acting in self-defense.\nTherefore, in response to the Six-Day War, the UN Security Council adopted a resolution for \u2018Land for peace\u2019 and it mandated that Israel should return the captured areas back to the defeated nations.\nIn light of Israel\u2019s reluctance to return the captured territories, another Arab-Israeli war erupted in 1973\u00a0(Yom Kippur War) in which Israel suffered some setbacks.\nIn 1979, Israel-Egypt signed a peace treaty, accordingly, Israel returned the Sinai Peninsula to Egypt (1982). Egypt became the first Arab nation to officially recognize Israel as a state.\n\nAlso read: Arab Nationalism\n\nHamas and Fatah\nIn 1987, Hamas (Islamic Militant group) for the liberation of Palestine through Jihad came into existence. It refused to recognize Israel as a country. It has received support from Iran and Syria.\nOn the other hand, Fatah, a faction of PLO under Yasser Arafat received support from Western nations.\nIntifada (uprising) against Israel occupancy\nFirst Intifada: The tension between Israel and Palestine escalated with Israel\u2019s increased settlement in the West Bank and Gaza Strip. Palestinians living in the West Bank and the Gaza Strip fomented the riots begun in 1987, known as the first intifada.\nOslo Peace Accord: With the mediation of US and Russia in 1993, Israel and PLO signed the Oslo Peace accord which was based on the concept of two-state solution. Palestine and Israel signed the Declaration of Principles \u2013 in which both nations seek recognition as autonomous governing bodies. PLO recognized Isreal. Isreal agreed to give independence to the \u2018occupied territories. However, territories remained under Israel possession.\nCamp David Summit (2000): It aimed to help the two sides finally agree on a settlement, but the talks eventually failed. The violence led to the Second Intifada.\nSecond Intifada (2000-05):\u00a0In 2000, a more violent Palestine Uprising started and a large number of civilians died on both sides. This is known as the second intifada. As a defensive measure, Israel constructed a West Bank Barrier along West Bank to separate Israel and Palestine settlements.\nGaza Expulsion plan: This is a unilateral disarmament plan by Israel by which Israel\u2019s defence forces leave the Gaza strip and four settlements in the northern West Bank (2005)\nTensions between Hamas and Fatah\n\nAfter the Oslo accord, a Palestinian Authority (PA) was created with a limited self-rule power in the occupied territories.\nBut this led to disputes between Hamas and Fatah for political power.\nHamas \u2013 do not accept the Oslo peace accord or 2 state peace resolution. They want the whole state. They control Gaza. Hamas is supported by Iran.\nFatah \u2013 accept the Oslo peace accord and negotiates for peace. They control West Bank.\nIn 2006, Hamas won the Palestine election and it intensified the tensions between Fatah and Hamas for power. After a long-armed struggle, in 2011 Palestinian Rivals Fatah and Hamas signed a Reconciliation Pact.\nCurrently, Gaza is controlled by Hamas and Palestine West bank region by Fatah with known presence of Israeli settlements.\nOperation Protective Edge: By Israel to punish Hamas for abducting and killing Israeli settlers.\nIsrael-Palestine conflict and US\nThe US has been playing a significant role as the mediator in the Israel-Palestine. However, its credibility as a mediator had long been questioned by Palestinians. The United States has been criticized by the OIC (Organization of Islamic cooperation) and other Arab organizations, for vetoing most Security Council decisions critical of Israel.\nNote: The USA has more Jews than Israel. Jews have significant control over US media and the economy.\nAlso, Israel\u00a0receives about $3 billion in direct\u00a0foreign assistance\u00a0each year, which is roughly one-fifth of America\u2019s entire\u00a0foreign aid\u00a0budget.\nOn the other side, United States has been vocal about its intention to veto any Palestinian bid for statehood. Due to which Palestine had to be satisfied with a \u2018non-member observer\u00a0status in UN.\nHowever, the second term of the Obama administration saw a degrading US-Israel relationship. Iran Nuclear deal of 2015 irritated Israel and it criticized the US for the deal.\nObama administration allowed the United Nations to pass a resolution that declared Israel\u2019s growing settlements in the occupied territories illegal. Until that vote, the Obama administration had blocked resolutions criticizing Israel by using its veto power in the UN Security Council.\nWith the presidency regime under Trump, who was more inclined to Israel, the illegal settlements by Israel in West Bank and Gaza saw a rise.\nWhat does Palestine want?\n\nThey want Israeli to withdraw from pre-1967 borders and establish an independent Palestine state in West Bank and Gaza.\nIsrael should stop all expansion of settlements before coming to peace talks.\nPalestine wants Palestine refugees who lost their homes in 1948 to be able to come back.\nPalestine wants East Jerusalem as the capital of the Independent Palestine state.\nWhat does Israel want?\nSovereignty over Jerusalem.\nRecognition of Israel as a Jewish State. Note: Israel is the only country in the world created for a religious community.\nThe right of return of Palestine refugees only to Palestine and not to Israel.\nWhat is so special about Jerusalem?\n\nJerusalem is a city that straddles the border between Israel and the West Bank. It\u2019s home to some of the holiest sites in both Judaism and Islam, and so both Israel and Palestine want to make it their cap the solution to the Israel-Palestine conflict.\n\nThe solution for the Israel-Palestine conflict\n\nThe best solution is a\u00a0\u201ctwo-state solution\u201d that would establish Palestine as an independent state in Gaza and most of the West Bank, leaving the rest of the land to Israel. Though the two-state plan is clear in theory, the two sides are still deeply divided over how to make it work in practice.\nOne state solution (only Palestine or only Israel) is not a viable option.\nRoad Map for Peace: The European Union, UN, US, and Russia had released a road map in 2003, which outlined a clear timetable towards a Palestinian state.\nThe democratization of the Palestinian society through which new credible leadership can emerge is necessary.\nThe need of the hour is to treat this conflict as an Israeli-Arab conflict rather Israel-Palestine. As we have seen, conflict is not only between Israel and Palestine but also with other Arab countries such as Egypt, Jordan, Iran, Syria etc. All of them should participate in the negotiations and the final agreement should be recognized formally by each one of them along with UN general assembly and security council.\nIt is time for the international community to find a just and lasting peaceful solution to the World\u2019s most intractable conflict soon.\n\nRead: Gaza humanitarian crisis;\u00a0Iran-Israel relations\n\n\u00a0Article by:\u00a0Sreeresmi\u00a0S"
