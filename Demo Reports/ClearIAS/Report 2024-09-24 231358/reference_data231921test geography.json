These processes are driven by forces originating within the Earth (endogenic processes) or from external sources (exogenic processes). Read here to learn more.\n\nIt is time to know in detail about the surface of the earth on which we live. We know that the surface of the earth is not a plain platform. It is distributed unevenly with a variety of landforms like mountains, hills, plateaus, plains, ravines, cliffs etc.\n\nWhy is the surface of the earth uneven? What makes changes in the earth\u2019s surface? What process makes mountains and hills?

This energy is mostly generated by radioactivity, rotational and tidal friction and primordial heat from the origin of the earth.\n\nThese are internal processes that derive their energy from within the Earth, mainly from tectonic and volcanic activity.\n\nTectonic Processes:\n\nFolding: When Earth\u2019s crust is compressed, it bends and forms folds, leading to the creation of mountain ranges, such as the Himalayas.\nFaulting: When the crust is subjected to stress, it may fracture, creating faults. Movements along these faults can result in earthquakes, forming rift valleys or blocking mountains.\nVolcanism: The movement of molten rock (magma) from beneath the Earth\u2019s surface to above it, leading to the formation of volcanic landforms like volcanoes, lava plateaus, and volcanic islands.\n\nAlso read: Marginal seas of the world\n\nExogenic Forces\n\nExogenic forces can take the form of weathering, erosion, and deposition. Weathering is the breaking of rocks on the earth\u2019s surface by different agents like rivers, wind, sea waves and glaciers. Erosion is the carrying of broken rocks from one place to another by natural agents like wind, water, and glaciers.\n\nThe actions of exogenic forces result in wearing down (degradation) of relief/elevations and filling up (aggradation) of basins/ depressions, on the earth\u2019s surface. The phenomenon of wearing down of relief variations of the surface of the earth through erosion is known as gradation.\n\nThese are external processes driven by forces like gravity, water, wind, and ice, which gradually wear down the Earth\u2019s surface.\n\nWeathering:\nPhysical Weathering: The mechanical breakdown of rocks into smaller pieces without changing their chemical composition, often due to temperature changes (freeze-thaw cycles), pressure release, or biological activity.\nChemical Weathering: The decomposition of rocks due to chemical reactions, often involving water, acids, or gases. This process leads to the formation of features like karst landscapes (e.g., limestone caves).\nBiological Weathering: The breakdown of rocks by living organisms, such as plants and microbes, which can accelerate both physical and chemical weathering processes.\nErosion: The process of wearing away and transporting rock material by natural agents like water, wind, ice, and gravity.\nFluvial Erosion: Erosion caused by rivers and streams, leading to the formation of valleys, canyons, and deltas.\nAeolian Erosion: Wind-driven erosion, which shapes features like dunes and desert pavements.\nGlacial Erosion: The movement of glaciers erodes the underlying rock, creating U-shaped valleys, fjords, and moraines.\nMass Wasting: The movement of rock and soil downslope under the influence of gravity, including landslides, rockfalls, and debris flows.\nDeposition: The accumulation of sediment in new locations, creating landforms such as deltas, alluvial fans, dunes, and glacial moraines.\nOther geomorphic processes\nCoastal Processes\nWave Action: The continuous impact of ocean waves erodes coastlines, forming features like cliffs, arches, and sea stacks.\nTides and Currents: These influence the deposition of sediments along coastlines, leading to the formation of beaches, spits, and barrier islands.\nFluvial Processes\nRiver Action: Rivers play a crucial role in shaping landscapes by eroding, transporting, and depositing sediments, which leads to the formation of valleys, floodplains, meanders, and oxbow lakes.\nGlacial Processes\nGlacial Movement: Glaciers erode the landscape through plucking and abrasion, carving out deep valleys and shaping mountain ranges. The deposition of glacial till creates landforms such as drumlins, eskers, and terminal moraines.\nWind Processes (Aeolian Processes)\nWind Erosion: Wind picks up and transports fine particles, leading to the formation of landforms like dunes and loess plains.\nBiotic Processes\nVegetation and Animals: The roots of plants and the activities of animals contribute to the breakdown of rocks and the stabilization of soil, influencing erosion and deposition.\nGeomorphic Processes vs Geomorphic Agents\n\nGeomorphic agents are natural forces that drive the processes of weathering, erosion, transportation, and deposition, which collectively shape the Earth\u2019s surface over time.\n\nThese agents play a crucial role in the formation and evolution of landscapes, and they can be classified into several categories based on their nature and effects.\n\nThese geomorphic agents interact with each other, and their combined effects are responsible for the continuous reshaping of the Earth\u2019s surface, creating diverse landscapes across the planet.\n\nEarth Movements\nThey are the movements in the earth\u2019s crust caused by endogenic or exogenic forces. These movements are also termed as Tectonic movements.\nThe term \u2018Tectonic\u2019 is derived from the Greek word \u2018Tekton\u2019 which means builders.\nAs the word means, these movements are mainly builders and have been responsible for building up different types of landforms.\n\nNext in the series:\u00a0Endogenic Forces and Evolution of Land Forms.\n\nArticle by: Jijo Sudarshan",

We also know that endogenic forces (internal) and exogenic forces (external) are the two main types of geomorphic processes which results in earth movements. In this post, let\u2019s study endogenic forces in detail.\n\nTable of Contents\n\nEndogenic Forces \u2013 Internal forces in detail\nSlow Movements (Diastrophic forces)\nVertical Movements (Epeirogenic movements):\nHorizontal Movements (Orogenic Movements):\nForces of Compression:\nForces of Tension:\nSudden Movements\nEndogenic Forces \u2013 Internal forces in detail\n\nEndogenic forces a can be classified as slow movements (diastrophic) and sudden movements.\u00a0Slow movements cause changes very gradually which might not be visible during a human lifetime.\n\nSlow Movements (Diastrophic forces)\n\nDiastrophic forces refer to forces generated by the movement of the solid material of the earth\u2019s crust. All the processes that move, elevate or build portions of the earth\u2019s crust come under diastrophism. Diastrophism includes:\n\norogenic processes involving mountain building through severe folding and affecting long and narrow belts of the earth\u2019s crust.\nepeirogenic processes involving uplift or warping of large parts of the earth\u2019s crust.\nearthquakes involving local relatively minor movements.\nplate tectonics involving horizontal movements of crustal plates.\n\nSlow movements can again be classified as vertical movements and horizontal movements.\n\nVertical Movements (Epeirogenic movements):\nVertical\u00a0movements are mainly associated with the formation of continents and plateaus. They are also called as Epeirogenic movements\nThe broad central parts of continents are called cratons and are subject to epeirogeny.\nThey do not bring any changes in the horizontal rock strata.\nWhile they cause upliftment of continent, they can also cause subsidence of continent.\nThese movements are originated from the centre of the earth.\nHorizontal Movements (Orogenic Movements):\nHorizontal\u00a0forces acts on the earth\u2019s crust from side to side to cause these movements.\nThey are also known as orogenic movements (mountain building).\nThey bring a lot of disruptions to the horizontal layer of strata leading to a large structural deformation of earth\u2019s crust.\nThey can be classified as forces of compression and forces of tension.\nForces of Compression:\n\nForces of compression\u00a0are the forces which push\u00a0rock strata against a hard plane from one side or from both sides.\nThe compressional forces lead to the bending of rock layers and thus lead to the formation of Fold Mountains.\nMost of the great mountain chains of the world like the Himalayas, the Rockies (N. America), the Andes (S. America), the Alps (Europe) etc are formed in this manner.\n\n\ud83d\udc49 Which year are YOU targeting for success in the IAS/IPS/IFS Exam? \ud83d\ude80\n\n(1) \u21d2 UPSC 2025: Prelims cum Mains\n\n(2) \u21d2 UPSC 2026: Prelims cum Mains\n\n(3) \u21d2 UPSC 2027 Prelims cum Mains\n\nTip: Know more about ClearIAS Courses (Online/Offline)\n\nForces of Tension:\n\nForces of tension\u00a0work horizontally, but in opposite directions.\nUnder the operation of intense tensional forces, the rock stratum gets\u00a0broken or fractured which results in the formation of cracks and fractures in the crust.\nThe displacement of rock upward or downward from their original position along such a fracture is termed as faulting.\nThe line along which displacement of the fractured rock strata take place is called as the fault line.\nFaulting results in the formation of well-known relief features such as Rift Valleys and Block Mountains. (E.g. Vindhya and Satpura Mountains)\nA rift valley is formed by sinking of rock strata lying between two almost parallel faults. (E.g. Valley of Nile, Rift valley of Narmada and Tapti )\nRift valleys with steep parallel walls along the fault are called as Graben and the uplifted landmass with steep slopes on both sides are called as Horst.\nThe very steep slope in a continuous line along a fault is termed as\u00a0Escarpment.\n\nSudden Movements\n\nExamples:\u00a0Volcanoes and earth quakes.\n\nNext article in the series:\u00a0Volcanoes: Everything You Need To Know.\n\nArticle by: Jijo Sudharashan",

A weaker zone of the mantle called asthenosphere, usually is the source of magma.\nOnce this magma came out to the earth surface through the vent of a volcano, it is called as the Lava. Therefore, Lava is nothing but the magma on earth surface.\nThe process by which solid, liquid and gaseous material escape from the earth\u2019s interior to the surface of the earth is called as Volcanism.\nTypes of Volcanoes\n\nVolcanoes are classified on the basis of nature of eruption and the form developed at the surface.\n\nShield Volcanoes\nHow to identify: They are not very steep but are far and wider. They extend to great height as well as distance.\nThey are the largest of all volcanoes in the world as the lava flows to a far distance. The Hawaiian volcanoes are the most famous examples.\nShield volcanoes have low slopes and consist almost entirely of frozen lavas.\nIf you were to fly over top of a shield volcano, it would resemble a warrior\u2019s shield, hence the name.\nThese volcanoes are mostly made up of basalt (less viscous), a type of lava that is very fluid when erupted.\u00a0For this reason, these volcanoes are not steep.\nThey are of low explosive in general, but if somehow water gets into the vent they may turn explosive.\nThe upcoming lava moves in the form of a fountain and throws out the cone at the top of the vent and develops into cinder cone\nCinder Cone Volcanoes:\nCinders are extrusive igneous rocks. A more modern name for cinder\u00a0is Scoria.\nSmall volcanoes.\nThese volcanoes consist almost entirely of loose, grainy cinders and almost no lava.\nThey have very steep sides and usually have a small crater on top.\nComposite Volcanoes:\nShape: Cone shaped with\u00a0moderately steep sides and sometimes have small craters in their summits.\nVolcanologists call these \u201cstrato-\u201d or composite volcanoes because they consist of layers of solid lava flows mixed with layers of sand- or gravel-like volcanic rock called cinders or volcanic ash.\nThey are characterized by the eruption of a cooler and more viscous lavas than basalt.\nThese volcanoes often result in explosive eruptions.\nAlong with lava, large quantities of pyroclastic materials and ashes find their way to the ground.\nThis material accumulates in the vicinity of the vent openings and leading to the formation of layers, and this makes the mount appears as composite volcanoes.\nCaldera:\nThese are the most explosive of the earth\u2019s volcanoes.\nThey are usually so explosive that when they erupt they tend to collapse on themselves rather than building any tall structure. The collapsed depressions are called calderas.\nTheir explosiveness indicates that its magma chamber is large and in close vicinity.\nA caldera differs from a crater in such a way that a caldera is a huge depression caused by a collapse after a large-scale eruption, whereas a crater is a small, steep side, volcanic depression bored out by an eruptive plume.\nFlood Basalt Provinces\nThese volcanoes outpour highly fluid lava that flows for long distances.\nThe Deccan Traps from India, presently covering most of the Maharashtra plateau, are a much larger flood basalt province.\nMid-Ocean Ridge Volcanoes\nThese volcanoes occur in the oceanic areas.\nThere is a system of mid-ocean ridges more than 70,000 km long that stretches through all the ocean basins.\nThe central portion of this ridge experiences frequent eruptions.\n\nVolcanoes can also be classified based on the frequency of eruption, mode of eruption and characteristic of lava.\n\n\ud83d\udc49 Which year are YOU targeting for success in the IAS/IPS/IFS Exam? \ud83d\ude80\n\n(1) \u21d2 UPSC 2025: Prelims cum Mains\n\n(2) \u21d2 UPSC 2026: Prelims cum Mains\n\n(3) \u21d2 UPSC 2027 Prelims cum Mains\n\nTip: Know more about ClearIAS Courses (Online/Offline)\n\nVolcanic Landforms:\nThe lava that is released during volcanic eruptions on cooling develops into igneous rocks.\nThe cooling may take place either on reaching the surface or from the inside itself.\nDepending on the location of the cooling of lava, igneous rocks are classified as:\nVolcanic Igneous rocks (Extrusive igneous rocks):\n\nCooling of the rock occurs at the surface of the earth.\u00a0 E.g. Basalt, Andesite etc.\n\nPlutonic Igneous rocks (Intrusive igneous rocks):\n\nCooling takes place in the crust and not over the surface. E.g. Granite, Gabbro, Diorite etc.\u00a0Intrusive igneous rocks are classed into the following types according to their forms.\n\nBatholiths: A large body of magmatic material that cools in the deeper depth in the form of a large dome. These are granitic bodies. They sometimes appear on the earth surface when the denudation processes remove the overlying materials.\nLaccoliths: Large dome shaped intrusive bodies with a level base and pipe-like conduit from below. Resembles a composite volcano structure, but beneath the earth. (Eg: Karnataka Plateau)\nLapoliths: They are saucer shaped, concave to the sky.\nPhacoliths:\u00a0Wavy materials which have a definite conduit to source beneath.\nSheets/ sills: They are the near horizontal bodies of intrusive igneous rocks. Thinner ones are called as sheets and while thick horizontal deposits are called sills.\nDykes: When the lava comes out through cracks and fissures, they solidify almost perpendicular to the ground to form wall like structures called dykes. (Eg: Deccan traps in Maharastra region).\n\nDistribution of Volcanoes:\n\nMost of the volcanoes in the world are found in three well defined belts:\n\nThe Circum-Pacific Belt (The Pacific Ring of Fire).\nThe Mid-World Mountain Belt.\nThe African Rift Valley Belt.\n\nVolcanic Activity \u2013 Points to note down:\nVolcanoes are closely related to the regions of intense folding and faulting.\nThey occur along coastal mountain ranges, on islands and in the mid oceans.\nInterior parts of the continent are generally free from their activity.\nMost of the active volcanoes are found in the pacific region which is thus called as the Pacific Ring of Fire.\n\nNext article in the series:\u00a0Earthquakes: Everything You Need To Know.\n\nArticle by: Jijo Sudarshan",

These events are caused by the movement of the Earth\u2019s tectonic plates and are a common geological occurrence. Read here to learn more.\n\nEarthquakes and volcanoes are examples of sudden movements which originate from inside the earth. We have already seen the types of volcanoes. But, what is an earthquake?\n\nTo put it simply, an earthquake is the shaking of the earth. An earthquake can be defined as a sudden violent shaking of the ground as a result of movements in the earth\u2019s crust or volcanic action.\n\nThese movements result in the release of energy along a fault and cause the earth to shake. An earthquake, like a volcano, is a type of endogenic process.\n\nTable of Contents\n\nEarthquakes: Points you should not miss!\nCauses of Earthquakes\nEarthquake waves or Seismic waves\nBody waves\nPrimary waves (p-waves)\nSecondary waves (s-waves)\nSurface Waves\nLove waves\nRayleigh waves\nShadow regions of waves\nMeasuring earthquakes\nMercalli Scale\nRichter Scale\nDistribution of Earthquakes\nEarthquakes: Points you should not miss!\nThe network of seismographic (seismograph is the instrument used to measure earthquakes) stations all over the world record dozens of earthquakes every day. Most of them are not felt by human beings as they are minor quakes only.\nThe occurrence of a severe earthquake is limited to a few regions in the world.\nThe point within the earth\u2019s crust where an earthquake originates is called the focus hypocenter or seismic focus.\nIt generally lies within a depth of 6 km in the earth\u2019s crust.\nThe point vertically above the focus on the earth\u2019s surface is called as the epicenter.\nThe intensity of the earthquake will be highest in the epicenter and decrease as one moves away.\nAll natural earthquakes take place in the lithosphere (i.e., the region that constitutes the earth\u2019s crust and rigid upper part of the mantle).\nCauses of Earthquakes\n\nEarthquakes are primarily caused by the movement of tectonic plates beneath the Earth\u2019s surface. These plates are large sections of the Earth\u2019s crust that float on the semi-fluid layer of the mantle.\n\nThere are three main types of plate boundaries where earthquakes are common:\n\n\ud83d\udc49 Which year are YOU targeting for success in the IAS/IPS/IFS Exam? \ud83d\ude80\n\n(1) \u21d2 UPSC 2025: Prelims cum Mains\n\n(2) \u21d2 UPSC 2026: Prelims cum Mains\n\n(3) \u21d2 UPSC 2027 Prelims cum Mains\n\nTip: Know more about ClearIAS Courses (Online/Offline)\n\nDivergent Boundaries: Plates move away from each other, creating tension and often resulting in earthquakes.\nConvergent Boundaries: Plates move toward each other, leading to compression and causing earthquakes.\nTransform Boundaries: Plates slide past each other horizontally, generating shear stress and causing earthquakes.\nEarthquake waves or Seismic waves\nThe earthquake which originates in the lithosphere propagates different seismic waves or earthquake waves.\nEarthquake waves are basically of two types \u2013 body waves and surface waves.\n\nBody waves\nThey are generated due to the release of energy at the focus and move in all directions traveling through the body of the earth. Hence, the name \u2013 body waves.\nThey travel only through the interior of the earth.\nBody waves are faster than surface waves and hence they are the first to be detected on a seismograph.\nThere are two types of body waves primary waves and secondary waves.\nPrimary waves (p-waves)\nPrimary waves are the fastest body waves (twice the speed of s-waves) and are the first to reach during an earthquake.\nThey are similar to sound waves, i.e., they are longitudinal waves, in which particle movement is in the same direction of wave propagation.\nThey travel through solid, liquid, and gaseous materials.\nThey create density differences in the earth material leading to stretching and squeezing.\n\nSecondary waves (s-waves)\nThey arrive at the surface with some time lag after primary waves.\nThey are slower than primary waves and can pass only through solid materials.\nThis property of s-waves led seismologists to conclude that the earth\u2019s outer core is in a liquid state. (the entire zone beyond 105o from the epicenter does not receive S-waves)\nThey are transverse waves in which directions of particle movement and wave propagation are perpendicular to each other.\n\nSurface Waves\nWhen the body waves interact with surface rocks, a new set of waves is generated called surface waves.\nThese waves move along the earth\u2019s surface.\nSurface waves are also transverse waves in which particle movement is perpendicular to the wave propagation.\nHence, they create crests and troughs in the material through which they pass.\nSurface waves are considered to be the most damaging waves.\nTwo common surface waves are Love waves and Rayleigh waves.\nLove waves\nThis kind of surface wave causes horizontal shifting of the earth during an earthquake.\nThey are much slower than body waves but are faster than Rayleigh.\nThey exist only in the presence of a semi-infinite medium overlain by an upper finite thickness.\nConfined to the surface of the crust, Love waves produce entirely horizontal motion.\n\nRayleigh waves\nThese waves follow an elliptical motion.\nA Rayleigh wave rolls along the ground just like a wave rolls across a lake or an ocean.\nBecause it rolls, it moves the ground up and down and side-to-side in the same direction that the wave is moving.\nMost of the shaking felt from an earthquake is due to the Rayleigh wave, which can be much larger than the other waves.\n\nShadow regions of waves\nWe already discussed that p-waves pass through all mediums while S-waves pass only through solid mediums.\nWith the help of these properties of primary waves, seismologists have a fair idea about the interior of the earth.\nEven though p-waves pass through all mediums, they cause reflection when they enter from one medium to another.\nThe variations in the direction of waves are inferred with the help of their record on seismographs.\nThe area where the seismograph records no waves is called as \u2018shadow zone\u2019 of that wave.\nAccordingly, it is observed that the area beyond 1050 does not receive S-waves, and the area between 1050 to 1400\u00a0 does not receive P-waves.\n\nMeasuring earthquakes\nSeismometers are the instruments that are used to measure the motion of the ground, which includes those seismic waves generated by earthquakes, volcanic eruptions, and other seismic sources.\nA Seismograph is also another term used to mean seismometer though it is more applicable to older instruments.\nThe recorded graphical output from a seismometer/seismograph is called as a seismogram. (Note: Do not confuse seismograph with seismogram. A seismograph is an instrument while a seismogram is the recorded output)\nThere are two main scales used in the seismometers: (1) the Mercalli Scale and the Richter Scale.\nMercalli Scale\n\nThe scale represents the intensity of the earthquake by analyzing the after-effects like how many people felt it, how much destruction occurred etc. The range of intensity is from 1-12.\n\nAlso read: Avalanche: Types, Causes and Mitigation\n\nRichter Scale\n\nThe scale represents the magnitude of the earthquake. The magnitude is expressed in absolute numbers from 1-10. Each whole number increase in the Richter scale represents a tenfold increase in the power of an earthquake.\n\nDistribution of Earthquakes\n\nThere are two well-defined belts where earthquakes frequently occur \u2013\u00a0The Circum-Pacific Belt and\u00a0The Mid-World Mountain Belt.\n\nAbout 68% of earthquakes in the world occur in the Circum-Pacific Belt.\nThe mid-World Mountain belt extends from the Alps with extension into the Mediterranean, the Caucasus, and the Himalayan region and continues to Indonesia.\n21% of earthquakes are occurring in this belt.\nThe remaining 11% occur in the other parts of the world.\n\nNext in the series:\u00a0Exogenic Forces and their classification.\n\nArticle by: Jijo Sudarshan",

E.g. the wind, water, waves etc.\n\nNote: A process is a force applied on earth materials affecting the same. An agent is a mobile medium (like running water, moving ice, winds, waves etc) which removes, transport and deposits earth materials.\n\nGeomorphic processes and geomorphic agents especially exogenic, unless stated separately, are one and the same.\n\nGravity and gradients are the two things that make these agents mobile.\n\nAll the movements either within the earth or on the surface of the earth occur due to gradients\u2013 from higher levels to lower levels, from high pressure to low pressure etc.\n\nThe exogenic forces derive their energy from the atmosphere determined by the ultimate energy from the sun and also the gradient created by tectonic factors. We have already discussed in previous articles that slopes on the earth surface are mainly created by tectonic factors or earth movements due to endogenic forces.\n\nWe know that force applied per unit area is called stress. Stress is produced in a solid by pushing or pulling.\n\nThe gravitational force acts upon all earth materials having a sloping surface and tends to produce movement of matter in the down-slope direction. This creates stress and induces deformation to the particles.\n\nWeathering\n\nWeathering is the action of elements of weather and climate over earth material.\n\nIt can be defined as mechanical disintegration and chemical decomposition of rocks through the actions of various elements of weather and climate.\n\nWhen rocks undergo weathering, some minerals are removed through chemical/ physical leaching by groundwater and thereby the concentration of remaining (valuable) minerals increase.\n\nWeathering can be classified as \u2013 physical, chemical and biological:\n\n(1) Physical / Mechanical weathering\nPhysical or mechanical weathering processes depend on some applied forces.\nThe applied forces could be (i) gravitational forces such as overburden pressure, load, and shearing stress; (ii) expansion force due to temperature changes, crystal growth or animal activity; (iii) water pressure controlled by wetting and drying cycles.\nCauses: Most of the physical weathering are caused by thermal expansion and pressure.\nA) UNLOADING AND EXPANSION:\nRemoval of overlying rock load because of continued erosion causes vertical pressure release.\nThus, the upper layers of the remaining rock expand to produce disintegration of rock masses.\nFractures will develop roughly parallel to the ground surface.\nIn areas of curved ground surfaces, arched fractures tend to produce massive sheets or exfoliated slabs.\nExfoliation is a result but not a process. Flaking off of more or less curved sheets of shells from over rocks or bedrocks results in smooth and rounded surfaces.\nSo, unloading and expansion create largely, smooth rounded domes called exfoliation domes.\nB) TEMPERATURE CHANGES AND EXPANSION:\nWith rising in temperature, every mineral expands and pushes against its neighbour and as the temperature falls, a corresponding contraction takes place.\nDue to differential heating and the resulting expansion and contraction of surface layers and their subsequent exfoliation from the surface results in smooth rounded surfaces in rocks.\nIn rock like granites, smooth-surfaced and rounded small to big boulders called tors form due to such exfoliation.\n\nC) FREEZING, THAWING AND FROST WEDGING:\nCycles of freezing and thawing (the weather becomes warmer and causes snow and ice to melt) cause frost weathering.\nIt is most effective at high elevations in mid-latitude where freezing and melting is often repeated.\nRapid freezing of water causes its sudden expansion and high pressure. The resulting expansion affects joints, cracks, and small intergranular fractures to become wider and wider till the rock breaks apart.\nD) SALT WEATHERING:\nSalts in rocks expand due to thermal action, hydration and crystallization.\nMany salts like calcium, sodium, magnesium, potassium and barium have a tendency to expand.\nThe expansion depends on temperature and thermal properties. High temperature ranges between 30-50 0 C of surface temperatures in desert favours such salt expansions.\nSalt crystallization is the most effective of all salt weathering processes. It is favoured in areas of alternative wetting and drying conditions.\n(2) Chemical weathering\n\nChemical weathering can be due to solution, carbonation, hydration or oxidation/reduction.\n\nA) SOLUTION:\nWhen something is dissolved in water or acids, the water or acid with dissolved content is called a solution.\nThis process involves the removal of solids in solution and depends upon the solubility of a mineral in water or weak acids.\nWhen coming into contact with water, many solids disintegrate and mix up as a suspension in water.\nSoluble rock-forming minerals like nitrates, sulphates, potassium etc are affected by this process.\nThis kind of weathering mainly occurs in a rainy\nMinerals like calcium carbonate and magnesium bicarbonate present in limestone are soluble in water containing carbonic acid (formed with the addition of carbon dioxide in water) and are carried away in the water as a solution.\nCommon salt is also a rock-forming mineral and is susceptible to this process of solution.\nB) CARBONATION:\nCarbonation is the reaction of carbonate and bicarbonate with minerals and is a common process helping to break down feldspar and carbonate minerals.\nCarbon dioxide from the atmosphere and soil air is absorbed by water to form carbonic acid that acts as a weak acid.\nCalcium carbonates and magnesium carbonates are dissolved in carbonic acid and are removed in a solution without leaving any residue resulting in cave formation.\nC) HYDRATION:\nHydration is the chemical addition of water.\nMinerals take up water and expand; this expansion causes an increase in the volume of the material itself or rock.\nThe process is reversible and long, continued repetition of this process causes fatigue in the rocks and may lead to their disintegration.\ng. calcium sulphate takes in water and turns to gypsum, which is more unstable than calcium sulphate.\nD) OXIDATION AND REDUCTION:\nIn weathering, oxidation means a combination of a mineral with oxygen to form oxides or hydroxides.\nMinerals most commonly involved in this are iron, manganese, sulphur etc.\nThe red colour of the iron upon oxidation turns to brown and yellow.\nIn this process of oxidation, rock breakdown occurs due to the disturbance caused by the addition of oxygen.\nWhen oxidized minerals are placed in an environment where oxygen is absent, reduction takes place.\n(3) Biological weathering\nThis kind of weathering is caused by several biological activities like the growth or movements of organisms.\nThey also bring conditions for physical or chemical weathering.\nGrazing of animals, ploughing by human beings etc. are examples of biological weathering.\n\nAlso read: Earth\u2019s Crust: Elements, Minerals and Rocks\n\nMass Movements\n\nThese movements transfer the mass of rock debris down the slope under the direct influence of gravity.\n\nMass movements are very active over weathered slopes rather than over unweathered slopes.\n\nUsual geographic agents like running water, glaciers, wind, waves etc do not have much role to play in mass movements, and it is gravity, which is the main driving force.\n\nMass movements are classified into slow movements and rapid movements.\n\n(1) Slow movements:\nA) CREEP:\n\nIt occurs on moderately steep, soil-covered slopes (doesn\u2019t need to be lubricated with water as in solifluction). The movement is extremely slow and imperceptible except through extended observation. We might notice that some of the electric posts in our region which are posted in sloppy areas deviated from their horizontal linearity. This is an effect of creep.\n\nB) SOLIFLUCTION:\n\nIt is the process of slow downslope flowing of soil mass or fine-grained rock debris saturated or lubricated with water. It can be said as a type of creep with lubricated water influences the movement. It mainly occurs in permafrost regions as the layers of groundwater are occupied in between permanently frozen soil and rocks.\n\n(2) Rapid movements\n\nA) EARTHFLOW:\n\nThe movement of water-saturated clayey or silty earth materials down low angle terraces or hillsides is called earthflow.\n\nB) MUDFLOW:\n\nIn the absence of vegetation and cover and with heavy rainfall, thick layers of weathered materials get saturated with water and either slow or rapidly flow down along definite channels is called as a mudflow.\n\nC) DEBRIS AVALANCHE:\n\nIt is more in humid regions with or without vegetation. It occurs in narrow tracks on steep slopes and is similar to snow avalanche.\n\nD) LANDSLIDES:\n\nIn landslides, the materials involved are relatively dry irrespective of the above said rapid mass movements.\u00a0Landslides can be classified into a slump, debris slide, rockslide etc\n\nSlump: It is a type of landslide in which the slipping of several units of rock debris occurs with a backward rotation with respect to the slope over which the movement takes place.\nDebris slide:\u00a0In this type of landslide, there is no backward rotation. The fall is almost vertical.\nRockslide: It is nothing but the slide of individual rock masses.\nErosion and Deposition\n\nErosion is the acquisition and transportation of rock debris by geomorphic agents like running water, the wind, waves etc.\n\nThough weathering aids erosion, it is not a pre-condition for erosion to takes place. (i.e., erosion can take place in unweathered conditions also)\n\nThe deposition is a consequence of erosion. The erosional agents lose their velocity and energy on gentle slopes and materials carried by them start to settle themselves.\n\nNote: Deposition is not the work of any agents. It is just the end result\u00a0of erosion.\n\nNext in the series:\u00a0Erosion and Deposition: Action of Running Water and Groundwater\n\nArticle by: Jijo Sudarshan",

These processes are primarily driven by the movement of water, typically through rivers, streams, and other water bodies. Read here to learn about the erosional landforms by running water and groundwater.\n\nIn the previous articles, we were discussing various types of endogenic and exogenic processes. We have also seen that erosion and deposition are some of the exogenic processes. In this post, we are dealing with the geomorphic agents \u2013 running water and groundwater, which causes erosion and deposition. They form various erosional (destructional) and depositional (constructional) landforms.\n\nEven though we are considering the erosional and depositional activities and their landform creation, it should be kept in mind that they are always aided by weathering and mass movements. There are some other independent controls like (i) stability of sea level; (ii) tectonic stability of landmass; (iii) climate etc. which influence the evolution of these landforms.\n\nAlso read: Coastal Erosion\n\nTable of Contents\n\nWhat does Running Water do?\nCourses of \u00a0a river\nUpper Course / Stage of Youth (Erosion dominates):\nMiddle Course/ Stage of Maturity (Transportation dominates):\nLower Course/ Stage of Old (Deposition dominates):\nRunning water: erosion, transportation, and deposition\nErosion Types\nTransportation types\nErosional Landforms Due to Running Water\nValleys, Gorges, Canyon\nPotholes, Plunge pools\nIncised or Entrenched Meanders\nRiver Terraces\nDepositional Landforms Due to Running Water\nAlluvial Fans\nDeltas\nFlood Plains, Natural Levees\nMeanders and oxbow lakes\nBraided Channels\nWhat does Groundwater do?\nErosional Landforms due to Groundwater\nSinkholes\nCaves\nDepositional Landforms of Groundwater\nStalactites and stalagmites\nWhat does Running Water do?\n\nSubscribe to the ClearIAS YouTube Channel for more informative videos on UPSC preparation, tips, and strategies.

(Note: A valley can be formed in various ways like faulting, but here we are dealing only with the formation using an exogenic geomorphic agent).\nOnce a valley is formed, it later develops into a stream or river.\n\nCourses of \u00a0a river\n\nA river, which is the best example of the linear flow of running water through a valley, can be divided into three, based on its course \u2013 upper course, middle course, and lower course.\n\nUpper Course / Stage of Youth (Erosion dominates):\nIt starts from the source of the river in hilly or mountainous areas.\nThe river flows down the steep slope and, as a result, its velocity and eroding power are at their maximum.\nStreams are few, with poor integration.\nAs the river flows down with high velocity, vertical erosion or downward cutting will be high which results in the formation of V-shaped valleys.\nWaterfalls, rapids, and gorges exist where the local hard rock bodies are exposed.\nMiddle Course/ Stage of Maturity (Transportation dominates):\nIn this stage, vertical erosion slowly starts to replace with lateral erosion or erosion from both sides of the channel.\nThus, the river channel causes the gradual disappearance of its V-shaped valley (not completely).\nStreams are plenty at this stage with good integration.\nWider flood plains start to visible in this course and the volume of water increases with the confluence of many tributaries.\nThe work of the river predominantly becomes transportation of the eroded materials from the upper course (little deposition too).\nLandforms like alluvial fans, piedmont alluvial plains, meanders, etc. can be seen at this stage.\nLower Course/ Stage of Old (Deposition dominates):\nThe river starts to flow through a broad, level plain with heavy debris brought down from the upper and middle courses.\nVertical erosion has almost stopped and lateral erosion still goes on.\nThe work of the river is mainly deposition, building up its bed and forming an extensive flood plain.\nLandforms like braided channels, floodplains, levees, meanders, oxbow lakes, deltas, etc. can be seen at this stage.\n\nRunning water: erosion, transportation, and deposition\nErosion occurs when overland flow moves soil particles downlope.\nThe rock materials carried by erosion are the load of the river.\nThis load acts as a grinding tool helping in cutting the bottom and sides of the river bed, resulting in the deepening and widening of the river channel.\nErosion Types\n\nThe work of river erosion is accomplished in different ways, all of which may operate together. They are corrasion, corrosion, hydraulic action, etc.\n\nCorrasion or Abrasion: As the rock particles bounce, scrape, and drag along the bottom and sides of the river, they break off additional rock fragments. This form of erosion is called corrosion or abrasion. There are two types: vertical corrosion which acts downward and lateral corrosion which acts on both sides.\nCorrosion or Solution: This is the chemical or solvent action of water on soluble or partly soluble rocks with which the river water comes in contact.\nHydraulic Action: This is the mechanical loosening and sweeping away of material by the sheer force of river water itself. No load or material is involved in this process.\nTransportation types\n\nAfter erosion, the eroded materials get transported with the running water. This transportation of eroded materials is carried in four ways:\n\nTraction: The heavier and larger rock fragments like gravel, pebbles, etc. are forced by the flow of the river to roll along its bed. These fragments can be seen rolling, slipping, bumping, and being dragged. This process is called traction and the load transported in this way is called traction load.\nSaltation: Some of the fragments of the rocks move along the bed of a stream by jumping or bouncing continuously. This process is called saltation.\nSuspension: The holding up of small particles of sand, silt, and mud by the water as the stream flows is called suspension.\nSolution: Some parts of the rock fragments dissolved in the river water and transported. This type of transportation is called solution transportation.\n\nWhen the stream comes down from the hills to plain areas with the eroded and transported materials, the absence of slope/gradient causes the river to lose its energy to further carry those transported materials.\nAs a result, the load of the river starts to settle down which is termed as deposition.\nErosion, transportation, and deposition continue until the slopes are almost completely flattened leaving finally a lowland of faint relief called peneplains with some low resistant remnants called monadnocks.\nErosional Landforms Due to Running Water\nValleys, Gorges, Canyon\nAs we discussed above, valleys are formed as a result of running water.\nThe rills which are formed by the overland flow of water later develop into gullies.\nThese gullies gradually deepen and widen to form valleys.\nA gorge is a deep valley with very steep to straight sides.\nA canyon is characterized by steep step-like side slopes and may be as deep as a gorge.\nA gorge is almost equal in width at its top as well as bottom and is formed in hard rocks while a canyon is wider at its top than at its bottom and is formed in horizontal bedded sedimentary rocks.\nPotholes, Plunge pools\nPotholes are more or less circular depressions over the rocky beds of hills streams.\nOnce a small and shallow depression forms, pebbles and boulders get collected in those depressions and get rotated by flowing water. Consequently, the depressions grow in dimensions to form potholes.\nPlunge pools are nothing but large, deep potholes commonly found at the foot of a waterfall.\nThey are formed because of the sheer impact of water and the rotation of boulders.\n\nIncised or Entrenched Meanders\nThey are very deep wide meanders (loop-like channels) found cut in hard rocks.\nOver time, they deepen and widen to form gorges or canyons in hard rock.\nThe difference between a normal meander and an incised/entrenched meander is that the latter is found on hard rocks.\nRiver Terraces\nThey are surfaces marking old valley floors or flood plains.\nThey are the result of vertical erosion by the stream.\nWhen the terraces are of the same elevation on either side of the river, they are called as paired terraces.\nWhen the terraces are seen only on one side with none on the other or one at quite a different elevation on the other side, they are called unpaired terraces.\n\nDepositional Landforms Due to Running Water\nAlluvial Fans\nThey are found in the middle course of a river at the foot of a slope/mountain.\nWhen the stream moves from the higher level and breaks into a foot slope plain of low gradient, it loses the energy needed to transport much of its load.\nThus, they get dumped and spread as broad low to high cone-shaped deposits called alluvial fans.\nThe deposits are not roughly very well sorted.\nDeltas\nDeltas are like an alluvial fan but develop at a different location.\nThey are found in the mouth of the river, which is the final location of the depositional activity of a river.\nUnlike alluvial fans, the deposits making up deltas are very well sorted with clear stratification.\nThe coarser material settles out first and the finer materials like silt and clay are carried out into the sea.\nFlood Plains, Natural Levees\nDeposition develops a floodplain just as erosion makes valleys.\nA riverbed made of river deposits is the active flood plain and the flood plain above the bank of the river is the inactive flood plain.\nNatural levees are found along the banks of large rivers. They are low, linear, and parallel ridges of coarse deposits along the banks of a river.\nThe levee deposits are coarser than the deposits spread by flood water away from the river.\nMeanders and oxbow lakes\nMeanders are loop-like channel patterns that develop over the flood and delta plains.\nThey are not a landform but only a type of channel pattern formed as a result of deposition.\nThey are formed basically because of three reasons: (i) the propensity of water flowing over a very gentle gradient to work laterally on the banks; (ii) the unconsolidated nature of alluvial deposits making up the bank with many irregularities; (iii) the Coriolis force acting on fluid water deflecting it like deflecting the wind.\nThe concave bank of a meander is known as a cut-off bank and the convex bank is known as a slip-off\nAs meanders grow into deep loops, the same may get cut off due to erosion at the inflection point and are left as oxbow lakes.\nFor large rivers, the sediments deposited linearly at the depositional side of a meander are called Point Bars or Meander Bars.\nBraided Channels\nWhen selective deposition of coarser materials causes the formation of a central bar, it diverts the flow of the river towards the banks, which increases lateral erosion.\nSimilarly, when more and more such central bars are formed, braided channels are formed.\nRiverine Islands are the result of braided channels.\nWhat does Groundwater do?\nThe part of rain or snow-melt water that accumulates in the rocks after seeping through the surface is called underground water or simply groundwater.\nThe rocks through which water can pass easily are called permeable rocks while the rocks which do not allow water to pass are called impermeable rocks.\nAfter vertically going down to some depth, the water under the ground flows horizontally through the bedding planes, joints, or through the materials themselves.\nAlthough the amount of groundwater varies from place to place, its role in shaping the surface features of the earth is quite important.\nThe works of groundwater are mainly seen in rocks like limestone, gypsum, or dolomite which are rich in calcium carbonate.\nAny limestone, dolomite, or gypsum region showing typical landforms produced by the action of groundwater through the process of solution and deposition is called Karst Topography (Karst region in the Balkans)\nThe zones or horizons of permeable and porous rocks that are filled with water are called the Zones of Saturation.\nThe marks which show the upper surface of these saturated zones of the groundwater are called the Water Tables.\nAnd these rocks, which are filled with underground water, are called aquifers.\nThe water table is generally higher in areas of high precipitation and also in areas bordering rivers and lakes.\nThey also vary according to season. Based on variability, water tables are of two types: (i) Permanent water tables, in which the water will never fall below a certain level and wells dug up to this depth provide water in all seasons; (ii) Temporary water tables, which are seasonal.\nSprings: They are the surface outflow of groundwater through an opening in a rock under hydraulic pressure.\nWhen such springs emit hot water, they are called Hot Springs. They generally occur in areas of active or recent volcanism.\nWhen a spring emits hot water and steam in the form of fountains or jets at regular intervals, they are called geysers.\nIn a geyser, the period between two emissions is sometimes regular (Yellowstone National Park in the USA is the best example).\nErosional Landforms due to Groundwater\n\nSinkholes and caves are erosional landforms formed due to the action of groundwater.\n\nSinkholes\nSmall to medium-sized rounded to sub-rounded shallow depressions called swallow holes form on the surface of rocks like limestone by the action of the solution.\nA sinkhole is an opening more or less circular at the top and funnel-shaped towards the bottom.\nWhen a sinkhole is formed solely through the process of solution, it is called a solution sink.\nSome sinkhole starts their formation through the solution process but later collapse due to the presence of some caves or hollow beneath it and becomes a bigger sinkhole. These types are called collapse sinks.\nThe term Doline is sometimes used to refer to collapse sinks.\nSolution sinks are more common than collapse sinks.\nWhen several sinkholes join together to form a valley of sinks, they are called as valley sinks or Uvalas.\nLapies are irregular grooves and ridges formed when most of the surfaces of limestone are eaten by the solution process.\nCaves\nIn the areas where there are alternative beds of rocks (non-soluble) with limestone or dolomite in between or in areas where limestone is dense, massive, and occurring as thick beds, cave formation is prominent.\nCaves normally have an opening through which cave streams are discharged\nCaves having an opening at both ends are called tunnels.\nDepositional Landforms of Groundwater\nStalactites and stalagmites\nThey are formed when the calcium carbonates dissolved in groundwater get deposited once the water evaporates.\nThese structures are commonly found in limestone caves.\nStalactites are calcium carbonate deposits hanging as icicles while Stalagmites are calcium carbonate deposits that rise from the floor.\nWhen a stalactite and stalagmite happen to join together, it gives rise to pillars or columns of different diameters.\n\nNext in the series: Evolution of landforms due to glaciers.\n\nArticle by: Jijo Sudarshan",

Drumlins\nWhat is a Glacier?\nGlaciers are a mass of ice moving under its own weight.\u00a0They\u00a0are commonly found in the snow-fields.\nWe know that the landmass on the earth is not entirely the same as we see around. Some areas are covered by thick green forests, some with dry hot deserts, some with permanent ice covers etc. Among these varied landmasses, the permanently ice-covered regions on the earth surface are called as snow-fields. The lowest limit of permanent snow or snow-field is called as the snowline.\nA Glacier forms in areas where the accumulation of snow exceeds its ablation (melting and sublimation) over many years, often centuries.\nThey form features like crevasses, seracs etc. A crevasse is a deep crack, or fracture, found in an ice sheet or glacier, as opposed to a crevice that forms in rock. A serac is a block or column of glacial ice, often formed by intersecting crevasses on a glacier.\nOgives are alternating wave crests and valleys (troughs) that appear as dark and light bands of ice on glacier surfaces. They are linked to seasonal motion of glaciers; the width of one dark and one light band generally equals the annual movement of the glacier.\nGlaciers cover about 10 percent of Earth\u2019s land surface and they are the largest freshwater reservoirs on earth.\n\nOn the basis of the location of the glacier, they can be classified as:\n\nContinental Glacier/Piedmont Glacier: they move outward in all directions\nValley/Mountain Glaciers: Move from higher elevation to lower\nErosional landforms due to Glaciers\n1. Cirque or Corris\nThey are deep, long and wide troughs or basins with very steep concave to vertically dropping high walls at its head as well as sides.\nThey are simply a bowl-shaped depression formed due to the erosional activity of glaciers.\nWhen these depressions are filled with water, they are called as Cirque lake or Corrie Lake or Tarn Lakes.\n\n2. Hanging Valleys or U-shaped Valleys, Fjords/fiords\nThe Glacier doesn\u2019t create a new valley like a river does but deepens and widens a pre-existing valley by smoothening away the irregularities.\nThese valleys, which are formed by the glacial erosions assume the shape of letter \u2018U\u2019 and hence are called as U-shaped Valleys or Hanging Valleys.\nA fjord is a very deep glacial trough filled with sea water and making up shorelines.\nA fjord is formed when a glacier cuts a U-shaped valley by ice segregation and abrasion of the surrounding bedrock and this valley gradually gets filled with the seawater (formed in mountains nearby sea).\n\n3. Horns and Aretes\nHorns are sharp pointed and steep-sided peaks.\nThey are formed by headward erosion of cirque wall.\nWhen the divide between two cirque walls gets narrow because of progressive erosions, it results in the formation of a saw-toothed ridge called Arete.\n\nDepositional Landforms due to Glaciers\n\nGlacial deposits are of two types:\n\n(i) Glacial Till \u2013 unassorted coarse and fine debris;\n(ii) Outwash \u2013 assorted roughly stratified deposits.\n1. Moraines\n\nMoraines are long ridges of deposits of glacial till.\nWhen these deposits are at the end of a glacier, they are called as Terminal moraines and when they are deposited on both sides, they are called as Lateral moraines.\nWhen lateral moraines of two glaciers join together, they form Medial moraines.\nWhen the lateral moraines of both sides of a glacier join together, it forms a horse-shoe shape.\nGround moraines are deposits left behind in areas once covered by glaciers.\n\n\ud83d\udc49 Which year are YOU targeting for success in the IAS/IPS/IFS Exam? \ud83d\ude80\n\n(1) \u21d2 UPSC 2025: Prelims cum Mains\n\n(2) \u21d2 UPSC 2026: Prelims cum Mains\n\n(3) \u21d2 UPSC 2027 Prelims cum Mains\n\nTip: Know more about ClearIAS Courses (Online/Offline)\n\n2. Eskers\nWhen glaciers melt in summer, the water which formed as a result of melting accumulates beneath the glacier and flows like streams in channels beneath that ice.\nVery coarse material like boulders, blocks and some minor fractions of rock debris are carried away by these streams.\nThey later get deposited in the valleys itself and once the ice melts completely, they are visible to the surface as sinuous ridges.\nThese ridges are called as Eskers.\n3. Drumlins\nThey are smooth oval-shaped ridge-like structures composed mainly of glacial till.\nIt shapes like an inverted spoon with the highest part is called as Stoss End and the lowest narrow part is called as Tail End.\nThey are formed as a result of glacial movement over some minor obstruction like small surface rocks.\nThe glacial till gets deposited in those obstructions and the movement of glacier shapes these deposits like an inverted spoon.\n\nNext in the series:\u00a0Evolution of landforms due to wind and waves.\n\nArticle by: Jijo Sudarshan",

We have seen the evolution of landforms due to these agents. In this post, we discuss in detail how the wind and the waves cause the evolution of various landforms on the earth surface.\n\nAlso read: Coastal Erosion\n\nTable of Contents\n\nAction of\u00a0Winds:\nErosional Landforms due to Wind\n1.

Beaches and dunes\n2. Bars, spits, and Lagoons\nAction of\u00a0Winds:\nThe wind is the main geomorphic agent in the hot deserts.\nWinds\u00a0in hot deserts have greater speed which causes erosional and depositional activities in the desert.\nThe landforms which are created by erosional and depositional activities of wind are called as Aeolian Landforms.\nThis process is not unique to the Earth, and it has been observed and studied on other planets, including Mars.\nAn erg (also known as sand sea / dune sea / sand sheet if it lacks dunes) is a broad, flat area of desert covered with wind-swept sand with little or no vegetative cover. It is defined as a desert area that contains more than 125 square kilometres of aeolian or wind-blown sand and where sand covers more than 20% of the surface. Smaller areas are known as \u201cdune fields\u201d. The largest hot desert in the world, the Sahara, contains several ergs.\n\nAlso read: World Climate: Types and its Characteristics\n\nErosional Landforms due to Wind\n1. Pediplains\nWhen the high relief structures in deserts are reduced to low featureless plains by the activities of wind, they are called as Pediplains.\n2. Deflation Hollows\nDeflation is the removal of loose particles from the ground by the action of wind.\nWhen deflation causes a shallow depression by persistent movements of wind, they are called as deflation hollows.\n3. Mushroom Tables\nVentifacts are rocks that have been abraded, pitted, etched, grooved, or polished by wind-driven sand or ice crystals.\nThese geomorphic features are most typically found in arid environments where there is little vegetation to interfere with aeolian particle transport, where there are frequently strong winds, and where there is a steady but not overwhelming supply of sand.\nMushroom Tables / Mushroom rocks are Ventifacts in the shape of a mushroom.\nIn deserts, a greater amount of sand and rock particles are transported close to the ground by the winds which cause more bottom erosion in overlying rocks than the top.\nThis result in the formation of rock pillars shaped like a mushroom with narrow pillars with broad top surfaces.\n\nDepositional Landforms of Wind\n1. Sand dunes\nDry hot deserts are good places for sand dune formation.\nAccording to the shape of a sand dune, there are varieties of sand dune forms like Barchans, Seifs etc.\nThe crescent-shaped dunes are called as Barchans and they are the most common one.\nSeif is similar to Barchans but has only one wing or point.\n\n2. Loess\n\nIn several large areas of the world, the surface is covered by deposits of wind-transported silt that has settled out from dust storms over many thousands of years. These depositions are called as Loess.\nAction of Waves:\nCoastal processes are the most dynamic and hence most destructive.\nSome of the changes along the coast take place very fast. Storm waves and tsunami waves can cause far-reaching changes in short period of time than normal breaking waves.\nThe coastal landforms in the world can be classified into two categories:\n1. High Rocky Coast/ Submerged Coast/ Retreating Coast\n\nIn these type of coasts, the sea will be very close to the land without any coast or sometimes a narrow coast.\nThe shores of these high rocky coasts do not show any depositional landforms.\nErosional feature dominates here.\nWave-cut platforms, cliffs, sea caves etc are common here.\nMost of the west coasts of the Indian Peninsula belong to this category.\n2.

Cliffs, Terraces, Caves, Stacks and Stumps\nCliffs are common on the high rocky coasts.\nAt the foot of such cliffs, there may be flat or gently sloping platform covered by rock debris derived from the sea cliff behind.\nSuch platforms occurring at an elevation above the average height of waves is called as a wave-cut terrace.\nWhen the upper part of a coastal rock is hard and the lower part is soft, the erosion will not be uniform. The lower part erodes easily which results in the formation of a hollow part.\nThis hollow part, by frequent wave action, gradually develops into a sea-cave.\nSea arches are also formed in the same manner.\nSea stacks are nothing but the isolated standing rocks in the sea which were once a part of the cliff.\nThese stacks look will like small islands in the sea.\nSmall underwater stacks are known as stumps.\n\nDepositional Landforms due to Waves\n\u00a01. Beaches and dunes\nBeaches are characteristics of shorelines that are dominated by deposition.\nBeaches are temporary features which are made up of sand-sized materials.\nBeaches which contain excessively small pebbles and even cobbles are called as Shingle Beaches.\nSand dunes are formed just behind the beaches as long ridges parallel to the coastline.\n2. Bars, spits, and Lagoons\nBars are deposits of sand and gravel laid down by waves and currents which separate the shoreline from the sea.\nThey act as a barrier between the mainland and the sea.\nWhen one end of such bar is attached to the coast and other extends into the sea, it is called as a spit.\n\nTombolo is a deposition landform in which an island is attached to the mainland by a narrow piece of land such as a spit or bar.\nSometimes due to deposition of waves and currents, both ends of the bar join to enclose a part of sea water between the coast and the bar. This enclosed part of the sea forms a lake of saline water called as Lagoon.\n\nA lagoon is generally connected with the sea through a narrow passage.\nChilika and Pulicat lakes are examples of Lagoon Lake.\n\nNext in the series:\u00a0Major Landforms \u2013 Mountains, Plateaus, and Plains: Learn faster.\n\nArticle by: Jijo Sudarshan",

Weathering acts upon the earth\u2019s crust constantly.\nTo a large extent, the process of wearing down depends on the shape and structure of the rocks upon which it acts.\nSo, in some cases, some portions of an elevated area escape from the process of weathering due to the hardness of the materials it is made of.\nThese portions remain unweathered while its surrounding area gets eroded constantly. This results in the formation of Residual or Relict Mountains.\nExamples: Hills like Nilgiri, Palkonda, Parasnath and Rajmahal and Mountains like the Aravalli, the Vindhya, and the Satpura are some of the examples of Relict Mountains in India.\nEconomic Significance of Mountains\nA storehouse of resources: Mountains are the storehouse of natural resources. Large resources of minerals like petroleum, coal, limestone are found in mountains. The mountains are the main source of timber, lac, medical herbs, etc.\nGeneration of hydro-electricity: Hydro-electricity is mainly generated from the waters of perennial rivers in the mountains.\nAn abundant source of water: Perennial rivers arising in the snow-fed or heavily rain-fed mountains are one of the important sources of water. They help in promoting the irrigation and provide water for many other purposes.\nFormation of fertile plains: The rivers that originate from the high mountain ranges bring silt along with water to the lower valleys. This helps in the formation of fertile plains and further the expansion of agriculture and related activities.\nNatural political frontiers:\u00a0The mountains can also act as natural boundaries between the two countries. They have a prominent role in protecting the country from external threats.\nEffects on climate:\u00a0They serve as a climatic divide between two adjoining regions. The mountains cause orogenic rainfalls, diversion, and blocking of cold winds, etc.\nTourist centres:\u00a0The pleasant climate and beautiful sceneries of the mountains have led to their development as centres of tourist attraction.\nPlateaus\nA plateau is an elevated area with a more or less levelled land on its top. It has a large area on its top and a steep slope on its sides.\nThey are also called as high plains or tablelands.\nThe plateaus cover about 18% of the earth\u2019s land surface.\nClassification of plateaus\n\nOn the basis of their geographical location and structure of rocks, the plateaus can be classified as:\n\nIntermontane Plateaus\nPiedmont plateaus\nContinental plateaus\nVolcanic plateaus\nDissected plateaus\nIntermontane Plateaus\n\nThe plateaus which are bordering the mountain ranges (generally fold mountains) or are partly or fully enclosed within them are the intermontane plateaus.\nThe word \u2018intermontane\u2019 means \u2018between mountains\u2019.\nIntermontane plateaus are the highest in the world.\nThey have nearly horizontal rock layers which are raised to very heights by vertical movements of the earth.\nExamples: The Plateau of Tibet is an example of the intermontane plateau which is surrounded by the fold mountains like the Himalayas, the Karakoram, the Kunlun and the Tien Shah.\nPiedmont Plateaus\n\nPlateaus which is situated at the foot of a mountain and is locked on the other side by a plain or a sea/ ocean is called as a piedmont plateau.\nThe word \u2018piedmont\u2019 means \u2018foot of a mountain\u2019.\nThey are also called as Plateaus of denudation as the areas once were high to the level of mountains, have now been reduced to the foot level of the mountain by various agents of erosion.\nExamples: The Malwa Plateau is an example of piedmont plateau.\nContinental Plateaus\n\nThey are formed either by an extensive continental upliftment or by the spread of horizontal basic lava (less viscous) sheets completely covering the original topography.\nThis kind of plateaus shows an abrupt elevation in contrast to the nearby lowland or sea (i.e. more steepness on sides).\nThe Continental Plateaus are also known as Plateaus of Accumulation.\nExamples: Plateau of Maharashtra is an example of the continental plateau.\nVolcanic Plateaus\nA volcanic plateau is a plateau produced by volcanic activity. There are two main types: lava plateaus and pyroclastic plateaus.\nLava plateaus are formed by highly fluid basaltic lava during numerous successive eruptions through numerous vents without violent explosions.\nPyroclastic volcanic plateaus are produced by massive pyroclastic flows and they are underlain by pyroclastic rocks.\n\nDissected Plateaus\nA dissected plateau is a plateau area that has been severely eroded so that the relief is sharp. Such an area may appear\u00a0as mountainous.\nDissected plateaus are distinguishable from orogenic mountain belts by the lack of folding, metamorphism, extensive faulting, or magmatic activity that accompanies orogeny (mountain building).\n\nThe economic significance of Plateaus\nA storehouse of minerals: Most of the minerals in the world are found in plateaus. The extraction of minerals in plateaus is relatively easier on plateaus than mountains. The major portions of industrial raw materials are obtained from plateaus. We get gold from the plateau of Western Australia; copper, diamond and gold from the plateaus of Africa; and coal, iron, manganese and mica from the Chottanagpur Plateau in India.\nGeneration of hydel-power: The edges of plateaus form waterfalls which provide ideal sites for generating hydel power.\nCool climate:\u00a0The higher parts of the plateaus even in tropical and sub-tropical regions have a cool climate.\nAnimal rearing and agriculture: plateaus have large grassland areas suitable for animal rearing especially sheep, goat, and cattle. The lava plateaus when\u00a0compared to other plateaus are richer in minerals and hence used for agriculture as\u00a0the soil is very fertile.\nPlains\nPlains are the most important landforms found on the earth surface.\nA plain is nothing but a low-lying relatively flat land surface with very gentle slope and minimum local relief.\nAbout 55% of the earth\u2019s land surface is occupied by plains.\nMost of the plain have been formed by deposition of sediments brought down by rivers.\nBesides rivers, some plains have also been formed by the action of the wind, moving ice and tectonic activities (Refer exogenic processes).\nClassification of plains\n\nOn the basis of their mode of formation, plains can be classified as:\n\nStructural plain\nErosional plains\nDepositional plains\nStructural Plains\n\nThese plains are mainly formed by the upliftment of a part of the sea floor or continental shelf.\nThey are located on the borders of almost all the major continents.\nThe structural plains may also be formed by the subsidence of areas.\nErosional Plains (Peneplains)\n\nErosional plains are formed by the continuous and longtime erosion of uplands.\nThe surface of such plains is hardly smooth and hence, they are also called as Peneplains, which means almost plain.\nDepositional Plains\n\nThese plains are formed by the depositional activity of various geomorphic agents.\nWhen plains are formed by the river deposits, they are called as riverine or alluvial plains.\nThe depositions of sediments in a lake give rise to a Lacustrine Plain or Lake Plains. The Valley of Kashmir is an example of lacustrine plain.\nWhen plains are formed by glacial deposits, they are called as Glacial or Drift Plains.\nWhen the wind is the major agent of deposition, those plains are called as Loess Plains.\nThe economic significance of Plains\nFertile soil: The plains generally have deep and fertile soil. As\u00a0they have a flat surface, the means of irrigation can be\u00a0easily developed. That is\u00a0why plains are called as the \u2018Food baskets of the world\u2019.\nThe growth of industries: The rich agricultural resources, especially of alluvial plains, have helped in the growth of agro-based industries. Since the plains are thickly populated, plenty of labour is available for the intense cultivation and for supplying the workforce for the industries.\nExpansion of means of transportation: The flat surface of plains favours the building of roads, airports and laying down railway lines.\nCentres of civilizations: Plains are centres of many civilizations.\nSetting up of cities and towns: Easy means of transportation on land and the growth of agriculture and industries in plains have resulted in the setting up and expansion of cities and towns. The most developed trade centres and ports of the world are found in the plains only and as much as 80% of the world\u2019s population lives here.\nSummary\n\nMountains, Plateaus and Plains are some of the important landforms on earth. Each of these is classified into different subtypes are economically significant.

Also, the origin of many phenomena like earthquakes, volcanoes, tsunami\u00a0etc are linked with the structure of earth\u2019s interior.\n\nTable of Contents\n\nWhat should you understand about the interior of the earth?\nSources of Information about the interior of the earth\nDirect Sources:\nIndirect Sources\nStructure of the earth\u2019s interior\nCrust\nMantle\nCore\nTemperature, Pressure and Density of the Earth\u2019s Interior\nTemperature\nPressure\nDensity\nWhat should you understand about the interior of the earth?\nIt is not possible to know about the earth\u2019s interior by direct observations because of the huge size and the changing nature of its interior composition.\nIt is an almost impossible distance for the humans to reach till the centre of the earth (The earth\u2019s radius is 6,370 km).\nThrough mining and drilling operations we have been able to observe the earth\u2019s interior directly only up to a depth of few kilometers.\nThe rapid increase in temperature below the earth\u2019s surface is mainly responsible for setting a limit to direct observations inside the earth.\nBut still, through some direct and indirect sources, the scientists have a fair idea about how the earth\u2019s interior look like.\nSources of Information about the interior of the earth\nDirect Sources:\nRocks from mining area\nVolcanic eruptions\nIndirect Sources\nBy analyzing the rate of change of temperature and pressure from the surface towards the interior.\nMeteors, as they belong to the same type of materials earth is made of.\nGravitation, which is greater near poles and less at the equator.\nGravity anomaly, which is the change in gravity value according to the mass of material, gives us information about the materials in the earth\u2019s interior.\nMagnetic sources.\nSeismic Waves: the shadow zones of body waves (Primary and secondary waves) give us information about the state of materials in the interior.\nStructure of the earth\u2019s interior\n\nStructure of earth\u2019s interior is fundamentally divided into three layers \u2013 crust, mantle and core.\n\nCrust\nIt is the outermost solid part of the earth, normally about 8-40 kms thick.\nIt is brittle in nature.\nNearly 1% of the earth\u2019s volume and 0.5% of earth\u2019s mass are made of the crust.\nThe thickness of the crust under the oceanic and continental areas are different. Oceanic crust is thinner (about 5kms) as compared to the continental crust (about 30kms).\nMajor constituent elements of crust are Silica (Si) and Aluminium (Al) and thus, it is often termed as SIAL (Sometimes SIAL is used to refer Lithosphere, which is the region comprising the crust and uppermost solid mantle, also).\nThe mean density of the materials in the crust is 3g/cm3.\nThe discontinuity between the hydrosphere and crust is termed as the Conrad Discontinuity.\n\nMantle\nThe portion of the interior beyond the crust is called as the mantle.\nThe discontinuity between the crust and mantle is called as the Mohorovich Discontinuity or Moho discontinuity.\nThe mantle is about 2900kms in thickness.\nNearly 84% of the earth\u2019s volume and 67% of the earth\u2019s mass is occupied by the mantle.\nThe major constituent elements of the mantle are Silicon and Magnesium and hence it is also termed as SIMA.\nThe density of the layer is higher than the crust and varies from 3.3 \u2013 5.4g/cm3.\nThe uppermost solid part of the mantle and the entire crust constitute the Lithosphere.\nThe asthenosphere (in between 80-200km) is a highly viscous, mechanically weak and ductile,\u00a0 deforming region of the upper mantle which lies just below the lithosphere.\nThe asthenosphere is the main source of magma and it is the layer over which the lithospheric plates/ continental plates move (plate tectonics).\n\nThe discontinuity between the upper mantle and the lower mantle is known as Repetti Discontinuity.\nThe portion of the mantle which is just below the lithosphere and asthenosphere, but above the core is called as Mesosphere.\nCore\nIt is the innermost layer surrounding the earth\u2019s centre.\nThe core is separated from the mantle by Guttenberg\u2019s Discontinuity.\nIt is composed mainly of iron (Fe) and nickel (Ni) and hence it is also called as NIFE.\nThe core constitutes nearly 15% of earth\u2019s volume and 32.5% of earth\u2019s mass.\nThe core is the densest layer of the earth with its density ranges between 9.5-14.5g/cm3.\nThe Core consists of two sub-layers: the inner core and the outer core.\nThe inner core is in solid state and the outer core is in the liquid state (or semi-liquid).\nThe discontinuity between the upper core and the lower core is called as Lehmann Discontinuity.\nBarysphere is sometimes used to refer the core of the earth or sometimes the whole interior.\nTemperature, Pressure and Density of the Earth\u2019s Interior\nTemperature\nA rise in temperature with increase in depth is observed in mines and deep wells.\nThese evidence along with molten lava erupted from the earth\u2019s interior supports that the temperature increases towards the centre of the earth.\nThe different observations show that the rate of increase of temperature is not uniform from the surface towards the earth\u2019s centre. It is faster at some places and slower at other places.\nIn the beginning, this rate of increase of temperature is at an average rate of 10C for every 32m increase in depth.\nWhile in the upper 100kms, the increase in temperature is at the rate of 120C per km and in the next 300kms, it is 200C per km. But going further deep, this rate reduces to mere 100C per km.\nThus, it is assumed that the rate of increase of temperature beneath the surface is decreasing towards the centre (do not confuse rate of increase of temperature with increase of temperature. Temperature is always increasing from the earth\u2019s surface towards the centre).\nThe temperature at the centre is estimated to lie somewhere between 30000C and 50000C, may be that much higher due to the chemical reactions under high-pressure conditions.\nEven in such a high temperature also, the materials at the centre of the earth are in solid state because of the heavy pressure of the overlying materials.\nPressure\nJust like the temperature, the pressure is also increasing from the surface towards the centre of the earth.\nIt is due to the huge weight of the overlying materials like rocks.\nIt is estimated that in the deeper portions, the pressure is tremendously high which will be nearly 3 to 4 million times more than the pressure of the atmosphere at sea level.\nAt high temperature, the materials beneath will melt towards the centre part of the earth but due to heavy pressure, these molten materials acquire the properties of a solid and are probably in a plastic state.\nDensity\nDue to increase in pressure and presence of heavier materials like Nickel and Iron towards the centre, the density of earth\u2019s layers also gets on increasing towards the centre.\nThe average density of the layers gets on increasing from crust to core and it is nearly 14.5g/cm3 at the very centre.\n\nArticle by: Jijo Sudarsan",

Intrusive Igneous Rocks\n2. Extrusive Igneous Rocks\nSedimentary Rocks\nMetamorphic Rocks\nRock Cycle\nSummary\nElements in the Earth\u2019s Crust\n\nThe earth is composed of various kinds of elements.\nAbout 98% of the total crust is made up of eight elements as oxygen, silicon, aluminium, iron, calcium, sodium, potassium, and magnesium.\nThe rest is constituted by elements like titanium, hydrogen, phosphorous, manganese, sulphur, carbon, nickel and others.\nThe elements in the earth\u2019s crust are rarely found exclusive but are usually combined with other elements to make various substances.\nThese substances are recognised as minerals.\nThe table below shows the percentage wise share of each element in both the earth\u2019s crust and the whole earth.\n\nMinerals in the Earth\u2019s Crust\nA mineral is a naturally occurring organic or inorganic substance, having an orderly atomic structure and a definite chemical composition and physical properties.\nA mineral is composed of two or more elements. But, sometimes single element minerals like sulphur, copper, silver, gold, graphite, etc are also found.\nThe basic source of all minerals is the hot magma in the interior of the earth.\nWhen magma cools, crystals of the minerals appear and a systematic series of minerals are formed in sequence to solidify so as to form rocks.\nThe minerals which contain metals are called metallic minerals (eg: Haematite) and the metallic minerals which are profitably mined are called as the ores.\nThe crust of the earth is made up of more than 2,000 minerals, but out of these, only six are the most abundant and contribute the maximum.\nThese six most abundant minerals are feldspar, quartz, pyroxenes, amphiboles, mica and olivine.\n\nAlso read: Exogenic Forces: Classification\n\nCharacteristics of some of the major minerals\nFeldspar:\nSilicon and oxygen are major elements of all types of feldspar.\nSodium, potassium, calcium, aluminium, etc are found in specific feldspar varieties.\nHalf of the earth\u2019s crust is composed of feldspar (plagioclase (39%) and alkali feldspar (12%)).\nIt has light cream to salmon pink colour.\nIt is commonly used in ceramics and glass making.\nQuartz:\nIt is one of the most important components of sand and granite.\nIt consists of silica and it is a hard mineral virtually insoluble in water.\nIt is usually white or colourless.\nThey are used in the manufacturing of radio, radar, etc.\nPyroxene:\nThe common elements in pyroxene are Calcium, aluminium, magnesium, iron and silicon.\nAbout 10% of the earth\u2019s crust is made up of pyroxene.\nIt is commonly found in meteorites.\nIts colour is usually green or black.\nAmphibole:\nAluminium, calcium, silicon, iron and magnesium are the major elements of amphiboles.\nThey form 7% of the earth\u2019s crust.\nIt is green or black in colour and is used in asbestos industries commonly.\nHornblende is another form of amphiboles.\nMica:\nIt is made up of elements like potassium, aluminium, magnesium, iron, silicon, etc.\nIt forms 4% of the earth\u2019s crust.\nIt is commonly found in igneous and metamorphic rocks.\nMica is widely used in electronic instruments.\nOlivine:\nMagnesium, iron and silica are the major elements of olivine.\nIt is commonly found in basaltic rocks with a greenish colour.\nOlivine is used commonly in jewellery.\n\nAlso read: Classification of Indian Rock System\n\nRocks in the earth\u2019s Crust\nA rock is nothing but a composition of minerals.\nThey are aggregates or a physical mixture of one or more minerals.\nRocks may be hard or soft and in varied colours.\nFeldspar and quartz are the most common minerals found in all type of rocks.\nThe science dealing with the study of rocks is called as Petrology.\nClassification of Rocks\n\nAs we said above, rocks differ in their properties, the size of particles and mode of formation.\nOn the basis of mode of formation, rocks may be classified into three:\nIgneous Rocks\nSedimentary Rocks\nMetamorphic Rocks\n\n\ud83d\udc49 Which year are YOU targeting for success in the IAS/IPS/IFS Exam? \ud83d\ude80\n\n(1) \u21d2 UPSC 2025: Prelims cum Mains\n\n(2) \u21d2 UPSC 2026: Prelims cum Mains\n\n(3) \u21d2 UPSC 2027 Prelims cum Mains\n\nTip: Know more about ClearIAS Courses (Online/Offline)\n\nIgneous Rocks\nIgneous rocks are formed by the cooling of highly heated molten fluid material called as Magma.\nAsthenosphere, which is just below the upper mantle, a region beneath Lithosphere is the main source of magma.\nThey might be formed directly by cooling of magma from the interior of the earth itself or by cooling of lava from the surface of the earth.\nAs they comprise the earth\u2019s first crust and all other rocks are derived from them, they are also called as the parents of all rocks or the Primary Rocks.\nThey are the most abundant rocks in the earth\u2019s crust.\nOn the basis of their mode of occurrence, igneous rocks can be classified as Intrusive and Extrusive Igneous Rocks.\n\n\u00a01. INTRUSIVE IGNEOUS ROCKS\nThey are formed when magma solidifies below the earth\u2019s surface.\nThe rate of cooling below the earth\u2019s surface is very slow which gives rise to the formation of large crystals in the rocks.\nThat is, the mineral grains of intrusive igneous rocks are very large.\nDeep-seated intrusive igneous rocks are called as Plutonic rocks and shallow depth intrusive igneous rocks are called as Hypabyssal Rocks.\nEg: Granite, dolerite, etc.\n\n2. EXTRUSIVE IGNEOUS ROCKS\nThey are formed by the cooling of the lava on the earth\u2019s surface.\nAs lava cools very rapidly on the surface, the mineral crystals forming extrusive igneous rocks are very fine.\nThese rocks are also called as Volcanic Rocks.\nEg: Gabbro, Basalt, etc.\n\nOn the basis of chemical properties, igneous rocks can be classified as Acid and Basic Igneous rocks.\nThey are formed as a result of solidification of acidic (high viscous) or basic lava (low viscous).\nAcidic igneous rocks are composed of 65% or more of silica. They are coloured, hard and very strong (Eg: Granite).\nBasic igneous rocks contain less than 55% of silica and have more iron and magnesium. They are dark in colour, weak enough for weathering (Eg: Basalt, Gabbro).\nSedimentary Rocks\n\n\u00a0\n\nThese rocks are formed by successive deposition of sediments.\nThese sediments may be the debris eroded from any previous existing rock which may be igneous, metamorphic or old sedimentary rocks.\nThe process of successive deposition and formation of sedimentary rocks is called as Lithification.\nDue to successive depositions, they have a layered or stratified structure and hence are also called as Stratified Rocks.\nDepending upon the mode of formation, sedimentary rocks can be classified as:\n\n1. Mechanically formed/ Clastic Sedimentary Rocks\n\nThey are formed by the consolidation of sediments under excessive pressure and cementation.\nEg: Conglomerate, Breccia, Sandstone, Shale, etc.\n\n2. Organically/ Biologically formed Sedimentary Rocks\n\nThe consolidation of organic matters derived from plants and animals form this type of rocks.\nEg: Coal, limestone, chalk, chert, etc.\n\n3. Chemically formed Sedimentary Rocks\n\nThey are formed by various chemical reactions.\nEg: Gypsum, rock salt, limestone, etc.\nMetamorphic Rocks\n\nThe word metamorphic means \u2018change of form\u2019.\nHence, these rocks form under the action of temperature, pressure and volume changes on original rocks.\nMetamorphic rocks are formed under the influence of heat or pressure on original rocks which cause to change their colour, hardness, structure and composition.\nThe process of recrystallization and reorganisation of materials within the original rock is called as metamorphism.\nWhen the metamorphism happens without any appreciable chemical change, it is called as Dynamic Metamorphism.\nIf metamorphism happened due to the influence of heat, it is called as Thermal Metamorphism. It has two types: Contact Metamorphism and Regional Metamorphism.\nWhen the reorganisation occurs due to direct contact with the hot magma, it is called as Contact Metamorphism.\nIf the rocks undergo reorganisation due to tremendous heat/ pressure formed as a result of tectonic shearing, it is called as Regional Metamorphism.\nMetamorphic Rocks can be classified into Foliated (Slate, Schist, Gneiss) and Non-Foliated (Quartzite, Marble) Metamorphic Rocks on the basis of the presence or absence of bands of mineral grains.\nRock Cycle\nRocks do not remain in their original form for a long time but may undergo transformations.\nThe rock cycle is a continuous process through which old rocks are transformed into new ones as shown in the diagram below.\n\nSummary\n\u201cCrust\u201d describes the outermost shell earth. Our planet\u2019s thin, 40-kilometer deep crust\u2014just 1% of Earth\u2019s mass\u2014contains all known life in the universe.\nOceanic crust is mostly composed of different types of basalts. Geologists often refer to the rocks of the oceanic crust as \u201csima.\u201d\u00a0Sima stands for silicate and magnesium, the most abundant minerals in oceanic crust.\nContinental crust is mostly composed of different types of granites. Geologists often refer to the rocks of the continental crust as \u201csial.\u201d Sial stands for silicate and aluminum, the most abundant minerals in the continental crust.\nSial can be much thicker than sima (as thick as 70 kilometers kilometers), but also slightly less dense (about 2.7 grams per cubic centimeter).\n\nAlso read:\u00a0Prithvi Vigyan\n\nArticle by: Jijo Sudarsan",

All the best for UPSC CSE Prelims 2017!\n\nOceanic land-forms (submarine relief)\nThere are mountains, basins, plateaus, ridges, canyons and trenches beneath the ocean water too.\nThese relief features found on the ocean floor are called Submarine Relief.\nThe ocean basins are broadly divided into four major subdivisions. They are;\nContinental Shelf\nContinental slope\nAbyssal plains\nThe ocean deeps/ submarine trenches\nContinental Shelf\nThere is no clear or well-defined line separating oceans from the continent. In fact, continents do not end abruptly at the shoreline.\nThey slope seaward from coast to a point where the slope becomes very steep.\nThis shallow submerged extension of the continent is called as the Continental Shelf.\n\nThe depth usually ranges from 120 to 370 meters from the surface water.\nTheir width also varies from a few kilometers to more than 100 kilometers.\nThis variation can be seen even in the context of the Indian peninsula. The continental shelf of the western\u00a0coast of India is much wider than that of the eastern coast. (Note: NIOS text mentions the opposite case)\nContinental shelves are much narrow or absent in some continents, particularly where Fold Mountains run parallel or close to the coast.\nThe shallow water over the shelf enables sunlight to penetrate through the water to the bottom and encourages the growth of microscopic plants and animals called planktons, which are the food for fishes.\nContinental Shelves are of greater importance to man. They are the sources of fishes, \u00a0minerals including sand and gravel, etc.\nA large quantity of world\u2019s petroleum and natural gas are obtained from the shelves.\nCoral reefs are also common on continental shelves.\nOne of the striking features of the continental shelf is the presence of submarine canyons which extend to the continental slope.\nThese canyons are \u2018steep-sided valleys\u2019 cut into the floor of the seas.\nThey are very similar to the gorges found on the continents.\nOne of the reasons for the formation of the submarine canyon is the underwater landslide.\nThe continental shelf is generally considered to be territorial water extents of the nations to which it adjoins.\nContinental Slope\nThe continuous sloping portion of the continental margin, seaward of the continental shelf and extending down to the deep sea floor of the abyssal plain, is known as Continental Slope.\nIt extends between the depths of 180m to 3600m.\nThey have very little deposits of sediments on them due to their steepness and increasing distance from the land.\nSea life is also far less here than on the shelf.\nThe base of the continental slope will have deposits of sediments. This belt of sedimentary deposits forms the Continental Rise.\nAbyssal Plain\nAbyssal plains are the extremely flat and featureless plains of the deep ocean floor.\nAbyssal plains are considered as the levelest areas on the earth.\nThey cover a major portion of the ocean floors between the depths of 3000m to 6000m.\nAbyssal plains are as irregular as the continental plains with submarine plateaus, hills, guyots, and seamounts.\nThe floor of the abyssal plain is covered by sediments.\nThe sediments which are formed from the remains of living things are called Oozes.\nOozes can be seen in those seas which favour an abundant growth of organisms.\nAnother type of sediments is red clay which is of volcanic origin or made up of tiny particles brought by wind and rivers.\nSome relief feature seen on abyssal plains are:\nSubmarine Ridges\nThe oceanic mountains are called as submarine ridges.\n\nThey are linear belts occurring near the middle of the oceans and are also called mid-oceanic ridges.\nThe oceanic ridge is the site of frequent earthquakes.\nVolcanism is common in ocean ridges and it produces many relief features.\nThe Mid-Atlantic Ridge is the largest continuous submerged mountain ridge which runs from north to south in the Atlantic Ocean.\nAt some places, the peaks rise above the sea surface to form Islands.\nSeamounts and Guyots\nSubmerged volcanoes with sharp tops are called as seamounts.\nSometimes they rise above the sea as isolated islands.\nHawaii and Tahiti Islands are such exposed tops of volcanoes.\nSeamounts with a flattened top are called as Guyots or Tablemounts.\nThe Ocean Deeps/ Submarine Trenches\nThe ocean deeps are the deepest part of the ocean.\nThey are generally called submarine trenches.\nThese trenches are not always located in the middle of the ocean basins. They may be very close or parallel to the continents bordered by Fold Mountains.\nThey are usually found adjacent to the areas of volcanic and earthquake activity.\nGreat earthquakes and tsunamis are born in them.\nThe Pacific Ocean has the largest number of trenches.\nThe Mariana trench in the Pacific Ocean is the deepest known part of the world.\n\nArticle by: Jijo Sudarsan\n\n\ud83d\udc49 Which year are YOU targeting for success in the IAS/IPS/IFS Exam? \ud83d\ude80\n\n(1) \u21d2 UPSC 2025: Prelims cum Mains\n\n(2) \u21d2 UPSC 2026: Prelims cum Mains\n\n(3) \u21d2 UPSC 2027 Prelims cum Mains\n\nTip: Know more about ClearIAS Courses (Online/Offline)",

(Any large system of rotating ocean current, particularly those involved with large wind movements is called a Gyre.).\nCurrent direction:\u00a0In general, currents in the northern hemisphere travel in the clockwise direction in a gyre, while currents in the southern hemisphere travel in the anti-clockwise direction \u00a0( the only exception is the current direction in the Indian ocean, which changes seasonally.)\nThe ocean current movement in the north-Atlantic gyre, as well as north-Pacific gyre, is clockwise, while the gyres in the Southern hemisphere are anti-clockwise.\nCurrent temperature:\u00a0In general, currents in the western part of every continent are\u00a0cold (the exceptions are mentioned in the article on\u00a0movements of the ocean water).\nCurrents coming from the polar region are generally cold.\nCurrents near to equator are generally warm.\nThere is a counter-equatorial current, which moves from west to east (warm).\nThe west-wind drift moves from west to east (cold)\n\nNow, that\u2019s the only quick note you need to learn the flow pattern of ocean currents. With the above points, you can find the nature of almost all currents. Let\u2019s analyse the major ocean currents.\n\nNorth Equatorial Current\nIt is a significant Pacific and Atlantic Ocean current that flows from east to west.\nThey flow in between 100 north and 200 north latitudes.\nDespite its name, the North Equatorial Current is not connected to the equator.\nIn both oceans, it is separated from the equatorial circulation by the equatorial countercurrent, which flows eastward.\nSouth Equatorial Current\nIt is a significant ocean current in the Pacific, Atlantic and the Indian Ocean that flows from east to west.\nThey flow in between the equator and about 200 south.\nIn the Pacific and Atlantic Oceans, it extends across the equator to about 50 north.\nEquatorial Counter Current\nIt is an eastward flowing current found in the Atlantic, Indian and Pacific Oceans.\nIt is found in between the North Equatorial and South Equatorial Currents at about 3-100 northern latitudes.\nThis counter-current replaces the water removed from the eastern side of the ocean by the North Equatorial and South Equatorial Currents.\nIn the Indian Ocean, the current tends to reverse hemispheres seasonally due to the impact of reversing Asian monsoons.\nAntarctic Circumpolar Current or West Wind Drift\nIt is an ocean current that flows from west to east around Antarctica.\nThe current is circumpolar due to the lack of any landmass connecting with Antarctica and thus keeps warm ocean waters away from Antarctica.\n\nThe Antarctic Convergence is associated with this current. It is the region where the cold Antarctic waters meet the water of the Sub-Antarctic, creating a zone of upwelling (a zone of very high marine productivity).\nGyres of Ocean Currents in each of the major Oceans\n\nThe major loops are seen in the Pacific Ocean, Atlantic Ocean and the Indian Ocean in both the hemispheres. Each of the currents follows more or less a definite pattern. But the currents in the Indian Ocean (Northern Hemisphere) change the flow direction between summer and winter.\n\nCurrents of the Atlantic Ocean\nTo the north and south of the equator, there are two westward-moving currents, i.e., the North and the South Equatorial Currents.\nBetween these two, there is the counter-equatorial current which moves from west to east.\nATLANTIC OCEAN: NORTHERN\u00a0HEMISPHERE\nThe South Equatorial Current bifurcates into two branches near the Cape De Sao Roque in Brazil and its northern branch joins the North Equatorial Current.\nA part of this combined current enters the Caribbean Sea and the Gulf of Mexico, while the remaining current passes along the eastern side of the West Indies as the Antilles Current.\nThe part of the current which enters the Gulf of Mexico comes out from the Florida Strait and joins the Antilles Current.\nThis combined current moves along the south-eastern coast of the U.S.A. and is known as the Florida Current up to Cape Hatteras.\nBeyond Cape Hatteras, it is known as the Gulf Stream.\nThe Gulf Stream starts when it exits the Florida Strait and follows North America northward to Newfoundland.\n\nA cold current from the Arctic Ocean called Labrador Current, which flows along the eastern coast of Canada, meets the warm Gulf Stream near the northeast corner of the U.S.A.\nThe confluence of these two currents, one cold and the other warm, produce fog around the region and makes it the most important fishing ground in the world.\nThe Gulf Stream then deflected eastward under the combined influence of the westerlies and the rotation of the earth.\nIt then crosses the Atlantic Ocean as the warm North Atlantic Drift.\nIn this journey, another cold current from the Arctic called the East Greenland Current joins with the North Atlantic Drift.\nThe North Atlantic Drift bifurcates into two branches on reaching the eastern part of the ocean.\nThe northern branch continues as North Atlantic Drift; reaches the British Isles from where it flows along the coast of Norway as the warm Norwegian Current and enters the Arctic Ocean.\nThe southern branch flows between Spain and Azores Island as the cold Canaries Current.\nThe Canaries Current finally joins the North Equatorial Current and completes the circuit.\nATLANTIC OCEAN: SOUTHERN HEMISPHERE\n\nThe South Equatorial Current turns south and flows along the eastern coast of South America as Brazil Current.\nAt about 350 south latitude, due to the influence of westerlies and the rotation of the earth, the current moves eastward.\nA cold current called the Falkland Current which flows along the south-eastern coast of South America from south to north joins with the current at this time.\nThe Brazil Current moves eastward and crosses the Atlantic Ocean as South Atlantic Current.\nA part of the west wind drift or the Antarctic Circumpolar Current merges with the South Atlantic Current while crossing the Atlantic.\nNear the Cape of Good Hope, the South Atlantic Current is diverted northward as the Cold Benguela Current.\nBenguela Current finally joins with the South Equatorial Current and completes the circuit.\n\nAlso read:\u00a0Bottom topography of Atlantic Ocean\n\nCurrents of the Pacific Ocean\nPACIFIC\u00a0OCEAN: NORTHERN\u00a0HEMISPHERE\nThe North Equatorial Current turns northward and flows along the Philippines Islands, Taiwan, and Japan to form the warm Kuro Shio or Kuro Siwo current.\n\nLater, a cold current called Oya Shio or Oya Siwo which flows along the eastern coast of the Kamchatka Peninsula merges with the Kuro Shio Current (Okhotsk Current is a cold current that merges with the Oya Shio before its confluence with Kuro Shio).\nFrom the southeast coast of Japan, the Kuro Shio current comes under the influence of westerlies and flow right across the ocean as the North Pacific Current.\nAfter reaching the west coast of North America, it bifurcates into two branches: the northern branch flows anti-clockwise along the coast of Alaska as warm Alaska Current and the southern branch moves southward along the coast of California as the cold California Current.\nCalifornia Current eventually joins with the North Equatorial Current and completes the circuit.\nPACIFIC\u00a0OCEAN: SOUTHERN\u00a0HEMISPHERE\n\nIn the South Pacific Ocean, the South Equatorial Current flows towards the west and turns southward as the East Australian Current.\nFrom Tasmania, it flows as the cold South Pacific Current from west to east and crosses the Pacific Ocean along with the West Wind Drift.\nOn reaching the south-western coast of South America, it turns northward and flows as the cold Peru Current or Humbolt Current.\nThe cold waters of the Peru Current are partially responsible for making the coast of northern Chile and western Peru with very scanty rainfall.\nPeru Current eventually joins with the South Equatorial Current and completes the circuit.\nCurrents of the Indian Ocean\nThe pattern of circulation of ocean currents in the Indian Ocean differs from the general pattern of circulation in the Atlantic and the Pacific Oceans.\nThis is because the Indian Ocean is blocked by the continental masses in the north.\nThe general pattern of circulation in the southern hemisphere of the Indian Ocean is anti-clockwise as that of the other oceans.\nIn the northern hemisphere, there is a clear reversal of currents in the winter and summer seasons, which are completely under the influence of the seasonal changes of monsoon winds.\nINDIAN OCEAN: NORTHERN\u00a0HEMISPHERE DURING WINTER\n\nDuring winter, Sri Lanka divides the currents of the Arabian Sea from those of the Bay of Bengal.\nThe North-East Monsoon Drift flows westward just south of Sri Lanka with a countercurrent flow between it and the South Equatorial Current.\nDuring the winter season, in the northern section, the Bay of Bengal and the Arabian Sea are under the influence of North East Monsoon Winds.\nThese North East Monsoon winds drive the waters of the Bay of Bengal and the Arabian Sea westward to circulate in an anti-clockwise direction.\nINDIAN OCEAN: NORTHERN\u00a0HEMISPHERE DURING\u00a0SUMMER\n\nIn summer, the northern part comes under the influence of the South West Monsoon.\nIt results in an easterly movement of water in the Bay of Bengal and the Arabian Sea in a clockwise direction.\nThis current is called the South West Monsoon Drift.\nIn the Indian Ocean, the summer currents are more regular than those of the winter.\nINDIAN OCEAN: SOUTHERN\u00a0HEMISPHERE\nIn the southern part, the South Equatorial Current which flows from east to west is strengthened by its corresponding current of the Pacific Ocean.\nIt then turns southward along the coast of Mozambique in Africa.\nA part of this current moving in between the African mainland and Mozambique is called the warm Mozambique Current.\nAfter the confluence of these two parts, the current is called Agulhas Current.\nAgulhas Current merges with the West Wind Drift when it crosses the Indian Ocean.\nA branch of this merged current flows along the western coast of Australia as the cold West Australian Current.\nIt later joins with the South Equatorial Current to complete the circuit.\n\nAlso read: Indian Ocean Geoid Low\n\nSummary\n\nAs mentioned above, the quick way to remember ocean currents is to remember the gyres.\n\nCurrents in the western part of every continent are cold.\n\nCurrents coming from the polar region are generally cold.\n\nCurrents near to equator are generally warm.\n\nArticle by: Jijo Sudarsan",

It is the period between high tide and low tide during which water flows away from the shore.\nTypes of Tides\n\nA. Tides based on the frequency\n\nSemi-diurnal Tide: They are the most common tidal pattern, featuring two high tides and two low tides each day.\nDiurnal Tides: Only one high tide and one low tide each day.\nMixed Tide: Tides having variations in height are known as mixed tides. They generally occur along the west coast of North America.\n\nB. Tides based on the sun, the moon, and the earth\u2019s positions\n\nSpring Tides: When the sun, the moon, and the earth are in a straight line, the height of the tide will be higher than normal. These are called spring tides. They occur twice a month on the full moon (Poornima) and the other on the new moon (Amavasya).\nNeap Tides: Normally after seven days of a spring tide, the sun and the moon become at a right angle to each other concerning the earth. Thus, the gravitational forces of the sun and the moon tend to counteract one another. The tides during this period will be lower than the normal which are called the neap tides. They also occur twice in a month- during the first quarter moon and the last quarter moon.\nMagnitude of Tides\n\nPerigee: When the moon\u2019s orbit is closest to the Earth, it is called a perigee. During this period, unusually high and low tides occur.\n\nApogee: When the moon\u2019s orbit is farthest from the earth, it is called an apogee. Tidal ranges will be much less than the average during this period.\n\nPerihelion: It is the position where the earth is closest to the sun (around January 3rd). Unusual high and low tides occur during this time.\n\nAphelion: It is the position where the earth is farthest from the sun (around July 4th). Tidal ranges are much less than the average during this period.\n\nTIDAL BORE\n\nWhen the leading edge of the incoming tide forms a wave/ waves of water that travel up a river or a narrow bay against the direction of the river or bay\u2019s current, it is called a tidal bore. The Indian rivers like the Ganges, Brahmaputra, Indus, etc. exhibit tidal bores.\n\nINTER-TIDAL ZONE\n\nThe intertidal zone, also known as the foreshore and seashore and sometimes referred to as the littoral zone, is the area that is above water at low tide and under water at high tide (i.e., the area between the tide marks).\n\nEFFECTS OF TIDES\nTides act as a link between the port and the open sea. Some of the major ports of the world, such as London port on the river Thames and Kolkata port on river Hugli are located on the rivers away from the sea coast.\nThe tidal current clears away the river sediments and slows down the growth of the delta.\nIt increases the depth of water which helps ships to move safely to the ports.\nIt also acts as a source for producing electricity.\n\nRead: Tidal Energy\n\nOcean Currents\n\nThe ocean currents are the horizontal flow of a mass of water in a fairly defined direction over great distances.\nThey are just like a river flowing in an ocean.\nOcean currents can be formed by the winds, density differences in ocean waters due to differences in temperature and salinity, gravity, and events such as earthquakes.\nThe direction of movement of an ocean current is mainly influenced by the rotation of the earth (due to the Coriolis force, most ocean currents in the northern hemisphere move in a clockwise manner, and ocean currents in the southern hemisphere move in an anti-clockwise manner).\nGyre, Drift, and Stream\nAny large system of rotating ocean currents, particularly those involved with large wind movements is called a Gyre. They are caused by the Coriolis force.\nWhen the ocean water moves forward under the influence of prevailing wind, it is called Drift (The term \u2018drift\u2019 is also used to refer to the speed of an ocean current which is measured in knots). E.g. North Atlantic Drift.\nWhen a large mass of ocean water moves in a definite path just like a large river on the continent, it is called a Stream. They will have greater speed than drifts. E.g. Gulf Stream.\nOcean eddies are swirling, rotating masses of water that can occur within ocean currents. They can have a significant impact on local oceanic and atmospheric conditions.\nTypes of Ocean Currents\n\nWarm Ocean Currents:\n\nThose currents that flow from equatorial regions towards poles which have a higher surface temperature and are called warm current.\nThey bring warm waters to the cold regions.\nThey are usually observed on the east coast of the continents in the lower and middle latitudes of both hemispheres.\nIn the northern hemisphere, they are also found on the west coast of the continents in the higher latitudes (E.g. Alaska and Norwegian Currents).\n\nCold Ocean Currents:\n\nThose currents that flow from polar regions towards the equator have a lower surface temperature and are called cold currents.\nThey bring cold waters into warm areas.\nThese currents are usually found on the west coast of the continents in low and middle latitudes of both hemispheres.\nIn the northern hemisphere, they are also found on the east coast in the higher latitudes (E.g. Labrador, East Greenland, and Oyashio currents).\n\nThe ocean currents can be also classified as:\n\nSurface Currents: They constitute about 10% of all the water in an ocean. These waters are occupied at the upper 400m of an ocean or the Ekman Layer. It is the layer of ocean water which moves due to the stress of blowing the wind and this motion is thus called Ekman Transport.\nDeep Water Currents: They constitute about 90% of the ocean water. They move around the ocean basin due to variations in the density and gravity.\n\nRead:\u00a0Marine cold waves\n\nFactors influencing the origin and nature of ocean currents\n\nDifference in density\n\nAs we all know, the density of seawater varies from place to place according to its temperature and proportion of salinity.\nThe density increases with an increase in salinity and decreases with a decrease in salinity.\nBut when the temperature increases, density decreases, and when the temperature decreases density increases.\nThis increase and decrease in density due to the differences in temperature and salinity causes the water to move from one place to another.\nSuch a movement of water due to the differences in density as a function of water temperature and salinity is called the Thermohaline Circulation.\nIn polar regions, due to a lower temperature, the waters will be of high density. This causes the waters to sink to the bottom and then to move towards the less dense middle and lower latitudes (or towards the equatorial regions).\nThey rise (upwelling) at the warm region and push the already existing less dense, warm water towards the poles.\nWhile considering the equatorial region, the high temperature in those regions causes the water to expand. Thus, the waters in these regions will be at a higher level than that of the middle and upper latitudes. This also creates a gradient and results in the movement of waters from the equatorial region to the middle and upper latitudes.\n\nThe earth\u2019s rotation\n\nEarth\u2019s rotation causes Coriolis force which deflects the air to its right in the northern hemisphere and its left in the southern hemisphere.\nSimilarly, ocean water is also affected by the Coriolis force and follows Ferrel\u2019s Law.\nHence, ocean currents in the northern hemisphere move in a clockwise (towards right) direction, and ocean currents in the southern hemisphere move in an anti-clockwise (towards left) direction (In the Indian Ocean due to the impact of the Asian monsoon, the currents in the northern hemisphere do not follow this pattern of movements all time).\n\nThe winds\n\nThe winds like trade winds and westerlies drive the ocean water in a steady flow in front of them.\nWhen the direction of the winds changes, the direction of the current also gets changed.\n\nThe movement of ocean water is a critical component of Earth\u2019s climate system and has far-reaching effects on weather patterns, marine ecosystems, and global climate regulation. Scientists continue to study and monitor these processes to better understand their impacts on our planet.\n\nArticle by: Jijo Sudarsan",

(See\u00a0Major Ocean Currents: How to learn faster?) Having covered most of the important concepts in Lithosphere and Hydrosphere, in this article, we are going to discuss the composition and structure of the Earth\u2019s Atmosphere in detail.\n\nTable of Contents\n\nWhat is atmosphere?\nComposition of the atmosphere\nGases of the atmosphere\nCarbon dioxide:\nOzone gas:\nWater Vapour\nDust Particles\nStructure of the atmosphere\nTroposphere\nStratosphere\nMesosphere\nThermosphere\nExosphere\nWhat is atmosphere?\n\nWe all know that earth is a unique planet due to the presence of life. The air is one among the necessary conditions for the existence of life on this planet. The air is a mixture of several gases and it encompasses the earth from all sides. The air surrounding the earth is called the atmosphere.\n\nAtmosphere\u00a0is the air surrounding the earth.\nThe atmosphere is a mixture of different gases. It contains life-giving gases like Oxygen for humans and animals and carbon dioxide for plants.\nIt envelops the earth all round and is held in place by the gravity of the earth.\nIt helps in stopping the ultraviolet rays harmful to the life and maintains the suitable temperature necessary for life.\nGenerally, atmosphere extends up to about 1600 km from the earth\u2019s surface. However, 99 % of the total mass of the atmosphere is confined to the height of 32 km from the earth\u2019s surface.\nComposition of the atmosphere\nThe atmosphere is made up of different gases, water vapour and dust particles.\nThe composition of the atmosphere is not static and it changes according to the time and place.\nGases of the atmosphere\n\nThe atmosphere is a mixture of different types of gases.\nNitrogen and oxygen are the two main gases in the atmosphere and 99 percentage of the atmosphere is made up of these two gases.\nOther gases like argon, carbon dioxide, neon, helium, hydrogen, etc. form the remaining part of the atmosphere.\nThe portion of the gases changes in the higher layers of the atmosphere in such a way that oxygen will be almost negligible quantity at the heights of 120 km.\nSimilarly, carbon dioxide (and water vapour) is found only up to 90 km from the surface of the earth.\nCARBON DIOXIDE:\nCarbon dioxide is meteorologically a very important gas.\nIt is transparent to the incoming solar radiation (insolation) but opaque to the outgoing terrestrial radiation.\nIt absorbs a part of terrestrial radiation and reflects back some part of it towards the earth\u2019s surface.\nCarbon dioxide is largely responsible for the greenhouse effect.\nWhen the volume of other gases remains constant in the atmosphere, the volume of the carbon dioxide has been rising in the past few decades mainly because of the burning of fossil fuels. This rising volume of carbon dioxide is the main reason for global warming.\nOZONE GAS:\nOzone is another important component of the atmosphere found mainly between 10 and 50 km above the earth\u2019s surface.\nIt acts as a filter and absorbs the ultra-violet rays radiating from the sun and prevents them from reaching the surface of the earth.\nThe amount of ozone gas in the atmosphere is very little and is limited to the ozone layer found in the stratosphere.\nWater Vapour\nGases form of water present in the atmosphere is called water vapour.\nIt is the source of all kinds of precipitation.\nThe amount of water vapour decreases with altitude. It also decreases from the equator (or from the low latitudes) towards the poles (or towards the high latitudes).\nIts maximum amount in the atmosphere could be up to 4% which is found in the warm and wet regions.\nWater vapour reaches in the atmosphere through evaporation and transpiration. Evaporation takes place in the oceans, seas, rivers, ponds and lakes while transpiration takes place from the plants, trees and living beings.\nWater vapour absorbs part of the incoming solar radiation (insolation) from the sun and preserves the earth\u2019s radiated heat. It thus acts like a blanket allowing the earth neither to become too cold nor too hot.\nWater vapour also contributes to the stability and instability in the air.\nDust Particles\nDust particles are generally found in the lower layers of the atmosphere.\nThese particles are found in the form of sand, smoke-soot, oceanic salt, ash, pollen, etc.\nHigher concentration of dust particles is found in subtropical and temperate regions due to dry winds in comparison to equatorial and polar regions.\nThese dust particles help in the condensation of water vapour. During the condensation, water vapour gets condensed in the form of droplets around these dust particles and thus clouds are formed.\nStructure of the atmosphere\n\nThe atmosphere can be divided into five layers according to the diversity of temperature and density. They are:\n\nTroposphere\nStratosphere\nMesosphere\nThermosphere (Ionosphere)\nExosphere\n\nTroposphere\nIt is the lowermost layer of the atmosphere.\nThe height of this layer is about 18 km on the equator and 8 km on the poles.\nThe thickness of the troposphere is greatest at the equator because heat us transported to great heights by strong convectional currents.\nTroposphere contains dust particles and water vapour.\nThis is the most important layer of the atmosphere because all kinds of weather changes take place only in this layer.\nThe air never remains static in this layer. Therefore this layer is called \u2018changing sphere\u2019 or troposphere.\nThe environmental temperature decreases with increasing height of the atmosphere. It decreases at the rate of 1 degree Celsius for every 165 m of height. This is called Normal Lapse Rate.\nThe zone separating troposphere from the stratosphere is known as tropopause.\nThe air temperature at the tropopause is about \u2013 80 degree Celsius over the equator and about \u2013 45 degree Celsius over the poles. The temperature here is nearly constant, and hence, it is called tropopause.\nStratosphere\nStratosphere is found just above the troposphere.\nIt extends up to a height of 50 km.\nThe temperature remains almost the same in the lower part of this layer up to the height of 20 km. After this, the temperature increases slowly with the increase in the height. The temperature increases due to the presence of ozone gas in the upper part of this layer.\nWeather related incidents do not take place in this layer. The air blows horizontally here. Therefore this layer is considered ideal for flying of aircraft.\nThe upper limit of the stratosphere is known as stratopause.\nOne important feature of stratosphere is that it contains a layer of ozone gas.\nThe relative thickness of the ozone layer is measured in Dobson Units.\nIt is mainly found in the lower portion of the stratosphere, from approximately 20 to 30 km above the earth\u2019s surface.\nIt contains a high concentration of ozone (O3) in relation to other parts of the atmosphere.\nIt is the region of the stratosphere that absorbs most of the sun\u2019s ultra-violet radiations.\nMesosphere\nIt is the third layer of the atmosphere spreading over the stratosphere.\nIt extends up to a height of 80 km.\nIn this layer, the temperature starts decreasing with increasing altitude and reaches up to \u2013 100 degree Celsius at the height of 80 km.\nMeteors or falling stars occur in this layer.\nThe upper limit of the mesosphere is known as mesopause.\nThermosphere\nThis layer is located between 80 and 400 km above the mesopause.\nIt contains electrically charged particles known as ions, and hence, it is known as the ionosphere.\nRadio waves transmitted from the earth are reflected back to the earth by this layer and due to this, radio broadcasting has become possible.\nThe temperature here starts increasing with heights.\nExosphere\nThe exosphere is the uppermost layer of the atmosphere.\nGases are very sparse in this sphere due to the lack of gravitational force. Therefore, the density of air is very less here.\n\nWhat\u2019s next in the series: Insolation and Heat Balance of the Earth\n\n\ud83d\udc49 Which year are YOU targeting for success in the IAS/IPS/IFS Exam? \ud83d\ude80\n\n(1) \u21d2 UPSC 2025: Prelims cum Mains\n\n(2) \u21d2 UPSC 2026: Prelims cum Mains\n\n(3) \u21d2 UPSC 2027 Prelims cum Mains\n\nTip: Know more about ClearIAS Courses (Online/Offline)\n\nArticle by: Jijo Sudarshan",

    "[CONTENT] #48": "In the previous article, we discussed the composition and structure of the Earth\u2019s atmosphere. The atmosphere is essential for the survival of plant and animal life. They also require the optimum temperature to keep themselves warm and grow. In this article, we are going to discuss in detail some of the topics like insolation, terrestrial radiation, heat budget of the earth, albedo, etc.\n\nTable of Contents\n\nInsolation or Incoming Solar Radiation\nFactors influencing Insolation\n1.

Advection (horizontal transfer of heat)\nHeat Budget of the Earth\nAlbedo\nLatest developments\nVariation in the net budget at the earth\u2019s surface\nInsolation or Incoming Solar Radiation\n\nAs we all know, the sun is the primary source of energy for the Earth. The sun radiates its energy in all directions into space in short wavelengths, which is known as solar radiation.\nThe earth\u2019s surface receives only a part of this radiated energy (2 units out of 1,00,00,00,000 units of energy radiated by the sun).\nThe energy received by the earth\u2019s surface in the form of short waves is termed Incoming Solar Radiation or Insolation.\nThe amount of insolation received on the earth\u2019s surface is far less than that is radiated from the sun because of the small size of the earth and its distance from the sun.\nMoreover, water vapor, dust particles, ozone, and other gases present in the atmosphere absorb a small amount of solar radiation.\nThe solar radiation received at the top of the atmosphere varies slightly in a year due to the variations in the distance between the earth and the sun.\nDuring the earth\u2019s revolution around the sun, the earth is farthest from the sun on the 4th of July. This position of the earth is called aphelion. On 3rd January, the earth is nearest to the sun. This position is called perihelion.\nDue to this variation in the distance between the Earth and the sun, the annual insolation received by the earth on 3rd January is slightly more than the amount received on 4th July.\nHowever, the effect of this variation is masked by some other factors like the distribution of land and sea and the atmospheric circulation. Hence the variation does not have a greater effect on daily weather changes on the surface of the earth.\nFactors influencing Insolation\n\nThe amount of insolation received on the earth\u2019s surface is not uniform everywhere. It varies according to the place and time. When the tropical regions receive maximum annual insolation, it gradually decreases towards the poles. Insolation is more in summers and less in winters. The major factors which influence the amount of insolation received are:\n\nRotation of the earth on its axis\nThe angle of incidence of the sun\u2019s rays\nDuration of the day\nTransparency of the atmosphere\n1. Rotation of the earth on its axis\n\nThe earth rotates on its axis which makes an angle of 66.5 with the plane of its orbit around the sun.\nThe rotation of the earth on this inclined axis has a greater influence on the amount of insolation received at different latitudes.\n2. The angle of incidence of the sun\u2019s rays\n\nSince the earth is a geoid resembling a sphere, the sun\u2019s rays strike the surface at different angles at different places. This depends on the latitude of the place.\nThe higher the latitude, the less the angle they make with the surface of the earth.\nThe area covered by the vertical rays is always less than the slant rays. If more area is covered, the energy gets distributed and the net energy received per unit area decreases.\nMoreover, the sun\u2019s rays with small angles traverse more of the atmosphere than rays striking at a large angle.\nThe longer the path of the sun\u2019s rays, the greater the amount of reflection and absorption of heat by the atmosphere. As a result, the intensity of insolation is less.\n3. Duration of the day\nThe duration of the day varies from place to place and season to season. It decides the amount of insolation received on the earth\u2019s surface.\nThe longer the day, the greater the amount of insolation received. Conversely, a shorter day leads to the receipt of less insolation.\n4. Transparency of the atmosphere\n\nThe transparency of the atmosphere depends upon the cloud cover and its thickness, dust particles, water vapor, etc. They reflect, absorb, or transmit insolation.\nA thick cloud hinders solar radiation from reaching the earth\u2019s surface. Similarly, water vapour absorbs solar radiation resulting in less amount of insolation reaching the surface.\nWhen solar radiation passes through the atmosphere, water vapor, ozone, and other gases absorb much of the near-infrared radiation (mainly in the troposphere).\nVery small suspended particles in the troposphere scatter visible spectrum both to space and towards the earth\u2019s surface. This process adds color to the sky.\nThe red color of the rising and the setting sun and the blue color of the sky are the results of the scattering of the light within the atmosphere.\n\nNote: Maximum insolation is received over the subtropical desert, where the cloudiness is the least. The equator receives comparatively less insolation than the tropics. Generally, at the same latitude, the insolation is higher over the continent than over the oceans. In winter, the middle and higher latitudes receive less radiation than in summer.\n\n\ud83d\udc49 Which year are YOU targeting for success in the IAS/IPS/IFS Exam? \ud83d\ude80\n\n(1) \u21d2 UPSC 2025: Prelims cum Mains\n\n(2) \u21d2 UPSC 2026: Prelims cum Mains\n\n(3) \u21d2 UPSC 2027 Prelims cum Mains\n\nTip: Know more about ClearIAS Courses (Online/Offline)\n\nHeating and Cooling of the Atmosphere\n\nThe sun is the ultimate source of atmospheric heat and energy. There are different ways of heating and cooling of the atmosphere. They are:\n\nTerrestrial Radiation\nConduction\nConvection\nAdvection\n1. Terrestrial Radiation\n\nBefore discussing terrestrial radiation, the following facts about radiation are worth noting.\n\nAll objects whether hot or cold emit radiant energy continuously.\nHotter objects emit more energy per unit area than colder objects.\nThe temperature of an object determines the wavelength of radiation. Temperature and wavelength are inversely proportional. The hotter the object, the shorter the length of the wave.\nSo, when the earth\u2019s surface is heated up by the insolation (in the form of short waves), it becomes a radiating body.\nThe earth\u2019s surface starts to radiate energy to the atmosphere in the form of long waves.\nThis is what we call terrestrial radiation. This energy heats the atmosphere from bottom to top.\nIt should be noted that the atmosphere is transparent to short waves and opaque to long waves.\nThe long-wave radiation is absorbed by the atmospheric gases, particularly by carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases. Thus, the atmosphere is indirectly heated by the terrestrial radiation.\nThe atmosphere, in turn, radiates and transmits heat to space. Finally, the amount of heat received from the sun is returned to space, thereby maintaining a constant temperature at the earth\u2019s surface and in the atmosphere.\n2. Conduction (transfer of heat by contact)\nConduction is the process of heat transfer from a warmer object to a cooler object when they come in contact with each other.\nThe flow of heat energy continues till the temperature of both the objects becomes equal or the contact is broken.\nThe conduction in the atmosphere occurs at the zone of contact between the atmosphere and the earth\u2019s surface.\nConduction is important in heating the lower layers of the atmosphere.\n3. Convection (vertical transfer of heat)\n\nTransfer of heat by the movement of a mass or substance from one place to another, generally vertical, is called convection.\nThe air of the lower layers of the atmosphere gets heated either by the earth\u2019s radiation or by conduction. The heating of the air leads to its expansion. Its density decreases and it moves upwards.\nThe continuous ascent of heated air creates a vacuum in the lower layers of the atmosphere. As a consequence, cooler air comes down to fill the vacuum, leading to convection.\nThe cyclic movement associated with the convectional process in the atmosphere transfers heat from the lower layer to the upper layer and heats the atmosphere.\nThe convection transfer of energy is confined only to the troposphere.\n4. Advection (horizontal transfer of heat)\nThe transfer of heat through the horizontal movement of air (wind) is called advection.\nWinds carry the temperature of one place to another. The temperature of a place will rise if it lies in the path of winds coming from warmer regions. The temperature will fall if the place lies in the path of the winds blowing from cold regions.\nThe horizontal movement of the air is relatively more important than the vertical movement. In the middle latitudes, most of diurnal (day and night) variations in daily weather are caused by advection alone.\nIn tropical regions particularly in northern India during the summer season, local winds called \u2018Loo\u2019 are the outcome of the advection process.\nHeat Budget of the Earth\n\nThe earth as a whole does not accumulate or lose heat. It maintains its temperature.\nThis can happen only if the amount of heat received in the form of insolation equals the amount lost by the earth through terrestrial radiation.\nThis balance between the insolation and the terrestrial radiation is termed the heat budget or heat balance of the earth.\nThis is why the earth neither warms up nor cools down despite the huge transfer of heat that takes place.\nAlbedo\n\nAlbedo can be simply defined as a measure of how much light that hits a surface is reflected without being absorbed.\nIt is a reflection coefficient and has a value of less than one.\nWhen solar radiation passes through the atmosphere, some amount of it is reflected, scattered, and absorbed.\nThe reflected amount of radiation is called the albedo of the earth.\nThe value of albedo will be different for different surfaces.\nBecause of the effect of albedo, highly developed areas such as urban cities can experience higher average temperatures than the surrounding suburban or rural areas, a phenomenon known as the \u201cUrban Heat Island Effect\u201d.\nThe higher average temperature can be attributed to less vegetation, higher population densities, and more infrastructures with dark surfaces (asphalt roads, brick buildings, etc.).\nLatest developments\n\nNASA Launches Small Climate Satellite to Study Earth\u2019s Poles: The first of a pair of climate satellites designed to study heat emissions at Earth\u2019s poles for NASA is in orbit as it launched on May 25 2024.\n\nThe agency\u2019s PREFIRE (Polar Radiant Energy in the Far-InfraRed Experiment) mission consists of two shoebox-size cube satellites or CubeSats, that will measure the amount of heat Earth radiates into space from two of the coldest, most remote regions on the planet. Data from the PREFIRE mission will help researchers better predict how Earth\u2019s ice, seas, and weather will change in a warming world.\n\nVariation in the net budget at the earth\u2019s surface\nAlthough the earth as a whole maintains a balance between the insolation and the terrestrial radiation, this is not what we observe at different latitudes.\nAs we have discussed earlier, there are variations in the amount of insolation received at different latitudes.\nIn the tropical region, the amount of insolation is higher than the amount of terrestrial radiation. Hence it is a region of surplus heat. In the polar region, the heat gain is less than the heat loss. Hence it is a region of deficit heat.\nThus the insolation creates an imbalance of heat at different latitudes.\nThis imbalance is nullified to some extent by winds and ocean currents, which transfer heat from surplus heat regions to deficit heat regions.\nThis process of redistribution and balancing of latitudinal heat is commonly known as Latitudinal Heat Balance.\n\nNote: Topics like Temperature, Factors controlling Temperature, and Distribution of Temperature will be covered in the next article.\n\nAlso read:\u00a0Prithvi Vigyan; Ocean heat content\n\nArticle by: Jijo Sudarshan",

Cirrus\n\t\nThey are thin and often wispy. Typically found at heights greater than 20,000 feet (6,000 meters), they are composed of ice crystals that originate from the freezing of supercooled water droplets.\n\n\n2. Cirrostratus\n\t\nThey are high, very thin, comprise a uniform layer, and are composed of ice crystals. It isn\u2019t easy to detect and is capable of forming halos when the cloud takes the form of thin cirrostratus nebulosus.\n\n\n3. Cirrocumulus\n\t\nThey are small rounded puffs shaped, that usually appear in long rows high in the sky and are white, but sometimes appear grey.\n\n2) Middle Clouds\n\nThey form between 6,500 feet and cirrus level or from 2000 to 6000 meters.\nThey are also known as\u00a0\u00a0\u201cAlto\u201d clouds.\nThey frequently indicate an approaching storm.\nThey may sometimes produce Virga, which is rain or snow that does not reach the ground.\nTypes\n\t\nDescription\n\n\n1. Altostratus\n\t\nThese are in the form of continuous sheets or veils, grey or blue-gray. They are composed of ice crystals and water droplets. In its thinner areas, the sun can still be visible as a round, dim disk. These clouds may often form ahead of storms with continuous rain or snow.\n\n\n2. Altocumulus\n\t\nThey are greyish sheet-like, characterized by globular masses or rolls in layers or patches, the individual elements being larger and darker than those of cirrocumulus and smaller than those of stratocumulus.\n\n3)\u00a0Low Clouds\n\nThey lie below 6,500 feet, which means from the surface to 2,000 meters.\nThey are also known as Stratus Clouds.\nThey may appear dense, dark, and rainy (or snowy) and can also be cottony white clumps interspersed with blue sky.\n\nTypes\n\t\nDescription\n\n\n1. Strato Cumulus\n\t\nUsually arranged in large dark, rounded, or globular masses, usually in groups, lines, or waves.\n\n\n2. Stratus\n\t\nIt usually looks like a huge grey blanket that hangs low in the sky resembles fog, comprises a uniform layer, and appears dull, if these clouds are warm it means rain and if it is cold it snows.\n\n\n3. Nimbostratus\n\t\nThey are known as \u2018Rain Clouds\u2019 and they are dark, thick, and accompanied by light to moderately falling precipitation.\n\n4) Great Vertical Extent Clouds\n\nThey are the most dramatic type.\nThey are also known as Storm Clouds.\nThey rise to dramatic heights, and sometimes well above the level of transcontinental jetliner flights.\n\nTypes\n\t\nDescription\n\n\n1. Cumulus\n\t\nThey are convection-type, puffy, and sometimes look like pieces of floating cotton. The base of each one is often flat and maybe only 1000 meters (3300 feet) above the ground. The top of the cloud has rounded towers.\n\n\n2. Cumulonimbus\n\t\nThey are dense towering and vertical and their top acquires an \u2018Anvil Shape\u2019, associated with thunderstorms and atmospheric instability, forming from water vapor carried by powerful upward air currents.\nLearn all cloud types in a single diagram\n\nWhat is International Cloud Atlas?\n\nThe International Cloud Atlas describes the classification system for clouds and meteorological phenomena used by all World Meteorological Organization Members.\nIt includes a manual of standards and photographs of clouds and weather phenomena.\nIt was first published in the 19th century and was last updated 30 years ago.\nThe new 2017 version of \u00a0International Cloud Atlas was a digitalized one and has many additions.\nThe new cloud classifications\n\n1) The Species\n\nVolutus\n\nThey are long, typically low, horizontal, detached, tube-shaped cloud masses.\nThey often appear to roll slowly about a horizontal axis.\nThe species volutus is a soliton and hence not attached to other clouds.\nThis species applies mostly to Stratocumulus and rarely Altocumulus.\n\n2) The Supplementary Features\n\n(a)\u00a0Asperitas\n\nThere are well-defined, wave-like structures on the underside of the cloud.\nAsperitas is characterized by localized waves in the cloud base, either smooth or dappled with smaller features, sometimes descending into sharp points, as if viewing a roughened sea surface from below.\nThe varying levels of illumination and thickness of the cloud can lead to dramatic visual effects.\nThey occur\u00a0mostly with Stratocumulus and Altocumulus.\n\n(b) Fluctus\n\nThey are relatively short-lived wave formations, usually seen on the top surface of the cloud, in the form of curls or breaking waves (Kelvin-Helmholtz waves).\nThey occur mostly with Cirrus, Altocumulus, Stratocumulus, Stratus, and occasionally Cumulus.\n\n(c) Cavum\n\nThese are well-defined generally circular holes in a thin layer of supercooled water droplet cloud.\nThe Cavum is typically a circular feature when viewed from directly beneath, but may appear oval-shaped when viewed from a distance. When resulting directly from the interaction of an aircraft with the cloud, it is generally linear.\nThey occur in Altocumulus and Cirrocumulus and rarely Stratocumulus.\n\n(d) Murus\n\nIt is a localized, persistent, and often abrupt lowering of cloud from the base of a Cumulonimbus from which tuba (spouts) sometimes form.\nUsually associated with a supercell or severe multi-cell storm.\nMurus showing significant rotation and vertical motion may result in the formation of tuba (spouts), Commonly known as a \u2018wall cloud\u2019.\n\n(e) Cauda\n\nA horizontal, tail-shaped cloud (not a funnel) at low levels extends from the main precipitation region of a supercell Cumulonimbus to the murus (wall cloud).\nIt is typically attached to the wall cloud, and the bases of both are typically at the same height.\nCloud motion is away from the precipitation area and towards the murus, with rapid upward motion often observed near the junction of the tail and wall clouds and is commonly known as a \u2018tail cloud\u2019.\n\n3) Accessory Cloud\n\nFlumen\n\nThey are bands of low clouds associated with a supercell severe convective storm (Cumulonimbus), arranged parallel to the low-level winds and moving into or towards the supercell.\nThese accessory clouds form on an inflow band into a supercell storm along the pseudo-warm front.\nOne particular type of inflow band cloud is the \u2018Beaver\u2019s tail\u2019. This is distinguished by a relatively broad, flat appearance suggestive of a beaver\u2019s tail.\n\n4) Special Clouds\n\n(a)\u00a0Flammagenitus\n\nThese are observed to have originated as a consequence of localized natural heat sources (forest fires, wildfires, or volcanic activity) and consist of water drops.\n\n(b)\u00a0Homogenitus\n\nThese originated specifically as a consequence of human activity.\nThey include\u00a0aircraft condensation trails (contrails), or clouds resulting from industrial processes, such as cumuliform clouds generated by rising thermals above power station cooling towers.\n\n(c)\u00a0Homomutatus\n\nThese are formed as a result of persistent contrails (Cirrus homogenitus) that may be observed, over some time and under the influence of strong upper winds, to grow and spread out over a larger portion of the sky, and undergo internal transformation such that the cloud eventually takes on the appearance of a more natural cirriform cloud.\n\n(d)\u00a0Cataractagenitus\n\nThey may develop locally in the vicinity of large waterfalls due to water broken up into spray by the falls.\nCataractagenitus is formed when the downdraft caused by the falling water is compensated for by the locally ascending motion of air.\n\n(e) Silvagenitus\n\nThese may develop locally over the forests as a result of increased humidity due to evaporation and evapotranspiration from the tree canopy.\n\nWhat is Asperitas Cloud?\n\nAsperitas was formerly known as Undulatus asperitus.\nIt is a cloud formation proposed by Gavin Pretor-Pinney of the Cloud Appreciation Society (2009).\nIt was recently been accepted and added to the International Cloud Atlas on March 23, 2017, on the occasion of World Meteorological Day.\nThe \u2018Asperitas\u2019 is a Latin word and its meaning is \u2018Rough\u2018.\nThe Asperitas clouds tend to be low-lying and are caused by weather fronts that create undulating waves in the atmosphere.\nPyrocumulonimbus clouds\n\n2024: Wildfires raging in the United States and Canada are so intense that they have created pyrocumulonimbus clouds, which have the potential to spit out thunder and spark more fires.\n\nPyrocumulonimbus clouds (or pyroCb clouds) are a type of cumulonimbus cloud that forms specifically due to intense heat sources, such as wildfires, volcanic eruptions, or even nuclear explosions. These clouds are often associated with extreme weather phenomena and can have significant impacts on the environment.\n\nFormation: Pyrocumulonimbus clouds form when intense heat from a fire or eruption causes air to rise rapidly, creating an updraft. As the air ascends, it cools and condenses, forming a cloud. If the updraft is strong enough, it can create a cumulonimbus cloud, which is a thunderstorm cloud, but in this case, the \u201cpyro\u201d prefix indicates that it is fire-induced.\nStructure: These clouds can reach the stratosphere, much higher than typical thunderstorms, and are capable of producing lightning, hail, and even fire-induced tornadoes. They also generate strong downdrafts that can exacerbate the spread of fires on the ground.\nEnvironmental Impact: Pyrocumulonimbus clouds can inject large amounts of smoke, ash, and other aerosols into the upper atmosphere, affecting air quality and potentially influencing weather patterns. They are also known for their role in creating \u201cdirty\u201d thunderstorms, where lightning occurs in the absence of significant rainfall.\nGlobal Significance: Due to their ability to transport smoke and particles into the stratosphere, pyroCbs can have global implications, including contributing to climate change by affecting the Earth\u2019s radiation balance.\nExamples: These clouds have been observed during significant wildfire events, such as the Australian bushfires in 2019-2020, and the massive wildfires in Canada and the western United States. They have also been associated with volcanic eruptions like the 1991 Mount Pinatubo eruption in the Philippines.\nConclusion\n\nWhy do clouds appear white?\n\nThe clouds usually appear white because\u00a0the tiny water droplets and ice crystals inside them are tightly packed, and they reflect most of the sunlight that falls on these masses (scattering).\nThe tiny cloud particles equally scatter all colors of light, which makes the viewer perceive all wavelengths of sunlight mixed as white light.\n\nWhy do clouds darken at the time of rain?\n\nThe clouds appear dark or grey at the time of rain due to their particulate density.\nThe water vapor will bind together into raindrops, leaving larger spaces between these drops of water, and hence less amount of light is reflected, lending a darker appearance to the rain clouds.\n\nRelated article:\u00a0Cloud seeding\n\nArticle by: Priyanka Sunil",

These preconditions are:\n\nPhysiographic homogeneity \u2013 surface should be either an oceanic surface or a plane on a continental surface.\nAtmospheric conditions must be stable for the origin of air masses. There should not be any major movement in the air. This is important for air to maintain contact with uniform surface area for a long duration of time.\nThe air should rest on the given surface for 2 to 3 days to absorb the properties of the given surface.\n\nSuch atmospheric conditions are found in very restricted areas on the globe where the air is sinking slowly and gradually over the uniform surface, such areas are:\n\nPolar and subpolar regions\u00a0 (due to the presence of polar high-pressure belts and related sinking of air)\nSubtropical high-pressure belts (due to subsidence of air from the upper troposphere to lower troposphere)\nSource regions:\n\nThe homogenous surfaces, over which air masses form, are called the source regions. The source region should be extensive with gentle, divergent air circulation. Areas with\u00a0high pressure but little pressure difference or pressure gradient are ideal source regions.\u00a0There are no major source regions in the mid-latitudes as these regions are dominated by cyclonic and other disturbances.\n\nThe main source regions are the high-pressure belts in the sub-tropics (giving rise to tropical air masses) and around the poles (giving rise to polar air masses).\nSource Region establishes heat and moisture equilibrium.\nWhen an air mass moves away from a source region, the upper level maintains the physical characteristics for a longer period. This is possible because they are stable with stagnant air which does not facilitate convection.\nMovement of air masses:\n\nOnce they are formed they start moving away from the source regions due to gravity.\n\n\ud83d\udc49 Which year are YOU targeting for success in the IAS/IPS/IFS Exam? \ud83d\ude80\n\n(1) \u21d2 UPSC 2025: Prelims cum Mains\n\n(2) \u21d2 UPSC 2026: Prelims cum Mains\n\n(3) \u21d2 UPSC 2027 Prelims cum Mains\n\nTip: Know more about ClearIAS Courses (Online/Offline)\n\nUsually, they follow the path provided by the permanent winds system prevailing in that area which are polar winds, westerly winds, and trade winds.\n\nTypes of air masses\n\nClassification of air masses is done based on a variety of parameters. In total there are 16 kinds and each has been denoted by a symbol for identification. However, for understanding fronts and cyclones further, only two types of classification are required.\n\nThey are classified based on the nature of the surface from which they originate. On this basis they are classified as:\n\nContinental \u2013 originating from the homogeneous continental surface\nMaritime \u2013 originating from homogeneous oceanic surface\n\nTherefore the classification is done based on their latitudinal position. On this basis both the above-mentioned they have been further classified into two kinds of each:\n\nContinental Air mass\n\n1. Continental tropical air mass\n\nThe source regions include tropical and subtropical deserts of the Sahara in Africa, West Asia, and Australia.\nThese are dry, hot, and stable and do not extend beyond the source.\n\n2. Continental polar air mass\n\nSource regions of these are the Arctic basin, northern North America, Eurasia, and Antarctica.\nThese are characterized by dry, cold, and stable conditions.\nThe weather during winter is frigid, clear, and stable.\nDuring summer, the weather is less stable with the lesser prevalence of anticyclonic winds, warmer land, and lesser snow.\nMaritime air mass\n\n1. Maritime tropical air mass\n\nThe source regions of these include the oceans in the tropics and sub-tropics such as Mexican Gulf, the Pacific, and the Atlantic oceans.\nThese are warm, humid, and unstable.\nThe weather during winter has mild temperatures, overcast skies with fog.\nDuring summer, the weather is characterized by high temperatures, high humidity, cumulous clouds, and convectional rainfall.\n\n2. Maritime polar air mass\n\nThe source region of these is the oceans between 40\u00b0 and 60\u00b0 latitudes.\nThese are those continental polar air masses that have moved over the warmer oceans, got heated up, and have collected moisture.\nThe conditions over the source regions are\u00a0cool, moist, and unstable. These are the regions that cannot lie stagnant for long.\nThe weather during winters is characterized by high humidity, overcast skies, and occasional fog and precipitation.\nDuring summer, the weather is clear, fair, and stable.\n\nThey are also denoted by symbols as follows:\n\nMaritime tropical (mT)\nContinental tropical (cT)\nMaritime polar (mP)\nContinental polar (cP)\nContinental arctic (cA)\nAffect on global climate:\nThese have a deep impact on their areas of influence. For example, the Western European type of climate is fully developed by subtropical Marine Air masses.\nThe origin of temperate cyclones is dependent on the convergence of two contrasting air mass that are continental polar and Maritime tropical air mass.\nThe monsoon which is the backbone of Indian agriculture is also an example of tropical Marine Air mass",

The frontal zone is inclined at a low angle to the Earth\u2019s surface.\nThey are characterized by common characteristics such as large differences in air temperature across the convergence zone and bending isobars.\nIt is also a zone of intensification of low pressure, cooling of rising hot and humid air, condensation, cloud formation, and precipitation\nThe process associated with the creation of a new front is called frontogenesis. The process of destruction dying or dissolution of the front is called frontolysis.\nIn the northern hemisphere, frontogenesis happens in an anti-clockwise direction, and in the southern hemisphere in the clockwise direction due to the Coriolis effect.\nMid-latitude cyclones temperate cyclones or extra-tropical cyclones also occur due to frontogenesis.\nNecessary conditions for frontogenesis\nThe presence of two opposing air masses having contrasting properties of air temperature, air pressure, density, and humidity is important.\nTwo opposing air masses must have contrasting temperatures that are one air mass should be called dry and heavier while the other should be hot humid and light.\nIn such conditions, the cold and denser air mass being heavier invades the area of the warm and light Air mass.\nThe two masses must move in a face-to-face direction or converge.\nWhen air masses diverge they move in opposite directions and frontogenesis does not form.\nTypes of Fronts\n\nBased on the nature of convergence, relative acceleration of air masses, and stages of front formation, four types are identified-\n\nStationary\nWarm\nCold\nOccluded\nStationary front:\nIn this type, two air masses having contrasting physical properties rest against each other without showing any major movement.\nWeather generally remains stable but sometimes it might rain.\nAtmospheric conditions are stable within the front however atmospheric conditions can suddenly change across the stationary front also.\nCyclones migrating along stationary frontogenesis can dump heavy amounts of precipitation, resulting in significant flooding along the front.\nWarm front:\nWhen a warm air mass collides against a cold air mass, it rises above the cold air mass which is relatively heavier and denser.\nThe warm front is a gently sloping frontal surface along which warm and light air becomes active and aggressive and rises slowly over cold and dense air. Due to this condensation takes place gradually.\nIt leads to nimbostratus, altostratus and cirrostratus cloud formation. These clouds produce moderate to gentle precipitation over a relatively large area for several hours.\nCold front:\nThis is formed when cold air mass initiates the movement and hits the warm air and makes it rise.\u00a0 Here, condensation takes place rapidly.\nIt is a sloping frontal surface along which cold air becomes active and aggressive in the warm air territory.\nSevere storms can occur and during the summer months, thunderstorms are common in the warm sector.\nIn some regions like the USA, tornadoes occur in the warm sectors.\nCumulonimbus clouds are formed and heavy rainfall with lightning and thundering takes place.\nSometimes cold frontal precipitation is also associated with snowfall and hail storms.\nOccluded front:\nWhen warm air mass is completely raised over the cold air mass it is called an occluded front.\nWeather along this sector is complex\u2014a mixture of cold front type and warm front type weather. These are common in western Europe.\nThe formation of Mid-latitude cyclones (temperate cyclones or extra-tropical cyclones) involves the formation of an occluded front.\nClimatic Significance\n\n\nWhen a front passes over an area, it causes a change in the weather. The phenomenon causes weather events such as rain, thunderstorms, gusty winds, and tornadoes. On a cold front, there may be dramatic thunderstorms. At a warm front, there may be low stratus clouds. Usually, the skies clear once the front has passed.\n\nInstead of causing clouds and storms, some frontogenesis just causes a temperature change but some front formations can start Earth\u2019s largest storms. Tropical waves are a front that develops in the tropical Atlantic Ocean off the coast of Africa. These can also develop into tropical storms or hurricanes if conditions allow.\n\nThey move across the Earth\u2019s surface over multiple days and the direction of movement is often guided by high winds, such as Jet Streams.\u00a0 Landforms like mountains can also change the path of convergence.\n\nOn weather maps, the cold front is illustrated by blue lines with sharp \u201cteeth\u201d pointing in the direction of the wind.

The flow is from high pressure to low pressure and it is at right angles to isobars. The velocity of wind is directly proportional to pressure gradient force.\nCoriolis force/deflection force: The force that deflects the direction of the wind is called deflection force. They are deflected to the right (concerning their source) in the northern hemisphere and the left in the southern hemisphere.\nFriction force generated by surface: It is a restraining force on the flow of the wind.

During the day the land heats up faster and becomes warmer than the sea.\nOver the land, the air rises giving rise to a low-pressure area, whereas the sea is relatively cool and the pressure overseas is relatively high. Thus, a pressure gradient from sea to land is created and the wind blows from the sea to the land as the sea breeze.\nIn the night the reversal of condition takes place. The land loses heat faster and is cooler than the sea. The pressure gradient is from the land to the sea and hence land breeze results.\nVALLEY AND MOUNTAIN BREEZE\nIn the mountains, during the day the slopes get heated up and air moves upwards and the air from the valley blows up the valley to fill the resulting gap. This wind is known as the valley breeze.\nDuring the night the slopes get cooled and the dense air descends into the valley as the mountain wind. The cool air from mountains draining into the valley is called\u00a0katabatic wind.\nAnother warm wind occurs on the leeward side of the mountain ranges. The moisture in it, while crossing the mountain ranges condenses and precipitates. When it descends the leeward side of the slope the dry air gets warmed up by the adiabatic process. This dry air may melt the snow in a short time.\nTertiary or local wind\n\nThese are the types of wind blowing in a particular locality. Local differences in temperature and pressure produce local winds. Such type of wind is local in extent and is confined to the lowest levels of the troposphere.\n\nSome examples are discussed below:\n\nName\n\t\nType\n\t\nPlace\n\n\nChinook (Snow eaters)\n\t\nHot, dry\n\t\nThe Rocky mountains\n\n\nFoehn\n\t\nHot, dry\n\t\nThe Alps\n\n\nKhamsin\n\t\nHot, dry\n\t\nEgypt\n\n\nSirocco\n\t\nHot, moist\n\t\nSahara to the Mediterranean Sea\n\n\nSolano\n\t\nHot, moist\n\t\nSahara to the Iberian Peninsula\n\n\nHarmattan (Guinea doctor)\n\t\nHot, dry\n\t\nWest Africa\n\n\nLoo\n\t\nHot and dry\n\t\nNorth India and Pakistan\n\n\nNorwester\n\t\nHot\n\t\nNew Zealand\n\n\nSanta Ana\n\t\nHot\n\t\nSouth California\n\n\nKaraburun (black storm)\n\t\nHot dusty\n\t\nCentral Asia\n\n\nBora\n\t\nCold, dry\n\t\nBlows from Hungary to North Italy\n\n\nMistral\n\t\nCold\n\t\nThe Alps and France\n\n\nPampero\n\t\nCold\n\t\nArgentina\n\n\nPunas\n\t\nCold dry\n\t\nThe western side of Andes Mountain\n\n\nBlizzard\n\t\nCold\n\t\nTundra region\n\n\nPurga\n\t\nCold\n\t\nRussia\n\n\nLevanter\n\t\nCold\n\t\nSpain\n\n\nCalima\n\t\nDust-laden dry\n\t\nSaharan Air Layer across the Canary Islands\n\n\nElephanta\n\t\nMoist (in monsoon)\n\t\nMalabar coast\n\nThe Wind system causes the evolution of various landforms on the earth\u2019s surface as it is the main geomorphic agent shaping various landforms.

Sometimes temperate cyclones are so extensive that they cover an area of about 10 lakh square kilometers.\n\nTemperate cyclones extend up to 10 km from sea level in the upper troposphere.\n\nMoisture present in hot humid and lighter air mass is the source of energy in temperate cyclones. This moisture later becomes a source of cooling condensation cloud formation and rainfall. Since the source of energy in temperate cyclones is moisture present in warm air mass they can occur and develop over both oceanic and continental surfaces.\n\nTemperate cyclones are cyclones of mid-latitudes and hence are primarily under the influence of permanent winds of mid-latitude that is the westerlies.\n\nThe movement is these cyclones are eastwards of the origin with an average velocity of 32 km per hour in summers and 48 km per hour in winters.\n\nThe formation of temperate cyclones is a quick process but passes through a series of successive stages:\n\nThe period of a cyclone from its inception (cyclogenesis) to its termination (frontolysis or occlusion) is called the life cycle of a cyclone. It is completed through 6 successive stages and is described by the polar front theory.\n\nStage 1: It involves the convergence of two masses of contrasting physical properties and directions.\n\nStage 2: It is also called an incipient stage during which the warm and cold air masses penetrate the territories of each other and a wave-like front is formed under the influence of Coriolis force.\n\nStage 3: It is the mature stage when the cyclone is fully developed and isobars become almost circular. The energy and intensity of the cyclone are greatest in this stage. Rainfall is generated by nimbostratus clouds along the warm front and cumulonimbus clouds generate high-intensity rainfall at cold fronts.\n\nStage 4: The warm sector of the cyclone is narrow due to the more advancement of the cold front full stop as a warm front declines energy reservoir of the cyclonic system starts declining.\n\nStage 5: It starts with the occlusion of the cyclone when the advancing cold front finally overtakes the warm front and an occluded front is formed. The intensity of rainfall and winds declines further.\n\nStage 6: In this warm sector completely disappears occluded front is eliminated cold air mass covers the surface and ultimately cyclone dies out.\n\nTemperate cyclones are relatively regular and predictable compared to tropical cyclones and a primarily observed in the winter seasons.\n\nWESTERN DISTURBANCES:\n\nWave cyclones originating over the Mediterranean sea and Caspian sea flow eastward under the influence of subtropical westerly jet stream. The cyclones enter into North-Western parts of India during the winter season to generate snowfall on the Himalayan mountain ranges of Jammu and Kashmir Himachal Pradesh and Uttarakhand. They also cause rainfall in the plains of Punjab Haryana Western Uttar Pradesh Delhi and northern Rajasthan and support Rabi crops.\n\n(2) Tropical cyclone\n\nTropical cyclones are formed between 5 degrees to 30 degrees in both the Northern and Southern hemispheres. These are not formed over or near the equator due to a lack of Coriolis force.\n\nThey are low-pressure atmospheric systems of low latitudes.\n\nCyclones developed in the regions lying between the tropics of Capricorn and cancer are called tropical cyclones which are not regular and uniform like extratropical or temperate cyclones.\n\nNumerous forms of cyclones vary considerably in shape size velocity and weather conditions.\n\nDifferent names of tropical cyclones in different regions of the world:\n\nSoutheast Asia- typhoons\nCaribbean sea- hurricane\nIndian Ocean- tropical cyclones\nNortheast coast of Australia- Willy Willy\nA tornado is the smallest and most deadly form of cyclone in the Mississippi valley of the USA. They are funnel-shaped storms that are small but the most violent and disastrous of all storms. The center of a tornado is characterized by extremely low pressure.\n\nBecause of such steep pressure gradient winds rush hour with great force towards the center having a high velocity of 600 to 800 km per hour. The approach of tornadoes is heralded by dark and thick clouds in the sky resulting in complete darkness and minimum visibility and low air pressure.\n\nConditions required for the origin of tropical cyclones:\n\nPresence of a warm Ocean surface with a temperature of 27 degrees Celsius or more. The warm surface is the source of thermal convection and strong hot and humid currents. It is because of this factor that tropical cyclones are characteristically developed over the east coast of continents under the influence of warm ocean currents.\nThe presence of ITCZ (Inter Tropical Convergence Zone) supports the intensification of low pressure and augments the supply of moisture due to the inflow of trade winds.\nCoriolis force helps in deflection of strong influence wind to generate circulatory system. In the absence of Coriolis force tropical cyclones do not originate near the equator.\nPresence of high moisture in the atmosphere as it becomes the source of latent heat of vaporization which is the basic source of energy for a tropical cyclone.\nMinimum vertical wind shear to support the unrestricted flow of air currents upwards.\nDivergence of air in the upper troposphere.\n\nTropical cyclones cover relatively smaller areas but are more destructive. On average their diameters range between 80-300 km but sometimes they become so small that the diameter is restricted to 50 km or less. But they are relatively taller and extend up to 15 km from sea level in the upper troposphere.\n\nThe basic source of energy is the latent heat of vaporization present in hot and humid thermal convective currents. This latent heat of vaporization later becomes a source of cooling condensation cloud formation and rainfall.\n\nNormally they move from east to west under the influence of trade winds hence the general direction is there for the West word from their origin.\n\nA fully developed tropical cyclone consists of:\n\nEye: the pressure is lowest in the eye. It is a zone of high temperature and high humidity. It is also a cloudless, windless, and rain-less zone.\nInner eyewall: It is the most destructive part of a tropical cyclone. It is characterized by strong winds and the greatest intensity of rainfall. Rainfall is generated through cumulonimbus clouds.\nOuter eyewall: It is the outermost part of a tropical cyclone. In this zone, wind velocity is relatively low and so is the intensity of rainfall.\n\nTropical cyclones become very vigorous with high velocity over the oceans but become weak while moving over land areas and ultimately die out after reaching the interior portion of the continents. That is why the cyclones affect only the coastal areas of the continents.\n\nAlso read: India Meteorological Department (IMD)\n\nAnticyclones\n\nAnticyclones are centers of high pressure. They are surrounded by closed isobars having decreasing pressure outward.\n\nThe circulation is from central high pressure towards the periphery in such a way that air blows outwards in a clockwise direction in the Northern hemisphere and anticlockwise direction in the southern hemisphere.\n\nDue to Coriolis force, blowing winds are deflected from their paths to the right in the Northern hemisphere and left in the Southern hemisphere, \u00a0that\u2019s how it gets circular with a flowing system.\n\nThe difference in pressure between the center and periphery of anticyclone ranges between 10 to 20 mb and sometimes higher.\n\nThere are much larger in size and area than temperate cyclones as the diameter is 75% larger than that of temperate cyclones. Temperate anticyclones are very extensive that a single anticyclone can cover nearly half of the USA.\n\nThe track is highly variable and unpredictable. They move very sluggishly and sometimes they become stationary over a particular place for 4 days. The average velocity of an anticyclone is 30 to 50 km per hour.\n\nAnticyclones originated due to the descent of either polar cold air mass or warm tropical air mass.\n\nThese anticyclones are high-pressure systems and are more common in subtropical high-pressure belts and polar high-pressure belts where the air is sinking from the upper troposphere to the lower troposphere but are practically absent in equatorial regions.\n\nThe formation of anticyclonic conditions at polar high-pressure belts is a thermal phenomenon as these bills a thermally direct whereas the formation of anticyclonic conditions at subtropical high-pressure belts is a dynamic phenomenon as these bills are thermally indirect.\n\nHence, anticyclones of polar high-pressure belts are termed thermal anticyclones, and anticyclones of subtropical high-pressure belts are termed dynamic anticyclones.\n\nTypes of anticyclones:\nCold anticyclones or thermal anticyclones: They are formed above the Polar Regions due to the sinking of air. Post subsidence of air outflows from the polar region in an easterly and southeasterly direction.\nWarm anticyclones or dynamic anticyclones: They are formed above warm subtropical regions due to the sinking of air from the upper troposphere to the lower troposphere and consequent divergence of air.\nBlocking anticyclones: These developed due to obstruction in the air circulation in the upper troposphere that develops over mid-latitudes and are called blocking because they obstruct the flow of temperate cyclones in mid-latitudes.\n\nAnticyclones tend to produce fairly uniform weather. Whence descends from above at the center and the weather becomes clear and rainless because the descending wind brings atmospheric stability. The weather of Canada USA and northern Eurasia is mostly affected by anticyclones.\n\nColour code for Cyclones by IMD\n\nGreen: The color green denotes that everything is smooth and in order, or that \u201ceverything is well\u201d with no bad weather.\n\nYellow: The yellow color code requests that the security personnel \u201cbe updated\u201d to deal with adverse weather that could linger for days and could have an impact on everyday activities.\n\nOrange: The color-coded alert meaning \u201cbe prepared\u201d is orange. It may serve as a warning of severe damage to communication breakdowns that could result in power outages, traffic and rail jams, and other problems. The orange notice also serves as a warning to evacuate and to prepare the essentials for families.\n\nRed: The color red represents the strongest level of warning and urges authorities to \u201ctake action.\u201d In this situation, the worst weather conditions pose a hazard to human life.

Read to know more.\n\nTable of Contents\n\nWhat is a jet stream?\nCharacteristics of Jet streams\nTypes of Jet streams\nSubtropical Westerly Jet stream\nPolar front Jet stream\nOther types\nClimatic Significance\nWhat is a jet stream?\n\nThe understanding of Jet streams is very important for understanding temperate cyclones and Indian monsoons.\n\nAccording to the World Meteorological Organisation (WMO), \u201ca strong narrow current concentrated along a quasi-horizontal axis in the upper troposphere or the stratosphere characterized by strong vertical and lateral wind shear and featuring one or more velocity maxima is called the jet stream.\u201d\n\nJet streams are strong, upper tropospheric flows that are quasi-horizontal. They originate due to differential heating of the earth\u2019s surface and form at the boundaries of adjacent air masses with significant temperature differences.\n\nThe factors that influence the flow of the jet stream are the landmasses and the Coriolis effect.\n\nLandmasses interrupt the flow of the jet through friction and temperature differences, whilst the spinning nature of the earth emphasizes these changes. This causes the meandering movement.\nThe meandering sections of the stream continue to change as they interact with landmasses creating a state of flux and subsequent temperature differences.\nIn winter, the temperature of the stratosphere can also affect the strength and position of the stream. The cooler the polar stratosphere, the stronger the jet stream.\nThe warmth of the landmasses and oceans (such as the El Nino Southern Oscillation) can also have an impact on the strength and amplitude of the stream.\nCharacteristics of Jet streams\nThe circulation of Jet streams is from west to east due to the effect of Earth\u2019s rotation. Generally, the circulation is observed between poles and 20 degrees latitude in both hemispheres.\nThese are also called circumpolar because they move around the poles in both hemispheres.\nTheir circulation path on the trajectory is wavy and meandering.\nThe extent narrows down during the summer season because of the northward shifting while these extend up to 20 degrees latitude during winters.\nThese may range from 40 km in width and 2-3 km in depth.\nThe average wind speed is very high with a lower limit of about 120 km per hour in winter and 50 km per hour in summer.\nThe maximum velocity of wind is recorded in the crest and trough of the jet stream.\nIn winter, it flows along the southern slopes of the Himalayas and shifts northwards in summer, flowing along the edge of the Himalayas (early June). And in late summers between July and August along the northern edge of the Tibetan Plateau.\nThe periodic movement of the Jet Stream often indicates the onset and subsequent withdrawal of the monsoon.\nThe northward movement of the subtropical stream is the first indication of the onset of the monsoon over India.\nTypes of Jet streams\n\nThe origin of the Jets is supported by three kinds of gradients:\n\n\ud83d\udc49 Which year are YOU targeting for success in the IAS/IPS/IFS Exam? \ud83d\ude80\n\n(1) \u21d2 UPSC 2025: Prelims cum Mains\n\n(2) \u21d2 UPSC 2026: Prelims cum Mains\n\n(3) \u21d2 UPSC 2027 Prelims cum Mains\n\nTip: Know more about ClearIAS Courses (Online/Offline)\n\nThe thermal gradient between the pole and equator\nThe pressure gradient between the pole and equator\nThe pressure gradient between surface and subsurface air over the poles.\n\nThe two major types are:\n\nThe subtropical jet stream\nThe mid-latitude or polar front jet stream\nSubtropical Westerly Jet stream\nThey move in the upper troposphere to the north of the subtropical high-pressure belt in both hemispheres that is above 30 degrees to 35 degrees latitude.\nTheir circulation from west to east and more regular than the polar front jet stream.\nIt flows through most of the year and is produced by the rotation of the earth.\nPolar front Jet stream\nThey are formed above the convergence zone (40 degrees and 60 degrees latitude) of the surface polar cold air mass and tropical warm air mass.\nThe thermal gradient is steep because of the convergence of two contrasting air masses.\nThese move in an easterly direction and have a more variable position than the subtropical jet.\nOther types\nThere is another type of upper-level jet called polar night jet which forms mainly during the winter months when the nights are much longer. It meanders through the upper stratosphere over the poles and is present in the convergence zone above the sub-polar low-pressure belt.\nA barrier jet in the low levels forms just upstream of mountain chains, with the mountains causing the jet to be oriented parallel to the mountains.\nCoastal low-level jets are related to a sharp contrast between high temperatures over land and lower temperatures over the sea and play an important role in coastal weather, giving rise to strong coast parallel winds. These are associated with oceanic high-pressure systems and thermal lows over land.\nA\u00a0valley exit jet is a strong, down-valley, elevated air current that flows above the intersection of the valley and its adjacent plain. They can achieve high speeds and heights.\nThe mid-level\u00a0African easterly jet occurs during the summer in the Northern Hemisphere between 10\u00b0N and 20\u00b0N above West Africa. While the nocturnal poleward low-level jet occurs in the Great Plains of East and South Africa.\nClimatic Significance\n\nThey have an immense influence on local and regional weather conditions.\n\nThere is a close relationship between the intensity of temperate cyclones and jet streams. Severe storms occur when Jet streams interfere with surface wind systems.\n\nThey also help in giving a relatively clear picture of the occurrence of the events of El Nino and La Nina\n\nThey are also used by aviators if they have to fly in the direction of the flow of the jet streams. But aviators avoid them when flying in the opposite direction of the jet streams because Jet streams are unpredictable and can cause sudden movement even when the weather looks calm and clear.\n\nThe monsoon of South Asia is largely affected and controlled by Jet streams.\n\nThe monsoons also depend on the upper air circulation which Sub Tropical Jet Streams dominate. The southwest monsoon in India is related to the tropical easterly stream which is between 8-35 degrees North latitudes. The northeast monsoon in the winters is related to the subtropical westerly Jet Stream which blows between 20-35 degree latitudes in both hemispheres.\n\nThey are also known to bring ozone-depleting substances to the stratosphere, aiding the ozone layer depletion by acting as a vehicle.\n\nAlso read:\u00a0Atmospheric River; Heat Index",

Precipitation occurs when a portion of the atmosphere becomes saturated with water vapor so that the water condenses and precipitates.\n\nThere are five forms of precipitation:\n\nRainfall: It is the fall of atmospheric moisture in the form of water due to gravity.\nSnow: Precipitation of white opaque crystals when cloud forms below zero degree Celcius.\nHail: It falls in the form of small ice pellets and is a very destructive form of precipitation produced by thunderstorms or cumulonimbus clouds.\nSleet: It is a mix of rain and snow or it is frozen rain that forms when rain passes through very cold air mass before reaching the land.\nDrizzle: Very small and uniform sized raindrops (less than 0.5 mm size)\nRainfall\n\nIt is the most common form of precipitation, especially in low latitudes. Monsoon or equatorial rains are good examples to understand.\n\nConditions for rain formation:\n\nWarm, moist, and unstable air\nSufficient number of hygroscopic nuclei\n\nThe warm and moist air after being lifted upward becomes saturated and clouds are formed but the process of condensation begins only when the relative humidity of ascending air exceeds a hundred percent.\nRainfall does not occur unless these cloud droplets become so large due to coalescence that the air becomes unable to hold them.\n\n\ud83d\udc49 Which year are YOU targeting for success in the IAS/IPS/IFS Exam? \ud83d\ude80\n\n(1) \u21d2 UPSC 2025: Prelims cum Mains\n\n(2) \u21d2 UPSC 2026: Prelims cum Mains\n\n(3) \u21d2 UPSC 2027 Prelims cum Mains\n\nTip: Know more about ClearIAS Courses (Online/Offline)\n\nTypes of rainfall\n\nGenerally, three different types of rainfall are recognized:\n\nConvectional or convective rainfall occurs due to thermal convection currents caused by insolation heating of the ground surface.\nOrographic rainfall occurs due to the accent of air from highland.\nCyclonic or frontal rainfall occurs due to upward movement of air caused by convergence of contrasting wind\nConvectional Rain:\n\nConvectional rain occurs mainly in equatorial regions where daily heating of the ground surface causes convection currents. The sky becomes overcast by afternoon daily causing pitch darkness and heavy rains to follow. Thus the convectional rainfall in the equatorial region is a daily regular feature.\n\nIn this type of rainfall, there is a thermal convective rise of hot and humid air. For the hot and humid air to rise two conditions are necessary:\n\nPresence of moisture through evaporation to the air so that relative humidity becomes high.\nIntense heating of ground surface through incoming short wave solar radiation insolation heating.\n\nThe ground surface is intensely heated due to the enormous amount of heat received. The air in contact with a warm surface also gets heated expands and ultimately rises upward. The ascending warm and moist air cools becomes saturated, causes condensation and cloud formation, and rainfall starts.\n\nIndia receives convectional rainfall during the summer season before the onset of Southwest monsoon these are known by local names in India like mango showers, Kal Baisakhi, bhardoli cheera, etc.\n\nOrographic rain:\n\nThe rain which is caused by the physiographic barrier for falling in the path of moisture-laden air is known as orographic rainfall. The moisture in the air is forced to rise which gets cooled adiabatically leading to condensation, cloud formation, and rain. This occurs on the windward side of the hill or by any other physiographic barrier like plateau or mountain.\n\nNecessary conditions for the occurrence of orographic rainfall are:\n\nThey should be mountain barriers across the wind direction so that the moist air is forced on obstruction to move upwards\nThere should be enough moisture content in the air and the presence of an onshore wind that is hot and humid\n\nFeatures of orographic rainfall:\n\nMore rainfall on the windward side and less on the leeward side\nMaximum rainfall near the mountain slopes decreases away from the foothills\nWindward slopes of mountains are at the time of rainfall are characterized by cumulus clouds and leeward side slopes have stratus clouds.\n\nAmount of rainfall depends on:\n\nAmount of moisture present in onshore winds\nDistance of mountain barrier from the coast\nAltitude and slope of the mountain\n\nOrographic rainfall is the most common in the world and India. Rainfall in India through Southwest monsoon and northeast monsoon is orographic.\n\nAlso read: Unseasonal Rains in India\n\nCyclonic or frontal rain:\n\nThis occurs due to the convergence of extensive air masses. When two contrasting air masses like cold polar air mass and warm westerly air mass coming from opposite directions converge along a line a front is formed. The warm wind is lifted upward along this front where the cold air being heavier settles down.\n\nSuch cyclonic fronts are created in temperate regions where cold polar winds and warm westerlies converge. The warm air lying over cold air is cooled and gets saturated and condensation begins around hygroscopic nuclei.\n\nThe lifting of warm air along the cyclonic front is not vertical like convective currents rather it is along an inclined plane.\n\nThe front is a zone of intensification of low pressure, cooling condensation, cloud formation, and rainfall- the entire process is known as frontogenesis.\n\nFrontal rainfall is most common in mid-latitudes as it is a zone of convergence of warm westerlies and cold polar easterlies. Frontogenesis is also the basis of the formation of temperate cyclones. Temperate cyclones also produce frontal rainfall in India during the winter season in North-Western parts of India which are known as western disturbances.",

Thus the classification was:\n\nUrvara [fertile]\nUsara [sterile]\n\nIn the modern period, when men started to know about the various characteristics of soil they began to classify soil based on texture, color, moisture, etc.\n\nWhen the Soil Survey of India was established in 1956,\u00a0they studied the soils of India and their characteristics.\nThe National Bureau of Soil Survey and Land Use Planning, an institute under the control of the Indian Council of Agriculture Research did a lot of studies on Indian soil.\nClassification of Soils of India\n\nAlluvial soil [43%]\nRed soil [18.5%]\nBlack/regur soil [15%]\nArid / desert soil\nLaterite soil\nSaline soil\nPeaty / marshy soil\nForest soil\nSub-mountain soil\nSnowfields\nAlluvial soil:\nMostly available soil in India (about 43%) covers an area of 143 sq. km.\nWidespread in northern plains and river valleys.\nIn peninsular India, they are primarily found in deltas and estuaries.\nHumus, lime, and organic matter are present.\nHighly fertile.\nIndus-Ganga-Brahmaputhra plain, Narmada-Tapi plain etc are examples.\nThey are depositional soil \u2013 transported and deposited by rivers, streams, etc.\nSand content decreases from west to east of the country.\nNew alluvium is termed as Khadar and old alluvium is termed as Bhangar.\nColor: Light Grey to Ash Grey.\nTexture: Sandy to silty loam or clay.\nRich in: potash\nPoor in: phosphorous.\nWheat, rice, maize, sugarcane, pulses, oilseed, etc. are cultivated mainly.\nRed soil:\nSeen mainly in low-rainfall areas.\nAlso known as Omnibus group.\nPorous, friable structure.\nAbsence of lime, kankar (impure calcium carbonate).\nDeficient in: lime, phosphate, manganese, nitrogen, humus, and potash.\nColor: Red because of Ferric oxide. The lower layer is reddish-yellow or yellow.\nTexture: Sandy to clay and loamy.\nWheat, cotton, pulses, tobacco, oilseeds, potatoes, etc. are cultivated.\nBlack soil / regur soil:\nRegur means cotton \u2013 the best soil for cotton cultivation.\nMost of the Deccan is occupied by Black soil.\nMature soil.\nHigh water retaining capacity.\nSwells and will become sticky when wet and shrink when dried.\nSelf-plowing is a characteristic of black soil as it develops wide cracks when dried.\nRich in: Iron, lime, calcium, potassium, aluminum, and magnesium.\nDeficient in: Nitrogen, phosphorus, and organic matter.\nColor: Deep black to light black.\nTexture: Clayey.\nLaterite soil:\nName from the Latin word \u2018Later\u2019 which means Brick.\nIt becomes so soft when wet and so hard when dried.\nIn the areas of high temperature and high rainfall.\nFormed as a result of high leaching.\nLime and silica will be leached away from the soil.\nOrganic matter in the soil will be removed fast by the bacteria as it is high temperature and humus will be taken quickly by the trees and other plants. Thus, humus content is low.\nRich in: Iron and Aluminum\nDeficient in: Nitrogen, Potash, Potassium, Lime, Humus\nColor: Red color due to iron oxide.\nRice, Ragi, Sugarcane, and Cashew nuts are cultivated mainly.\nDesert / arid soil:\nSeen under Arid and Semi-Arid conditions.\nDeposited mainly by wind activities.\nHigh salt content.\nLack of moisture and Humus.\nKankar or Impure Calcium carbonate content is high which restricts the infiltration of water.\nNitrogen is insufficient and Phosphate is normal.\nTexture: Sandy\nColor: Red to Brown.\nPeaty / marshy soil:\nAreas of heavy rainfall and high humidity.\nThe growth of vegetation is very low.\nA large quantity of dead organic matter/humus which makes the soil alkaline.\nHeavy soil with black color.\nPeaty and marshy soils are found in areas with high water tables, such as the Kerala backwaters and parts of northeastern India. They have high organic content but can be acidic.\nThese soils can support wetland agriculture and are suitable for rice and aquatic crops.\nForest soil:\nForest and hill soils are found in densely forested regions and higher altitudes. They are typically acidic and often have a shallow topsoil layer.\nThese soils are essential for maintaining forest ecosystems but are not suitable for intensive agriculture.\nMountain soil:\nImmature soil with low humus and acidic.\nMountain soils are found in hilly and mountainous regions, including the Himalayas. They are highly weathered and can vary in composition depending on local conditions.\nThese soils are suitable for horticulture, tea, and temperate crops like apples and potatoes.\nSaline and Alkaline Soils:\nSaline and alkaline soils are found in coastal areas and arid regions. They have high levels of salts and alkalis, making them unsuitable for most crops.\nThese soils can be reclaimed for agriculture through drainage and soil amendments.\n\nPS: Also refer to the article \u2018Different soil types in India: Understand the differences\u2018 for a comparative study.

    "[CONTENT] #84": "Even though our country is blessed with wide varieties of soils with high fertility, it is being degraded day by day by various natural and human activities. Farmers in India are complaining about low productivity because of various reasons and soil degradation is one of them.\n\nLoss of soil fertility results in low productivity. It also results in high cost-of-production, low income, food scarcity, loss of biodiversity etc. As food security is a major concern, India has to overcome the challenge of low productivity due to soil degradation. Conservation of soil is the only way to override this problem.\n\nTable of Contents\n\nMajor causes of soil degradation\nSoil erosion:\nConsequences of soil erosion\nDecline of soil fertility\nWater logging\nSalinity\nShifting / jhum cultivation\nSoil conservation methods\nModel question based on soil conservation for UPSC Prelims\nMajor causes of soil degradation\nSoil erosion\nDecline of soil fertility\nWater logging\nSalinity\nShifting cultivation\nSoil erosion:\nAmong the agents, water is considered as the main cause of soil erosion.\nMain agents of soil erosion are\u00a0(1)\u00a0Water, (2)\u00a0Wind, (3)\u00a0Waves and (4)\u00a0Glaciers\nRemoval of the top layer of soil by various means, which include both natural events and human activities, is called as soil erosion.\nWater-caused soil erosion can be classified as below:\nSheet Erosion: Uniform removal of the top soil just like a sheet.\nRill Erosion: Heavy water flow cause rill in Land.\nGully Erosion: Rill will enlarge as Gullies and land will be disordered. ( eg: Chambal Valley)\nNote: Wind erosion also causes sheet and rill erosions.\nNote: The largest area affected by soil erosion in India is the State of Rajasthan followed Madhya Pradesh.\nCONSEQUENCES OF SOIL EROSION\n\nFertility of top soil will be lost.\nNutrients content will decline as they are washed away by erosion.\nUnderground water level will be reduced.\nLoss of vegetation and habitat.\nDrought and flood become frequent.\nRivers get dried off.\nAdversely affect the economy and culture.\nNatural hideouts are formed when gully erosion occurs (Ex: Chambal valley was famous for criminal\u2019s hideout).\nDecline of soil fertility\nSoil fertility is mostly affected in the states of Punjab, Haryana, and U.P.\nIt is a condition when the soil is not giving enough production even though adequate irrigation and nutrients are supplied.\nThe major reasons for decline of soil fertility are:\nFrequent cropping\nUnscientific rotation of crops\nExtensive and excessive use of chemical fertilizers\nToo much use of chemical pesticides\nLand should left uncultivated for a period of time and let to retain its fertility. Cropping after cropping will leave the land unfertile.\nLeguminous plants can be cultivated in intervals which will increase the fertility of the soil.\nWater logging\nIf there is no proper drainage system in the land, the land will become waterlogged.\nThis results in the saturation of crops.\nThe normal circulation of air will not be possible due to water logging and the amount of oxygen in the soil will decline.\nConstruction of proper drainage system to allow water flow away from the land is the best way to reduce water logging.\nSalinity\nSoil will become saline or alkaline in low rainfall areas. Rajasthan is an example.\nWhen the sea water enters the land, the soil becomes saline.\nThe presence of calcium carbonate beneath (kankar) the soil will act as impermeable to water and water gets logged as happened in Indira Gandhi canal regions of Rajasthan. If the soil contains salt content, it will spread to the whole land due to this.\nShifting / jhum cultivation\nIt is a type of cultivation practiced mainly in North-Eastern states of India\nIt is a type of slash and burn method of cultivation.\nAfter reaping the crops, the land (usually the forest) is slashed and burned. The next cultivation will be in another plot and the burned land will let uncultivated for a period.\nIn the early periods, the gap between two cultivations in a land was 10-20 years.\nDue to population increase and availability of land is reduced, the gap decreased to merely 2-3 years.\nThis causes major deforestation, environmental pollution, loss of habitat for wild animals etc.\nThe burning of forest results in soil erosion and gradual degradation of soil.\nSoil conservation methods\nAfforestation.\nContour ploughing (cultivation against the direction of the wind).\nStrip cultivation (cultivation in strips).\nFlood control by government initiatives.\nReclamation of bad lands.\nWind breaks in land; like trees at borders.\nOrganic farming.\nControl/restrict shifting cultivation.\nConstruction of proper drainage.\nLeveling of gullies, ravines etc.\nControl of chemical fertilizers and pesticides in the market.\nProper awareness about the need of conservation.\nModel question based on soil conservation for UPSC Prelims\n\nQn 1: Among the statements given below, identify the correct statement(s):\n\nOrganic farming has a role to play in soil conservation.\nSheet erosion results in the formation of gullies resulting in loss of underground soil.\nThe largest area affected by soil erosion in India is the State of Rajasthan followed Madhya Pradesh.\n\nChoices:\n\na) 1 only\nb) 2 only\nc) 1 and 3 only\nd) 1, 2 and 3\n\nRight Answer:\u00a0c) 1 and 3 only\n\nExplanation: In case of sheet erosion, there will be a uniform removal of the top soil just like a sheet.\n\n\ud83d\udc49 Which year are YOU targeting for success in the IAS/IPS/IFS Exam? \ud83d\ude80\n\n(1) \u21d2 UPSC 2025: Prelims cum Mains\n\n(2) \u21d2 UPSC 2026: Prelims cum Mains\n\n(3) \u21d2 UPSC 2027 Prelims cum Mains\n\nTip: Know more about ClearIAS Courses (Online/Offline)\n\nArticle Contributed by: Jijo Sudarsan",

Studies are indicating that UHI is increasing with more people being part of such areas. What are Urban heat islands? How is it affecting the global climate? Read here to find out.\n\nSurface temperatures play a critical role in how hot the surrounding area gets and also present a health risk during extreme heat events.\n\nDuring heat waves, a substantial amount of the sun\u2019s energy is absorbed and reflected by surfaces exposed to its rays, leading to their temperatures increasing significantly.\n\nThe process of urban development greatly changes the landscape. Natural and permeable surfaces are replaced by impermeable structures like buildings and roads. This creates what climatologists refer to as \u201curban heat islands\u201d, areas within cities that experience significantly higher temperatures compared to nearby rural regions.\n\nTable of Contents\n\nUrban Heat Islands\nCauses for the formation of heat islands\nImpacts of urban heat islands\nRemedies\nWay forward\nUPSC Civil Services Mains Question\nUrban Heat Islands\n\nUrban heat islands (UHIs) are localized areas within urban environments that experience significantly higher temperatures compared to their surrounding rural areas.\n\nUHIs occur due to human activities, modifications to the landscape, and the concentration of heat-absorbing materials in urban settings. They are a result of the urbanization process and can have various impacts on the environment, public health, and energy consumption.\n\n\ud83d\udc49 Which year are YOU targeting for success in the IAS/IPS/IFS Exam? \ud83d\ude80\n\n(1) \u21d2 UPSC 2025: Prelims cum Mains\n\n(2) \u21d2 UPSC 2026: Prelims cum Mains\n\n(3) \u21d2 UPSC 2027 Prelims cum Mains\n\nTip: Know more about ClearIAS Courses (Online/Offline)\n\nThe phenomenon, \u2018Urban Heat Island\u2019 was first investigated and described by Luke Howard in the 1810s.\n\nCauses for the formation of heat islands\n\nHeat islands form in urban and suburban areas because many common construction materials absorb and retain more of the sun\u2019s heat than natural materials in less developed rural areas.\n\nTemperatures of dark, dry surfaces in direct sun can reach 88\u00b0C during the day, while vegetated surfaces with moist soil under the same conditions might reach only 18\u00b0C.\nConcrete, cement, and metal surfaces in urban areas tend to absorb heat energy rather than reflect it, contributing to higher urban temperatures.\nCities have a low albedo, the reflecting power of a surface. The increased surface area of buildings results in more solar radiation absorption than reflection.\n\nHeat Absorbing Materials: Urban areas are characterized by extensive use of heat-absorbing materials such as asphalt, concrete, and dark-colored buildings. These materials absorb and retain solar radiation, leading to elevated temperatures.\n\nReduced Vegetation: Urbanization often involves the removal of natural vegetation, such as trees and green spaces, which act as cooling agents through evapotranspiration and shading.\n\nHuman Activities: Heat generated by human activities, including industrial processes, vehicular traffic, and energy consumption, contributes to the overall temperature increase in urban areas.\n\nArtificial Heat Sources: The presence of heat sources like air conditioners, industrial processes, and waste heat from buildings and vehicles further exacerbates this.\n\nModified Wind Patterns: Urban landscapes can alter local wind patterns, reducing natural ventilation and trapping warm air within the city.\n\nUrban Form: The density, layout, and design of urban areas can impact the intensity and extent of UHIs. High-rise buildings, narrow streets, and compact urban layouts can intensify heat retention.\n\nRead: Insolation and heat balance of earth\n\nImpacts of urban heat islands\nUHIs lead to higher demand for cooling in buildings, increasing energy consumption, and associated greenhouse gas emissions.\nElevated temperatures in urban areas can cause heat-related illnesses and exacerbate existing health conditions, particularly in vulnerable populations.\nUHIs can contribute to poor air quality, as higher temperatures can enhance the formation of ground-level ozone and other air pollutants.\nUHIs affect the water balance in urban areas, leading to increased runoff and reduced infiltration, affecting stormwater management.\nUHIs can disrupt local ecosystems, impacting flora and fauna and altering natural habitats.\nRemedies\nUrban Planning: Incorporating green spaces, parks, and trees into urban planning can help mitigate UHIs by providing shading and promoting natural cooling.\nCool Roofs and Pavements: Implementing cool roofs and pavements, which reflect sunlight rather than absorb it, can reduce heat absorption in urban areas.\nGreen Roof and Walls: Installing green roofs and walls can help reduce surface temperatures and improve air quality.\nEnergy-Efficient Buildings: Promoting energy-efficient building designs and cool building materials can reduce heat emissions from structures.\nTransportation Planning: Encouraging public transportation, biking, and walking can help reduce vehicular heat emissions.\n\nBy implementing these strategies, cities can effectively mitigate urban heat islands and create more comfortable and sustainable living environments for their residents.\n\nWay forward\n\nCooler, shaded spaces in our parks, near buildings, in streetscapes, and alongside homes can reduce heat stress, particularly for those in our community who are most vulnerable to high temperatures.\n\nNote: Cities in desert environments show a different trend known as the \u201curban oasis effect\u201d. This effect is characterized by a cooler city center compared to the surrounding environments\n\nRead: India Cooling Action Plan\n\nUPSC Civil Services Mains Question\nBring out the causes for the formation of heat islands in the urban habitat of the world.

These factors include physical, economic, social, and historical considerations.\n\nPrimary Sector Industries\nNatural Resources: Industries involved in extracting raw materials, such as agriculture, mining, and forestry, tend to be located near the sources of natural resources.\nFor example, agricultural activities are usually situated in regions with fertile soil and favorable climatic conditions.\nSecondary Sector Industries\nRaw Material Availability: Industries like manufacturing and construction rely on the proximity to raw materials. Regions with easy access to raw materials, such as iron ore for steel production, tend to attract these industries.\nTransportation: Proximity to transportation networks, including roads, railways, and ports, is crucial for the movement of raw materials and finished products. Industries often locate near transportation hubs to minimize costs.\nLabor Availability: Labor-intensive industries are often located where there is a skilled or low-cost labor force. Textile and garment industries, for instance, may be located in regions with a large workforce.\nEnergy Availability: Industries requiring a significant amount of energy, like heavy manufacturing, may be located near energy sources such as coal, hydroelectric power, or oil and gas.\nMarket Proximity: Industries that produce consumer goods may locate close to major markets to reduce transportation costs and reach consumers efficiently.\nGovernment Policies: Incentives and regulations set by governments can influence industry location. Tax breaks, subsidies, and other policies can attract industries to specific regions.\nTertiary Sector Industries\nMarket Demand: Service industries, such as retail, hospitality, and healthcare, are often located in areas with high population densities and strong consumer demand.\nAccess to Customers: Proximity to potential customers is important for many service industries. Businesses like banks and restaurants are often located in commercial and urban centers.\nTransportation and Accessibility: Service industries need good transportation links to serve customers effectively. Airports, highways, and public transportation play a role in location decisions.\nInfrastructure: The availability of modern infrastructure, including communication networks, is important for service industries that rely on information and technology.\nEconomic Base: Tertiary sector industries are often concentrated in urban areas with diverse economic activities and a larger consumer base.\n\nIndustrial locations are complex. These are influenced by the availability of many factors. Some of them are raw materials, land, water, labor, capital, power, transport, and market.\n\n\ud83d\udc49 Which year are YOU targeting for success in the IAS/IPS/IFS Exam? \ud83d\ude80\n\n(1) \u21d2 UPSC 2025: Prelims cum Mains\n\n(2) \u21d2 UPSC 2026: Prelims cum Mains\n\n(3) \u21d2 UPSC 2027 Prelims cum Mains\n\nTip: Know more about ClearIAS Courses (Online/Offline)\n\nFor ease of convenience, we can classify the location factors into two: geographical factors and non-geographical factors.\n\nGeographical Factors\n\n\u00a0\n\nRaw material: Availability of natural resources that can be used as raw material.\nTechnology: To turn the resource into an asset with value.\nPower: To utilize the technology.\nLabor: Human resources in the area who can function as labor to run the processes.\nTransport: Road/rail connectivity.\nStorage and warehousing.\nMarketing feasibility.\nCharacteristics of land and soil.\nClimate.\nPrecipitation and water resources.\nVulnerability to natural resources.\n\nExplanation:\n\nRaw materials are one of the important factors in an industrial location. The mere location of industries itself may be determined by the availability or location of the raw materials.\nPower \u2013 conventional (coal, mineral oil, or hydroelectricity) or- conventional is a necessity for any industrial establishment.\nThe availability of labor or a skilled workforce is the success mantra for the growth of all industries.\nThe availability of easy transportation always influences the location of the industry. So the junction points of waterways, roadways, and railways become humming centers of industrial activity.\nThe finished goods should reach the market at the end of the process of manufacturing. Thus nearness to the market is an add-on quality in the process of selecting a location for industry.\nThe availability of water is another factor that influences the industrial location. Many industries are established near rivers, canals, and lakes, because of this reason. Iron and steel industries, textile industries, and chemical industries require large quantities of water, for their proper functioning.\nThe site that is selected for the establishment of an industry must be flat and well-served by adequate transport facilities.\nThe climate of the area selected for the industry is important, very harsh climates are not suitable for successful industrial growth.\nNon-geographical Factors\nCapital investment.\nAvailability of loans.\nInvestment climate.\nGovernment policies/regulations.\nInfluence of pressure groups.\n\nExplanation:\n\nCapital or huge investment is needed for the establishment of industries.\nGovernment policies are another factor that influences industrial location. The government sets certain restrictions in the allocation of land for industries to reduce regional disparities, control excessive pollution, and avoid the excessive clustering of industries in big cities.\nIndustrial inertia is the predisposition of industries or companies to avoid relocating facilities even in the face of changing economic circumstances that would otherwise induce them to leave. Often the costs associated with relocating fixed capital assets and labor far outweigh the costs of adapting to the changing conditions of an existing location.\nEfficient and enterprising organization and management are essential for running the modem industry successfully.\nThe location that has better banking facilities and Insurance are best suited for the establishment of industries.\n\nIt is rarely possible to find all these factors available in one place. Consequently, manufacturing activity tends to be located at the most appropriate place where all the factors of industrial location are either available or can be arranged at a lower cost.\n\nIn general, it should also be noted that both lower production cost and lower distribution cost are the two major factors when considering the location of an industry. Sometimes, the government provides incentives like subsidized power, lower transport costs, and other infrastructure so that industries may be located in backward areas.\n\nIndustrial System\n\nAn industrial system consists of inputs, processes, and outputs. The inputs are the raw materials, labor, and costs of land, transport, power, and other infrastructure.\n\nThe processes include a wide range of activities that convert the raw material into finished products. The outputs are the end product and the income earned from it. In the case of the textile industry, the inputs may be cotton, human labor, factory, and transport costs.\n\nThe processes include ginning, spinning, weaving, dyeing, and printing. The output is the shirt you wear.\n\nIndustrialization and Urbanization\n\nAfter an industrial activity starts, urbanization follows. Sometimes, industries are located in or near the cities. Thus, industrialization and urbanization go hand in hand. Cities provide markets and also provide services such as banking, insurance, transport, labor, consultants financial advice, etc. to the industry.\n\nAgglomeration Economies\n\nMany industries tend to come together to make use of the advantages offered by the urban centers known as agglomeration economies. Gradually, a large industrial agglomeration takes place.\n\nFactors Responsible for the Location of Primary Secondary and Tertiary Sector Industries in India\n\nIn the pre-independence period, most manufacturing units were located in places from the point of view of overseas trade such as Mumbai, Kolkata, Chennai, etc.\n\nConsequently, there emerged certain pockets of industrially developed urban centers surrounded by a huge agricultural rural hinterland.\n\nIndia\u2019s primary sector industries, like agriculture, are influenced by factors such as climate, soil fertility, and water availability.\nSecondary industries often located near raw material sources, such as steel plants near iron ore deposits.\nTertiary sector industries are often found in urban areas with a dense population and consumer demand, such as cities with IT hubs.\n\nA combination of factors unique to each sector and region shapes the location of industries around the world, contributing to regional economic development and specialization.\n\nRelated posts\nIndustrial Regions of India\nDistribution of Major Industries: Location Factors",

The inputs for the industry include raw materials such as iron ore, coal, and limestone, along with labor, capital, site, and other infrastructure. The process of converting iron ore into steel involves many stages. The raw material is put in the blast furnace where it undergoes smelting. It is then refined. The output obtained is steel which may be used by other industries as raw material.\n\nThe Indian iron and steel industry consists of large integrated steel plants as well as mini steel mills. It also includes secondary producers, rolling mills, and ancillary industries.\n\nChanges in locations: Before 1800 A.D. iron and steel industry was located where raw materials, power supply and running water were easily available. Later the ideal location for the industry was near coal fields and close to canals and railways. After 1950, iron and steel industry began to be located on large areas of flat land near sea ports. This is because by this time steel works had become very large and iron ore had to be imported from overseas.\n\nLocations in India: In India, iron and steel industry has developed taking advantage of raw materials, cheap labour, transport and market. All the important steel producing centres such as Bhilai, Durgapur, Burnpur, Jamshedpur, Rourkela, Bokaro are situated in a region that spreads over four states \u2014 West Bengal, Jharkhand, Odisha and Chhattisgarh. Bhadravati and Vijay Nagar in Karnataka, Vishakhapatnam in Andhra Pradesh, Salem in Tamil Nadu are other important steel centres utilising local resources. India\u2019s steel production increased from one million tonne in 1947 to 30 million tonnes in 2002.\n\nWhy Jamshedpur?\u00a0Before 1947, there was only one iron and steel plant in the country \u2013 Tata Iron and Steel Company Limited (TISCO). It was privately owned. After Independence, the government took the initiative and set up several iron and steel plants. TISCO was started in 1907 at Sakchi, near the confluence of the rivers Subarnarekha and Kharkai in Jharkhand. Later on Sakchi was renamed as Jamshedpur. Geographically, Jamshedpur is the most conveniently situated iron and steel centre in the country.\n\nSakchi was chosen to set up the steel plant for several reasons. This place was only 32 km away from Kalimati station on the Bengal-Nagpur railway line. It was close to the iron ore, coal and manganese deposits as well as to Kolkata, which provided a large market. TISCO gets coal from Jharia coalfields, and iron ore, limestone, dolomite and manganese from Odisha and Chhattisgarh. The Kharkai and Subarnarekha rivers ensured sufficient water supply. Government initiatives provided adequate capital for its later development.\n\nThe development of the iron and steel industry opened the doors to rapid industrial development in India. Almost all sectors of the Indian industry depend heavily on the iron and steel industry for their basic infrastructure.\n\nWhy Pittsburgh?\u00a0It is an important steel city of the United States of America. The steel industry at Pittsburgh enjoys locational advantages. Some of the raw material such as coal is available locally, while the iron ore comes from the iron mines at Minnesota, about 1500 km from Pittsburgh. Between these mines and Pittsburgh is one of the world\u2019s best routes for shipping ore cheaply \u2013 the famous Great Lakes waterway. Trains carry the ore from the Great Lakes to the Pittsburgh area. The Ohio, the Monogahela and Allegheny rivers provide adequate water supply.\n\nToday, very few of the large steel mills are in Pittsburgh itself. They are located in the valleys of the Monogahela and Allegheny rivers above Pittsburgh and along the Ohio River below it. Finished steel is transported to the market by both land and water routes. The Pittsburgh area has many factories other than steel mills. These use steel as their raw material to make many different products such as railroad equipment, heavy machinery and rails.\n\nCotton Textile Industry\n\nWeaving cloth from yarn is an ancient art. Cotton, wool, silk, jute, flax have been used for making cloth. The textile industry can be divided on the basis of raw materials used in them. Fibres are the raw material of textile industry. Fibres can be natural or man-made. Natural fibres are obtained from wool, silk, cotton, linen and jute. Man-made fibres include nylon, polyester, acrylic and rayon. The cotton textile industry is one of the oldest industries in the world. Till the Industrial Revolution in the 18th century, cotton cloth was made using hand spinning techniques (wheels) and looms. In 18th century power looms facilitated the development of cotton textile industry, first in Britain and later in other parts of the world. Today India, China, Japan and the USA are important producers of cotton textiles.\n\nIndia has a glorious tradition of producing excellent quality cotton textiles. Before the British rule, Indian hand spun and hand woven cloth already had a wide market. The Muslins of Dhaka, Chintzes of Masulipatnam, Calicos of Calicut and Gold-wrought cotton of Burhanpur, Surat and Vadodara were known worldwide for their quality and design. But the production of hand woven cotton textile was expensive and time consuming. Hence, traditional cotton textile industry could not face the competition from the new textile mills of the West, which produced cheap and good quality fabrics through mechanized industrial units.\n\nWhy Mumbai? The first successful mechanized textile mill was established in Mumbai in 1854. The warm, moist climate, a port for importing machinery, availability of raw material and skilled labour resulted in rapid expansion of the industry in the region. Initially this industry flourished in the states of Maharashtra and Gujarat because of favourable humid climate. But today, humidity can be created artificially, and raw cotton is a pure and not weight losing raw material, so this industry has spread to other parts of India. Coimbatore, Kanpur, Chennai, Ahmedabad, Mumbai, Kolkata, Ludhiana, Puducherry and Panipat are some of the other important centres.\n\n\u00a0Why\u00a0Ahmedabad?\u00a0It is located in Gujarat on the banks of the Sabarmati river. The first mill was established in 1859. It soon became the second largest textile city of India, after Mumbai. Ahmedabad was therefore often referred to as the \u2018Manchester of India\u2019. Favourable locational factors were responsible for the development of the textile industry in Ahmedabad. Ahmedabad is situated very close to cotton growing area. This ensures easy availability of raw material. The climate is ideal for spinning and weaving. The flat terrain and easy availability of land is suitable for the establishment of the mills. The densely populated states of Gujarat and Maharashtra provide both skilled and semi-skilled labour. Well-developed road and railway network permits easy transportation of textiles to different parts of the country, thus providing easy access to the market. Mumbai port nearby facilitates import of machinery and export of cotton textiles.\n\nBut in the recent years, Ahmedabad textile mills have been having some problems. Several textile mills have closed down. This is primarily due to the emergence of new textile centres in the country as well as non- upgradation of machines and technology in the mills of Ahmedabad. \u00a0\n\nWhy Osaka?\u00a0It is an important textile centre of Japan, also known as the \u2018Manchester of Japan\u2019. The textile industry developed in Osaka due to several geographical factors. The extensive plain around Osaka ensured that land was easily available for the growth of cotton mills. Warm humid climate is well suited to spinning and weaving. The river Yodo provides sufficient water for the mills. Labour is easily available. Location of port facilitates import of raw cotton and for exporting textiles. The textile industry at Osaka depends completely upon imported raw materials. Cotton is imported from Egypt, India, China and USA. The finished product is mostly exported and has a good market due to good quality and low price. Though it is one of the important textile cities in the country, of late, the cotton textile industry of Osaka has been replaced by other industries, such as iron and steel, machinery, shipbuilding, automobiles, electrical equipment and cement.\n\nInformation Technology (IT)\n\nThe information technology industry deals in the storage, processing and distribution of information. Today, this industry has become global. This is due to a series of technological, political, and socio-economic events. The main factors guiding the location of these industries are resource availability, cost and infrastructure. The major hubs of the IT industry are the Silicon Valley, California and Bangalore, India.\n\nWhy Silicon Valley? Silicon Valley is a part of Santa Clara Valley, located next to the Rocky Mountains of North America. The area has temperate climate with the temperatures rarely dropping below 0 degrees centigrade.\n\nWhy Bangalore? Bangalore is located on the Deccan Plateau from where it gets the name \u2018Silicon Plateau\u2019. The city is known for its mild climate throughout the year. There are other emerging information technology hubs in metropolitan centres of India such as Mumbai, New Delhi, Hyderabad and Chennai. Other cities such as Gurgaon, Pune, Thiruvanthapuram, Kochi and Chandigarh are also important centres of the IT industry. However, Bangalore has always had a unique advantage, as a city with highest availability of middle and top management talent.\n\nUPSC Civil Services Main Exam questions related to this topic\nDo you agree that there is a growing trend of opening new sugar mills in the Southern states of India?

Read here to learn more about Indian agriculture.\n\nIndia has one of the largest plain areas in the world Indo-Gangetic Plain which is immensely fertile.\n\nIndia has a variety of climatic conditions and soil types.\n\nThese physical variations along with factors like availability of irrigation, use of machinery, and modern agricultural inputs like High Yielding Varieties (HYV) of seeds, insecticides, and pesticides have played important roles in the evolution of different farming practices in the Indian agriculture sector.\n\nTable of Contents\n\nTypes of farming in India\ni) Subsistence farming:\nii) Intensive and Extensive farming\niii) Commercial farming\niv) Plantation Farming\nv) Mixed Farming\nFeatures of Indian Agriculture\nChallenges for Indian Agriculture\nIndian Agriculture: Important Facts\nTypes of farming in India\n\nSome of the major types of farming are discussed below.\n\ni) Subsistence farming:\n\nThe majority of farmers in India practice subsistence farming- farming for their consumption. The entire production is largely consumed by the farmers and their families and they do not have any surplus to sell in the market.\n\nIn this type of farming, landholdings are small and fragmented; cultivation techniques are primitive and simple. There is a total absence of modern equipment like tractors and farm inputs like chemical fertilizers, insecticides, and pesticides. In this farming, farmers mostly cultivate cereals along with oilseeds, pulses, vegetables, and sugarcane.\n\n\ud83d\udc49 Which year are YOU targeting for success in the IAS/IPS/IFS Exam? \ud83d\ude80\n\n(1) \u21d2 UPSC 2025: Prelims cum Mains\n\n(2) \u21d2 UPSC 2026: Prelims cum Mains\n\n(3) \u21d2 UPSC 2027 Prelims cum Mains\n\nTip: Know more about ClearIAS Courses (Online/Offline)\n\nSubsistence farming is further classified into:\n\nIntensive\nPrimitive\n\nPrimitive subsistence agriculture is practised on patches of land with the help of primitive tools like simple digging tools and community or family labour. This type of farming is monsoon depending on the fertility of the soil and other environmental conditions. Examples of such types are shifting agriculture and nomadic herding.\n\nShifting agriculture is practised in thickly forested regions like the Amazon basin, tropical Africa, parts of southeast Asia, and northeast India. These areas receive heavy rainfall hence the vegetation regenerates quickly.\nA patch of land is cleared by felling trees and burning them. The ashes are then mixed with the soil and crops like maize, yam, potatoes, and cassava are grown. The land is abandoned once fertility is reduced.\nNomadic herding is practised in the semi-arid and arid regions of the Sahara, Central Asia, and some parts of India like Rajasthan, Jammu and Kashmir.\nHerdsmen move from place to place with their animals for fodder and water, along defined routes and such movement arises due to seasonal changes. Animals like sheep, camel, yak, and goats are most commonly reared.\n\nIntensive subsistence agriculture is done on small lands with simple tools and more labour. The produce is enough for local consumption and to be sold outside. The sunny climate and fertile soil for most of the year permit the cultivation of more than one crop annually on the same plot. Rice, wheat, maize, pulses, and oilseeds are generally cultivated.\n\nii) Intensive and Extensive farming\n\nThe basic difference between these two types of farming is the amount of production per unit of land. In comparison temperate areas of the USA, Canada, and India do not practice extensive cultivation.\n\nWhen a large patch of land is used for cultivation then we call it extensive farming. Here, total production may be high due to the larger area but per unit production is low.\n\nIntensive Farming records high production per unit of land. An example of intensive cultivation is in Kerala where the availability of land for cultivation is very limited.\n\niii) Commercial farming\n\nIt is just the opposite of subsistence farming as most of the produce is sold in the market for earning money. In this system, farmers use inputs like irrigation, chemical fertilizers, insecticides, pesticides, High Yielding Varieties of seeds, etc.\n\nSome of the major commercial crops grown in different parts of India are cotton, jute, sugarcane, groundnut, etc.\n\nRice farming in Haryana is mainly for commercial purposes as people of this area are predominantly wheat eaters. However, in the East and North-Eastern states of India, rice cultivation would be a large subsistence type.\n\niv) Plantation Farming\n\nIn this type, a single cash crop is grown for sale in national and international markets. This type of agriculture involves the growing and processing of a single cash crop purely meant for sale.\n\nTea, coffee, rubber, bananas, and spices are all examples of plantation crops. Most of these crops were introduced in India by the Britishers in the 19th Century\n\nv) Mixed Farming\n\nWhen both raising crops and rearing animals are carried on simultaneously it is called mixed farming. Farmers engaged in mixed farming have economic advantages as well.\n\nAll classifications are based on the nature and purpose of farming hence they may overlap in some cases. For example, Banana is a plantation type of farming but can also be classified as commercial farming.\n\nFeatures of Indian Agriculture\n\nSubsistence Agriculture: Most parts of India have subsistence agriculture which has been practised in India for several hundreds of years and still prevails.\n\nThe pressure of population on Agriculture: Despite the increase in urbanization and industrialization, about 70% of the population is still directly or indirectly dependent on agriculture.\n\nMechanization in agriculture: Even after more than forty years of the Green Revolution and the revolution in agricultural machinery and equipment, complete mechanization is still not achieved.\n\nMonsoon dependency: Despite the large-scale expansion, only about one-third of the total cropped area is irrigated today. As a consequence, two-thirds of cropped areas are still dependent upon the monsoon.\n\nVariety of crops: Since India has both tropical and temperate climates, crops of both climates are found in India. There are very few countries in the world that have variety comparable to that of India. You would realize that when we would discuss the different types of crops in detail.\n\nThe predominance of food crops: The production of food crops is the priority of the farmers almost everywhere in the country.\n\nSeasonal patterns: India has three distinct agricultural/cropping seasons\u2013 Kharif, rabi, and Zaid. In India, there are specific crops grown in these three seasons. For example, rice is a Kharif crop whereas wheat is a Rabi crop.\n\nChallenges for Indian Agriculture\n\nThe challenges faced by Indian agriculture can be broadly grouped into two categories- the long-standing problems and the emerging issues from the prevailing agricultural practices, system, changing climate, and economy.\n\nStagnation in Production of Major Crops: The production of some of the major staple food crops like rice and wheat has been stagnating for quite some time. This is a situation that is worrying our agricultural scientists, planners, and policymakers as it creates a huge gap between the demand of the ever-growing population and the production.\n\nHigh cost of Farm Inputs: Farm inputs include fertilizer, insecticide, pesticides, HYV seeds, farm labour cost, etc. Such an increase puts low and medium-land-holding farmers at a disadvantage.\n\nSoil Exhaustion: The Green Revolution has played a positive role in reducing hunger in India but has negative consequences also. One of which is Soil exhaustion which means the loss of nutrients in the soil from farming the same crop over and over again.\n\nGroundwater depletion: The second negative consequence of the green revolution is the depletion of fresh groundwater. Most of the irrigation in dry areas of Punjab, Haryana, and Western Uttar Pradesh was carried out by excessive use of groundwater. Today fresh groundwater situation in these states is alarming.\n\nGlobal Climatic Change: It has been predicted that climate change\u2019s impact on Indian agriculture will be immense. It is predicted that due to climate change, the temperature will increase, leading to an increase in sea level, more intense cyclones, unpredictable rainfall, etc. These changes would adversely affect the production of rice and wheat. Specifically, a rise in temperature in winter would affect the production of wheat in north India. Production of rice would be affected in coastal areas of India due to the ingress of saline water and an increase in the frequency of cyclones.\n\nImpact of Globalisation: All developing countries have been affected by globalization. The most evident effect is the reduction in farmers\u2019 income and the threat to the viability of cultivation in India. This is due to the rising input costs and falling output prices. This reflects the combination of reduced subsidy and protection to farmers. Trade liberalization exposes these farmers to competition from highly subsidized production in the developed world.\n\nProviding Food Security: Before the introduction of the green revolution in India, we were not self-sufficient in terms of our food grain production. But last few decades agriculture has not grown with the increasing population and to ensure food security factors like accessibility, affordability as well nutritional value of the food available should be catered to.\n\nFarmers Suicides: The farmer suicides appear concentrated in regions of high commercialization of Indian agriculture and very high peasant debt. Cash crop farmers seemed far more vulnerable than those growing food crops. Commercialization of the countryside along with a massive decline in investment in agriculture was the beginning of the decline. Privatization of many resources has also compounded the problems.\n\nIndian Agriculture: Important Facts\n\nThe Economic Survey of India 2020-21 report stated that in FY20:\n\nThe total food grain production in the country was recorded at 296.65 million tonnes (up by 11.44 million tonnes compared with 285.21 million tonnes in FY19).\nThe government has set a target to buy 42.74 million tonnes from the central pool in FY21; this is 10% more than the quantity purchased in FY20.\nFor FY22, the government has set a record target for farmers to raise food grain production by 2% with 307.31 million tonnes of food grains.\nIn FY21, production was recorded at 303.34 million tonnes against a target of 301 million tonnes\nGross Value Added (GVA) by agriculture, forestry, and fishing was estimated at Rs. 19.48 lakh crore in FY20.\nThe share of agriculture and allied sectors in GVA of India at current prices stood at 17.8 % in FY20.\nConsumer spending in India will return to growth in 2021 after the pandemic-led contraction, expanding by as much as 6.6%.\n\nAlso read:\u00a0\n\nAgriculture export policy\nNew Schemes for Farmers",

However, they have distinct purposes, regulations, and levels of human activity allowed within their boundaries.\n\nBiosphere Reserves are the biggest entity among the three. The level of restriction in the increasing order is Biosphere Reserves, Wildlife Sanctuaries, and National Parks.\n\nThe Indian government has established\u00a018 Biosphere Reserves in India, roughly corresponding to\u00a0IUCN\u00a0Category V Protected areas.\u00a0India\u00a0has over\u00a0441 animal sanctuaries, referred to as Wildlife sanctuaries (IUCN Category IV Protected Area). As of January 2023, there are 567 existing wildlife sanctuaries in India covering an area of\u00a0 125564.86 km2.\n\nThe National Parks of India are IUCN category II protected areas. As of January 2023, there were 106 national parks in India, and more parks are in the process of getting commissioned.\n\nRecent news\n\nUNESCO has approved the designation of 11 new biosphere reserves in 11 countries.

India by ClearIAS\n\nClick here to watch video series on GI Tags in India \u2013 arranged state-wise with photographs.\n\nSummary: GI Tags\nGeographical Indications of Goods are defined as that aspect of industrial property which refers to the geographical indication referring to a country or to a place situated therein as being the country or place of origin of that product.\nTypically, such a name conveys an assurance of quality and distinctiveness which is essentially attributable to the fact of its origin in that defined geographical locality, region or country.\nUnder Articles 1 (2) and 10 of the Paris Convention for the Protection of Industrial Property, geographical indications are covered as an element of IPRs.\nThey are also covered under Articles 22 to 24 of the Trade Related Aspects of Intellectual Property Rights (TRIPS) Agreement, which was part of the Agreements concluding the Uruguay Round of GATT negotiations.\nProponents of GIs regard them as strong tools for protecting their national property rights. Opponents, however, consider GIs as barriers to trade.\n\nCompiled by: Yuvaalex and Ujwala Pullela",

Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO) which is based in Paris, France.\n\nThe International World Heritage Programme administered by the UNESCO World Heritage Committee establishes the sites to be listed as UNESCO World Heritage Sites.\n\nThe World Heritage Committee is responsible for the implementation of the World Heritage Convention (The Convention Concerning the Protection of the World Cultural and Natural Heritage or the World Heritage Convention), defines the use of the World Heritage Fund and allocates financial assistance upon requests from States Parties.\n\nIt is composed of 21 state parties which are elected by the General Assembly of States Parties for a four-year term.\n\nCurrently, India is a member of the World Heritage Committee.\n\nHow is a World Heritage Site selected?\nThe first step towards the listing is the nomination of a site by the respective government of a country.\nThe site should have an Outstanding Universal Value (OUV) for the World Heritage nomination.\nTo determine the Outstanding Universal Value (OUV) for the World Heritage nomination, there are ten enlisted criteria.\nThe proposed nomination must satisfy at least one of these ten criteria.\nThe Nomination File is then evaluated by the International Council on Monuments and Sites and the World Conservation Union.\nThese bodies then make their recommendations to the World Heritage Committee.\nThe Committee meets once per year to determine whether or not to inscribe each nominated property on the World Heritage List and sometimes defers the decision to request more information from the country which nominated the site.\nWhat are the ten criteria for determining Outstanding Universal Value (OUV)?\n(i)\n\t\nto represent a masterpiece of human creative genius;\n\n\n(ii)\n\t\nto exhibit an important interchange of human values, over a span of time or within a\u00a0\u00a0 cultural area of the world, on developments in architecture or technology, monumental arts, town-planning or landscape design;\n\n\n(iii)\n\t\nto bear a unique or at least exceptional testimony to a cultural tradition or to a civilization which is living or which has disappeared;\n\n\n(iv)\n\t\nto be an outstanding example of a type of building, architectural or technological\u00a0\u00a0 ensemble or landscape which illustrates (a) significant stage(s) in human history;\n\n\n(v)\n\t\nto be an outstanding example of a traditional human settlement, land-use, or sea-use which is representative of a culture (or cultures), or human interaction with the environment especially when it has become vulnerable under the impact of irreversible change;\n\n\n(vi)\n\t\nto be directly or tangibly associated with events or living traditions, with ideas, or with beliefs, with artistic and literary works of outstanding universal significance. (The Committee considers that this criterion should preferably be used in conjunction with other criteria.\n\n\n(vii)\n\t\nto contain superlative natural phenomena or areas of exceptional natural beauty and aesthetic importance;\n\n\n(viii)\n\t\nto be outstanding examples representing major stages of earth\u2019s history, including the record of life, significant on-going geological processes in the development of landforms, or significant geomorphic or physiographic features;\n\n\n(ix)\n\t\nto be outstanding examples representing significant ongoing ecological and biological processes in the evolution and development of terrestrial, freshwater, coastal and marine ecosystems and communities of plants and animals;\n\n\n(x)\n\t\nto contain the most important and significant natural habitats for in-situ conservation of biological diversity, including those containing threatened species of outstanding universal value from the point of view of science or conservation.\nHow does this program help the listed site and the country?\n\nWhen a site is inscribed on the World Heritage List, the resulting prestige often helps raise awareness among citizens and governments for heritage preservation.\n\nGreater awareness leads to a general rise in the level of the protection and conservation given to heritage properties.\n\nA country may also receive financial assistance and expert advice from the World Heritage Committee to support activities for the preservation of its sites.\n\nThe site will also get immediate international recognition which boosts the tourism of the country.\n\nAlso read: Gothic Architecture\n\nUNESCO World Heritage Sites in India\n\nThe Archaeological Survey of India (ASI) is the nodal agency for forwarding any request for World Heritage status to any Indian site whether cultural or natural.\n\nBased on the proposals received from the Central or State Government agencies as well as management Trusts, etc., and after their due scrutiny, the Government forwards the nomination dossiers to the World Heritage Center.\n\nIndia now has 35 sites, including 27 cultural properties, seven natural sites and one mixed site, notified as World Heritage Sites.\n\nThe\u00a0latest entries in 2016 were \u2013 (1) Nalanda University (2) Capitol Complex and (3) Khangchendzonga National Park (mixed site).\n\nThe list of places in India that have been granted World Heritage status by UNESCO is given below:\n\nCultural Sites\n1.\n\t\nAgra Fort (1983)\n\t\nDelhi\n\n\n2.\n\t\nAjanta Caves (1983)\n\t\nMaharashtra\n\n\n3.\n\t\nArchaeological Site

When it reaches Namcha Barwa, it takes a U-turn around it and enters India in the state of Arunachal Pradesh.\nHere it is known as the\u00a0Dihang River. In India, it flows through the states of Arunachal Pradesh and Assam and is connected by several tributaries.\nThe Brahmaputra has a braided channel throughout most of its length in Assam.\nThe river is known as the Tsangpo in Tibet. It receives less volume of water and has less silt in the Tibet region.\nBut in India, the river passes through a region of heavy precipitation, and as such, the river carries large amounts of water during rainfall and a significant amount of silt.\nIt is considered one of the largest rivers in India in terms of volume. It is known for creating calamities in Assam and Bangladesh.\n\nRead:\u00a0Transboundary rivers of India\n\nThe Ganga River System\n\nThe Ganga originates as the Bhagirathi from the Gangotri glacier.\nBefore it reaches Devprayag in the Garhwal Division, the Mandakini, Pindar, Dhauliganga and Bishenganga rivers merge into the Alaknanda and the Bheling drain into the Bhagirathi.\nThe Pindar River rises from East Trishul and Nanda Devi unites with the Alaknanda at Karan Prayag. The Mandakini meets at Rudraprayag.\nThe water from both Bhagirathi and the Alaknanda flows in the name of the Ganga at Devprayag.\n\nThe concept of Panch Prayag\n\nVishnuprayag: where the river Alaknanda meets river Dhauli Ganga\nNandprayag: where river Alaknanda meets river Nandakini\nKarnaprayag: where river Alaknanda meets river Pinder\nRudraprayag: where river Alaknanda meets river Mandakini\nDevprayag: where river Alaknanda meets river Bhagirathi -GANGA\n\nThe principal tributaries of the Ganga are Yamuna, Damodar, Sapta Kosi, Ram Ganga, Gomati, Ghaghara, and Son.

Read further to learn more.\n\nLearning about Fossils, their classification, and formation is important for the UPSC Civil Services Mains Exam Optional Subject Geology.\n\nThroughout human history, people have discovered preserved remains and wondered about the creatures that lived long ago. In ancient times, fossils inspired legends of monsters and other strange creatures.\n\nThe griffin, a mythical creature with a lion\u2019s body and an eagle\u2019s head and wings was probably based on skeletons of Protoceratops that were discovered by nomads in Central Asia.\n\nAnother fossil reminded the Greeks of the coiled horns of a ram.

They include body fossils, left behind when the soft parts have decayed away, as well as trace fossils, such as burrows, tracks, or fossilized waste (feces).\nThe process of a once-living organism becoming a fossil is called fossilization. Fossilization is a very rare process: of all the organisms that have lived on Earth, only a tiny percentage of them ever become fossils.\nTypes\n\nFossilization can occur in many ways. Most remains are preserved in one of five processes: preserved remains, permineralization, molds, and casts, replacement, and compression.\n\nPreserved Remains\n\nThe rarest form of fossilization is the preservation of original skeletal material and even soft tissue. For example, insects have been preserved perfectly in\u00a0amber, which is ancient tree sap.\n\nSeveral mammoths and even a Neanderthal hunter have been discovered frozen in glaciers. These preserved remains allow scientists the rare opportunity to examine the skin, hair, and organs of ancient creatures. Scientists have collected DNA from these remains and compared the DNA sequences to those of modern creatures.\n\nPermineralization\n\nThe most common method of fossilization is\u00a0permineralization or Petrification. After a bone, wood fragment, or shell is buried in sediment, it may be exposed to mineral-rich water that moves through the sediment.\n\nThis water will deposit minerals into empty spaces, producing preserved remains. Fossil dinosaur bones, petrified wood, and many marine fossils were formed by permineralization.\n\nMolds and Casts\n\nIn some cases, the original bone or shell dissolves away, leaving behind a space in the shape of the shell or bone. This depression is called a mold. Later the space may be filled with other sediments to form a matching\u00a0cast in the shape of the original organism.\n\nMany mollusks (clams, snails, octopi, and squid) are commonly found as molds and casts because their shells dissolve easily.\n\nReplacement\n\nIn some cases, the original shell or bone dissolves away and is replaced by a different mineral. For example, shells that were originally calcite may be replaced by dolomite, quartz, or pyrite.\n\nIf quartz-preserved\u00a0remains are surrounded by a calcite matrix, the calcite can be dissolved away by acid, leaving behind an exquisitely preserved quartz fossil.\n\nCompression\n\nSome of them form when their remains are compressed by high pressure. This can leave behind a dark imprint of the fossil. Compression is most common for preserved remains of leaves and ferns but can occur with other organisms, as well.\n\nMega fossils and Microfossils\n\nThey can be classified into various types based on their preservation and the size of the remains. The two primary categories are megafossils and microfossils.\n\nMegafossils: These are large preserved remains, visible to the naked eye, and include the remains of organisms such as plants, animals, and larger structures like tree trunks.\n\nTypes:\n\nBody Fossils: These include the preserved parts of an organism\u2019s body, such as bones, teeth, shells, and tissues.\nTrace Fossils: These are indirect evidence of past life activities, including footprints, burrows, and coprolites (fossilized dung).\n\nMicrofossils: They are tiny preserved remains that require microscopic examination for proper observation. They include the remains of microscopic organisms and their byproducts.\n\nTypes:\n\nForaminifera: Single-celled marine organisms with shells, commonly used in paleoclimate studies.\nDiatoms: Microscopic algae with intricate silica shells, often used in environmental and climate research.\nRadiolarians: Planktonic marine protozoa with intricate mineral skeletons.\nDinoflagellates: Microscopic aquatic organisms, often found in marine sediments.\nPollen and Spores: Plant reproductive structures, crucial for studying past vegetation.\nSignificance of Fossils\nEvolutionary Insights: They provide evidence of past life forms and evolutionary changes over millions of years, helping scientists understand the history of biodiversity.\nStratigraphy and Dating:\u00a0They aid in the relative dating of rock layers, allowing researchers to establish the chronological order of geological formations through the principle of faunal succession.\nPaleoenvironmental Reconstruction:\u00a0Fossilized plants and microorganisms help reconstruct past environments, climate conditions, and the distribution of species.\nOil and Gas Exploration:\u00a0Microfossils, such as foraminifera, are used in petroleum exploration as they indicate the presence of oil and gas deposits.\nBiogeography:\u00a0They provide insights into the historical distribution of species and the movement of continents over time.\nMedical and Industrial Applications:\u00a0Fossil-derived resources, such as coal and oil, are crucial for energy production. Additionally, fossils are used in medical research, particularly in understanding the evolution of diseases.\nChallenges in Fossil Study\nIncomplete Preservation:\u00a0The fossilization process is selective, and not all organisms or body parts are preserved. This incompleteness can limit the information available to scientists.\nTaphonomy:\u00a0Taphonomy refers to the study of what happens to an organism\u2019s remains after death. Understanding taphonomic processes is essential for interpreting the reliability of fossil records.\nFossil Bias:\u00a0Certain environments are more conducive to fossilization, leading to a bias in the types of fossils that are preserved. For example, marine environments are more likely to yield preserved remains than terrestrial ones.\nDating Challenges:\u00a0Absolute dating of preserved remains is often challenging, and scientists rely on various dating methods, including radiometric dating, to estimate the age of fossils and associated rocks.\nFossil parks in India\n\nThe Geological Survey of India (GSI) currently maintains two protected areas bearing rich fossil deposits.\n\nShivalik Fossil Park, near Saketi, Himachal Pradesh is notable for its life-size models of the vertebrates that might have roamed the Sivalik Hills 1.5-2.5 million years ago.\nMandla Plant Fossils National Park, near Dindori, Madhya Pradesh is a park that attempts to preserve the fossil remains of a primordial forest that covered the region 40-150 million years ago.\n\nOther parks in India include:\n\nIndroda Dinosaur and Fossil Park, Gujarat\nGhughua Fossil Park, Madhya Pradesh\nSalkhan Fossils Park, Uttar Pradesh\nAkal Wood Fossil Park, Rajasthan\nAmkhoi Fossil Park, West Bengal\nRaiyoli Dinosaur Fossil Park, Gujarat\nRajmahal Hills Fossil Park, Bihar\nWadadham Fossils Park, Wadadam, Sironcha, Gadchiroli, Maharashtra\n\nRead: Why India\u2019s fossil wealth has remained hidden?\n\nConclusion\n\nFossils are invaluable windows into Earth\u2019s past, offering a treasure trove of information for scientists and researchers.\n\nFrom reconstructing ancient ecosystems to understanding evolutionary processes, the study of fossils continues to contribute significantly to our knowledge of the natural world and the history of life on our planet.\n\nAs technology advances, new methods and discoveries will likely enhance our understanding of fossils and their role in unraveling the mysteries of Earth\u2019s history.\n\nRelated articles:\n\nGeological Time Scale\nMass Extinctions\nHolocene Extinction\nMagnetofossils\n\n-Article by Swathi Satish",

It takes the Sun about 225-250 million years to complete one orbit around the center, known as a cosmic year or galactic year.\nThe Milky Way\u2019s spiral arms contain a higher density of stars and regions of star formation. They appear as bright, winding structures when viewed from a distance.\n\nThe Milky Way is just one of billions of galaxies in the observable universe. It is part of the Local Group, a small cluster of galaxies that also includes the Andromeda Galaxy, the Triangulum Galaxy, and numerous smaller dwarf galaxies.\n\nStudying the Milky Way and its structure is challenging because we are inside it. Astronomers use a variety of tools, including radio and infrared telescopes, to study different regions and components of the galaxy.\n\nSolar system\n\nWe call it the solar system because it is made up of our star, the Sun, and everything bound to it by gravity \u2013 the planets Mercury, Venus, Earth, Mars, Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus, and Neptune; dwarf planets Pluto, Ceres, Makemake, Haumea, and Eris \u2013 along with hundreds of moons; and millions of asteroids, comets, and meteoroids.\n\nOur solar system is the only one we know of that has a planet that supports life. So far, we only know of life on Earth, but we\u2019re looking for life on other worlds.\n\nIt is a small part of the Milky Way galaxy and serves as our cosmic neighborhood.\n\nThe Sun is the central and most massive object in the solar system. It accounts for over 99% of the total mass of the solar system. It is a G-type main-sequence star, primarily composed of hydrogen and helium. The Sun\u2019s gravitational pull keeps all other objects in the solar system in orbit around it.\n\nPlanets\n\nThere are eight recognized planets in the solar system, divided into two groups:\n\nInner Planets (Terrestrial Planets): These include Mercury, Venus, Earth, and Mars. They are characterized by their solid surfaces and relatively small sizes. They are often called the \u201cterrestrial planets\u201d because their surfaces are rocky.\nOuter Planets: These include Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus, and Neptune. They are sometimes called the Jovian or \u201cJupiter-like\u201d planets because of their enormous size relative to the terrestrial planets. They are composed primarily of hydrogen and helium. They lack solid surfaces and have extensive ring systems.\nJupiter and Saturn are sometimes called the gas giants, whereas the more distant Uranus and Neptune have been nicknamed the ice giants. This is because Uranus and Neptune have more atmospheric water and other ice-forming molecules, such as methane, hydrogen sulfide, and phosphene, that crystallize into clouds in the planet\u2019s frigid conditions\nDwarf Planets: In addition to the eight planets, there are several dwarf planets in the solar system, including Pluto, Eris, Haumea, Makemake, and Ceres. These objects do not dominate their orbits and share them with other celestial bodies.\nOther components of the Solar system\nMoons (Natural Satellites): Many of the planets and dwarf planets have moons. Earth\u2019s moon is the most well-known. For example, Jupiter has over 80 moons, while Saturn has more than 80 as well.\nAsteroids: Asteroids are rocky, metallic objects that orbit the Sun, primarily located in the asteroid belt between Mars and Jupiter. Some notable asteroids include Ceres, Vesta, and Pallas.\nComets: Comets are icy bodies that travel in elliptical orbits around the Sun. When they approach the Sun, they develop a glowing coma and a tail due to the sublimation of their ice. Famous comets include Halley\u2019s Comet and Comet Hale-Bopp.\nKuiper Belt: Beyond the orbit of Neptune lies the Kuiper Belt, a region containing numerous small icy bodies and some dwarf planets. Pluto is one of the Kuiper Belt objects.\nOort Cloud: The Oort Cloud is a hypothetical, spherical region surrounding the solar system, where long-period comets are believed to originate. It is much farther from the Sun than the Kuiper Belt.\nInterplanetary Space: The vast regions of space between the celestial objects in the solar system are filled with solar wind, cosmic dust, and electromagnetic radiation.\nDifferent types of solar systems\n\nThe term \u201csolar system\u201d specifically refers to our star system, which includes the Sun and all the celestial bodies orbiting it, such as planets, moons, asteroids, and comets.\n\nHowever, throughout the universe, there are countless star systems, each with its own set of celestial objects.\n\nSingle Star Systems: These are star systems that consist of a single star, like our own solar system with the Sun as the central star.\nBinary Star Systems: Binary star systems contain two stars that orbit a common center of mass. They can be further classified into various types:\nVisual Binaries: These are binary stars that can be observed as two distinct stars through telescopes.\nSpectroscopic Binaries: In these systems, the two stars are so close together that they cannot be visually separated, but their presence is detected through spectroscopic observations.\nEclipsing Binaries: These systems, when observed from Earth, periodically eclipse each other, causing variations in brightness.\nMultiple Star Systems: These systems consist of three or more stars orbiting each other. They can be hierarchical, with pairs of binary stars orbiting each other, or more complex configurations involving multiple stars nearby.\nStellar Clusters: Stellar clusters are groups of stars that are gravitationally bound and have formed from the same molecular cloud. Open clusters contain young stars, while globular clusters are typically older and contain many more stars.\nPlanetary Systems: These systems, like our solar system, consist of one or more planets orbiting a star. Exoplanetary systems are planetary systems outside our solar system.\nStar-Planet Systems: These systems involve a single star and one or more planets that orbit it. These are also known as planetary systems.\nExoplanetary Systems: These systems are located outside our solar system and consist of exoplanets (planets that orbit stars other than the Sun) and their host stars.\nMultiple Planetary Systems: Some stars have multiple planets in orbit around them, and these planetary systems can be complex with various combinations of planets and their orbits.\nPulsar Systems: Pulsars are highly magnetized, rotating neutron stars that emit beams of electromagnetic radiation. Some of them are found in binary systems where they can have companion stars.\nWhite Dwarf Systems: In these systems, a white dwarf, which is the remnant of a Sun-like star, may have a companion star. Material from the companion star can accrete onto the white dwarf, leading to periodic outbursts.\nBlack Hole Systems: These systems involve a black hole, an extremely dense region of spacetime, and may include stars or other objects in orbit around the black hole.\nYoung Stellar Objects (YSOs): YSOs are stars in the early stages of formation. These systems often have disks of gas and dust, which may lead to the eventual formation of planetary systems.\nIn news\n\nA new study has revealed more\u00a0spiral galaxies\u00a0in the universe\u2019s youth than astronomers had expected.\n\nThe universe is about 13.8 billion years old and is home to different kinds of galaxies, from spiral to elliptical and those with or without bulges. Astronomers previously believed spiral galaxies formed about 6 billion years ago.\nStill, a new study by a group of astronomers from the University of Missouri in the U.S. has questioned this belief.\nIt was published in the Astrophysical Journal Letters on June 11, 2024.\n\nCurrent Theory: Astronomers believe that a large amount of hot gas was present in the cosmos when it cooled from a hot, dense condition. Clusters created by this gas ultimately coalesced to form galaxies.\n\nUnlike spiral galaxies of today, these early galaxies had irregular shapes and lacked flat discs.\nThese galaxies formed thick, hot discs over billions of years as they cooled down; these discs eventually flattened down to become the spiral arms that are familiar to us today.\n\nUnexpected Early Formation: The new analysis implies that spiral galaxies may have originated considerably earlier, at the same time as other forms of galaxies were forming, in contrast to the above idea.\n\nAt least 216 of the 873 galaxies examined in the study\u2014which made use of data from NASA\u2019s James Webb Space Telescope\u2014were spiral galaxies.\nThe percentage of spiral-shaped galaxies rose from around 8% to 48% between 3 and 7 billion years after the Big Bang, according to the study.\nThe study\u2019s findings may influence our present knowledge of spiral galaxies\u2019 star formation rates and the prerequisites for the construction of planets similar to Earth.\nFor planet formation, spiral arms formed from supernovae must include heavy materials.\nConclusion\n\nThe solar system formed about 4.6 billion years ago from a giant molecular cloud of gas and dust. Over time, gravitational forces led to the formation of the Sun and the various objects that make up the solar system.\n\nThe solar system provides a unique window into the study of planetary science, astronomy, and the origins of our cosmic neighborhood.\n\nHere only a few examples of the diverse star systems found throughout the universe are mentioned.

    "[CONTENT] #129": "Given the increasing food demand, environmental degradation, and the challenges posed by climate change, there is an urgent need to transform agri-food systems into sustainable enterprises through scientific innovations. Read here to understand how sustainable agri-food systems can be fostered.\n\nFood systems encompass the entire range of actors and their interlinked value-adding activities involved in the production, aggregation, processing, distribution, consumption, and disposal of food products that originate from agriculture, forestry, or fisheries, and parts of the broader economic, societal, and natural environments in which they are embedded.\n\nThe food system is composed of sub-systems (e.g., farming system, waste management system, input supply system, etc.) and interacts with other key systems (e.g. energy system, trade system, health system, etc.).\n\nTherefore, a structural change in the food system might originate from a change in another system; for example, a policy promoting more biofuel in the energy system will have a significant impact on the food system.\n\nTable of Contents\n\nSustainable agri-food systems\nWhy sustainable agri-food systems?\nLimitations of current approaches\nIndia and sustainability of food-agri systems\nConclusion\nSustainable agri-food systems\n\nSustainable agri-food systems refer to a holistic approach to agriculture and food production that aims to meet the needs of the present while preserving the ability of future generations to meet their own needs.\n\n\ud83d\udc49 Which year are YOU targeting for success in the IAS/IPS/IFS Exam? \ud83d\ude80\n\n(1) \u21d2 UPSC 2025: Prelims cum Mains\n\n(2) \u21d2 UPSC 2026: Prelims cum Mains\n\n(3) \u21d2 UPSC 2027 Prelims cum Mains\n\nTip: Know more about ClearIAS Courses (Online/Offline)\n\nThese systems are designed to be environmentally, economically, and socially sustainable.\n\nEnvironmental Sustainability:\n\nConservation of Resources: Sustainable agriculture aims to minimize the use of non-renewable resources like fossil fuels and synthetic chemicals while maximizing the efficient use of renewable resources like water and soil.\nBiodiversity: The preservation of biodiversity is essential. Sustainable systems promote crop rotation, agroforestry, and the preservation of natural habitats to support diverse ecosystems.\nReduced Environmental Impact: Sustainable agriculture seeks to minimize environmental impacts, such as soil erosion, water pollution, and greenhouse gas emissions, associated with farming practices.\n\nEconomic Sustainability:\n\nEconomic Viability: Farmers and agricultural businesses should be economically viable, able to earn a living, and maintain financial stability.\nMarket Access: Access to markets and fair pricing for agricultural products is essential for economic sustainability.\nValue Addition: Adding value to agricultural products through processing and marketing can enhance the economic sustainability of agri-food systems.\n\nSocial Sustainability:\n\nLabor Conditions: Providing fair wages and decent working conditions for agricultural workers is a fundamental aspect of social sustainability.\nCommunity Well-Being: Sustainable agriculture benefits local communities by creating job opportunities, supporting local economies, and fostering a sense of community well-being.\nAccess to Healthy Food: Ensuring that all members of society have access to safe, nutritious, and affordable food is a social sustainability goal.\nWhy sustainable agri-food systems?\n\nA food system must be considered in the context of rapid population growth, urbanization, growing wealth, changing consumption patterns, and globalization as well as climate change and the depletion of natural resources.\n\nThe developments in food systems have yielded many positive results, especially over the past three decades in developing countries.\n\nThese results include the expansion of off-farm employment opportunities as food industries have developed, and the widening of food choices beyond local staples, thus satisfying consumers\u2019 preferences in terms of taste, form, and quality.\n\nFood Security and Nutrition:\n\nSustainable agri-food systems prioritize food security by aiming to produce a sufficient and consistent supply of food to meet the population\u2019s nutritional needs.\nNutrient-dense and diverse food production is promoted to address nutritional deficiencies and improve overall health.\n\nResilience:\n\nBuilding resilience in agri-food systems involves practices and policies that help agriculture withstand and recover from shocks such as extreme weather events, pests, and diseases.\n\nTechnology and Innovation:\n\nSustainable systems incorporate innovative technologies that improve resource use efficiency, reduce waste, and enhance agricultural productivity.\n\nReduced Waste and Loss: Sustainable agri-food systems seek to reduce food waste and loss at various stages of production, distribution, and consumption.\n\nLocal and Organic Farming: Supporting local and organic farming practices is often a key element of sustainable agri-food systems, as they tend to have lower environmental impacts and promote healthier food.\n\nKnowledge Transfer: Sustainable agriculture involves the transfer of knowledge and best practices to farmers and stakeholders to improve the sustainability of farming techniques.\n\nPolicy and Regulation: Governments play a critical role in shaping sustainable agri-food systems through policies and regulations that support responsible and sustainable practices.\n\nConsumer Awareness and Demand: Consumer choices can drive the sustainability of agri-food systems by supporting products and practices that align with their values and sustainability goals.\n\nGlobal Collaboration: Many sustainability challenges in agri-food systems are global. Collaboration among countries and international organizations is crucial to address issues such as climate change, trade, and food security.\n\nLimitations of current approaches\n\nThe complexity of food systems requires a more holistic and coordinated approach. Many food security and nutrition challenges are complex problems whose solutions are contested and which transcend disciplinary, divisional, and institutional boundaries.\n\nIn increasingly globalized food systems, these challenges result from interactions across different scales and levels. They require integrated actions taken by all stakeholders at local, national, regional, and global levels, by both public and private actors, and across multiple fronts- not only in agriculture, but also trade, policy, health, environment, gender norms, education, transport and infrastructure, and so on.\nIt requires a synergetic merging rather than a destructive clashing of the ideas emerging from these various angles.\nTraditional food security programs tend to adopt a production-focused approach, which seeks to directly influence food security through increasing the supply of food.\nIn a few regions of the world, particularly Sub-Saharan Africa, inadequate food production is still the major cause of food and nutrition insecurity.\n\nHowever, the dramatic pace of food system changes over the past decades has brought about complex interactions and feedback loops that impact food security and nutrition in many different ways.\n\nThe focus on food production leads to the neglect of other areas in which the root causes of the food system\u2019s underperformance, as well as the leverage points to bring about the biggest impacts, can often be found.\nFurthermore, the interwoven interactions and feedback in the food system mean that direct interventions in one area risk creating or exacerbating problems in another.\nIndia and sustainability of food-agri systems\n\nIndia has been working towards transforming agri-food systems into sustainable enterprises through scientific innovations. But there are still more aspects to be cared for.\n\nAgricultural scientists should strive to infuse greater mechanization in the agriculture production process and develop and popularise specialized farm implements for women in agriculture.\nThe Sagar Parkirama drive shed more light on marine and inland water pollution that has seriously affected aquatic life and coastal ecology.\nTraditional farm products such as pokkali rice need to be promoted and measures are to be taken to ensure profitability for the pokkali farmers.\nMinimising post-harvest losses is equivalent to boosting production and this can be achieved by focusing attention on advanced technological interventions.\n\nThe future of India\u2019s agriculture depends a lot on how the accumulated scientific knowledge can be translated to commercial success.\n\nConclusion\n\nSustainable agri-food systems are about achieving a balance between economic prosperity, social equity, and environmental responsibility in agriculture and food production. These systems seek to ensure that agriculture not only provides for today\u2019s needs but also preserves resources for future generations while promoting health, equity, and resilience.\n\nRelated Articles:\n\nGreen Agriculture\nBlue Food\nAgroforestry\nOrganic Farming\nAgri-food policies for Soil, water, air, and biodiversity\n\n-Article by Swathi Satish",

The Mid-Atlantic Ridge, which runs down the center of the Atlantic, is one of the longest mountain ranges on Earth.\n\nMid-Atlantic Ridge\n\nThe Mid-Atlantic Ridge is a prominent underwater mountain range that extends along the center of the Atlantic Ocean from the Arctic Ocean in the north to the Southern Ocean in the south.\n\nIt marks a divergent plate boundary, where the Eurasian, North American, South American, African, and Antarctic Plates are moving away from each other.\nThe Mid-Atlantic Ridge is characterized by rugged, volcanic peaks and deep rift valleys.\nThe ridge is known as Dolphin Rise to the north and Challenger Rise to the south of the equator.\nIt is known as Wyville Thompson Ridge between Iceland and Scotland.\nThe ridge becomes quite extensive to the south of Greenland and Iceland and is called the Telegraphic Plateau because the first cables were laid down in this area.\nAzores Rise bifurcates from the mid-Atlantic Ridge to the south of 40\u00b0N latitude and ex\u00adtends up to the Azores Islands.\nOther fracture zones are also well marked, Gibbs Fracture Zone (near 40\u00b0N), Atlantis Fracture Zone (near 30\u00b0N), Oceanographic Fracture Zone (32\u00b0N), Kane Fracture Zone (25\u00b0N), Vema Fracture Zone (10\u00b0N), Romancha Fracture Zone (near equator) etc.\nTrenches and Basins\n\nThe Atlantic Ocean features several deep-sea trenches, which are formed at convergent plate boundaries where one tectonic plate is subducting beneath another.\n\nThe Puerto Rico Trench, located north of Puerto Rico, is one of the deepest trenches in the Atlantic Ocean.\nSouth Sandwich trench is located in the South Atlantic Ocean, east of South America. It is a subduction zone where the South American Plate is descending beneath the Scotia Plate. The trench is associated with volcanic activity in the South Sandwich Islands.\n\nMid-Ocean Basins\n\nThe Atlantic Ocean is divided into several deep ocean basins, including the North Atlantic Basin, the South Atlantic Basin, and the Sargasso Sea. These basins vary in size and depth and are surrounded by the continents and the Mid-Atlantic Ridge.\n\nNorth Atlantic Basin: This is the northernmost part of the Atlantic Ocean, extending from the Arctic Ocean in the north to the Mid-Atlantic Ridge in the south. It includes the Labrador Sea, Greenland Sea, Norwegian Sea, and parts of the Barents Sea.\nSouth Atlantic Basin: This is the southern counterpart to the North Atlantic Basin, stretching from the southern tip of South America to the African continent. It includes the Argentine Basin, the Brazil Basin, and the Falkland Plateau.\nBermuda-Azores-Canary Triangle: This triangular region in the North Atlantic Ocean includes the Bermuda Islands, the Azores Islands, and the Canary Islands. It is a geologically complex area with volcanic islands and seamounts.\nNorth Equatorial Basin: This basin is situated in the tropical North Atlantic Ocean, between the Caribbean Sea and the African coast. It is influenced by the North Equatorial Current and features warm waters.\nContinental Shelves and Continental Slopes\n\nThe Atlantic Ocean has extensive continental shelves along its coastlines. These are shallow, submerged platforms that extend from the continents into the ocean. They are important for marine ecosystems and are often used for fishing and oil and gas exploration.\n\nBeyond the continental shelves, the seafloor gradually slopes downward toward the deep ocean basins. This transition is known as the continental slope. It is a region of steep underwater cliffs and canyons.\n\nBottom topography of Atlantic Ocean: other features\n\nAbyssal Plains\n\nAbyssal plains are flat, sediment-covered regions of the deep ocean floor. They are found in the Atlantic Ocean\u2019s deep basins, away from the continental margins. Abyssal plains are some of the flattest and most featureless areas on Earth\u2019s surface.\n\nSeamounts\n\nSeamounts are underwater mountains that rise abruptly from the seafloor. The Atlantic Ocean contains numerous seamounts, some of which were formed by volcanic activity. Some seamounts may approach the ocean\u2019s surface, creating a habitat for marine life.\n\nGuyots\n\nGuyots are flat-topped seamounts that were once above sea level but have since subsided. They are often found in the deeper parts of the Atlantic Ocean and provide insight into past sea-level changes.\n\nSargasso Sea\n\nThe Sargasso Sea is a unique region in the North Atlantic Ocean characterized by calm, clear waters and the presence of Sargassum seaweed. It is located within the North Atlantic Gyre and is a critical habitat for marine life.\n\nCaribbean Sea\n\nWhile not a basin within the Atlantic Ocean itself, the Caribbean Sea is an enclosed sea surrounded by the Caribbean islands and the eastern coasts of Central and South America. It is connected to the Atlantic Ocean through various straits and passages.\n\nRift Valleys\n\nIn addition to the Mid-Atlantic Ridge, there are several rift valleys and fracture zones that traverse the Atlantic Ocean floor. These are associated with tectonic plate movements and are marked by geological features like faults and ridges.\n\nOcean deeps\n\nThe number of deeps in the Atlantic Ocean is less than in the Pacific Ocean because of the absence of the effects of Tertiary orogenic movements along the Atlantic coasts.\n\nA few examples are Nares Deep, Puerto Rico Deep, Hatteras Deep, Columbia Deep (south of Haiti), Valdivia Deep, Buchanan Deep, Moseley Deep, Vema Deep, etc.\n\nConclusion\n\nThe bottom topography of the Atlantic Ocean is continually evolving due to plate tectonics, erosion, sedimentation, and other geological processes.\n\nIt is a fascinating and dynamic part of the Earth\u2019s surface, with significant implications for oceanography, geology, and marine biology.\n\nAlso read:\u00a0Bottom topography of Pacific Ocean;\u00a0Bottom topography of Indian Ocean\n\n-Article by Swathi Satish",

To answer these questions, read further.\n\nIn 1957 McKenzie and Parker suggested the plate tectonic theory. The theory was propounded in 1967 by Morgan by taking some attributes from all previous theories of geomorphology.\n\nBoth conventional current theory and seafloor spreading theory paved the way for the theory of plate tectonics.\n\nThe theory provides substantial and scientific evidence about the present configuration of the first order and the process of origin of every second-order relief feature.\n\nTable of Contents\n\nPlate Tectonic Theory\nThe theory of plate tectonics is based on 4 general geomorphological assumptions\nThe first orderly relief features\nEvidence in support of separation\nThe origin of the second orderly relief features\nConvergent Boundaries\nDivergent Boundaries\nTransform Boundaries\nMajor Tectonic Plates\nMinor Tectonic Plates\nSignificance of plate tectonic theory\nConclusion\nPlate Tectonic Theory\n\nThe plate tectonic theory is a fundamental concept in geology that explains the movement of the Earth\u2019s lithospheric plates, which make up the Earth\u2019s outermost shell.\n\n\ud83d\udc49 Which year are YOU targeting for success in the IAS/IPS/IFS Exam? \ud83d\ude80\n\n(1) \u21d2 UPSC 2025: Prelims cum Mains\n\n(2) \u21d2 UPSC 2026: Prelims cum Mains\n\n(3) \u21d2 UPSC 2027 Prelims cum Mains\n\nTip: Know more about ClearIAS Courses (Online/Offline)\n\nThis theory provides a comprehensive framework for understanding the dynamic processes that shape the Earth\u2019s surface, including the formation of continents, ocean basins, mountains, earthquakes, and volcanic activity.\n\nThe Earth\u2019s lithosphere is divided into several large and smaller plates that float on the semi-fluid asthenosphere beneath them. These plates are made up of the Earth\u2019s crust and the uppermost part of the mantle.\nPlate tectonics is driven by the movement of the Earth\u2019s mantle, specifically convection currents. The heat from the Earth\u2019s interior causes the mantle to convect, creating circulation patterns. This movement of material in the mantle drags the overlying lithospheric plates with it.\n\nPlate Boundaries:\n\nThe boundaries between these lithospheric plates are where most of the Earth\u2019s geological activity occurs. There are three main types of plate boundaries:\n\nDivergent Boundaries: Plates move away from each other. This can result in the formation of mid-ocean ridges and rift valleys.\nConvergent Boundaries: Plates move toward each other. When oceanic plates collide with continental plates, subduction zones, and mountain ranges can form. Oceanic-continental convergence can lead to volcanic arcs. Continental-continental convergence can create high mountain ranges.\nTransform Boundaries: Plates slide past each other horizontally. This can lead to strike-slip faults and earthquakes.\nThe theory of plate tectonics is based on 4 general geomorphological assumptions\nFirstly the slab or zone of the lithosphere is divided into several vertical columns geomorphological known as plates drifting kinematically over a semi-molten asthenosphere called a tectonic.\nSecondly, the surface area of a continental plate is also extended over the oceanic lithosphere. Thus, there is no complete segregation between the continental and the oceanic lithosphere. In this way, the theory again rejects the primary contention of Alfred Wegener that Continental sial and oceanic Sima are two different lithospheric entities.\nThirdly, the movement or tectonics of the respective plates depends on the direction and the impulse action of the thermal Convection currents. consequently, the plates are converging and also divergent away from each other.\nLastly, the process of convergence and divergence further creates a new crust over the Earth\u2019s surface and also disintegrates the crust apart. The rate of formation and disintegration of the crust has acquired a profile of equilibrium by which the surface area of the earth remains constant.\nThe first orderly relief features\n\nAccording to the plate tectonic theory, in the carboniferous period, the Pangea was segregated into two disrupted Continental blocks by the divergence of convection currents and the location of hotspots between the blocks.\n\nThe southern block of Gondwanaland further cross a hotspot and get segregated into the Northern and Southern block. In the present geological timescale, the southern block is known as Antarctica, and the northern block is the plates of South America, Africa, India, and Australia.\n\nThe physical location of the Indian block was initially between the plates of Africa and Antarctica and for the last 200 million years, the continental block of India has been drifting northeast over the asthenosphere.\n\nApproximately 120 million years ago the physical location of the Indian block was near the equator and at the same time, the plate of India was segregated from the continental blocks of Africa.\n\nEvidence in support of separation\n\nThe plate tectonic theory is supported by various lines of evidence, including:\n\nThe fit of continents (e.g., the jigsaw puzzle fit of South America and Africa)\nThe distribution of earthquakes and volcanoes along plate boundaries\nThe age of oceanic crust (youngest at mid-ocean ridges and oldest at continental margins)\nThe magnetic striping pattern of oceanic crust\n\nThe evidence in support of such separation is very well-identified along the eastern and western margin of the Africa Indian block respectively, characterized by the presence of the central fault line and volcanic deposition.\n\nWith time, the plate of Australia also gets segregated from the Indian block and substantial shreds of evidence of such tectonic movements are identified in the center of the Indian Ocean by the presence of the Central fault line and made Indian oceanic ridge.\n\nThe tectonic movement of respective plates and segregation of Continental blocks for each other further created an intervening space between the horizontally displacing block filled by oceanic water of Panthalassa to give rise to oceanic basins like the Pacific, Atlantic, and the Indian Ocean.\n\nThe origin of the second orderly relief features\n\nDue to the plate tectonic theory, we got to know that the major geomorphological features such as fold and block mountains, mid-oceanic ridges, trenches, volcanism, earthquakes, etc. are a direct consequence of the interaction between the various lithospheric plates.\n\nThree different types of tectonic borders:\n\nWhere plates collide is a convergence.\nDivergent, in which the plates separate.\nWhen plates transform, they shift sideways concerning one another.\n\nThe interactions between plates are responsible for a wide range of geological phenomena, including the formation of mountain ranges (e.g., the Himalayas), ocean basins (e.g., the Atlantic Ocean), earthquakes along faults, volcanic eruptions, and the creation and destruction of oceanic crust.\n\nThe behavior of plates at their margins varies depending on the type of boundary. For example, at convergent boundaries, subduction zones can lead to the recycling of oceanic crust into the mantle, while at divergent boundaries, new crust is formed.\n\nConvergent Boundaries\nWhen tectonic plates collide with one another, a convergent plate boundary is created. They are known as term \u201cdestructive boundaries\u201d as well.\nThese borders are frequently subduction zones, where a deep trench is formed as a heavier plate slides beneath a lighter plate.\nIn addition to creating subduction zones, convergent plate boundaries can cause mountain ranges and island arcs to form.\nThe collision can lead to the subduction of one plate beneath another, where one plate is pushed into the Earth\u2019s mantle, creating deep-sea trenches, volcanic arcs, and earthquakes.\nWhen two continental plates collide, they can also create large mountain ranges.\n\nConvergence can happen in three different ways:\n\nbetween a continental and oceanic plate (Andes Mountains)\nbetween two continental plates (The Himalayas)\ntwo oceanic plates (Mariana Trench)\nDivergent Boundaries\nThe breaking apart of tectonic plates creates a divergent boundary. The term \u201cconstructive boundaries\u201d refers to them.\nAt divergent plate boundaries, tectonic plates move away from each other.\nThis movement creates tensional stress that results in the formation of a new crust. As the plates separate, magma from the mantle rises to fill the gap, leading to the formation of mid-ocean ridges.\nDivergent boundaries are often associated with volcanic activity and earthquakes, although the earthquakes tend to be relatively mild compared to those at other types of plate boundaries.\nRift valleys and seafloor spreading are found at divergent boundaries.\nThe Mid-Atlantic Ridge, which divides the American Plate from the Eurasian and African Plates, is the most well-known example of diverging borders.\nExamples: Mid-Atlantic Ridge, East African Rift, Mid-Indian Ridge\nTransform Boundaries\nTectonic plates glide past one another horizontally to form a transform boundary, however, some of these plates become stuck where they touch.\nDue to plate interaction, the crust is neither created nor destroyed, hence these boundaries are conservative. As a result, they don\u2019t create amazing features like mountains or oceans.\nStress builds in these points of contact, causing the rocks to break or slide. Faults are these slippage or breakage regions. The majority of Earth\u2019s faults are located in the Ring of Fire along transform boundaries.\nTransform boundaries are often associated with significant seismic activity and can produce powerful earthquakes.\nExamples: San Andreas Fault (North American Plate and Pacific Plate); North Anatolian Fault (Eurasian Plate and Anatolian Plate); Alpine Fault (Pacific Plate and Indo-Australian Plate).\n\nIn addition to these primary types of plate boundaries, there are complex regions where the interactions between plates are not neatly categorized into one type. These regions can exhibit a combination of features associated with divergent, convergent, and transform boundaries.\n\nMajor Tectonic Plates\n\nAntarctica and the surrounding oceanic plate\nNorth American plate\nSouth American plate\nPacific plate\nIndia-Australia-New Zealand plate\nAfrica with the eastern Atlantic floor plate\nEurasia and the adjacent oceanic plate\nMinor Tectonic Plates\nArabian plate: Mostly the Saudi Arabian landmass\nBismark Plate (North Bismarck Plate & South Bismarck Plate)\nCaribbean plate\nCarolina plate [straddles the Equator in the eastern hemisphere located north of New Guinea]\nCocos Plate\nJuan de Fuca Plate (between Pacific and North American plates)\nNazca plate\nPhilippine plate: Between the Asiatic and Pacific plate\nPersian Plate\nThe Anatolian Plate [or the Turkish Plate is a continental tectonic plate comprising most of the Anatolia (Asia Minor) peninsula and the country of Turkey.\nChina plate.\nFiji Plate ( located b/w the Pacific Plate and the Indo-Australia Plate )\nSignificance of plate tectonic theory\n\nPlate tectonics explains the distribution of continents and oceans, the formation of mountain ranges, the opening and closing of ocean basins, and the generation of geological hazards such as earthquakes and volcanic eruptions.\n\nPlate tectonics is responsible for creating almost all significant landforms.\nMagmatic eruptions cause the core to spew out new materials.\nMinerals with high economic value, such as copper and uranium, are located close to plate borders.\nThe future shape of landmasses can be anticipated using the current understanding of crustal plate movement.\nFor instance, North and South America will split if current patterns continue. The east coast of Africa will split off into a new region. Australia will approach Asia.\nConclusion\n\nThe great unifying theory of geosciences that describes how continents move is called plate tectonics. Most significant landforms on Earth\u2019s surface, such as mountains, mid-ocean ridges, and the production of the new lithosphere are caused by volcanism and earthquakes.\n\nThe plate tectonic theory has revolutionized our understanding of the Earth\u2019s geology and has become a unifying principle in the field of earth sciences.\n\nIt provides a framework for explaining the dynamic processes that have shaped the Earth\u2019s surface over millions of years and continue to do so today.\n\nArticle written by Chetna Yadav.",

During the positive phase, the eastern North Pacific tends to be warmer than average, while during the negative phase, it tends to be cooler than average.\nThe positive phase is characterized by cool SSTs north of Hawaii and warmer-than-normal sea surface temperatures along the western coast of North America.\nThe negative phase is a mirror image with warm ocean temperatures in the Central North Pacific and cooler than normal waters along the western coast of North America.\n\nSpatial Patterns:\n\nThe positive phase is associated with a horseshoe-shaped pattern of above-average sea surface temperatures, with warm waters extending along the western coast of North America and into the central North Pacific.\nIn the negative phase, the pattern is reversed, with cooler waters along the western coast of North America.\n\nDuration:\n\nThe PDO is a long-term climate pattern that typically lasts for 20 to 30 years in one phase before transitioning to the opposite phase. However, the timing and duration of these phases can vary considerably.\n\nNatural Climate Variability:\n\nThe PDO is considered a part of natural climate variability and is driven by a combination of oceanic and atmospheric processes.\nIt is not directly related to human-induced climate change, although it can interact with and modulate the effects of climate change in certain regions.\nImpact of Pacific Decadal Oscillation\n\nThe PDO can influence weather patterns, ocean conditions, and ecosystems over a wide area, including North America and the North Pacific region.\n\nPositive Phase Impacts\nDuring the positive phase, it is often associated with milder winters in the western United States, increased rainfall in the Pacific Northwest, and changes in marine ecosystems.\nThe Northern Rockies and the Midwest are likely to be drier than normal, while Texas, the Gulf states, and the East are likely to be wetter than normal.\nDuring the positive phase of the PDO in the northern hemisphere wintertime, much of Asia is usually cooler than normal, with above-normal temperatures more likely over India.\nAt the same time, China and Japan are likely to be drier than normal, while India often has a winter that is wetter than normal.\nNegative Phase Impacts\nDuring the negative phase, it can lead to colder winters in the western U.S., drier conditions in the Pacific Northwest, and different marine ecosystem dynamics.\nMany parts of the US will see drier than normal weather, but there are some notable exceptions.\nDuring a negative PDO, winter rainfall is usually above normal for the Ohio and Tennessee Valleys as well as the Northern Rockies and Plains.\nDuring the negative phase of the PDO in the northern hemisphere wintertime, much of India and China is usually cooler than normal, But Japan has warmer than normal weather, especially in the North.\nAt the same time, Japan and Northwest China are usually wetter than normal, while Southwest China and much of India are usually wetter than normal\nPDO vs ENSO\n\nIt\u2019s important to note that the PDO is distinct from ENSO, which operates on a shorter timescale (typically 2 to 7 years) and involves interactions between the ocean and atmosphere in the tropical Pacific.\n\nHowever, there can be interactions between the PDO and ENSO, where the phase of one pattern can influence or reinforce the phase of the other.\n\nParameter\n\n\t\nPDO\n\t\n\nENSO\n\n\n\n\nTimescale\n\n\t\nThe PDO is a long-term climate pattern that varies on decadal to multi-decadal timescales, typically ranging from 20 to 30 years for each phase.\n\t\nENSO is a shorter-term climate phenomenon, with irregular cycles that typically last 2 to 7 years. It has two primary phases: El Ni\u00f1o (warm) and La Ni\u00f1a (cool), with a neutral phase in between.\n\n\n\nNature\n\n\t\nThe PDO is characterized by a shift in sea surface temperature (SST) patterns in the North Pacific Ocean. It involves the alternation between warm (positive) and cool (negative) phases.\n\t\nENSO involves changes in sea surface temperatures and atmospheric pressure patterns in the tropical Pacific Ocean, primarily in the eastern and central equatorial Pacific.\n\n\n\nGeographic scope\n\n\t\nThe PDO affects the entire North Pacific Ocean, from the west coast of North America to Japan and beyond.\n\t\nENSO\u2019s primary impacts are felt in the tropical Pacific region, but it has far-reaching global consequences.\n\n\n\nOceanic and atmospheric effects\n\n\t\nThe PDO primarily influences sea surface temperatures and oceanic patterns in the North Pacific. It can have secondary effects on atmospheric circulation, precipitation patterns, and climate conditions in the surrounding regions.\n\t\nENSO can lead to significant shifts in atmospheric circulation, altering weather patterns, precipitation, and temperature anomalies across the Pacific basin and beyond.\n\n\n\nImpact\n\n\t\nThe PDO can influence weather patterns and climate conditions over extended periods, affecting fisheries, marine ecosystems, and even temperature and precipitation patterns in North America.\n\t\nENSO can have profound and immediate impacts on global weather and climate. El Ni\u00f1o is associated with warm oceanic conditions and can lead to droughts, flooding, and extreme weather events, while La Ni\u00f1a tends to have the opposite effects.\nConclusion\n\nPDO and ENSO are distinct climate phenomena, each with its timescale, geographic scope, and influence on oceanic and atmospheric conditions. Understanding these patterns is essential for climate forecasting and assessing their impacts on weather, agriculture, and ecosystems.\n\nScientists monitor the PDO to understand its phase and anticipate its impacts on regional climate and ecosystems. Understanding the PDO can be valuable for various sectors, including agriculture, fisheries, and water resource management, as it provides insights into long-term climate patterns in the North Pacific region.\n\n-Article by Swathi Satish",

    "[CONTENT] #156": "The Indian Ocean Dipole (IOD) is also known as Indian Nino or Indian Ocean\u2019s counterpart to El Ni\u00f1o. The IOD affects the climate of Australia and other countries that surround the Indian Ocean Basin and is a significant contributor to rainfall variability in this region. Read here to learn in-depth about the IOD.\n\nRecently, it has been reported that the climate models indicate a positive Indian Ocean dipole event during September-October-November.\n\nWhat does the above statement mean?

The IOD is often referred to as the \u201cIndian Ocean\u2019s counterpart to El Ni\u00f1o.\u201d\n\nThe IOD\u2019s influence on sea surface temperatures and atmospheric pressure can have far-reaching effects on regional weather patterns.\nPositive IOD events can lead to droughts in countries like India, which rely heavily on the monsoon rains, as well as reduced agricultural productivity in affected areas.\nConversely, negative IOD events can bring relief from drought conditions in some regions but can also lead to an increased risk of flooding.\n\nRead:\u00a0Impact of climate change on Indian monsoon\n\nVariability and Prediction\nThe Indian Ocean Dipole exhibits variability on various timescales, from intra-seasonal to interannual.\nPredicting the IOD is challenging, but advances in climate modeling and monitoring have improved the ability to forecast its development.\nThe IOD is influenced by multiple factors, including ocean-atmosphere interactions and interactions with other climate phenomena like El Ni\u00f1o.\nPast events\n\nThe positive IOD event is known to help the South-West monsoon. The 2019 event was one of the strongest on record.\n\nIt drove the Indian monsoon to excess and extended it into October.\nFor Australia, a positive IOD event year brought low rainfall from October to December, a late monsoon onset, and low tropical cyclone activity.\nIndian Ocean Dipole and ENSO\n\nIndian Ocean Dipole is a varying ocean-atmosphere system in the Indian Ocean like ENSO in the Pacific Ocean.\n\nENSO and IOD are not directly linked but can influence each other indirectly. For example, during El Ni\u00f1o, the warming of the central and eastern Pacific can affect atmospheric circulation and rainfall patterns, which, in turn, can impact the IOD by affecting the trade winds and ocean currents in the Indian Ocean.\n\nThere are instances when a positive IOD and El Ni\u00f1o occur simultaneously, leading to compounded and potentially more extreme impacts on regional climate variability.\nIt was observed that a positive IOD index often negated the effect of ENSO, resulting in increased Monsoon rains in several ENSO years like 1983, 1994, and 1997.\nConclusion\n\nThe Indian Ocean Dipole is a vital climate driver that can significantly impact ecosystems, agriculture, water resources, and economies in the Indian Ocean region.\n\nIt underscores the complex interactions between ocean and atmosphere and the need for improved climate prediction systems to manage the potential impacts of its positive and negative phases.\n\nPrevious year question\n\nQ. With reference to \u2018Indian Ocean Dipole (IOD)\u2019 sometimes mentioned in the news while forecasting the Indian monsoon, which of the following statements is/are correct? (2017)\n\nThe IOD phenomenon is characterized by a difference in sea surface temperature between the tropical Western Indian Ocean and the tropical Eastern Pacific Ocean.\nAn IOD phenomenon can influence an El Nino\u2019s impact on the monsoon.\n\nSelect the correct answer using the code given below:\n\n(a) 1 only\n\n(b) 2 only\n\n(c) Both 1 and 2\n\n(d) Neither 1 nor 2\n\n-Article by Swathi Satish",

Here are some of the major rivers of the world, listed by continent.\n\nAfrica\nRIVER NILE\n\nConsidered to be the longest river in the world. The length of the Nile River is roughly 6650 kilometers. Lake Victoria is assumed to be the river\u2019s origin. The river\u2019s course passes through Egypt, Uganda, Ethiopia, Kenya, Tanzania, Rwanda, the Democratic Republic of the Congo, Eritrea, Burundi, Sudan, and South Sudan. The Blue and White Niles are the river\u2019s two tributaries.\n\nRIVER CONGO\n\nThe only river to cross the equator twice is the Congo River. It is originally known as the Zaire River. It has a length of\u00a0 4700\u00a0Km. It travels in a curving pattern across the continent of Africa. With some sections reaching depths of over 700 feet, it is also the deepest river in the entire globe.\n\nORANGE RIVER\n\nThe Orange River is the longest in South Africa. It starts in the Drakensberg in neighboring Lesotho, where it is also known as the Senqu River. It travels across South Africa before entering the Atlantic Ocean. The Orange River is a component of the border between Lesotho and South Africa as well as between Namibia and South Africa.\n\nFrom the river\u2019s source and the Atlantic Ocean, it travels 1,365 miles. The river was known as Gariep by the first residents, and Groote Rivier by the Dutch. Nonetheless, Colonel Robert Gordon gave it the name Orange River in 1779 in recognition of William V of Orange. Via the Orange River Project, the Orange River supports mining, manufacturing, and agriculture. The alluvial deposit on the river was where the first diamond in South Africa was found.\n\nLIMPOPO RIVER\n\nThe Limpopo River originates in southern Africa\u2019s central regions. It extends to a length of about 1,087 miles before flowing eastward toward the Indian Ocean. It has a 415,000-square-kilometre drainage basin.\u00a0 It is the Limpopo River that divides South Africa from Botswana and Zimbabwe.\n\nThe river starts at the confluence of its two tributaries, the Crocodile and Marico Rivers; its principal tributary in Botswana is the Notwane River. The Limpopo Basin is also home to numerous mining operations. Nonetheless, flooding has resulted in losses and damages.\n\nNIGER RIVER\n\nFlows through West Africa, passing through countries like Nigeria, Niger, Mali, and Guinea discharging through a massive delta, known as the Oil Rivers, into the Gulf of Guinea. The\u00a0Niger River\u00a0is the principal\u00a0river\u00a0of western\u00a0Africa, extending over 2,500 miles (about 4,180 km). The Niger is the third longest river in Africa, exceeded only by the Nile\u00a0and the\u00a0Congo Rivers\u00a0(also known as the Za\u00efre River). Its main tributary is the Benue River.\n\nZAMBEZI RIVER\n\nThe \u201cBig River\u201d sustains the lives of many iconic African species, including elephants, buffalo, hippos, antelope, and crocodiles, as well as the people who live between its modest source in the Zambian highlands and the Indian Ocean. It passes through parts of Angola, Namibia, Botswana, and Zimbabwe.\n\nAs it moves eastward, the Zambezi gains momentum and supplies plenty of electricity to many of the communities in its basin. Zambia and Zimbabwe receive power from the Kariba Dam, while Mozambique and South Africa are lit up by the Cahora Bassa Dam. These two hydroelectric plants are among the biggest in Africa. Victoria Falls is undoubtedly Zambezi\u2019s most noteworthy feature.\n\nAsia\nGANGES RIVER\n\nBangladesh and India are traversed by the Ganges River. The river is 2510 kilometers long and a notable landmark, but it is better known for its profound religious importance.\n\nThe Ganges is regarded as the most revered body of water in the world in Hindu culture and religion. In mythology, the river represents the goddess Ganga, who was the offspring of the mountain deity Himalaya.\n\nBRAHMAPUTRA RIVER\n\nChina, India, and Bangladesh are all countries that the Brahmaputra River passes through over a distance of 2,391 miles (3,848 km). It runs towards the east through the Tibet Autonomous Region of China from its source in the mountains then into India. The stream drains into the Bay of Bengal from that location. It travels across Bangladesh and Assam during that time.\n\nAlso read:\u00a0Transboundary rivers of India\n\nINDUS RIVER\n\nNext on the list is the Indus River, which flows across China, India, and Pakistan for a distance of 2,243 miles (3,610 km). It has twenty significant tributaries and is the largest and most important river in Pakistan. It originates in the Tibetan plateau, close to Lake Mansarovar and the Himalayas, flows through the Indian provinces of Jammu and Kashmir, and then across all of Pakistan before emptying into the Arabian Sea, a branch of the Indian Ocean.\n\nAlso Read: Indus Valley Civilization, Indus River and Tributaries, Major River systems in India\n\nYELLOW RIVER\n\nThis huge river, which has a length of\u00a0 5464 Km also known as the Huang He, is named after the color of its water. The color is caused by massive amounts of loose debris. Its basin is considered the birthplace of ancient Chinese civilization. It has enormous symbolic and practical significance for the country.\n\nMEKONG RIVER\n\nIt stretches about 5,000 kilometers from its source on the Tibetan Plateau to the Mekong Delta. The longest river in Southeast Asia and the seventh longest in all of Asia is this transboundary river. The river, which is known by several names, flows through six Asian nations: China, Vietnam, Laos, Myanmar, Thailand, and Cambodia.\n\n65 million people are living in the Mekong Basin, 80 percent of whom reside in the lower basin. With over 20,000 plants and 800 different species of fish, the river is likewise incredibly diverse.\n\nIRRAWADDY RIVER\n\nMyanmar is traversed by the Irrawaddy River, which runs from north to south. At a length of 1,348 miles, it is both the longest river in the nation and the most significant body of water for commerce. The Irrawaddy River rises at the meeting of the Rivers N\u2019mal and Mali. It travels southward before draining into the Andean Sea through the Irrawaddy Delta. A region of about 255,000 square kilometers is drained by the river.\n\nThe Irrawaddy River is home to a variety of creatures, including 43 different species of fish. The river provides water for rice irrigation and is a significant means of export and import transit. Notwithstanding the concern expressed by environmentalists, work is still being done along the river to build seven hydroelectric dams.\n\nSALWEEN RIVER\n\nA 1,491-mile-long river called the Salween originates in the Tibetan Plateau. It enters the Andaman Sea in Southeast Asia after passing through three nations. It drains a 320,000-square-kilometre watershed that is spread throughout China, Myanmar, and Thailand.\n\nAlmost 7 million people live along the Salween, one of the longest free-flowing rivers in the world, and are spread across 13 different ethnic groups. Moreover, the river is home to 25% of all animal species in the world, as well as 140 fish species and 7000 plant species. UNESCO rates the upper section of the river, which is in China, as the most biodiverse temperate ecosystem on Earth.\n\nYANGTZE RIVER\n\nThe Yangtze River is the third-longest river in the world and the longest river in the world to run entirely within one nation. It has a length of 6300 Km. Moreover, it is Asia\u2019s longest river. One-third of China\u2019s population is residing in the Yangtze River basin. The Chinese government has long believed that the river\u2019s source is the Tuotuo tributary in the Tanggula Mountains.\n\nRecently it is indicated that the headwaters of the Dam Qu tributary are located on Jari Hill, which is where the Yangtze River\u2019s source lies. The Yangtze River, which drains into the East China Sea at Shanghai, is formed when these and other tributaries come together.\n\nYENISEI RIVER\n\nThe Yenisei River originates in Mongolia and travels north before emptying into the Kara Sea in the Arctic Ocean via the Yenisei Gulf. Along the way, it drains a sizable portion of Siberia. The Yenisei begins in the Russian city of Kryzyl at the meeting of its headstreams, By-Khem (rising in the Eastern Sayan Mountains) and Ka-Khem (rising in Mongolia).\n\nIt then runs for 3,487 kilometers until finally draining into the Kara Sea. One of the main Yenisei headwater tributaries, the Angara River drains Lake Baikal. It enters the Yenisei near Strelka in Russia after leaving Lake Baikal.\n\nRIVER IRTYSH\n\nThe main tributary of the Ob River, the Irtysh River, has its origins in the glaciers of the Altai mountains in the Chinese region of Xinjiang, which is close to Mongolia. It eventually meets the Ob near Khanty-Mansiysk, western Siberia, Russia, and flows northwest into Kazakhstan before emptying into the Arctic Ocean.\n\nThe river\u2019s whole course spans around 4,248 km. Along with its banks, there are several significant cities in China, Kazakhstan, and Russia. The river is a crucial conduit for the movement of people and goods throughout the nations through which it flows.\n\nURAL\u00a0 RIVER\n\nThe Ural River is a 2,428 km long river that flows through Russia and Kazakhstan along the continental divide between Europe and Asia. It is also known as the Zhayyq River in the local Kazakh language. The Caspian Sea, the most enormous inland sea in the world and located between Europe and Asia, is where the river drains after its source in Russia\u2019s Ural Mountains near Mount Kruglaya.\n\nThe digitate delta, or tree-like structure, of the Ural River, which is visible as it enters the Caspian Sea, is a notable characteristic of the river. The words \u201cEurope\u201d and \u201cAsia\u201d are engraved into permanent monuments that are placed on either side of the Ural River bridge in Orenburg, Russia.\n\nLENA RIVER\n\nThe Lena River spans the entirety of Russia\u2019s boundaries and is 2,668 kilometers long. It can be found in the north, where there is a wealth of wildlife and natural resources, including gold. The river originates in the Baikal range, just to the east of the actual Baikal Lake, and travels primarily through the Russian Republic of Sakha before finally joining the Yenisei River and making a vast arc up to the Laptev Sea, which is a part of the Arctic Ocean, where it empties.\n\nRIVER AMUR\n\nThe Heilong Jiang, commonly known as the Amur River, is the tenth-longest river in the world. It forms the border between northeastern China and Russia. It has a length of\u00a0 4480 \u00a0Km. The word Amur is thought to have originated from a term meaning \u201cwater\u201d. The Chinese word Heilong Jiang translates to \u201cblack dragon river.\u201d\n\nOB-IRTYSH\n\nThe Ob-Irtysh also referred to as the Ob River, is one of the three major Siberian rivers, together with the Yenisei and the Lena. It starts in the Altas Mountains and empties into the Arctic Ocean. It has a length of\u00a0 5410 \u00a0Km.\n\nRIVER EUPHRATES\n\nThe Euphrates River, which spans over 2,800 km, is regarded as Western Asia\u2019s longest river. The river rises in the Armenian Highlands in southeast Turkey. It flows through Syria and Iraq to meet the Tigris River and eventually empties into the Persian Gulf.\n\nRIVER TIGRIS\n\nIt was one of the primary water sources that helped Mesopotamia and other ancient cultures develop. The Tigris River, which flows 1,750 km from its source in the Armenian Highlands to its mouth in the Persian Gulf, is Western Asia\u2019s second-largest river after the Euphrates River.\n\nThe Tigris River drains an area of around 375,000 square kilometers and passes through Turkey, Syria, and Iraq (including Iran). Nearly the whole length, the Tigris River and Euphrates River are parallel.\n\nEurope\nDANUBE RIVER\n\nIt is one of the s most important shipping lanes in Europe. It plays a key factor in the settlement patterns and political development of Central and South-Eastern Europe. It originates at the meeting of the Brigach and Breg rivers, close to the German town of Donaueschingen, in the Black Forest region of Germany.\n\nIt flows for 2,850 kilometers. Germany, Austria, Hungary, Serbia, Bulgaria, Croatia, Slovakia, Moldova, Ukraine, and Romania are among the ten European countries that the river flows through. Ultimately, the Danube River empties into the Black Sea through the Danube Delta.\n\nIt is referred to as Donau in Germany and Austria; known as Dunaj in Slovakia and Ukraine, Dun\u0103rea in Romania, Dunav in Croatia, Serbia, and Bulgaria, and Duna in Hungary. Many cultural artifacts, including Greek myths, Romanian melodies, and even contemporary novels, memorialize its importance.\n\nRIVER ODER\n\nThe Oder River is the second-longest river in Poland, measuring roughly 840 km. Its source is in the rocky highlands of the eastern Czech Republic. It runs through Poland\u2019s western region before forming a boundary with Germany. The Peene, Wina, and Dziwna branches all drain into the Baltic Sea, while the river\u2019s main branch empties into the Szczecin Lagoon.\n\nDNIEPER RIVER\n\nThe Dnieper River is the fourth-longest in Europe with a length of around 2,200 km. It comes from the Valdai Hills, which are close to the city of Smolensk in Russia. More than 32,000 tributaries of the Dnieper River are thought to exist. Berezina, Bilozerka, Drut, Desna, Prypiat, Sozh, Myareya, Samara, Sula, and Vyazma are a few of its tributaries.\n\nRIVER VOLGA\n\nThe Volga River is the main river in western Russia. It extends 3,530 kilometers from its source in the Valdai Hills to the Caspian Sea, the biggest inland body of water in the world. It encompasses a significant portion of the Volga area. A little more than half of Russia\u2019s population resides in the Volga River Basin.\n\nFour of the ten largest cities in Russia are located along the river\u2019s full course. One of the greatest rivers in the world due to its historical, cultural, and economic significance. In the past, the Eurasian Civilization came together near the Volga River. It also has some of the biggest reservoirs in the world and provides a significant portion of the direct and indirect livelihood for millions of people.\n\nELBE RIVER\n\nThe Elbe River is 1,112 kilometers long. It has its beginnings in the southern Krkonose Mountains, which are close to the border between Poland and the Czech Republic. Following Bohemia in the northwest of the Czech Republic, it runs past Germany\u2019s eastern border and into the North Sea close to the town of Cuxhaven. Saale, Mulde, Ohre, Vltava, Schwarze Elster, Havel, and Alster are a few of the important Elbe River tributaries.\n\nRIVER RHINE\n\nWith a length of almost 1,230 kilometers from its source in Switzerland to its mouth on the North Sea in the Netherlands, the Rhine River is the eleventh-longest in Europe. This transboundary river travels through six nations\u2014Switzerland, Germany, Austria, Liechtenstein, Germany, and the Netherlands. It drains an area of around 185,000 square kilometers.\n\nThe Rhine Basin also drains sections of France, Italy, and Belgium. One of Europe\u2019s most significant rivers in terms of history, culture, and economy is the Rhine. Over 20% of the world\u2019s chemical industry is manufactured near the river, which helps industrial transportation and output. The Rhine and the Danube together formed the northern inland border of the Roman Empire.\n\nRHONE RIVER\n\nThe Rhone River begins in the Rhone glacier of the Swiss mountains. It has a length of around 813 kilometers. This swiftly moving river enters Lake Geneva at its eastern end before running through the southeast of France on its way south. The Rhone River splits into the Big Rhone and Little Rhone near the French city of Arles before emptying into the Mediterranean Sea.\n\nTHAMES RIVER\n\nThe River Thames is a 346 km river that originates at Thames\u2019s head in the Cotswold Hills in the county of Gloucestershire. It flows across southern England. After the River Severn, it is the second-longest river in the United Kingdom and the longest in England. The river runs into the North Sea via the Thames Estuary after passing through several well-known cities, including London, Reading, Hendley-on-Thomas, Windsor, and Oxford, where it is also known as the Isis River.\n\nDON RIVER\n\nThe Don River is the fifth-longest in Europe with a length of roughly 1,870 kilometres. Then, when it approaches the Volga River, it runs in a southeasterly direction until abruptly turning west to enter the Gulf of Taganrog in the Sea of Azov. Chir, Seversky Donets, Chyornaya Kalitva, Krasivaya Mecha, Khopyor, and Medveditsa are a few of the Don River\u2019s tributaries. The Don River and the Volga River are connected by the Lenin Volga-Don Shipping Canal.\n\nNorth America\nRIVER MISSISSIPPI\n\nThe Mississippi, Missouri, and Jefferson rivers combine to form the world\u2019s fourth-longest river system. It has a length of\u00a0 6275 Km. The river system drains 31 US states as well as two Canadian provinces.\n\nThe Mississippi River runs into the Gulf of Mexico from northern Minnesota. Lake Itasca is regarded to be its source. We get the Mississippi-Missouri-Jefferson River system when we regard the Jefferson River as the Mississippi River\u2019s farthest source.\n\nAlso Read: Major Landforms \u2013 Mountains, Plateaus, and Plains: Learn faster \u2013 ClearIAS\n\nSAINT LAWRENCE RIVER\n\nIts discharge originates in Lake Ontario and empties into the Atlantic Ocean near the Southeast coast of Canada\u2019s main continent. The St. Lawrence Seaway, which stretches for approximately 4,000 kilometers (or 2,500 miles), includes the river, which is 1,197 kilometers (744 miles) long. The river was once a basin filled with glaciers that grew larger as the ice flowed away.\n\nMACKENZIE RIVER\n\nThe Mackenzie River system is found in North America. It is also the biggest and longest river basin in Canada. From its headwaters in the Finlay River to its drainage into the Beaufort Sea in the Arctic Ocean, the Mackenzie River system travels 4,241 kilometers. Together, the Mackenzie and its tributaries drain a region that makes up nearly 20% of all of Canada\u2019s land.\n\nMany of the Mackenzie River\u2019s tributaries extend into neighboring Canadian provinces including British Columbia, Saskatchewan, Alberta, and Yukon, even though the Mackenzie River itself fully runs within the Northwest Territories of Canada. The Peace, Athabasca, and Liard Rivers are a few of the Mackenzie River\u2019s most significant tributaries. The Lake Athabasca, Great Slave, and Great Bear Lakes are only a few of the lakes that are significant components of the Mackenzie River system.\n\nMISSOURI RIVER\n\nA major tributary of the Mississippi River in the United States.\n\nCOLORADO RIVER\n\nFlows through the southwestern United States and northern Mexico, known for the Grand Canyon.\n\nSouth America\nAMAZON RIVER\n\nIn terms of total water flow volume, the Amazon River is without a doubt the largest in the world. It has a length of 6575\u00a0 Km. Its claims to be the second-longest river in the world, however, is widely contested because Egypt\u2019s Nile River has long held the title. The debate on the origins of the Amazon is the source of the dispute. The Cordillera Rumi Cruz is where the Amazon started, claims a 2014 study.\n\nPARANA RIVER\n\nOne of the world\u2019s longest rivers with a length of 4880 Km. The Parana River is found in South America. The Tupi word para the on\u00e1va, which means \u201clike the sea,\u201d is the source of its name.\n\nORINOCO RIVER\n\nIn South America, the Orinoco River passes through Colombia and Venezuela. In terms of the volume of discharge, it is ranked as the fourth-largest river in the world. Its 1,330-mile length makes it one of South America\u2019s longest rivers.\n\nMADEIRA RIVER\n\nOne of the principal rivers of South America, the 2,100-mile-long Madeira River flows between Bolivia and Brazil. It is one of the largest and most important tributaries of the Amazon River. The Portuguese referred to it as \u201cMadeira,\u201d which translates to \u201cWood River,\u201d but its previous name was the Cuyari River.\n\nThe Madeira is created by the confluence of the Mamore and Madre de Dios rivers. This river overflows during the rainy season, rising to a height of 50 feet and submerging the forests on its sides. From arider to more humid, its climate varies as it moves from region to region. After entering the lower plains, the Madeira River empties into the Abuna River.\n\nAustralia\nMURRAY RIVER\n\nAustralia\u2019s longest river, the Murray, flows through the southeast of the nation. It travels through New South Wales, Victoria, and South Australia and is 2508 kilometers long. Almost 1.5 million homes in Australia receive their water from this river, which is also used to irrigate nearby fields.\n\nDARLING RIVER\n\nA major tributary of the Murray-Darling system.\n\nConclusion\n\nThe culture of most places of the world is heavily influenced by the larger rivers that they depend on for food and transportation. The majority of the riverside towns and villages have a robust boat industry and travel hundreds of kilometers for fishing and cargo transportation.\n\nSome communities regard certain portions of these rivers as sacred, and only specific methods may be used to access these areas. Fish, reptiles, and huge mammals are just a few of the diverse plants and animals that may be found in the world\u2019s rivers.\n\nThe melting of glaciers will likely be accelerated by climate change and the resulting temperature rises, which will initially increase water levels but ultimately result in decreased river discharge.\n\nThe water quality in many major rivers of the world has already deteriorated to dangerous levels as a result of heavy home, industrial, and agricultural waste pollution. Rapid economic growth and urbanization have contributed to some of this, thus pollution is expected to persist unabatedly.\n\nArticle Written By: Atheena Fathima Riyas",

Read the article to get an in-depth understanding.\n\nAlthough India has a monsoon climate, regional variations exist due to different weather elements. These variations create subtypes of the monsoon climate, forming the basis for identifying climatic regions.\n\nEach climatic region has a homogeneous climatic condition resulting from a combination of factors, with temperature and rainfall being decisive factors in all classification schemes. The classification of climate is a complex exercise, with various methods available.\n\nTable of Contents\n\nStamp\u2019s Classification of Climatic Regions\nStamp\u2019s Classification of the Climatic Regions of India\n(A) Temperate India\n(B) Tropical India\nK\u00f6ppen Classification of Climatic Regions\nGroup A: Tropical Humid Climates\nGroup B: Dry Climates\nGroup C: Warm Temperate (Mid-Latitude) Climates\nGroup D: Continental Climates\nGroup E: Polar Climates\nGroup H: Highland Climates\nK\u00f6ppen Classification of Climatic Regions of India\nConclusion\nStamp\u2019s Classification of Climatic Regions\n\nThe Dudley Stamp climate classification is an alternative climate classification system developed by British geographer and climatologist, Laurence Dudley Stamp.\n\nThis classification system is designed to emphasize the climatic factors most relevant to human settlement and land use. It differs from other climate classification systems, such as the K\u00f6ppen classification, by focusing more on the practical implications of climate for human activities.\n\nThe Dudley Stamp climate classification system includes five main climate groups, which are further divided into subtypes:\n\nArid Climates (A):\n\nA1: Hot desert climate with high evaporation rates (similar to BWh in K\u00f6ppen).\nA2: Cool desert climate with lower evaporation rates (similar to BWk in K\u00f6ppen).\n\nTemperate Climates (B):\n\nB1: Warm-summer Mediterranean climate (similar to Csa in K\u00f6ppen).\nB2: Warm-summer continental climate (similar to Dfa, Dfb in K\u00f6ppen).\nB3: Cool-summer continental climate (similar to Dfc, Dfd in K\u00f6ppen).\n\nSnow Climates (C):\n\nC1: Maritime snow climate (similar to Cfb, Cfc in K\u00f6ppen).\nC2: Continental snow climate (similar to Dfb, Dfc, and Dfd in K\u00f6ppen).\n\nPolar Climates (D):\n\nD1: Tundra climate (similar to ET in K\u00f6ppen).\nD2: Ice cap climate (similar to EF in K\u00f6ppen).\n\nHumid Climates (E):\n\nE1: Hot humid climate (similar to Af in K\u00f6ppen).\nE2: Warm humid climate (similar to Am, Aw in K\u00f6ppen).\nE3: Cool humid climate (similar to Cfa, Cwa in K\u00f6ppen).\nStamp\u2019s Classification of the Climatic Regions of India\n\n\ud83d\udc49 Which year are YOU targeting for success in the IAS/IPS/IFS Exam? \ud83d\ude80\n\n(1) \u21d2 UPSC 2025: Prelims cum Mains\n\n(2) \u21d2 UPSC 2026: Prelims cum Mains\n\n(3) \u21d2 UPSC 2027 Prelims cum Mains\n\nTip: Know more about ClearIAS Courses (Online/Offline)\n\nL. Dudley Stamp and Kendrew shared similar views on the classification of India\u2019s climate.\n\nThey divided the country into two primary regions, based on the Tropic of Cancer.\nThis line roughly follows the 18\u00b0C isotherm of mean monthly temperature in January.\nThe northern part of this line is referred to as Temperate India, while the southern part is known as Tropical India.\nBoth of these central climatic regions are further divided into eleven sub-regions based on the amount of rainfall and temperature.\n\nWhile this classification is considered rational and reasonable, it is also subjective to a certain degree.\n\n(A) Temperate India\n\nThis region is alternatively known as continental India, where the temperature in January does not exceed 18\u00b0C. It is further divided into five sub-regions based on the amount of rainfall and the physical characteristics of the area.\n\nHimalayan Region\nNorth-West Region\nDry Desert Region\nModerate Rainfall Region\nThe Transitional Region\n(B) Tropical India\n\nThis region is located south of the Tropic of Cancer, where the temperature in January exceeds 18\u00b0C. The isotherm line for this region does not strictly follow the Tropic of Cancer line. It is divided into six sub-divisions based on various factors.\n\nVery Heavy Rainfall Region\nHeavy Rainfall Region\nModerate Rainfall Region\nThe Konkan Coast Region\nThe Malabar Coast Region\nThe Coastal Region of Tamilnadu\nK\u00f6ppen Classification of Climatic Regions\n\nThe K\u00f6ppen climate classification is a widely used system for classifying the world\u2019s climates. It was developed by Wladimir K\u00f6ppen, a German botanist and climatologist, in 1884, and has been revised several times since then.\n\nThe K\u00f6ppen classification system uses average monthly temperature and precipitation data to classify climates into five primary types, four of them are based on temperature and one on precipitation: tropical, dry, temperate, continental, and polar.\nThese primary types are further divided into subtypes, and the resulting classification is based on a combination of letters and numbers that represent the different climate types and subtypes.\n\nIn the table below, the capital letters: A, C, D, and E delineate humid climates and B dry climates.\n\nThe different climatic groups are further classified into various types, denoted by small letters, based on the seasonal patterns of precipitation and temperature characteristics.\n\nThe dry seasons are indicated by the letters f, m, w, and s, where f indicates no dry season, m refers to a monsoon climate, w denotes a winter dry season, and s signifies a summer dry season.\nThe small letters a, b, c, and d are used to indicate the degree of temperature severity. In the B-Dry Climates, the subdivisions are denoted by the capital letters S for steppe or semi-arid and W for deserts, based on the level of aridity.\nGroup A: Tropical Humid Climates\n\nTropical humid climates exist between the Tropic of Cancer and the Tropic of Capricorn. The annual range of temperature is deficient and annual rainfall is high. The tropical group is divided into three types, namely:\n\nAf: Tropical Rainforest Climate \u2013 High precipitation throughout the year.\nAm: Tropical Monsoon Climate \u2013 High precipitation in the summer season.\nAw: Tropical Savanna Climate \u2013 Distinct wet and dry seasons.\nGroup B: Dry Climates\n\nDry climates are characterized by minimal rainfall that is insufficient to support the growth of plants.\n\nThese climates are widespread and cover vast latitudes between 15\u00b0 to 60\u00b0 north and south of the equator.\nThey are classified into two main types: steppe or semi-arid climate (BS) and desert climate (BW).\n\nThese classifications are further subdivided based on latitude. The subtropical regions falling between latitudes of 15\u00b0 to 35\u00b0 are classified as subtropical steppe (BSh) and subtropical desert (BWh). On the other hand, the mid-latitude regions between 35\u00b0 to 60\u00b0 are classified as mid-latitude steppe (BSk) and mid-latitude desert (BWk).\n\nBWh: Hot Desert Climate \u2013 Hot temperatures and very low rainfall.\nBWk: Cold Desert Climate \u2013 Cold winters with low rainfall.\nBSh: Hot Steppe Climate \u2013 Hot temperatures with limited rainfall.\nBSk: Cold Steppe Climate \u2013 Cold winters with limited rainfall.\nGroup C: Warm Temperate (Mid-Latitude) Climates\n\nWarm temperate (mid-latitude) climates extend from 30\u00b0 \u2013 50\u00b0 of latitude mainly on the eastern and western margins of continents. These climates generally have warm summers with mild winters. They are grouped into five subtypes:\n\nCfa: Humid Subtropical Climate \u2013 Hot summers and mild winters with rainfall throughout the year.\nCwa: Monsoon-influenced Humid Subtropical Climate \u2013 Hot summers with rainy and dry seasons.\nCfb: Marine West Coast Climate \u2013 Mild temperatures with moderate rainfall throughout the year.\nCfc: Subpolar Oceanic Climate \u2013 Cold temperatures with moderate rainfall throughout the year.\nCsa: Mediterranean Climate \u2013 Hot, dry summers and mild, wet winters.\nGroup D: Continental Climates\n\nThese climates experience distinct seasons, with cold winters and warm to hot summers. They are further divided into four subtypes:\n\nDfa: Hot Summer Continental Climate \u2013 Hot summers and cold winters.\nDfb: Warm Summer Continental Climate \u2013 Warm summers and cold winters.\nDfc: Subarctic Climate \u2013 Cold winters and cool summers.\nDfd: Extremely Cold Subarctic Climate \u2013 Very cold winters and cool summers.\nGroup E: Polar Climates\n\nPolar climates exist poleward beyond 70\u00b0 latitude. Polar climates consist of two types:\n\nET: Tundra Climate \u2013 Cold temperatures with short, cool summers.\nEF: Ice Cap Climate \u2013 Extremely cold temperatures with little to no vegetation.\nGroup H: Highland Climates\n\nThe climate in highland areas is primarily influenced by the topography of the region. In mountainous terrain, even small distances can result in significant fluctuations in mean temperature.\n\nPrecipitation types and intensity also vary across highlands in space. Additionally, there is a vertical zonation of climatic types as we move up in altitude, resulting in distinct layers of climatic conditions in the mountainous environment.\n\nK\u00f6ppen Classification of Climatic Regions of India\n\nThe K\u00f6ppen climate classification system categorizes India\u2019s diverse climate zones into several different types based on temperature, precipitation, and other climatic characteristics.\n\nIndia experiences a wide range of climate types due to its vast geographical extent and varying topography. Here are the main K\u00f6ppen climate types found in different regions of India:\n\nTropical Monsoon Climate (Am):\n\nCharacteristics: This climate is characterized by high temperatures and a distinct wet season (monsoon) with heavy rainfall. Summers are hot, and winters are relatively dry.\nDistribution: Most of India, including the western coastal areas, the northern plains, and the northeastern states, experiences a tropical monsoon climate. Cities like Mumbai, Kolkata, and Delhi fall under this category.\n\nTropical Savanna Climate (Aw):\n\nCharacteristics: This climate has distinct wet and dry seasons. Summers are hot and wet, while winters are dry and cooler.\nDistribution: Regions of India that experience the tropical savanna climate include parts of central and peninsular India, such as Hyderabad and Chennai.\n\nSubtropical Humid Climate (Cfa, Cwa):\n\nCharacteristics: Summers are hot, and winters are mild. Rainfall is well-distributed throughout the year. Cfa has a warm summer, while Cwa has a monsoon-influenced summer.\nDistribution: Cities like Delhi, Lucknow, and Kolkata fall under the subtropical humid climate.\n\nDesert Climate (BWh, BWk):\n\nCharacteristics: Hot temperatures and very low rainfall. BWk has cold winters.\nDistribution: The Thar Desert in northwestern India, including regions of Rajasthan, experiences a desert climate.\n\nMountain Climate (Cwb, Cwc, Dsb, Dsc, ET, EF):\n\nCharacteristics: These climates are found in high-altitude regions. Summers are cool, and winters are cold. Cwb and Cwc have more precipitation than Dsb and Dsc. ET represents a tundra climate, and EF represents an ice cap climate.\nDistribution: Himalayan regions of northern India, including places like Shimla, experience mountain climates.\n\nSemi-Arid and Arid Climates (BSh, BSk):\n\nCharacteristics: Hot temperatures with limited rainfall. BSh has a hot steppe climate, while BSk has a cold steppe climate.\nDistribution: Parts of northwestern and central India, including cities like Jaipur, experience semi-arid and arid climates.\n\nTropical Rainforest Climate (Af):\n\nCharacteristics: High temperatures and heavy rainfall throughout the year.\nDistribution: The Andaman and Nicobar Islands, as well as some parts of northeastern India, experience the tropical rainforest climate.\n\nMediterranean Climate (Csa):\n\nCharacteristics: Hot, dry summers and mild, wet winters.\nDistribution: A small region along the western coast of India, including parts of Maharashtra and Karnataka, experiences a Mediterranean climate.\nConclusion\n\nThe Dudley Stamp climate classification system places greater emphasis on the human aspects of climate and its impact on agriculture, settlement, and other human activities. It\u2019s particularly useful for geographers and planners interested in understanding how climate affects the practical aspects of life in different regions.\n\nThe K\u00f6ppen climate classification system provides a way to understand and categorize the world\u2019s diverse climates based on shared characteristics. It has been widely adopted by scientists, geographers, and climatologists for research and communication purposes.\n\nHowever, it\u2019s worth noting that the K\u00f6ppen climate classification remains more widely recognized and used internationally for its comprehensive categorization of global climate patterns. The Dudley Stamp classification is more specialized and may be of particular interest to researchers and professionals studying the human-environment interaction in specific regions.\n\nArticle Written By: Priti Raj",

But what do they mean, what are events related to them, and how do they influence the seasons on Earth- these are some of the in-depth questions that will be answered here. Read further to learn more.\n\nEquinoxes and solstices are radically opposing. Equinoxes and solstices are what give rise to the earth\u2019s seasons.\n\nOn account of the planet\u2019s inclination towards its axis,\u00a0as it circles the Sun, seasons fluctuate on Earth. This implies that various regions of the Earth receive more or less sunlight depending on the time of year.\n\nThe Sun would constantly appear above the Equator, the amount of light received at any given position would be constant, and there wouldn\u2019t be any seasons if the Earth weren\u2019t tilted. The equinoxes and solstices wouldn\u2019t even need to be observed.\n\nTable of Contents\n\nSolstice\nScience of Solstices\nEquinox\nScience of Equinoxes\nSolstice and Equinox: Relation to seasons\nSolstice and Equinox: Cultural significance\nSolstice\n\nA solstice is an event in which a planet\u2019s poles are most extremely inclined toward or away from the star it orbits.\n\n\ud83d\udc49 Which year are YOU targeting for success in the IAS/IPS/IFS Exam? \ud83d\ude80\n\n(1) \u21d2 UPSC 2025: Prelims cum Mains\n\n(2) \u21d2 UPSC 2026: Prelims cum Mains\n\n(3) \u21d2 UPSC 2027 Prelims cum Mains\n\nTip: Know more about ClearIAS Courses (Online/Offline)\n\nSolar declination, the latitude of Earth where the sun is directly above at noon defines solstices on our planet.\n\nThe solar declination reaches the Tropic of Cancer in the north and the Tropic of Capricorn in the south at the solstices, which occur twice a year on Earth.\nThe solar declination of the June solstice, which is observed between June 20 and June 22, is around 23.5\u00b0N (the Tropic of Cancer).\nSolar declination is around 23.5\u00b0S (the Tropic of Capricorn) during the December solstice, which is observed between December 20 and December 23.\n\nSolar declination describes the latitude of Earth where the sun is directly overhead at noon.\n\nThe Earth\u2019s 23.5\u00b0 axial tilt as it circles the sun causes solitons and varying solar declinations.\n\nThis indicates that, depending on which hemisphere is inclined towards the sun during the year, it gets the sun\u2019s rays at their strongest intensity.\n\nDespite having distinct dates in the Northern and Southern Hemispheres, the solstices are referred to as the \u201csummer solstice\u201d and the \u201cwinter solstice,\u201d respectively.\n\nThe longest day of the year is the summer solstice when the sun is at its strongest and there are the most hours of daylight.\nThe winter solstice has the fewest daylight hours and is the shortest day of the year.\nThe June solstice is the summer solstice in the Northern Hemisphere and the winter solstice in the Southern Hemisphere.\nThe December solstice is the winter solstice in the Northern Hemisphere and the summer solstice in the Southern.\n\nSolstices occur on every planet in our solar system. The planet\u2019s axial tilt, orbital eccentricity, and distance from the sun all have a significant role in determining the date and size of solstices.\n\nThe axial tilt of Venus, the planet nearest to Earth, is barely 3\u00b0. Its solstices are spaced by around three months; thus, Venus suffers relatively little seasonal fluctuation.\nOur other close neighbor, Mars, has a 24\u00b0 axial tilt, which is identical to Earth\u2019s. Mars, on the other hand, orbits the sun in an orbit that is noticeably more elliptical than Earth\u2019s because of its substantially higher orbital eccentricity. Mars has dramatic seasonal fluctuations and its solstices are spaced around 11 months apart due to its greater orbital eccentricity and axial tilt.\nScience of Solstices\n\nSubscribe to the ClearIAS YouTube Channel for more informative videos on UPSC preparation, tips, and strategies. Stay updated with our latest content and enhance your exam readiness.\n\nThe solstices are felt differently depending on the latitude of Earth. The solstice marks the maximum point of dramatic exposure to daylight at the poles while scarcely being recognized near the equator.\n\nEquatorial regions\n\nThe Equator, at 0\u00b0 latitude, receives a maximum intensity of the sun\u2019s rays all year.\nAs a result, areas near Earth\u2019s Equator experience relatively constant sunlight and little solstice variation.\n\nMidlatitudes\n\nEarth\u2019s solstices are largely marked by the transition of the subsolar point across the tropics.\n\nThe latitude where the sun\u2019s rays strike Earth perfectly perpendicular to its surface is known as the subsolar point. It is the location where the sun is above at midday.\nThe subsolar point travels north and south over the tropics for the majority of the year before appearing at the Equator twice a year (around the equinoxes).\nThe subsolar point travels to its northern and southernmost latitudes at the solstices.\nOn the June solstice, the Tropic of Cancer, which is 23.5\u00b0 north of the equator, receives direct sunlight.\nThe subsolar point then starts moving south, and on the December solstice, vertical rays fall on the Tropic of Capricorn, which is 23.5\u00b0 south of the equator.\nEvery latitude in between these two extremes will be traversed by the subsolar point twice annually.\n\nPolar regions\n\nThe Arctic and Antarctica are never reached by the subsolar point.\n\nThe solstices represent the times when the sun is highest or lowest in the sky at the North and South Poles, respectively.\nTherefore, the solstices serve as the most extreme manifestations of the \u201cmidnight sun\u201d and \u201cpolar night.\u201d\nThe phenomena around the summer solstice, when the sun is still visible at midnight in the weeks preceding and after the event, is referred to as the \u201cmidnight sun.\u201d\nThe weeks preceding and after the winter solstice are referred to as the \u201cpolar night\u201d since the sun is below the horizon.\nEquinox\n\nAn equinox is an event in which a planet\u2019s subsolar point passes through its Equator.\n\nThe equinoxes are the only time when both the Northern and Southern Hemispheres experience roughly equal amounts of daytime and nighttime.\n\nTwo equinoxes occur annually on Earth: one around March 21 and the other around September 22. Even though the spring and fall equinoxes have distinct dates in the Northern and Southern Hemispheres.\n\nThe equinoxes are occasionally referred to as the \u201cvernal equinox\u201d (spring equinox) and the \u201cautumnal equinox\u201d (fall equinox).\nIn the Northern Hemisphere, the March equinox marks the spring equinox, whereas, in the Southern Hemisphere, it marks the autumnal equinox.\nIn the Northern Hemisphere, the equinox in September is the autumnal equinox; in the Southern, it is the vernal equinox.\n\nOn most planets, equinoxes occur. The axial tilt and orbital properties of the planet dictate when the equinoxes occur.\n\nEquinoxes are very spectacular on the gas giant Saturn. The equinoxes on Saturn occur every 15 years and last for around four days.\nThe magnificent ring system of Saturn revolves in the same plane as the equator of the planet.\nThe rings span thousands of kilometers across, yet they are just a few kilometers broad, making them exceedingly thin.\nThe rings and Saturn\u2019s equator exactly align with the sun during Saturn\u2019s equinoxes. Images taken from the perspective of the sun show the rings as a fine line.\nScience of Equinoxes\n\nDuring the equinoxes, solar declination is 0\u00b0. So, equinoxes are the only times of the year when the subsolar point is directly on the Equator.\n\nThe apparent center of the Sun\u2019s disc is in the same plane as the Equator during an equinox, which prevents Earth\u2019s 23.5\u00b0 axis from tilting either towards or away from the Sun.\n\nThe subsolar point moves north or south both before and after the equinox.\n\nThe subsolar point moves northward after the March equinox when the Northern Hemisphere tilts towards the sun.\nThe subsolar point crosses the Tropic of Cancer (23.5\u00b0N) around June 21.\nThe subsolar point starts to move southward after this June solstice.\nThe subsolar point keeps moving south after the September equinox as the Southern Hemisphere tilts towards the sun.\nThe subsolar point crosses the Tropic of Capricorn (23.5\u00b0S) around December 21 which is the December solstice.\n\nThe sun terminator equally divides the Earth from north to south at an equinox, indicating equally lighted hemispheres.\n\nOn a globe, the darkened line denoting day and night is known as the solar terminator.\nThere would be 12 hours of day and night on an actual equinox.\n\nEquatorial regions\n\nThe sun\u2019s rays are at their strongest all year round in the Equator, which is located at 0\u00b0 latitude.\nAs a result, there is little equinoctial oscillation and generally consistent sunshine in regions close to the equator.\nIn general, equinoxes and celestial seasons have less of an effect than climate-driven patterns like precipitation (rainy seasons and dry seasons).\n\nMidlatitudes\n\nWith latitude, seasonal fluctuation gets more extreme. The difference between the lengths of day and night during the \u201cequinox\u201d is significantly widened by atmospheric refraction.\nThe day lasts roughly eight minutes longer than the night at a latitude of around 30\u00b0.\n\nPolar regions\n\nIn the Arctic and Antarctic, where atmospheric refraction is most pronounced, the length of the day is approximately 12 hours, 16 minutes.\nThe equinoxes in polar locations thus serve as a signal for the gradual transition from \u201cmidnight sun\u201d to \u201cpolar night.\u201d\nThe phenomenon known as the \u201cmidnight sun\u201d occurs when the sun never sets below the horizon, illuminating the area all day long.\nIn contrast, \u201cpolar night\u201d refers to a period when the sun never rises, putting the area in complete darkness for 24 hours.\nSolstice and Equinox: Relation to seasons\n\nWe all know that the Earth follows an elliptical orbit around the sun, doing a full rotation once every 365 days.\n\nThis implies that the average distance of 93 million miles between the Earth and the Sun fluctuates during the year.\nThe Earth travels around 1.6 million miles closer to the sun during the first week of January. The perihelion is used to describe this.\nThe first week of July marks the aphelion, or the moment at which the Earth is approximately 1.6 million miles further from the sun.\n\nAlthough this information may seem to contradict what we know about seasons in the Northern Hemisphere, the climatic difference is not that big and is NOT the cause of our seasons.\n\nThe Earth\u2019s 23.5\u00b0 tilt on its axis is what causes the seasons. The Northern Hemisphere has tilted away from the sun in December and towards the sun in June because the tilt\u2019s position about space remains constant throughout the year.\n\nThe solstices and equinoxes mark the beginning and end of each season on Earth.\n\nSolstice and Equinox: Cultural significance\n\nThe solstices currently signal the start of winter and summer, but in certain ancient societies, these were the only seasons acknowledged (autumn and spring were not there). As a result, the solstices took place in the middle of the seasons.\n\nDue to this, the solstices are sometimes referred to as midwinter and midsummer.\nNumerous civilizations have celebrated the solstices with celebrations and festivals since ancient times.\n\nLike the solstices, equinoxes are historic markers of seasonal change.\n\nThe March equinox is historically recognized as a time of rebirth and regeneration since it unofficially ushers in the spring season. Because of this, the March equinox has traditionally been observed by many civilizations as the start of a new year.\nThe majority of September equinox-related cultural celebrations are linked to harvest festivities in the fall.\n\nRead:\u00a0Leap year: How does it work?\n\n-Article by Swathi Satish",

Hence, under the rapidly depleting groundwater table, water harvesting is an ideal solution. Read here to learn more about rainwater harvesting.\n\nIndia possesses 4% of the world\u2019s water resources and makes up around 2.45% of its surface area.\n\nRainfall serves as India\u2019s main supply of freshwater. India receives the second-highest quantity of rainfall for a nation its size.\n\nThe average annual rainfall in India is 1,170 millimeters (46 in), or over 4,000 cubic kilometers (960 cubic miles) of water. This translates to about 1,720 cubic meters (61,000 cu feet) of freshwater per person.\n\nFor most places in India, groundwater is the main source of water supply, and the country\u2019s rapidly declining groundwater resources demand immediate attention if water security is to be ensured in the upcoming years.\n\nAlso read: Aravalli Green Wall Project\n\nTable of Contents\n\n\ud83d\udc49 Which year are YOU targeting for success in the IAS/IPS/IFS Exam? \ud83d\ude80\n\n(1) \u21d2 UPSC 2025: Prelims cum Mains\n\n(2) \u21d2 UPSC 2026: Prelims cum Mains\n\n(3) \u21d2 UPSC 2027 Prelims cum Mains\n\nTip: Know more about ClearIAS Courses (Online/Offline)\n\nRainwater harvesting\nTraditional water harvesting systems in India\nGovernment policies for Rainwater harvesting\nWay forward\nRainwater harvesting\n\nThe act of collecting and storing rainwater as opposed to letting it flow off is known as rainwater harvesting.\n\nRainwater is gathered from a surface like a roof and directed to a container with percolation, such as a tank, cistern, deep pit (well, shaft, or borehole), aquifer, or reservoir where it seeps down and replenishes the groundwater table.\n\nThe rainwater harvesting process includes the collection and storage of collected rainwater with the help of artificially designed systems.\n\nThe main components of the system are-\n\nCatchment: Used to collect and store the captured rainwater.\nConveyance system: It is used to transport the harvested water from the catchment to the recharge zone.\nFlush: It is used to flush out the first spell of rain.\nFilter: Used for filtering the collected rainwater and removing pollutants.\nTanks and recharge structures: Used to store the filtered water which is ready to use.\n\nRainwater harvesting has significance in solving other related issues in a nation like food security, rapid urbanization, and industrial developmental demands. This method acts as a decentralized source of water for all needs.\n\nTraditional water harvesting systems in India\n\nWater has been harvested in India since antiquity, with our ancestors perfecting the art of water management. The raindrops were harvested directly from rooftops collected water and stored in tanks built in their courtyards.\n\nFrom open community lands, the rain was collected and stored in artificial wells.\nThe monsoon runoff was harvested by capturing water from swollen streams during the monsoon season and storing it through various forms of water bodies.\nThe water was also harvested from flooded rivers.\n\nPaar system: Paar is a common water harvesting practice in the western Rajasthan region.\n\nIt is a common place where the rainwater flows from the agar (catchment) and in the process percolates into the sandy soil.\nTo access the Rajani pani (percolated water) kuis or beris are dug in the agor (storage area).\n\nTalan/bandhis: Talabs are reservoirs.\n\nThey may be natural, such as the ponds (pokhariyan) at Tikamgarh in the Bundelkhand region.\nThey can be human-made, such as the lakes in Udaipur.\nA reservoir area of fewer than five bighas is called a talai; a medium-sized lake is called a bandhi or talab; bigger lakes are called sagar or samand.\nThe pokhariyan serves irrigation and drinking purposes. When the water in these reservoirs dries up just a few days after the monsoon, the pond beds are cultivated with rice.\n\nSaza kuva: An open well with multiple owners (saza means partner), saza kuva is the most important source of irrigation in the Aravalli hills in Mewar, eastern Rajasthan.\n\nThe soil dug out to make the well pit is used to construct a huge circular foundation or an elevated platform sloping away from the well.\nThe first is built to accommodate the rehat, a traditional water lifting device; the sloping platform is for the chada, in which buffaloes are used to lift water.\n\nJohads: Johads are small earthen check dams that capture and conserve rainwater, improving percolation and groundwater recharge.\n\nStarting in 1984, the last sixteen years have seen the revival of some 3000 johads spread across more than 650 villages in the Alwar district, Rajasthan.\nThis has resulted in a general rise of the groundwater level by almost 6 meters and a 33 percent increase in the forest cover in the area.\n\nPat: Bhitada village, Jhabua district of Madhya Pradesh developed the unique pat system.\n\nThis system was devised according to the particularities of the terrain to divert water from swift-flowing hill streams into irrigation channels called pats.\n\nJhalaras: Jhalaras are typically rectangular-shaped step-wells that have tiered steps on three or four sides.\n\nThese step-wells collect the subterranean seepage of an upstream reservoir or a lake.\nJhalaras were built to ensure an easy and regular supply of water for religious rites, royal ceremonies, and community use.\nThe city of Jodhpur has eight jhalaras, the oldest being the Mahamandir Jhalara which dates back to 1660 CE.\n\nBawari: Bawaris are unique step-wells that were once a part of the ancient networks of water storage in the cities of Rajasthan.\n\nThe little rain that the region received would be diverted to man-made tanks through canals built on the hilly outskirts of cities.\nThe water would then percolate into the ground, raising the water table and recharging a deep and intricate network of aquifers.\nTo minimize water loss through evaporation, a series of layered steps were built around the reservoirs to narrow and deepen the wells.\n\nTaanka: Taanka is a traditional rainwater harvesting technique indigenous to the Thar desert region of Rajasthan.\n\nA Taanka is a cylindrical paved underground pit into which rainwater from rooftops, courtyards or artificially prepared catchments flows.\n\nAhar Pynes: Ahar Pynes are traditional floodwater harvesting systems native to South Bihar.\n\nAhars are reservoirs with embankments on three sides that are built at the end of diversion channels like pynes.\nPynes are artificial rivulets led off from rivers to collect water in the ahars for irrigation in the dry months.\nPaddy cultivation in this relatively low rainfall area depends mostly on ahar pynes.\n\nPanam keni: The Kuruma tribe (a native tribe of Wayanad) uses a special type of well, called the Panam keni, to store water.\n\nWooden cylinders are made by soaking the stems of toddy palms in water for a long time so that the core rots away until only the hard outer layer remains.\n\nKhadin: Khadins are ingenious constructions designed to harvest surface runoff water for agriculture.\n\nThe main feature of a khadin, also called dhora, is a long earthen embankment that is built across the hill slopes of gravelly uplands.\nSluices and spillways allow the excess water to drain off and the water-saturated land is then used for crop production.\nFirst designed by the Paliwal Brahmins of Jaisalmer in the 15th century, this system is very similar to the irrigation methods of the people of ancient Ur (present Iraq).\n\nKund: A kund is a saucer-shaped catchment area that gently slopes towards the central circular underground well. Its main purpose is to harvest rainwater for drinking.\n\nKunds dot the sandier tracts of western Rajasthan and Gujarat. Traditionally, these well-pits were covered in disinfectant lime and ash.\nRaja Sur Singh is said to have built the earliest known kunds in the village of Vadi Ka Melan in the year 1607 CE.\n\nBaoli: These were built by the nobility for civic, strategic, or philanthropic reasons, baolis were secular structures from which everyone could draw water.\n\nThese beautiful stepwells typically have beautiful arches, carved motifs, and sometimes, rooms on their sides.\nBaolis within villages were mainly used for utilitarian purposes and social gatherings.\nBaolis on trade routes were often frequented as resting places.\nStepwells used exclusively for agriculture had drainage systems that channeled water into the fields.\n\nNadi: These are village ponds that store rainwater collected from adjoining natural catchment areas. These are found near Jodhpur in Rajasthan.\n\nZings: These are found in Ladakh. They are small tanks that collect melting glacier water.\n\nA network of guiding channels brings water from the glacier to the tank. The melting waters of the glacier are article in the mornings and turn into a flowing stream by the afternoon.\nThe water, collected by evening, is used in the fields on the following day.\nA water official called a Chirpun is responsible for the equitable distribution of water in this dry region that relies on melting glacial water to meet its farming needs.\n\nKuhls: Kuhls are surface water channels found in the mountainous regions of Himachal Pradesh.\n\nThe channels carry glacial waters from rivers and streams into the fields.\nThe Kangra Valley system has an estimated 715 major Kuhls and 2,500 minor kuhls that irrigate more than 30,000 hectares in the valley.\nKulhs are an important cultural tradition and were built either through public donations or by royal rulers.\n\nZabo: It means \u2018impounding run-off\u201d. This system combines water conservation with forestry, agriculture, and animal care.\n\nPracticed in Nagaland, Zabo is also known as the Ruza system.\nRainwater that falls on forested hilltops is collected by channels that deposit the run-off water in pond-like structures created on the terraced hillsides.\n\nEri: It is a tank system used in Tamil Nadu which is one of the oldest water management systems in India.\n\nGovernment policies for Rainwater harvesting\n\nCentral Government has formulated National Water Policy 2012 which inter alia contains provisions for rainwater harvesting like:\n\nincentivizing the revival of traditional water harvesting structures by States,\nencouraging rainwater harvesting to increase the availability of utilizable water in urban and industrial areas,\npreference to urban and rural domestic water supply from surface water in conjunction with groundwater and rainwater, etc.\n\nWater being a State subject, steps for augmentation, conservation, and efficient management of water resources are primarily undertaken by the respective State Governments.\n\nSome of the major steps taken by the Government of India for rainwater harvesting are as follows:\n\nJal Shakti Abhiyan: This was expanded as \u201cJal Shakti Abhiyan: Catch the Rain\u201d (JSA: CTR) in 2021 with the theme \u201cCatch the Rain Where it Falls When it Falls\u201d to cover all the blocks of all districts (rural as well as urban areas) across the country.\n\nAtal Bhuj Yojana: It is a Central Sector Scheme with an outlay of Rs. 6,000 crores in identified water-stressed areas of 8,220 Gram Panchayats (GPs) under 229 blocks in 80 districts of 7 States viz. Gujarat, Haryana, Karnataka, Madhya Pradesh, Maharashtra, Rajasthan, and Uttar Pradesh to arrest the decline in groundwater level through community-led sustainable groundwater management.\n\nWatershed Development Component of Pradhan Mantri Krishi Sinchayee Yojana (WDC-PMKSY) has got rainwater harvesting as one of the activities under its Natural Resource Management (NRM) component.\n\nSurface Minor Irrigation (SMI) and Repair, Renovation & Restoration (RRR) of Water Bodies have multiple objectives expanding the cultivable area under assured irrigation by improvement and restoration of water bodies inter alia increasing groundwater recharge and revival of lost irrigation potential.\n\nMaster Plan for Artificial Recharge to Groundwater- 2020 has been prepared by Central Ground Water Board in consultation with States/UTs which is a macro-level plan indicating various structures for the different terrain conditions of the country.\n\nAtal Mission for Rejuvenation and Urban Transformation (AMRUT) was launched in 2015 and focuses on the development of basic urban infrastructure especially water supply & access to tap connection to every household in 500 cities.\n\nMahatma Gandhi National Rural Employment Guarantee Scheme (MGNREGS) includes water conservation and water harvesting structures as one of the activities under its natural resource management (NRM) component.\n\nMission Amrit Sarovar was launched on National Panchayati Raj Day on 24th April 2022 as a part of the celebration of Azadi ka Amrit Mahotsav to conserve water for the future. The Mission is aimed at developing and rejuvenating 75 water bodies in each district of the country\n\nWay forward\n\nTo replenish India\u2019s depleting water supplies, it is urgent to encourage rainwater harvesting utilizing a combination of ancient rainfall-saving techniques including percolation tanks, injection wells, and subsurface barriers with modern rainwater-saving methods.\n\nBut relying just on conventional techniques is insufficient. The solution to India\u2019s ongoing water problems may be found in the effective combination of these techniques.\n\nIt is necessary to intensify efforts to lessen reliance on groundwater with a focus on improving water security.\n\nRejuvenation and replenishment of built-up and natural water bodies.\nincreased repurposing of cleaned wastewater by neighborhood sewage treatment facilities.\nAcross both residential and business locations, install properly constructed rainwater collection systems.\nGovernments at the federal and state levels must work together to enable these initiatives.\nFor long-term and sustainable solutions, strict policy actions are required.\nLocal government entities must propose and carry out an integrated water management strategy.\n\n-Article written by Swathi Satish",

As it descends, the snow accelerates, creating a river of snow and an ice cloud that rises far into the air.\n\nAs it rushes downward, the mass scoops up even more snow. The weight of a massive, fully-grown avalanche can reach one million tonnes.

It erupts from the starting zone.\n\nThat area of the stope is often the most unstable and is located higher up the mountain.\nThe avalanche follows its natural route downhill after it begins to slide, continuing along the avalanche track. Large clearings or tree chutes missing from an avalanche offer hints as to the route of the slide.\nThe runout zone, where snow and debris accumulate, is where the avalanche eventually comes to an end.\nTypes\n\nAvalanches come in a variety of forms, including-\n\nRock avalanches are made up of enormous chunks of broken rock. These are also known as landslides.\nIce avalanches frequently happen around a glacier.\nDebris avalanches contain a variety of unconsolidated materials, such as loose stones and soil.\n\nThere are two main types of snow avalanches- sluffs and slabs.\n\nSluff avalanches occur when the weak layer of a snowpack is on top. A sluff is a small slide of dry, powdery snow that moves as a formless mass. Sluffs are much less dangerous than slab avalanches.\nA slab avalanche occurs when the weak layer lies lower down in a snowpack. This layer is covered with other layers of compressed snow. When the avalanche is triggered, the weak layer breaks off, pulling all the layers on top of it down the slope. These layers tumble and fall in a giant block, or slab.\n\nAvalanches can be as small as a minor shifting of loose snow or as large as the displacement of massive slabs of snow.\n\nA slab avalanche\u2019s mass of descending snow may move at a pace of 130 km/h (80 mph), capable of obliterating small towns and forests in its path.\nWhat are the causes of avalanches?\n\nAvalanches occur as layers in a snowpack slide off.\n\nA snowpack is simply layers of snow that build up in an area, such as the side of a mountain.\nIn winter, repeated snowfalls build a snowpack dozens of meters thick.\nThe layers vary in thickness and texture, and the bonds between the layers of a snowpack may be weak.\n\nThere are numerous natural and man-made factors responsible for an avalanche.\n\nHeavy Snowfall: When a high rate of snowfall occurs, it leads to snow accumulation on the mountain slopes. This triggers the weaker layer of snow in the snowpack of unstable areas of the mountain causing avalanches.\nWind Direction: The direction of the wind determines the patterns of the snowfall as well as snow accumulation on the mountain slopes.\nLayering of Snow: The gradual snowfall creates a layer-by-layer accumulation of snow that creates a hypersensitive snowpack. A small trigger can cause these layers of snow to fall.\nSteeper Slopes: An avalanche is also caused by the influence of gravity. If the snow gets accumulates on the slopes of the mountain, then it is prone to rush down the slopes at greater speeds.\nHigh Temperatures: Temperature is one of the important factors for the avalanche because of high temperatures the surface layer of the snowpack gets melted. The accumulated snow will become highly susceptible to sliding down.\nEarthquakes: It is one of the important factors that trigger the layer of accumulated snowpack because earthquakes generate seismic waves that cause the ground to vibrate.\nDevelopmental activities: During the developmental activities, the terrain vehicles in regions with unstable layers of snow can dislodge the layers from the surface and cause them to slide down under gravity.\nDeforestation: Clearing trees and forests causes the soil to become loose, hence during snowfall the ground does not have the strength to hold the heavy snow. This causes landslides or avalanches of rocks and soil.\nWinter Sports Activities: At times, excessive pressure is transferred to snow layers during winter sports activities like skis and sledding. Excess of these activities can cause the topmost loose layer of snow to slip and eventually cause a greater catastrophe.\nMitigation\n\nAt present, it is difficult for scientists to predict with certainty when and where avalanches will happen. However, they can estimate hazard levels by checking the snowpack, temperature, and wind conditions.\n\nCertain measures like avalanche detention walls, rakes, diversion structures, etc, can be employed in areas prone to avalanches.\n\nAt some ski areas, patrols use explosives to set off avalanches. Or they may blast hazardous slopes with a cannon to shake loose any large, new accumulations of snow.\n\nConclusion\n\nAvalanches strike suddenly and can be deadly, and are one of the most powerful events in nature.\n\nIn 1970, a massive avalanche of rocks and ice destroyed the town of Yungay, Peru, killing 18,000 people.\nDuring World War I, more than 60,000 Italian and Austrian troops died in avalanches while fighting in snowy mountain passes in the Alps.\nAvalanches killed more soldiers in World War I than poison gas did.\n\nIn India, the National disaster management authority (NDMA) brings out mitigation and survival guidelines for avalanches. All major ski regions in the country post warnings based on local knowledge.\n\n\u00ad-Article written by Swathi Satish",

Read further to know more.\n\nStars play a vital role in the universe, as they are responsible for the creation of heavy elements through the process of nucleosynthesis.\u00a0 There are different stages in the life cycle of a star.\n\nA star is a massive, luminous sphere of plasma held together by its own gravity. It is composed mainly of hydrogen and helium, and its energy is produced by nuclear fusion reactions in its core. The immense heat and pressure generated by these reactions cause the star to emit light and heat, which radiate out into space.\n\nThere are many different types of stars, ranging from small, cool, dim stars known as red dwarfs to massive, hot, bright stars known as blue giants.

Here are the general stages of a star\u2019s life:\n\nStellar Nebula\n\nA stellar nebula is a cloud of gas and dust in space, mainly composed of hydrogen and helium, which is the birthplace of stars. These nebulae are typically several light-years in size and can be observed in our galaxy and others.\n\nStellar nebulae are formed from the remnants of previous generations of stars, which have exploded in supernovae, releasing heavy elements into space. These elements combine with hydrogen and helium gas to form nebulae.\n\n\ud83d\udc49 Which year are YOU targeting for success in the IAS/IPS/IFS Exam? \ud83d\ude80\n\n(1) \u21d2 UPSC 2025: Prelims cum Mains\n\n(2) \u21d2 UPSC 2026: Prelims cum Mains\n\n(3) \u21d2 UPSC 2027 Prelims cum Mains\n\nTip: Know more about ClearIAS Courses (Online/Offline)\n\nGravity is the force that causes the nebulae to contract, which increases the density and temperature of the gas and dust. As the density and temperature increase, nuclear fusion reactions begin, and a protostar is formed at the center of the nebula.\n\nProtostar\n\nA protostar is a stage in the formation of a star, where a dense core of gas and dust within a stellar nebula begins to contract under the force of gravity. As the protostar continues to contract, the temperature and pressure at its center increase, eventually reaching a point where nuclear fusion reactions begin.\n\nThe protostar stage is an important step in the formation of stars, as it marks the transition from a cloud of gas and dust to a self-sustaining star. Protostars are typically much larger than their final form, and they continue to contract and heat up until they reach the main sequence stage of their lifecycle.\n\nDuring the protostar stage, the nuclear fusion reactions are not yet strong enough to sustain the star over the long term. Instead, the protostar radiates energy that is generated by the gravitational contraction of its material.\n\nAlso read: LIGO-India\n\nMain Sequence\n\nThe main sequence is a stage in the lifecycle of a star, where it fuses hydrogen atoms in its core to form helium. This is the stage where the star will spend most of its life, and it is characterized by a stable balance between the inward force of gravity and the outward pressure generated by nuclear fusion reactions.\n\nStars in the main sequence stage come in a range of sizes and temperatures, with the most massive and hottest stars located in the upper left of the Hertzsprung-Russell diagram, and the least massive and coolest stars located in the lower right.\n\nThe length of time a star spends in the main sequence stage depends on its mass. Higher-mass stars have hotter and more massive cores, which allow them to fuse hydrogen more quickly and have shorter main sequence lifetimes. Lower-mass stars, on the other hand, have cooler and less massive cores, which allow them to fuse hydrogen more slowly and have longer main sequence lifetimes.\n\nDuring the main sequence stage, stars are in a state of equilibrium, where the outward pressure generated by nuclear fusion reactions is balanced by the inward force of gravity. This equilibrium is maintained until the star exhausts its supply of hydrogen fuel in the core, leading to further changes in its evolution.\n\n\u00a0\n\nRed Giant\n\nA red giant is a stage in the evolution of a star that has exhausted the hydrogen fuel in its core. As the core contracts and heats up, the outer layers of the star expand and cool, causing the star to increase in size and become much brighter.\n\nDuring the red giant stage, the star fuses helium into heavier elements in a shell around the core. This shell fusion generates more energy than the fusion reactions in the core, causing the outer layers of the star to expand and cool.\n\nRed giants are much larger and cooler than main-sequence stars of the same mass. They are characterized by a reddish color and have relatively low surface temperatures, ranging from about 2,500 to 4,000 Kelvin.\n\nThe length of time a star spends in the red giant stage depends on its mass. Higher-mass stars have larger and more massive cores, which allows them to generate more heat and pressure, causing them to spend less time as red giants. Lower-mass stars, on the other hand, have smaller and less massive cores, which causes them to spend longer in the red giant stage.\n\nAs the red giant stage progresses, the outer layers of the star continue to expand and cool, until they eventually become so diffuse that they are lost to space. The core of the star contracts and heats up, leading to further changes in its evolution.\n\nPlanetary Nebula\n\nA planetary nebula is a type of emission nebula that is formed when a low- to intermediate-mass star reaches the end of its life and enters the final stages of its evolution.\n\nDuring this stage, the outer layers of the star are expelled into space, forming a shell of gas and dust that surrounds a hot, dense core known as a white dwarf. The expanding shell of gas and dust is ionized by the intense ultraviolet radiation emitted by the white dwarf, causing it to glow brightly and create a planetary nebula.\n\nAlso read: Nobel Prize\n\nWhite Dwarf\n\nThe core of the red giant will collapse to form a hot, dense object known as a white dwarf. This is the final stage of life for low to medium-mass stars.\n\nA white dwarf is a dense, compact object that is formed when a low- to intermediate-mass star exhausts its nuclear fuel and sheds its outer layers to form a planetary nebula. The core of the star, which is composed mostly of carbon and oxygen, collapses under its own weight to form a hot, dense ball of matter.\n\nWhite dwarfs are one of the end states of stellar evolution for stars with initial masses up to about 8 solar masses. Higher-mass stars will continue to evolve and eventually explode as supernovae, leaving behind neutron stars or black holes. White dwarfs are also important objects for understanding the age of star clusters and the overall age of the Universe, as they provide a lower limit on the age of these systems.\n\nSupernova\n\nA supernova is a powerful and luminous explosion that occurs when a star has reached the end of its life and runs out of nuclear fuel. The explosion is so bright that it can briefly outshine an entire galaxy, and can release as much energy as the Sun will over its entire lifetime.\n\nSupernovae play an important role in the chemical evolution of the Universe, as they release heavy elements and other materials into space that can be used to form new stars and planets. They are also important for understanding the processes that occur in the most extreme environments in the Universe, such as the interiors of neutron stars and black holes. Finally, supernovae are valuable tools for measuring the distance to galaxies and for studying the expansion of the Universe.\n\nAlso read: GRAPES-3 Experiment\n\nNeutron Star or Black Hole\n\nThe core of a massive star may collapse into a neutron star or black hole, depending on its mass. These objects are extremely dense and have strong gravitational fields.\n\nA neutron star is an extremely dense and compact object that is made up of tightly packed neutrons. It is formed when the core of a massive star collapses under its own weight and the electrons and protons in the core combine to form neutrons. Neutron stars are often observed as pulsars, which are rapidly spinning neutron stars that emit beams of radiation from their magnetic poles.\n\nA black hole, on the other hand, is a region of space where the gravitational pull is so strong that nothing, not even light, can escape from it. It is formed when the core of a massive star collapses to a point of infinite density, known as a singularity. The event horizon, which is the boundary around a black hole beyond which nothing can escape, is determined by the mass and spin of the black hole.

The\u00a0Gulf of Mexico\u00a0lies to the northwest.\nENGLISH CHANNEL\nThe English Channel, also known as simply\u00a0the Channel, is an arm of the\u00a0Atlantic Ocean\u00a0that separates\u00a0Southern England\u00a0from northern\u00a0France.\nIt links to the southern part of the\u00a0North Sea\u00a0by the\u00a0Strait of Dover\u00a0at its northeastern end. It is the busiest\u00a0shipping area\u00a0in the world.\nGULF OF MEXICO\nThe Gulf of Mexico is an ocean basin and a marginal sea of the Atlantic Ocean, largely surrounded by the North American continent.\nIt is bounded on the northeast, north, and northwest by the Gulf Coast of the United States; on the southwest and south by the Mexican states of Tamaulipas, Veracruz, Tabasco, Campeche, Yucatan, and Quintana Roo; and on the southeast by Cuba.\nHUDSON BAY\nHudson Bay sometimes called Hudson\u2019s Bay, is a large body of saltwater in northeastern\u00a0Canada\u00a0with a surface area of 1,230,000\u00a0km2\u00a0(470,000\u00a0sq\u00a0mi).\nIt is located north of Ontario, west of Quebec, northeast of Manitoba, and southeast of Nunavut, but politically entirely part of Nunavut.\u00a0It is an\u00a0inland\u00a0marginal sea\u00a0of the\u00a0Arctic Ocean.\nIRISH SEA\nThe Irish Sea\u00a0is an extensive body of water that separates the islands of\u00a0Ireland\u00a0and\u00a0Great Britain.\nIt is linked to the\u00a0Celtic Sea\u00a0in the south by\u00a0St George\u2019s Channel\u00a0and to the\u00a0Inner Seas off the West Coast of Scotland in the north by the\u00a0North Channel.\u00a0Anglesey,\u00a0North Wales, is the largest\u00a0island\u00a0in the Irish Sea, followed by the\u00a0Isle of Man.\u00a0\nLABRADOR SEA\nThe Labrador Sea is an arm of the North Atlantic Ocean between the Labrador Peninsula and Greenland. The sea is flanked by continental shelves to the southwest, northwest, and northeast.\nIt connects to the north with\u00a0Baffin Bay\u00a0through the\u00a0Davis Strait.\nMEDITERRANEAN SEA\nThe Mediterranean Sea is a sea connected to the Atlantic Ocean, surrounded by the Mediterranean Basin, and almost completely enclosed by land: on the north by Southern Europe and Anatolia, on the south by North Africa, and the east by the Levant.\nThe Mediterranean has played a central role in the history of Western civilization. Geological evidence indicates that around 5.9 million years ago the Mediterranean was cut off from the Atlantic and was partly or completely desiccated over some 600,000 years during the Messinian salinity crisis before being refilled by the Zanclean flood about 5.3 million years ago.\nNORTH SEA\nThe North Sea\u00a0lies between\u00a0Great Britain,\u00a0Denmark,\u00a0Norway,\u00a0Germany, the\u00a0Low Countries, and\u00a0France. An\u00a0epeiric\u00a0sea on the\u00a0European\u00a0continental shelf, it connects to the\u00a0Atlantic Ocean\u00a0through the\u00a0English Channel\u00a0in the south and the\u00a0Norwegian Sea\u00a0in the north.\nIt is more than 970 kilometers (600 mi) long and 580 kilometers (360 mi) wide, covering 570,000 square kilometers (220,000 sq mi).\nNORWEGIAN SEA\nThe Norwegian Sea is a marginal sea, grouped with either the Atlantic Ocean or the Arctic Ocean, northwest of Norway between the North Sea and the Greenland Sea, adjoining the Barents Sea to the northeast.\nIn the southwest, it is separated from the Atlantic Ocean by a submarine ridge running between\u00a0Iceland\u00a0and the\u00a0Faroe Islands. To the north, the\u00a0Jan Mayen\u00a0Ridge separates it from the Greenland Sea.\nSCOTIA SEA\nThe Scotia Sea\u00a0is a\u00a0sea\u00a0located at the northern edge of the\u00a0Southern Ocean\u00a0at its boundary with the\u00a0South Atlantic Ocean. It is bounded on the west by the\u00a0Drake Passage\u00a0and on the north, east, and south by the\u00a0Scotia Arc, an\u00a0undersea ridge\u00a0and\u00a0island arc\u00a0system supporting various islands.\nThe sea sits atop the\u00a0Scotia Plate. It is named after the expedition ship\u00a0Scotia. Many\u00a0icebergs\u00a0melt there.\nMarginal seas of the Indian Ocean\nANDAMAN SEA\nThe Andaman Sea\u00a0(historically also known as the\u00a0Burma Sea) is a marginal sea of the northeastern Indian Ocean bounded by the coastlines of Myanmar and Thailand along the Gulf of Martaban and the west side of the Malay Peninsula and separated from the Bay of Bengal to its west by the Andaman Islands and the Nicobar Islands. Its southern end is at Breueh Island just north of Sumatra, with the Strait of Malacca further southeast.\nARABIAN SEA\nThe Arabian Sea is a region of the northern Indian Ocean bounded on the north by Pakistan, Iran, and the Gulf of Oman, on the west by the Gulf of Aden, Guardafui Channel, and the Arabian Peninsula, on the southeast by the Laccadive Sea and the Maldives, on the southwest by Somalia, and the east by India.\nIts total area is 3,862,000\u00a0km2\u00a0(1,491,000\u00a0sq\u00a0mi) and its maximum depth is 4,652 meters (15,262\u00a0ft). The Gulf of Aden in the west connects the Arabian Sea to the\u00a0Red Sea\u00a0through the strait of\u00a0Bab-el-Mandeb, and the\u00a0Gulf of Oman\u00a0is in the northwest, connecting it to the\u00a0Persian Gulf.\nBAY OF BENGAL\nThe Bay of Bengal is the northeastern part of the Indian Ocean, bounded on the west and northwest by India, on the north by Bangladesh, and the east by Myanmar and the Andaman and Nicobar Islands of India.\nIts southern limit is a line between Sangaman Kanda, Sri Lanka, and the northwesternmost point of Sumatra, Indonesia. It is the largest water region called a bay in the world.\nThere are countries dependent on the Bay of Bengal in South Asia and Southeast Asia. During the existence of British India, it was named the Bay of Bengal after the historic Bengal region. At the time, the Port of Kolkata served as the gateway to the Crown\u2019s rule in India.\nCox\u2019s Bazar, the longest sea beach in the world, and Sundarbans, the largest mangrove forest and the natural habitat of the Bengal tiger, are located along the bay.\nJAVA SEA\nThe Java Sea\u00a0is an extensive shallow sea on the\u00a0Sunda Shelf, between the\u00a0Indonesian\u00a0islands of\u00a0Borneo\u00a0to the north,\u00a0Java\u00a0to the south,\u00a0Sumatra\u00a0to the west, and\u00a0Sulawesi\u00a0to the east.\nKarimata Strait\u00a0to its northwest links it to the\u00a0South China Sea. It is a part of the western\u00a0Pacific Ocean.\nPERSIAN GULF\nThe Persian Gulf sometimes called the Arabian Gulf is a Mediterranean sea in Western Asia. The body of water is an extension of the Arabian Sea located between Iran and the Arabian Peninsula.\nIt is connected to the Gulf of Oman in the east by the Strait of Hormuz. The Shatt al-Arab River delta forms the northwest shoreline.\nRED SEA\nThe Red Sea is a\u00a0seawater\u00a0inlet\u00a0of the\u00a0Indian Ocean, lying between\u00a0Africa\u00a0and\u00a0Asia. Its connection to the ocean is in the south, through the\u00a0Bab el Mandeb\u00a0strait and the\u00a0Gulf of Aden.\nTo its north lie the\u00a0Sinai Peninsula, the\u00a0Gulf of Aqaba, and the\u00a0Gulf of Suez\u00a0(leading to the\u00a0Suez Canal). It is underlain by the\u00a0Red Sea Rift, which is part of the\u00a0Great Rift Valley.\nSEA OF ZANJ\nThe Sea of Zanj\u00a0is a former name for that portion of the western\u00a0Indian Ocean\u00a0adjacent to the region in the\u00a0African Great Lakes\u00a0referred to by\u00a0medieval\u00a0Arab\u00a0geographers as\u00a0Zanj.\nThe Sea of Zanj was deemed a fearful zone by Arab mariners and legends regarding dangers in the waters abounded, especially near its far southern limits.\nMarginal seas of the Mediterranean Sea\n\nMajor conflict zones lie in the east of the Mediterranean. Also, the recent refugee crisis is constantly in the news. Hence the locations from the region are important for prelims.\n\nADRIATIC SEA\nThe Adriatic Sea\u00a0is a body of water separating the\u00a0Italian Peninsula\u00a0from the\u00a0Balkan Peninsula.\nThe Adriatic is the northernmost arm of the Mediterranean Sea, extending from the Strait of Otranto (where it connects to the Ionian Sea) to the northwest and the Po Valley.\nThe countries with coasts on the Adriatic are Albania, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Croatia, Italy, Montenegro, and Slovenia.\nAEGEAN SEA\nThe Aegean Sea is an elongated embayment of the Mediterranean Sea between Europe and Asia. It is located between the Balkans and Anatolia and covers an area of some 215,000 square kilometers.\nIn the north, the Aegean is connected to the Marmara Sea and the Black Sea by the straits of the Dardanelles and the Bosphorus. The Aegean Islands are located within the sea and some bound it on its southern periphery, including Crete and Rhodes.\nThe sea reaches a maximum depth of 2,639m to the west of Karpathos. The Thracian Sea and the Sea of Crete are the main subdivisions of the Aegean Sea.\nMarginal seas of the Pacific Ocean\nBERING SEA\nThe Bering Sea is a marginal sea of the Northern Pacific Ocean. It forms, along with the Bering Strait, the divide between the two largest landmasses on Earth: Eurasia and The Americas. It comprises a deep water basin, which then rises through a narrow slope into the shallower water above the continental shelves. The Bering Sea is named after Vitus Bering, a Danish navigator in Russian service, who, in 1728, was the first European to systematically explore it, sailing from the Pacific Ocean northward to the Arctic Ocean.\nCELEBES SEA\nThe Celebes Sea or Sulawesi Sea, of the western Pacific Ocean, is bordered on the north by the Sulu Archipelago and Sulu Sea and Mindanao Island of the Philippines, on the east by the Sangihe Islands chain, on the south by Sulawesi\u2019s Minahasa Peninsula, and the west by northern Kalimantan in Indonesia.\nIt extends 420 miles (675\u00a0km) north-south by 520\u00a0mi (840\u00a0km) east-west and has a total surface area of 110,000 square miles (280,000\u00a0km2), to a maximum depth of 20,300 feet (6,200 m).\u00a0South of Cape Mangkalihat, the sea opens southwest through the\u00a0Makassar Strait\u00a0into the\u00a0Java Sea.\nCORAL SEA\nThe Coral Sea is a marginal sea of the South Pacific off the northeast coast of Australia and is classified as an interim Australian bioregion. The Coral Sea extends 2,000 kilometers (1,200 mi) down the Australian northeast coast.\nMost of it is protected by the French Natural Park of the Coral Sea and the Australian Coral Sea Marine Park. The sea was the location for the Battle of the Coral Sea, a major confrontation during World War II between the navies of the Empire of Japan, the United States, and Australia.\nEAST CHINA SEA\nThe East China Sea\u00a0is an arm of the\u00a0Western Pacific Ocean, located directly offshore from\u00a0East China. It covers an area of roughly 1,249,000 square kilometers (482,000\u00a0sq\u00a0mi).\nThe sea\u2019s northern extension between\u00a0mainland China\u00a0and the\u00a0Korean Peninsula\u00a0is the\u00a0Yellow Sea, separated by an\u00a0imaginary line\u00a0between the eastern tip of\u00a0Qidong\u00a0at the\u00a0Yangtze River\u00a0estuary\u00a0and the southwestern tip of\u00a0South Korea\u2019s\u00a0Jeju Island.\nPHILIPPINE SEA\nThe Philippine Sea\u00a0is a\u00a0marginal sea\u00a0of the\u00a0Western Pacific Ocean\u00a0east of the\u00a0Philippine archipelago\u00a0(hence the name), the largest in the world, occupying an estimated\u00a0surface area\u00a0of 5\u00a0million square kilometers (2\u00d7106\u00a0sq\u00a0mi).\n\u00a0The\u00a0Philippine Sea Plate\u00a0forms the floor of the sea. Its western border is the\u00a0first island chain\u00a0to the west, comprising the\u00a0Ryukyu Islands\u00a0in the northwest and\u00a0Taiwan\u00a0in the west\nSEA OF JAPAN\nThe Sea of Japan\u00a0is the\u00a0marginal sea\u00a0between the\u00a0Japanese archipelago,\u00a0Sakhalin, the\u00a0Korean Peninsula, and the mainland of the\u00a0Russian Far East. The Japanese archipelago separates the sea from the\u00a0Pacific Ocean. Like the\u00a0Mediterranean Sea, it has almost no\u00a0tides\u00a0due to its nearly complete enclosure from the Pacific Ocean.\nThis isolation also affects faunal diversity and salinity, both of which are lower than in the open ocean. The sea has no large islands, bays, or capes. Its water balance is mostly determined by the inflow and outflow through the straits connecting it to the neighboring seas and the Pacific Ocean. Few rivers discharge into the sea and their total contribution to the water exchange is within 1%.\nSEA OF OKHOTSK\nThe Sea of Okhotsk is a marginal sea of the western Pacific Ocean. It is located between\u00a0Russia\u2019s\u00a0Kamchatka Peninsula\u00a0on the east, the\u00a0Kuril Islands\u00a0on the southeast,\u00a0Japan\u2019s island of\u00a0Hokkaido\u00a0on the south, the island of\u00a0Sakhalin\u00a0along the west, and a stretch of eastern\u00a0Siberian\u00a0coast along the west and north.\nThe northeast corner is the Shelikhov Gulf. The sea is named after the Okhota River, which is in turn named after the Even word (okat) meaning \u201criver\u201d.\nSOUTH CHINA SEA\nThe South China Sea, or South East Asian Sea, is a marginal sea of the Western Pacific Ocean. It is bounded in the north by the shores of South China, in the west by the Indochinese Peninsula, in the east by the islands of Taiwan and northwestern Philippines, and in the south by Borneo, eastern Sumatra, and the Bangka Belitung Islands, encompassing an area of around 3,500,000 km2\u00a0(1,400,000\u00a0sq\u00a0mi).\nIt communicates with the East China Sea via the Taiwan Strait, the Philippine Sea via the Luzon Strait, the Sulu Sea via the straits around Palawan (e.g. the Mindoro and Balabac Straits), the Strait of Malacca via the Singapore Strait, and the Java Sea via the Karimata and Bangka Straits.\nTASMAN SEA\nThe Tasman Sea is a marginal sea of the South Pacific Ocean, situated between Australia and New Zealand.\nIt measures about 2,000\u00a0km (1,200\u00a0mi) across and about 2,800\u00a0km (1,700\u00a0mi) from north to south.\n\nYELLOW SEA\nThe Yellow Sea is a marginal sea of the Western Pacific Ocean located between mainland China and the Korean Peninsula and can be considered the northwestern part of the East China Sea.\nIt is one of four seas named after common color terms (the others being the Black Sea, the Red Sea, and the White Sea), and its name is descriptive of the golden-yellow color of the silt-ridden water discharged from major rivers.\nOTHER SEAS\nThe Caribbean Sea is sometimes defined as a marginal sea, sometimes as a Mediterranean sea.\nThe Caspian Sea is also sometimes defined as a marginal sea, and also the Dead Sea.\nPhytoplankton Bloom (Algal Bloom) in Marginal Seas\nThe Mediterranean Sea and the Black Sea are marginal seas found in proximity to one another. The color difference shown here is due to a\u00a0phytoplankton bloom\u00a0occurring in the Black Sea.\nPhytoplankton is good as fish feed on them. But when they proliferate indiscriminately, they consume too much oxygen during the night, thus depriving other marine organisms of oxygen.\nFor example, the discharge of domestic sewage leads to elevated nutrient concentrations (particularly\u00a0phosphates) which can result in harmful\u00a0algal blooms.\nBiomass Production and Primary Productivity\nMarine biomass production originates with primary productivity, which in turn is affected by the availability of sunlight, carbon dioxide, nutrients such as nitrates and phosphates, and trace elements.\nMarginal seas generally exhibit intermediate levels of primary production, with the\u00a0highest rates found in coastal upwelling regions\u00a0and the\u00a0lowest primary production occurring in open ocean regions.\nHence, the highest biomass production rates occur in coastal upwelling zones, the lowest in open ocean regions, and intermediate rates in marginal seas.\nFor near-shore regions, the dominant processes influencing primary productivity are river runoff, water column mixing, and turbidity.\nRiver runoff and water column mixing introduce dissolved nutrients, trace elements, and suspended particles into the photic (light) zones of near-shore regions.\nAlthough the addition of dissolved nutrients and trace elements to coastal waters and marginal seas serves to increase primary production, the addition of suspended particles increases water\u00a0turbidity, which results in reduced sunlight penetration and\u00a0decreased\u00a0primary productivity.\nWater Circulation in Marginal Seas\nWater circulation patterns in marginal seas depend largely on the shape of the sea, fresh-water input (e.g., river runoff and precipitation), and evaporation.\nIf river\u00a0runoff and precipitation exceed evaporation, as is the case in the Black and Baltic Seas, the excess fresh water will tend to flow seaward near the sea surface.\nIf evaporation exceeds river runoff and precipitation, as in the Mediterranean Sea, the marginal sea water becomes\u00a0saltier, then sinks and flows towards the less salty open ocean region.\nBays, gulfs, and Straits\nBays, gulfs, and straits are types of water bodies that are contained within a larger body of water near land.\nThese three water bodies are usually located at important points of human activities; thus, conflicts with nature and neighbors are common.\nBays\nA bay is a small body of water that is set off from a larger body of water generally where the land curves inward.\nIn simple words, a bay is a water body surrounded on three sides by land with the fourth side (mouth) wide open towards oceans. (In Gulfs, the mouth is narrow).\nA bay is usually smaller and\u00a0less enclosed than a gulf.\nExamples: The Bay of Pigs (Cuba), Hudson Bay (Canada), Bay of Bengal, etc.\nAn example of a bay at a river\u2019s mouth in New York Bay, at the mouth of the Hudson River (Hudson Estuary).\nGuant\u00e1namo Bay\nGuant\u00e1namo Bay is a sheltered inlet within the Caribbean Sea.\nDuring the Spanish-American War in 1898, the United States gained access to the outer harbor of Guant\u00e1namo Bay.\nThrough an agreement signed with Cuba in 1903, the United States obtained the right to maintain a naval base at Guant\u00e1namo Bay.\nIn 1934, a treaty reaffirmed the U.S. right to lease the site. The treaty gave the United States a perpetual lease on Guant\u00e1namo Bay.\nThe most infamous Guant\u00e1namo Bay prison is here.\nGulfs\nA gulf is a large body of water, sometimes with a narrow mouth, that is almost surrounded by land. The world\u2019s largest gulf is the Gulf of Mexico.\nExamples of other gulfs include the Gulf of California, the Gulf of Aden (between the Red Sea and the Arabian Sea), and the Persian Gulf (between Saudi Arabia and Iran).\nThe Persian Gulf is important concerning world energy because petroleum is transported through its waters in oil tankers.\nStraits\nA strait is a narrow passageway of water, usually between continents or islands, or between two larger bodies of water.\nThe\u00a0Strait of Gibraltar\u00a0is probably the world\u2019s most famous strait. It connects the Atlantic Ocean on its west with the Mediterranean Sea on its east.\nTwo other well-known straits are the\u00a0Strait of Bosporus\u00a0and the\u00a0Strait of Hormuz.\nThe Strait of Bosporus connects the\u00a0Black Sea (from the north) and the Sea of Marmara (from the south), and splits northwestern Turkey.\nThe Strait of Hormuz is located at the\u00a0southeastern end of the Persian Gulf. It is a narrow waterway that can be (and has been) controlled to prevent ships from sailing through the gulf.\nChoke Point\nWhen a body of water such as a strait is capable of being blocked or even closed to control transportation routes, the body is called a \u201cchoke point.\u201d\nHistorically, the Strait of Gibraltar has been one of the world\u2019s most important choke points.\nHowever, the Strait of Hormuz has become an important choke point in recent years because of increasing Middle East tensions.\nThe Strait is surrounded by the United Arab Emirates Oman (on one side) and Iran (on the other side).\nIsthmus\nThe isthmus is the land equivalent of a strait. i.e., a narrow strip of land connecting two larger land masses.\nExample:\u00a0Isthmus of Panama\u00a0and\u00a0Isthmus of Suez.\n\nArticle written by Aseem Muhammed\n\n\ud83d\udc49 Which year are YOU targeting for success in the IAS/IPS/IFS Exam? \ud83d\ude80\n\n(1) \u21d2 UPSC 2025: Prelims cum Mains\n\n(2) \u21d2 UPSC 2026: Prelims cum Mains\n\n(3) \u21d2 UPSC 2027 Prelims cum Mains\n\nTip: Know more about ClearIAS Courses (Online/Offline)",

There are five major oceans in the world- the Pacific Ocean, Atlantic Ocean, Indian Ocean, Arctic Ocean and Southern Ocean.\n\nPacific Ocean:\nIt is the biggest ocean on the planet. It occupies one-third of the earth\u2019s surface and is larger than all the continents combined. Asia and Australia are separated from North and South America by the Pacific Ocean.\nBecause he perceived the ocean to be quiet, Portuguese explorer Ferdinand Magellan gave it the name Pacific Ocean, which translates as \u201cpeaceful\u201d.\nThe Pacific Ocean is where the International Date Line is located. By the Indonesian Seaway, the Pacific Ocean and the Indian Ocean are connected (Torres strait and strait of Malacca).\nThe ocean here has an average depth of 4280 metres.\nThe world\u2019s deepest oceanic trench is the Mariana trench, which is located in the western Pacific Ocean.\nAtlantic Ocean:\nIt is the world\u2019s second-largest ocean. 20% of the earth\u2019s surface is covered by it.\nIts name, Atlantis Thalassa, which means Sea of Atlas, comes from Greek mythology.\nBetween Africa, Europe, the Arctic Ocean, the Americas, and the Southern Ocean, it is a body of water with an extended S shape. 3,646 metres is about how deep this ocean is on average.\nPuerto Rico Trench is the deepest trench in the Atlantic Ocean (8,376 m).\nIn the distant past, when the supercontinent Pangaea broke up, the north Atlantic Ocean was created, and Gondwanaland broke up, the south Atlantic Ocean was created.\nGreenland, the largest island, is found in the Atlantic Ocean.\nThe Atlantic Ocean contains the Sargasso Sea, the only sea in the world without a shore.\nThe Atlantic and Indian oceans converge in the southeast.\n\nAlso read:\u00a0Bottom topography of Atlantic Ocean\n\n\ud83d\udc49 Which year are YOU targeting for success in the IAS/IPS/IFS Exam? \ud83d\ude80\n\n(1) \u21d2 UPSC 2025: Prelims cum Mains\n\n(2) \u21d2 UPSC 2026: Prelims cum Mains\n\n(3) \u21d2 UPSC 2027 Prelims cum Mains\n\nTip: Know more about ClearIAS Courses (Online/Offline)\n\nIndian Ocean:\nIndia, which makes up a large portion of its northern border, inspired the name.\nThe eastern hemisphere is where it is located. 19.8% of the surface of the earth\u2019s water is covered by it.\nIt is situated between Asia, Australia, the Southern Ocean, and Africa. It is the world\u2019s hottest ocean and is enclosed by land in the northern hemisphere.\nMadagascar is the biggest island in the Indian Ocean (the fourth largest island in the world).\nThe deepest trench in the Indian Ocean is called the Sunda/Java Trench and is about 7450 metres deep.\nThe Indian Ocean\u2019s marginal seas are crucial for trade because they provide vital marine lanes that link the Middle East, East Asia, Africa, Europe, and the Americas.\nThe Indian Ocean\u2019s marginal seas are crucial for trade because they provide vital marine lanes that link the Middle East, East Asia, Africa, Europe, and the Americas. An island, peninsula, or collection of islands that encloses a portion of an ocean is known as a marginal sea (group of islands). They are located close to land and are shallower than the ocean.\nSouthern Ocean:\nThe southernmost parts of the world\u2019s oceans are collectively referred to as the Antarctic Ocean or Austral Ocean.\nIt is the second-smallest and fourth-largest ocean in the world, surrounding Antarctica south of 60\u00b0S latitude.\nThe Atlantic, Indian, and Pacific Oceans round its northernmost (and largest) border. The seas of this ocean are notoriously tumultuous.\nBetween Chile\u2019s Cape Horn in South America and Antarctica\u2019s South Shetland Islands is a body of water known as the Drake Passage. It is renowned for having severe storms. It stretches into the Southern Ocean and joins the southwest corner of the Atlantic (Scotia sea) with the southeast corner of the Pacific.\nArctic Ocean:\nIn comparison to the other four oceans, the Arctic Ocean is shallower and smaller. The Arctic Circle encompasses the entire area.\nIt covers roughly 1.3% of the water surface of the planet.\nEurasia and North America encircle it. In the winter, ice fully covers it. Of the five great oceans, its salinity is the lowest on average.\nThe Greenland Sea, Labrador Sea, and Norwegian Sea connect the Arctic Ocean to the Pacific Ocean while the Bering Strait connects it to the Atlantic Ocean.\nThe deepest spot in the Arctic Ocean is the Molloy Deep, or \u201cMolloy Hole,\u201d which is located in the Fram Strait (inside the Greenland Sea).\n\nThe temperature of Oceans\nSimilar to land, ocean waters also become warmer due to sun radiation. Oceanic water warms and cools more slowly than land-based water.\nTemperature Distribution Influences Ocean water temperature distribution is influenced by several factors, including:\nLatitude: As one moves further away from the poles, the amount of insolation decreases, causing the temperature of surface water to drop.\nUneven distribution of land and water: The northern hemisphere\u2019s oceans experience greater heat because they are in contact with a larger area of land than the southern hemisphere\u2019s oceans.\nPrevailing wind: The winds blowing from the land towards the oceans drive warm surface water away from the coast resulting in the upwelling of cold water from below. It results in the longitudinal variation in the temperature. Contrary to this, the onshore winds pile up warm water near the coast and this raises the temperature.\nOcean currents:\u00a0Warm ocean currents raise the temperature in cold areas while cold currents decrease the temperature in warm ocean areas. The Gulf stream (warm current) raises the temperature near the eastern coast of North America and the West Coast of Europe while the Labrador current (cold current) lowers the temperature near the northeast coast of North America.\nAll these factors influence the temperature of the ocean currents locally.\nThe enclosed seas in the low latitudes record relatively higher temperatures than the open seas; whereas the enclosed seas in the high latitudes have a lower temperatures than the open seas.\nThe salinity of Oceans\nSalinity is an important property of seawater. It is defined as the amount of salt (in grams) dissolved per kilogram (1000 g) of seawater. It is usually expressed as parts per thousand, ppt or \u00b0/\u2080\u2080. For example, 30 ppt means 30g of salt in 1000 g of seawater. A salinity of 24.7 ppt has been considered as the upper limit to demarcate brackish water.\nThe composition of seawater varies both spatially (varies from one area to another) and temporally (varies from one-time span to the other time unit- seasonally, yearly).\nHorizontal distribution of salinity of oceans\nOn average, the salinity decreases from the equator towards the poles. The highest salinity is observed between 20\u00b0 and 30\u00b0 N and S latitudes because this zone is characterized by high temperature, high evaporation and less rain than the equatorial region. Subpolar and polar zones record minimum salinity due to less evaporation.\nThe North Sea, though in higher latitude, records higher salinity due to more saline water brought by the North Atlantic Drift.\nBaltic Sea records low salinity due to the influx of river waters in large quantities.\nThe average salinity of Ithe ndian Ocean is 35\u00b0/\u2080\u2080..The Bay of Bengal records low salinity due to the influx of river water and the Arabian Sea has higher salinity due to high evaporation and a low influx of fresh water.\nHighest salinity in water bodies \u2013 Lake Van in turkey (330 \u00b0/\u2080\u2080), Dead Sea (238 \u00b0/\u2080\u2080), Great Salt Lake, Utah USA (220\u00b0/\u2080\u2080).\nVertical distribution of salinity\nThere is a marked difference in the salinity between the surface zones and the deep zones of the oceans. Salinity at the surface increases by the loss of water to ice or evaporation, or it decreases by the input of fresh waters. However, salinity at depth is very much fixed, because there is no way that water is lost or salt is added.\nAlthough salinity generally increases with depth, there is a distinct zone where the salinity increases sharply called the halocline.\nHighly saline sea water (dense) generally sinks below the lower saline sea water (less dense) which leads to the stratification of seawater.\nDensity stratification of oceans\nThe surface layer of lowest density \u2013 Also called photic zone as this layer is directly penetrated by solar radiation. It has a thickness of 100 m- 200 m. It carries only 2% of the total volume of ocean water.\nPycnocline layer of sharp density gradient \u2013 (by no means density). This layer is found between 300 m \u2013 1000 m depth of ocean water. It carries about 18% of the total volume of ocean water. Pycnocline (sharp density gradient), thermocline (steep temperature gradient) and halocline (sharp salinity gradient) occupy almost the same depth zones of 300 m \u2013 1000 m.\nThe bottom layer of highest but uniform density- It carries about 80% of the total volume of ocean water.\n\nArticle written by Aseem Muhammed",

Read further to know more.\n\nClassification of Lakes can be done on the Basis of Its Origin, Ecology, Size, Water Chemistry, etc manner.\n\nA lake is a large body of water that is surrounded by land. It is a type of inland waterway and can be natural or man-made. Lakes can be found all over the world, and they can vary in size, depth, and water chemistry. They can be formed by a variety of processes, including tectonic activity, glacial melting, volcanic activity, and human activity.\n\nLakes can support a wide range of aquatic and terrestrial life, and they are often important sources of water for human use, such as drinking, irrigation, and recreation.\n\nTable of Contents\n\nClassification of Lakes\nClassification of Lakes on the Basis of Its Origin\nGlacial Lakes\nTectonic Lakes\nVolcanic Lakes\nSolution Lakes\nMan-made Lakes\nClassification of Lakes on the Basis of Ecology\nOligotrophic Lakes\nMesotrophic Lakes\nEutrophic Lakes\nHypereutrophic Lakes\nClassification of Lakes on the Basis of Water Chemistry\nAcidic Lakes\nAlkaline Lakes\nSaline Lakes\nEutrophic Lakes\nOligotrophic Lakes\nClassification of Lakes on the Basis of Size\nSmall Lakes\nMedium Lakes\nLarge Lakes\nGreat Lakes\nCrater Lakes\nImportance of Lakes\nClassification of Lakes\n\nClassification of lakes can be done on different criteria such as their origin, size, depth, location, water chemistry, and ecology.

A few important of them are:\n\nGlacial Lakes\n\nGlacial lakes are formed when glaciers melt and retreat, leaving behind depressions that fill with water. Glaciers are large bodies of ice that move slowly over time, eroding and shaping the landscape as they go. When a glacier retreats, it can leave behind a depression called a cirque or a valley that is then filled with water. Examples of glacial lakes include Lake Tahoe in California and Lake Louise in Alberta, Canada.\n\n\ud83d\udc49 Which year are YOU targeting for success in the IAS/IPS/IFS Exam? \ud83d\ude80\n\n(1) \u21d2 UPSC 2025: Prelims cum Mains\n\n(2) \u21d2 UPSC 2026: Prelims cum Mains\n\n(3) \u21d2 UPSC 2027 Prelims cum Mains\n\nTip: Know more about ClearIAS Courses (Online/Offline)\n\nTectonic Lakes\n\nTectonic lakes are formed as a result of geological movements such as faulting and folding. When the earth\u2019s crust shifts and moves, it can create depressions that fill with water. These lakes can be found in areas with active tectonic activity, such as the Great Rift Valley in Africa. Lake Baikal in Russia is another example of a tectonic lake and is the deepest lake in the world.\n\nVolcanic Lakes\n\nVolcanic lakes are formed in the craters or calderas of active or extinct volcanoes. When a volcano erupts, it can create a depression that fills with water over time. These lakes can be found in areas with high volcanic activity, such as the Pacific Ring of Fire. One example of a volcanic lake is Crater Lake in Oregon, which was formed over 7,000 years ago when Mount Mazama erupted and collapsed.\n\nSolution Lakes\n\nSolution lakes are formed in areas with soluble rocks such as limestone and gypsum. When rainwater or groundwater comes into contact with these rocks, it can dissolve them and create depressions that fill with water. These lakes are typically found in areas with karst topography, such as the Yucatan Peninsula in Mexico. The Great Salt Lake in Utah is another example of a solution lake, formed from the evaporation of water that flowed into the area from rivers and streams.\n\nMan-made Lakes\n\nMan-made lakes are created by humans for various purposes such as irrigation, hydroelectric power generation, and recreation. These lakes can be found all over the world and are typically created by damming rivers or streams. Examples of man-made lakes include Lake Mead in Nevada, which was created by the Hoover Dam, and Lake Kariba in Zimbabwe, which was created by the Kariba Dam.\n\nClassification of Lakes on the Basis of Ecology\n\nLakes are complex ecosystems that are influenced by a wide range of environmental factors, including water quality, temperature, nutrient availability, and surrounding land use.\n\nOligotrophic Lakes\n\nOligotrophic lakes are characterized by low nutrient levels and clear water. These lakes are often deep and have a low level of productivity, meaning that they support relatively few aquatic plants and animals. Oligotrophic lakes are typically found in areas with low human population densities and little agricultural activity. Examples of oligotrophic lakes include Lake Tahoe in California and Crater Lake in Oregon.\n\nMesotrophic Lakes\n\nMesotrophic lakes are characterized by moderate nutrient levels and relatively clear water. These lakes have a moderate level of productivity and support a wider range of aquatic plants and animals than oligotrophic lakes. Mesotrophic lakes are typically found in areas with moderate human population densities and some agricultural activity. Examples of mesotrophic lakes include Lake Champlain in Vermont and Lake Simcoe in Ontario, Canada.\n\nEutrophic Lakes\n\nEutrophic lakes are characterized by high nutrient levels and often have green or murky water. These lakes have a high level of productivity and support a wide range of aquatic plants and animals. Eutrophic lakes are typically found in areas with high human population densities and extensive agricultural activity. Examples of eutrophic lakes include Lake Erie in North America and Lake Taihu in China.\n\nHypereutrophic Lakes\n\nHypereutrophic lakes are characterized by extremely high nutrient levels and are often dominated by algae and other aquatic plants. These lakes have a very high level of productivity and can become choked with plant growth, leading to problems such as oxygen depletion and fish kills. Hypereutrophic lakes are typically found in areas with very high human population densities and extensive agricultural or urban development. Examples of hypereutrophic lakes include Lake Apopka in Florida and Lake Kasumigaura in Japan.\n\nClassification of Lakes on the Basis of Water Chemistry\n\nLakes are complex ecosystems that are influenced by a wide range of environmental factors, including water chemistry. Lets understand the different types of lakes based on their water chemistry, including their unique characteristics and examples of each type.\n\nAcidic Lakes\n\nAcidic lakes are characterized by low pH levels, typically below 5.0. These lakes are often found in areas with high levels of acid rain or areas with high levels of organic material that have decomposed and produced acids. Acidic lakes have low nutrient levels and can be inhospitable to many aquatic plants and animals. Examples of acidic lakes include the Adirondack Lakes in New York and the lakes in Scandinavia.\n\nAlkaline Lakes\n\nAlkaline lakes are characterized by high pH levels, typically above 8.5. These lakes are often found in areas with high levels of mineral salts, such as in arid regions or areas with volcanic activity. Alkaline lakes have high nutrient levels and can support a wide range of aquatic plants and animals, including some that are unique to alkaline environments. Examples of alkaline lakes include Mono Lake in California and Lake Nakuru in Kenya.\n\nSaline Lakes\n\nSaline lakes are characterized by high salt concentrations, typically above 3 grams per liter. These lakes are often found in arid regions where water evaporates quickly and leaves behind concentrated salts. Saline lakes have low nutrient levels and are often inhospitable to many aquatic plants and animals. However, some specialized species are adapted to these extreme environments. Examples of saline lakes include the Great Salt Lake in Utah and the Dead Sea in Israel.\n\nEutrophic Lakes\n\nEutrophic lakes are characterized by high nutrient levels, typically from agricultural runoff or wastewater discharge. These lakes have high levels of productivity and support a wide range of aquatic plants and animals. However, excessive nutrient levels can lead to problems such as harmful algal blooms and oxygen depletion, which can harm fish populations. Examples of eutrophic lakes include Lake Erie in North America and Lake Taihu in China.\n\nOligotrophic Lakes\n\nOligotrophic lakes are characterized by low nutrient levels and clear water. These lakes are often found in areas with low human population densities and little agricultural activity. Oligotrophic lakes have low levels of productivity and support relatively few aquatic plants and animals. Examples of oligotrophic lakes include Lake Tahoe in California and Crater Lake in Oregon.\n\nClassification of Lakes on the Basis of Size\n\nLakes come in a wide range of sizes, from small ponds to vast bodies of water that span multiple countries. A few important of them are:\n\nSmall Lakes\n\nSmall lakes are typically less than 1 square kilometer in size, and they are often referred to as ponds. They are usually shallow and have a maximum depth of around 6 meters. Small lakes can be found in a variety of environments, including forests, meadows, and wetlands. They often serve as important habitats for a variety of aquatic plants and animals, such as frogs, salamanders, and waterfowl.\n\nMedium Lakes\n\nMedium-sized lakes range in size from 1 to 100 square kilometers, with a maximum depth of around 30 meters. They are usually deeper than small lakes and often have clearer water. Medium-sized lakes can be found in a variety of environments, including mountainous regions and coastal areas. They often serve as important recreational resources, providing opportunities for swimming, boating, and fishing.\n\nLarge Lakes\n\nLarge lakes are typically greater than 100 square kilometers in size, and they often span multiple countries or regions. They can have a maximum depth of hundreds of meters, making them some of the deepest bodies of water in the world. Large lakes can be found in a variety of environments, including mountainous regions, coastal areas, and inland basins. They often serve as important resources for drinking water, hydroelectric power generation, and transportation.\n\nGreat Lakes\n\nThe Great Lakes are a group of five large lakes located in North America. They are Lake Superior, Lake Michigan, Lake Huron, Lake Erie, and Lake Ontario. Together, they form the largest group of freshwater lakes in the world, with a total surface area of around 244,000 square kilometers. They have a maximum depth of over 200 meters and are an important resource for drinking water, transportation, and recreation.\n\nCrater Lakes\n\nCrater lakes are small to medium-sized lakes that are formed in volcanic craters. They can range in size from a few hundred meters to several kilometers in diameter. Crater lakes are often deep and clear, with a maximum depth of hundreds of meters. They are typically found in areas with active or extinct volcanoes, such as the Pacific Ring of Fire. One example of a crater lake is Crater Lake in Oregon, which is the deepest lake in the United States.\n\nImportance of Lakes\n\nLakes are important for a variety of reasons, both ecological and human-related. Here are some of the key reasons why lakes are important:\n\nBiodiversity: Lakes support a wide range of aquatic and terrestrial life, including fish, birds, plants, and mammals. They are often home to many species that are unique to the lake ecosystem.\n\nWater Supply: Lakes are a vital source of freshwater for human use, including drinking water, irrigation, and industrial purposes. In many regions, lakes are the primary source of water for local communities.\n\nFlood Control: Lakes can help to control floods by absorbing excess water during heavy rainfall or snowmelt. They can act as natural buffers that reduce the impact of floods on downstream areas.\n\nRecreation: Lakes provide opportunities for recreational activities such as swimming, boating, and fishing. They are popular destinations for tourists and locals alike, and they contribute to the economy through tourism and related industries.\n\nClimate Regulation: Lakes can help to regulate the local climate by releasing moisture into the air and cooling surrounding areas through evaporation.\n\nCultural Significance: Many lakes have cultural and spiritual significance for local communities. They may be associated with local myths and legends or used for religious ceremonies and rituals.\n\nArticle Written By: Priti Raj",

Mountain passes between peaks can arise during the construction of a mountain range or as a result of glaciers, rushing water, or precipitation in the form of rain or snow.\n\nAt lower heights, it is referred to as a hill pass. Most pass tops are flat and formed like a saddle.\n\nThese might be little, high peaks or enormous valleys that span for miles. Passes are typically found near the headwaters of rivers supplied by rain and snowmelt. It does not need to be flat, but it must be much lower in elevation than the other mountains.\n\n\ud83d\udc49 Which year are YOU targeting for success in the IAS/IPS/IFS Exam? \ud83d\ude80\n\n(1) \u21d2 UPSC 2025: Prelims cum Mains\n\n(2) \u21d2 UPSC 2026: Prelims cum Mains\n\n(3) \u21d2 UPSC 2027 Prelims cum Mains\n\nTip: Know more about ClearIAS Courses (Online/Offline)\n\nMountain Passes in India\n\nMountain passes, also known as Himalayan passes, can be found in Jammu and Kashmir, Ladakh, Himachal Pradesh, Uttrakhand, and the northeastern provinces of India.\n\nDue to the continuous nature of mountain ranges, mountain passes are notably present in Maharashtra, Kerala, and Tamil Nadu in the Western Ghats.\n\nMajor Mountain Passes in Leh-Ladakh\n\nMajor Passes in Leh-Ladakh include Chang La, Bara-Lacha La Pass, Khardung La Pass, Imis La etc.\n\nChang La\nChang La provides access to Pangong Lake from Leh.\nIt is one of the highest motorable passes, with an elevation of 17,590 feet.\nThe Defence Research and Development Organization is located near Chang La.\nYou are not recommended to spend too much time there due to the low oxygen level.\nBara-Lacha La Pass\nThe Bara-Lacha La is a well-known mountain pass in Ladakh.\nThis Himalayan Zanskar Range pass connects Lahual and Ladakh and is regarded as the \u201cGateway to Ladakh.\u201d\nThis wonderful location has always been a historical monument, once functioning as a vital trading route.\nKhardung La Pass\nKhardung La is a Tibetan mountain range.\nBorder Roads Organizations are responsible for overseeing it.\nIt serves as a gateway to valleys like Nubra Valley.\nIt is crucial in the transport of supplies to the Siachen Glacier.\nImis La\nIt connects Ladakh with Tibet.\nThis is the beginning of the Hanle Valley, which is historically significant in terms of Buddhism.\nThe Zoji La Pass\nThis pass, located in Dras, connects three areas:\nKashmir Valley in the west, Indus Valley in the east, and Suru Valley in the north-east\nOwing to significant snowfall, construction of the Zoji La Tunnel began in 2020, making traffic even easier.\nTanglang La Pass\nTanglang La Pass is one of Ladakh\u2019s most stunning high-altitude mountain routes, rising 5,328 meters (17,480 ft).\nThis high-altitude mountain pass in Ladakh is around 49 kilometres long and connects Debring with Gya.\nMajor Mountain Passes in Jammu and Kashmir\n\nMajor Passes in Jammu and Kashmir consist of\u00a0 Karakoram Pass, Pir Panjal Pass, Banihal Pass, Burzail Pass, and Pensi La.\n\nAlso read: Avalanche: Types, Causes and Mitigation\n\nKarakoram Pass\nIt is located in the Karakoram Mountain range and connects India and China.\nIt performed an important historical role by allowing travellers to cross these mountain ranges.\nBecause of its desolate and uneven terrain, this pass is highly unpredictable.\nPir Panjal Pass\nIt connects the districts of Kashmir Valley and Rajouri.\nThe Mughal Road runs across this pass.\nIt is an essential link between India and Pakistan.\nBanihal Pass\nIn 1956, a trail from Jammu to Srinagar passed this mountain pass, and Jawahar Tunnel was built beneath it.\nLater on, the same path runs through the Jawahar Tunnel.\nThis pass is no longer valid as a result.\nThe Zaban Glacier is located near Banihal Pass.\nBurzail Pass\n\nThis pass connects the Astore Valley in Kashmir with the Deosai Plains in Ladakh.\n\nPensi La\nPensi La is a mountain pass that connects Kashmir with Kargil.\nIt can be found throughout the Himalayan range.\nMajor Mountain Passes in Himachal Pradesh\n\nMajor passes in Himachal Pradesh are Shipki La,\u00a0Rohtang Pass, Bara-Lacha La, and Debsa Pass.\n\nShipki La\nIt connects the Kinnaur and Tibet districts.

and connects the Pindari and Milam valleys.\nThis pass is incredibly difficult and steep.\nMangsha Dhura\nIt links the Indian states of Uttarakhand and Tibet.\nIt is also significant during the Manasarovar Yatra.\nMuling La\nIt is situated at an elevation of 5669 meters in the Great Himalayas, north of Gangotri.\nThis seasonal crossing connecting Uttarakhand and Tibet is snow-covered throughout the winter.\nMajor Mountain Passes in the North Eastern States\n\nMajor Passes in North Eastern states are Nathu La, Bom Di La, Jelep La, Diphu Pass etc.\n\nNathu La\nIt connects Sikkim with Tibet.\nIt is a gathering place for Indian and Chinese army troops, making it one of the sites where the two countries engage.\nIndian citizens must first obtain a permit to access this pass.\nBom Di La\nIt connects Arunachal Pradesh to Tibet, specifically Lhasa.\nIt is situated at an altitude of 8,556 feet.\nJelep La\nIt is an important trading pass because of the less uneven pathways between Sikkim, India, and Tibet.\nIt has been closed to the public since the Sino-Indian War in 1962.\nDiphu Pass\nDiphu Pass is situated on the MacMohan Line, which separates Tibet from India\u2019s northeast.\nIt is a three-country boundary shared by India, China, and Myanmar.\nDihang La\nIn the northeast, this pass connects the states of Arunachal Pradesh and Burma.\nIt is approximately 4000 meters above sea level.\nPangsau Pass\nIt is located in the state of Arunachal Pradesh.\nThis pass connects Arunachal Pradesh with Burma.\nPangsau Pass, also known as Pan Saung Pass, is located at a height of 3,727 feet on the summit of the Patkai Hills on the India-Burma (Myanmar) border (1,136 m).\nThe pass provides one of the most direct ways into Burma from the Assam plains.\nIt is named after Pangsau, a Burmese hamlet located two kilometres east of the pass.\nMajor Mountain Passes in the Western Ghats\n\nMajor Passes in the Western Ghats include\u00a0 Bhor Ghat, Thal Ghat, Palakkad Ghat, Shencottah gap, etc.\n\nBhor Ghat\nThis pass connects three different locations:\nBetween Palasdari and Khandala, there is a railway line.\nThe route between Khopoli and Khandala by road\nIt is located in the state of Maharashtra.\nThal Ghat\nIt is located on Mumbai-Nashik Road.\nThe railway line that travels through this pass is one of the steepest in India.\nIt connects Kalyan with Kasara in Maharashtra.\nPalakkad Ghat\nIt links the Indian states of Tamil Nadu and Kerala.\nAnother name for it is the Palakkad Gap.\nIt\u2019s a tiny gap at an elevation of 460 feet.\nThe Pal Ghat runs through the Nilgiri and Anaimalai Hills.\nShencottah gap\nIt is found in the Western Ghats.\nIt connects the city of Madurai in Tamil Nadu with the district of Kottayam in Kerala.\nShencottah Gap, the second-largest gap in the Western Ghats, is located five kilometres from town and connects Shencottah and Punalur.\nRoad-rail lines pass through this gap, which connects Shencottah and Punalur.\nImportance of Mountain Passes\nPeople regularly use passes to get across mountainous mountain ranges since it is the most convenient option.\nAs a result, throughout history, they have played a key role in human movement, trade, and settlement.\nPasses are ideal locations for villages or defensive outposts since they are often the only level territory in a mountainous area.\nFrom this vantage point, a pass is also easier to defend against threats or foes.\nPasses act as a link between cultures that are separated by mountains in several places of the world.\nThe Khyber Pass, which goes over the Hindu Kush mountains and connects Pakistan and Afghanistan, has been an important trading route between Central and South Asia for thousands of years. It now connects Afghanistan\u2019s and Pakistan\u2019s modern cities of Kabul and Peshawar.\nConclusion\n\nIf a national border runs across a mountain range, there is frequently a pass through the mountains, as well as a border control or customs station and maybe a military installation. Passes, in addition to providing a reasonably straightforward route between valleys, also provide the shortest descent between two mountain tops.\n\nAs a result, tracks frequently cross at a pass, making them helpful even while traveling between a summit and the valley bottom. Snowdrifts can be a hazard on some mountain passes above the treeline in the winter.\n\nThis might be avoided by raising the road a few meters above ground level, allowing snow to blow off.\n\nRead:\u00a0Hindu Kush Himalaya\n\nArticle Written By: Atheena Fathima Riyas",

Monsoon seasons account for two of the four seasons that exist on the Indian subcontinent. They are\n\nThe Southwest Monsoon Season\nThe North-East Monsoon Season\n\nThe name monsoon is derived from the Arabic word mausin or the Malayan word monsin, both of which means season. Monsoons are seasonal winds (rhythmic wind movements) (periodic winds) that reverse direction as the seasons change. The monsoon is a seasonal wind pattern that flows from sea to land in the summer and from land to sea in the winter. Some scholars consider monsoon winds to be large-scale land and marine breezes.\n\nMonsoons are unique to the Indian subcontinent, South East Asia, and sections of Central Western Africa, among other places.\nThey are more noticeable in the Indian Subcontinent than in any other place.\nConvection cells on a massive scale characterise Indian monsoons.\nThese are seasonal reversals in wind direction that occur on a regular or seasonal basis.\nIn the summer, India receives southwest monsoon winds, while in the winter, it receives northeast monsoon winds.\nSouth-west monsoons arise as a result of an intense low-pressure system that forms over the Tibetan plateau.\nHigh-pressure cells over the Tibetan and Siberian plateaus are related to the northeast monsoons.\nThe southwest monsoons deliver heavy rains to most of India, while the northeast monsoons bring rain to the country\u2019s south-eastern coast (The southern coast of Seemandhra and the coast of Tamil Nadu.).\nMechanism of Indian Monsoon\n\nMonsoons are not completely understood. Many ideas have been proposed to explain the mechanics of monsoons. The mechanism of the Indian monsoon which transforms vast sections of India from semi-desert to lush greenery still not completely known.\n\n\ud83d\udc49 Which year are YOU targeting for success in the IAS/IPS/IFS Exam? \ud83d\ude80\n\n(1) \u21d2 UPSC 2025: Prelims cum Mains\n\n(2) \u21d2 UPSC 2026: Prelims cum Mains\n\n(3) \u21d2 UPSC 2027 Prelims cum Mains\n\nTip: Know more about ClearIAS Courses (Online/Offline)\n\nClassical Theories\nThe Rig Veda, for example, mentions monsoons. Yet, the monsoon mechanism was not mentioned in these books.\nArab traders conducted the first scientific research on monsoon winds.\nArab traders exploited the maritime route to trade with India, and monsoon patterns were critical to their success.\nAl Masudi, an Arab explorer, described the reversal of ocean currents and the monsoon winds over the north Indian Ocean in the tenth century.\nSir Edmund Halley explained the monsoon in the seventeenth century as a result of thermal disparities between continents and oceans caused by differential heating.\nModern Theories\n\nAside from differential heating, the formation of the monsoon is determined by the geometry of the continents, orography (mountains), and the characteristics of upper troposphere air circulation (jet streams). As a result, Halley\u2019s idea has lost most of its relevance, whereas modern hypotheses based on air masses and jet streams are growing more important.\n\nClassical Theory: Sir Edmund Halley\u2019s Theory\n\nClassical theory is based on summer monsoons and winter monsoons.\n\nSummer Monsoon\nThe apparent route of the sun in summer is vertically above the Tropic of Cancer, resulting in high temperatures and low pressure in Central Asia.\nThe pressure is high enough across the Arabian Sea and the Bay of Bengal. As a result, in the summer, winds streamed from the oceans towards the mainland.\nThis airflow from the sea to the land brings significant rain to the Indian subcontinent.\nWinter Monsoon\nThe sun\u2019s apparent path in winter is vertically over the Tropic of Capricorn.\nThe northwestern section of India becomes colder than the Arabian Sea and the Bay of Bengal, and the monsoon flow is reversed.\nThe essential concept underpinning Classical theory is similar to the production of land and sea breezes, except that in the case of monsoons, day and night are substituted by summer and winter.\nDrawbacks\n\nMonsoons do not develop evenly everywhere on Earth, and Halley\u2019s thermal notion fails to describe the complexities of monsoons such as sudden bursts of monsoons, occasionally a delay in one set of monsoons, and so on.\n\nModern theory: Air Mass Theory\n\nAccording to this view, the monsoon is just a modification of the tropics\u2019 planetary winds. The notion is based on the seasonal migration of the ITCZ.\n\nRole of ITCZ [Inter-Tropical Convergence Zone]\nNear the equator, the southeast trade winds of the southern hemisphere and the northeast trade winds of the northern hemisphere meet.\nThe Inter-Tropical Convergence Zone is where these winds collide (ITCZ).\nThis is the area of ascending air, the greatest clouds, and heavy rainfall.\nDuring the changing of the seasons, the location of the ITCZ varies north and south of the equator.\nDuring the summer, the sun shines vertically over the Tropic of Cancer, and the ITCZ shifts northward.\nUnder the influence of Coriolis force, the southern hemisphere\u2019s southeast trade winds cross the equator and begin blowing southwest to northeast.\nAs these displaced trade winds blow over the Indian subcontinent, they are known as south-west monsoons.\nThe Monsoon Front is the boundary between the south-west monsoons and the north-east trade winds (ITCZ). Along this front, rain falls.\nThe ITCZ shifts to 20\u00b0- 25\u00b0 N latitude in July, where it is positioned in the Indo-Gangetic Plain, and the south-west monsoons blow from the Arabian Sea and the Bay of Bengal. In this position, the ITCZ is referred to be the Monsoon Trough [highest rainfall].\nBecause of the seasonal change of the ITCZ, the notion of Northern Inter-Tropical Convergence Zone (NITCZ) in summer (July \u2013 rainy season) and Southern Inter-Tropical Convergence Zone (SITCZ) in winter has emerged (Jan \u2013 dry season).\nThe NITCZ is the cloud and rainfall zone that affects India.\n\nAlso Read: Seasons in India \u2013 ClearIAS\n\nOnset of the Monsoon\nIn April and May, when the sun shines vertically over the Tropic of Cancer, the huge continent to the north of the Indian Ocean gets exceedingly hot.\nThis causes an intense low-pressure system to build in the northwestern section of the subcontinent.\nBecause the pressure in the Indian Ocean to the south of the landmass is high due to the slow heating of water, the low-pressure cell attracts southeast trades over the Equator.\nThese factors help the ITCZ to move northward.\nThe southwest monsoon can be considered as a continuation of the southeast trades deflected towards the Indian subcontinent after crossing the Equator.\nThese winds cross the Equator between 40\u00b0E and 60\u00b0E longitudes.\nThe southwest monsoon arrives on the Kerala coast on June 1st and sweeps fast through Mumbai and Kolkata from June 10th to June 13th.\nBy mid-July, the southwest monsoon has engulfed the whole subcontinent.\nThe Southwest Monsoon Season\nThe Rainy Season is from June to September.\nLow-pressure conditions in the northwest plains have gotten even more extreme as a result of the quick rise in temperature in May.\nBy early June, they are strong enough to attract Southern Hemisphere trade winds from the Indian Ocean.\nThese southeast trade winds traverse the equator, entering the Bay of Bengal and the Arabian Sea before becoming entangled in the air circulation over India.\nAs they move through the equatorial warm currents, they bring a lot of moisture with them.\nAfter passing through the equator, they head southwest. This is what the southwest monsoons are called.\nBURSTS OF THE SOUTHWEST MONSOON\nDuring the southwest monsoon season, the rain begins suddenly.\nThe first rain has a substantial cooling effect on the temperature.\nThe term \u201cmonsoon break\u201d or \u201cburst\u201d refers to the abrupt onset of moisture-laden winds accompanied by strong thunder and lightning.\nThe monsoon may come in the first week of June in coastal parts of Kerala, Karnataka, Goa, and Maharashtra, and in the first week of July in the interior.\nThe daily temperature drops by 5\u00b0C to 8\u00b0C between mid-June and mid-July.\nAs these winds approach the land, the relief and thermal low pressure over northwest India change their southwesterly course.\nNorth-East Monsoon\nThe northeast monsoon makes its way into India from the northeast.\nWith this type of monsoon, the wind blows from the sea to the land.\nThe monsoon winds transport moisture from the Indian Ocean.\nFrom October through December, the northeast monsoon is limited to south India, bringing rain to Tamil Nadu, Puducherry, Karaikal, Yanam, Andhra Pradesh, Kerala, Mahe, and south interior Karnataka.\nThe related rainfall, often known as the winter monsoon, is caused by low-pressure systems, depressions, and cyclones.\nThis is Tamil Nadu\u2019s main rainy season, with 48% (447.4mm) of the state\u2019s annual rainfall falling during these three months.\nSeason of Retreating Monsoon\nMonsoons are known to disappear between October and November.\nThe southwest monsoon weakens around the end of September as the Ganga plain\u2019s low-pressure trough begins to travel southward in reaction to the sun\u2019s southward march.\nThe monsoon has left western Rajasthan by the first week of September.\nIt will have passed across Rajasthan, Gujarat, the Western Ganga plain, and the Central Highlands by the end of the month.\nEFFECTS CAUSED BY RETREATING MONSOONS\nThese tropical cyclones pose a significant risk.\nThe thickly populated deltas of the Godavari, Krishna, and Kaveri rivers are their favoured targets.\nEvery year, devastating cyclones wreak havoc on this region.\nCyclonic storms have also slammed the shores of West Bengal, Bangladesh, and Myanmar.\nThe majority of the rainfall on the Coromandel coast is caused by these depressions and cyclones.\nSuch cyclonic storms are less common in the Arabian Sea.\nImportance of the Indian Monsoon\nBecause about 60% of India\u2019s net arable land lacks irrigation, the monsoon is crucial for agriculture.\nThe monsoon is responsible for over 70% of India\u2019s annual rainfall and influences the yield of a wide range of cereals and pulses, including rice, wheat, and sugarcane.\nAgriculture employs more than half of India\u2019s people, and monsoon rains have a direct impact on their wages and well-being.\nAgriculture contributes to more than 15% of India\u2019s GDP, hence crop failure due to a lack of rain has a negative impact on the economy.\nMonsoonal rainfall helps with water storage for irrigation, electricity generation, and drinking.\nConclusion\n\nThe effect of the monsoon on local weather varies depending on location. Some areas may have a bit more or less rain. Semi-deserts in other areas are turned into beautiful green grasslands that support a varied range of flora and crops. The Indian Monsoon converts enormous areas of India from semi-desert to lush greenery. Farmers in regions like this must have the proper timing for spreading seeds on the fields since it is vital to use all of the available rain to grow crops.\n\nRead:\u00a0Impact of climate change on Indian monsoon\n\nArticle Written By: Atheena Fathima Riyas",

Current research on Himalayan glaciers demonstrates that topography and climate play a major role in determining the variations in retreat rate and mass balance in various mountain range sections. Read here to learn about the causes, effects, and solutions for the glacial retreat.\n\nMassive amounts of ice that are moving slowly downhill make up the glaciers. A glacier develops anywhere snow falls faster than it melts. As melting overcomes accretion, the glacier retreats, resulting in the glacier tongue\u2019s terminal edge terminating at progressively higher altitudes.\n\nThe bulk of mountain (alpine) glaciers on Earth have been retreating since about 1850. While the vast ice-sheet glaciers along the coasts of Greenland and the West Antarctic Peninsula have accelerated their flow to the sea, Alpine glaciers have recently accelerated their retreat.\n\nTable of Contents\n\nGlacial retreat\nCauses of glacial retreat\nImpact of glacial melting and retreat\nWay forward\nGlacial retreat\n\nToday, about 10% of the land area on Earth is covered with glacial ice. Almost 90% is in Antarctica, while the remaining 10% is in the Greenland ice cap.\n\nA glacier diminishing or retreating in size over time as a result of less ice accumulating on it or more ice melting is referred to as glacial retreat.\n\nThe vast majority of instances of rapid glacial retreat are very certainly the result of anthropogenic activities leading to global climate change.\n\n\ud83d\udc49 Which year are YOU targeting for success in the IAS/IPS/IFS Exam? \ud83d\ude80\n\n(1) \u21d2 UPSC 2025: Prelims cum Mains\n\n(2) \u21d2 UPSC 2026: Prelims cum Mains\n\n(3) \u21d2 UPSC 2027 Prelims cum Mains\n\nTip: Know more about ClearIAS Courses (Online/Offline)\n\nSince the turn of the 20th century, several glaciers throughout the world have been melting swiftly. Human activity is the cause of this phenomenon.\n\nThe ages of glaciers throughout the world range from hundreds to thousands of years, and they provide a historical record of climatic change. Their research offers important details on how rapidly and to what degree the earth is warming.\n\nThe present rate of glacier retreat is a challenge for glacier monitoring in three ways:\n\nFirst, the rapid glacier retreat with the disintegration of large glaciers into smaller ones, the formation of periglacial lakes, and the increased debris cover make it difficult to keep up length change and mass balance measurements.\nSecond, major parts of the monitoring systematics were developed for glaciers closer to balance as they appear to be now. The rapid melting has made it difficult to capture and quantify the extremes.\nThird, all the above-mentioned processes need thorough and consistent documentation, which has to be developed and coordinated in real-time at national and international levels.\n\nAs glaciers retreat, they expose landscapes that were only recently covered by ice. This provides an excellent opportunity to explore and understand how glacial landforms and sediments are formed during glacier recessions.\n\nCauses of glacial retreat\n\nThe phenomena of glacial retreat and meting are mostly the results of human activity.\n\nIn particular, since the industrial revolution, emissions of greenhouse gases such as carbon dioxide have increased temperatures, even more near the poles, and as a result, glaciers are quickly melting, calving off into the sea, and retreating on land.\n\nGlobal warming: Greenhouse gases, which affect the warming trend by trapping heat in the atmosphere, have been produced as a result of the burning of fossil fuels. More glaciers melt and recede as temperatures increase, exposing the land underneath.\n\nClimate change: Statistics predict that shortly, glacier loss will be at an all-time high. The faster melting of glaciers is a result of temperature increases brought on by global warming. Studies show that the main cause of glacier retreat is human-caused global warming.\n\nOil and gas extraction: During the process of extracting oil and gas, methane, the main component of natural gas, is also released. The gas also traps heat more efficiently than carbon dioxide, accelerating global warming, and making it more detrimental to the environment.\n\nSolar radiation: The most important of these is the quantity of solar energy that touches the ice, which has an impact on glacier melting and receding. Glaciers lose mass as a result of increased radiation-induced melting.\n\nGlacial till: The unsorted mass of material known as glacial till is gathered by moving glaciers and can include everything from silt to big boulders. The ice is protected by boulders while the weaker ice around it melts.\n\nEven if we significantly curb emissions in the coming decades, more than a third of the world\u2019s remaining glaciers will melt before the year 2100. When it comes to sea ice, 95% of the oldest and thickest ice in the Arctic is already gone.\n\nImpact of glacial melting and retreat\n\nThe glacial retreat can have a variety of important environmental effects, such as altered local ecosystems, altered water supply, and a higher risk of natural catastrophes like landslides and floods.\n\nRising sea level and coastal erosion: When Sea levels rise due to melting glaciers, more frequent and more powerful coastal storms like hurricanes and typhoons are produced. This increases coastal erosion and storm surge.\n\nThe Antarctic and Greenland ice sheets in particular are the main causes of the rise in sea levels worldwide.\n\nWeather patterns: As this ice melts, darker patches of the ocean start to emerge, eliminating the effect that previously cooled the poles, creating warmer air temperatures and in turn disrupting normal patterns of ocean circulation.\n\nResearch shows the polar vortex is appearing outside of the Arctic more frequently because of changes to the jet stream, caused by a combination of warming air and ocean temperatures in the Arctic and the tropics.\n\nFishing industries: Industries that thrive on vibrant fisheries will be affected as warmer waters change where and when fish spawn.\n\nCoastal communities will continue to face billion-dollar disaster recovery bills as flooding becomes more frequent and storms become more intense.\n\nWildlife: In the Arctic, as sea ice melts, wildlife like walruses are losing their home and polar bears are spending more time on land, causing higher rates of conflict between people and bears.\n\nFresh water scarcity: The scarcity of fresh water must be taken into account. There is less water accessible for human usage, whether it is for drinking, hydroelectricity production, or agriculture, the less ice there is.\n\nThreat of coral reefs: To thrive through the process of photosynthesis, coral reefs need sunshine. Due to glaciers melting or retreating, rising sea levels prevent corals from receiving adequate sunlight.\n\nRapid glacial melt in Antarctica and Greenland also influences ocean currents, as massive amounts of very cold glacial-melt water entering warmer ocean waters are slowing ocean currents. And as ice on land melts, sea levels will continue to rise.\n\nWay forward\n\nBy acting as massive mirrors that reflect sunlight from the Earth\u2019s surface into the atmosphere and regulate the planet\u2019s temperature, glaciers play a significant part in preventing global warming. People throughout the world depend on the rivers that are created by runoff from glacial melting.\n\nIt\u2019s important to be aware of the consequences of fossil fuel usage. The level of thermal energy in the environment rises as a result of the widespread use of fossil fuels. Over usage of coal and oil has an annual impact on the artificial atmosphere in addition to depleting these limited resources.\n\nResearch and development for mitigating and preventing further melting of glaciers should be given credence. Science along with other environmental strategies can help mitigate the catastrophe.\n\nSimilarly, alternate energy sources such as solar, wind, and other green sources should be given more promotion.\n\nGlaciers are important as they provide a scientific record of how climate has changed over time. Through their study, we gain valuable information about the extent to which the planet is rapidly warming. They provide scientists with a record of how climate has changed over time.\n\n-Article written by Swathi Satish",

It is typically well-served by transportation routes, such as rail, and may not be homogenous, meaning that there may be a variety of unrelated manufacturing kinds in a single location.

Chaudhry (1976), and the Centre for Monitoring Indian Economy (CMIE) also identified the industrial areas of India (1971, 1982).\nAlfred Marshall first used the term \u201cindustrial district\u201d to refer to a few features of the industrial organisation of countries.

The industrial areas of India, as defined by Prof. R.L. Singh, are briefly described as follows:\n\nThe Mumbai-Pune Industrial Region\nThe nation\u2019s most significant manufacturing area is located here. Following the arrival of the British in India, who created the Mumbai seaport, the area began to grow.\nThe sea path between India and Europe was significantly condensed after the Suez Canal\u2019s opening in 1869.\nThis industrial area\u2019s growth is closely related to India\u2019s history of progress in the cotton textile industry.\nThe growth of this industrial area was primarily influenced by the humid climate, natural port facilities, availability of hydropower, skilled labour, and a vast hinterland producing cotton.\nOnly the larger Mumbai area has more than 8000 registered factories, 350 of which are cotton textile factories.\nThe region\u2019s other industries include those that produce engineering products, chemicals, food processing, leather goods, pharmaceuticals, and films. The majority of the manufacturing in Mumbai is of light-textured, fine, and ultrafine cotton fabrics. In this region, the industrial industry employs over 15 lakh people.\nPune is the second-largest manufacturing hub in the area. More than 1200 recognised factories are there. Metallurgical, chemical, engineering, and automotive products are produced by its industries. Two companies in Pune build scooters and mopeds.\nAmbarnath, Andheri, Bhandup, Ghatkopar, Hadapsar, Jogeshwari, Kalyan, Kirkee, Kolhapur, Kurla, Nashik, Sholapur, Thane, Trombay, Ulhasnagar, and Vikroli are some of the other manufacturing hubs in this area in addition to Mumbai and Pune.\nThis industrial region has almost reached the saturation level. Some of the important problems of this industrial region are:\nInadequate supply of power\nObsolete and outdated machinery\nHigh cost of land and high rent of commercial space\nLabor unrest\nIncreasing regionalism\nHigh rate of crime\nIncreasing environment pollution\nThis area was negatively impacted by the country\u2019s 1947 division because 81% of the total irrigated cotton area used to produce long-staple cotton was given to Pakistan. Mumbai, the hub of this industrial area, is currently constrained by a lack of room for industry growth. To reduce congestion, businesses must be spread out.\nThe Kolkata-Hugli Industrial Region\nThe Hugh River runs alongside the manufacturing area of Kolkata-Hugli.\nIn the western Midnapur region, industries have also grown. The Hugli River provided the ideal location for the construction of an inland river port as the centre of the Hugli industrial area.\nThe proximity of coal mines (Raniganj and Jharia), the availability of agro-raw materials (jute, indigo, and tea), an abundance of water, affordable labor, and export facilities were the primary determinants of this industrial region\u2019s rapid expansion.\nIn addition, Calcutta served as British India\u2019s capital from 1773 to 1911. Since Kolkata is the country\u2019s capital, many industrialists chose to base their businesses here.\nIn this area, more than 10,000 registered industrial factories are employing more than 20 lakh people.\nJute, silk, cotton textiles, engineering, electrical products, automobiles, chemicals, pharmaceuticals, transport equipment, leather footwear, iron and steel and food processing, light machinery, locomotives, iron and steel, and spare parts for various types of machines are all produced by this belt.\nNaihati, Bhatpara, Shamnagar, Krishnanagar, Serampore, Titagarh, Rishra, Kolkata, Haora, and Budge are the major industrial cities and towns in this area.\nThe main problems of this industrial region are:\nThe paucity of space and traffic jams\nShortage of drinking water, insanitation, and lack of infrastructural amenities.\nSilting of the Hugli river resulting in the silting of Kolkata port\nObsolete machinery\nNaxalites movement and political unrest\nStrikes and lockouts\nShortage of power supply\nThe West Bengali government is following a liberalization policy and asking both domestic and foreign business owners to invest in the area to address these issues. In recent years, some advancements have been achieved in this direction.\nThe Ahmadabad -Vadodara Industrial Region\nThe third-largest industrial area in the nation is located here.\nThe proximity of petroleum, thermal, hydel (Ukai project), and nuclear power plants, as well as the availability of cheap land, cheap skilled and unskilled labor, and port facilities, all contributed to the growth of this industrial area (Kakrapara).\nIn this area, over 11 thousand registered factories are employing over 15 lakh people.\nIt is the country\u2019s second-largest center for the manufacturing of cotton textiles.\nIt specializes in engineering products, pharmaceuticals, and chemical sectors.\nVadodara is a significant hub for petroleum and woolen textile products.\nThe cutting of diamonds and silk textiles is well-known in Surat. Anand, Ankleshwar Bhavnagar, Bharuch, Godhra,\nJamnagar, Kalol, Kheda, Rajkot, and Surendernagar are some of the area\u2019s other significant manufacturing hubs.\nSome of the major issues in the area include a lack of decent cotton and a lack of water. The investment in businesses in this area has suffered recently as a result of racial tension.\nThe Madurai-Coimbatore-Bangalore Industrial Region\nIt is a significant industrial center that spans the states of Tamil Nadu and the southern regions of Karnataka, and it made significant strides after freedom.\nThe majority of the nation\u2019s cotton is produced in this location.\nThe favorable climate, well-behaved skilled and unskilled labor, consistent power supply (from the Mettur, Papanasam, Pykara, Savitri, and Sivasamudram power plants), and proximity to the seaports of Chennai, Kochi, Mangalore, and Tuticorin have all contributed to the industrial region\u2019s rapid growth.\nThe textile industry employs about 60% of all employees, followed by engineering (18%) and food processing (about 12%).\nThe Chotanagpur Industrial Region\nJharkhand, Odisha, Southern Bihar, and western West Bengal make up this industrial area.\nIt is frequently referred to as the \u201cRuhr of India\u201d due to the significant concentration of the iron and steel sector.\nMinerals, both solid and non-metallic, and fossil fuels are abundant in this area. The Damodar Valley Company provides power. The provinces of Bihar, Jharkhand, Odisha, Uttar Pradesh, and West Bengal are huge sources of cheap labour.\nAsansol, Bokaro, Burnpur, Durgapur, Kulti, Jamshedpur, and Raurkela are the principal Iron and Steel-producing cities in the area. Other significant manufacturing hubs in the area include Ramgarh and Bhurkunda for the glass industry, Ranchi for HMT, Chittranjan for locomotives, Sindri for fertilizer, and Chittranjan for locomotives.\nThe region\u2019s major issues are a lack of power supply and political unrest like that brought on by Naxalites. Many of the investors in this area have shied away due to labor strife.\nThe Agra-Delhi-Kalka-Saharanpur Industrial Region\nThe principal industrial hubs are located in Agra (textiles, tourism), Ambala (scientific instruments), Chandigarh (electronic and strategic goods), Delhi (textile, chemical, drugs, pharmaceutical, light machine, electronic goods, food processing), Faridabad (engineering), Ghaziabad (synthetic fiber, chemicals, electronics, pharmaceuticals, agricultural equipment, iron & steel, cycle tyre, and tubes), Gurgaon (automobiles), Kalka (paper, wood-work, sugar, textile, and food-processing).\nThe major issues in this area are the high cost of land, the traffic, and the high crime rate.\nVishakhapatnam-Guntur Region\nThis industrial region extends from the Vishakhapatnam district to Kurnool and Prakasam districts in the south. The industrial development of this region hinges upon Vishakhapatnam and Machilipatnam ports and developed agriculture and rich reserves of minerals in their hinterlands.\nCoalfields of the Godavari basin provide energy. The shipbuilding industry was started at Vishakhapatnam in 1941. Petroleum refineries based on imported petroleum facilitated the growth of several petrochemical industries.\nSugar, textile, jute, paper, fertilizer, cement, aluminum, and light engineering are the principal industries of this region. Important industrial centres are Vishakhapatnam, Vijayawada, Vijaynagar, Rajahmundry, Guntur, Eluru and Kurnool\nKollam-Thiruvananthapuram Region\nThis industrial region is spread over Thiruvananthapuram, Kollam, Alwaye, Ernakulam, and Alappuzha districts. Plantation agriculture and hydropower provide an industrial base to this region.\nLocated far away from the mineral belt of the country, agricultural products processing and market-oriented light industries predominate the region.\nAmong them, cotton textile, sugar, rubber, matchbox, glass, chemical fertilizer and fish-based industries are important. Food processing, paper, coconut coir products, aluminium, and cement industries are also significant.\nThe main industries of this region are coconut oil extraction, rice milling, fish packing, paper, coir-matting, ship-building (Kochi), petroleum refining (Kochi), and chemical and electronic goods.\nImportant industrial centres are Kollam, Tiruvanantapuram, Alluva, Kocchi, Alappuzha, and Punalur.\nThe Minor Industrial Areas of India\n\nApart from the industrial regions described there are 13 minor emerging industrial regions in the country.\n\nAmbala- Amritsar\nJaipur- Ajmer\nIndore- Dewas- Ujjain\nSaharampur-Muzaffarnagar- Bijnor\nKolhapur- South Kannada\nNorthern Malabar\nMiddle Malabar\nAdilabad \u2013 Nizamabad\nPrayag- Varanasi- Mirzapur\nBhojpur- Munger\nDurga- Raipur\nBilaspur- Korba\nBrahmaputra valley\n\nApart from the above Minor Industrial areas, Some other famous Industrial areas in India are listed below.\n\nKanpur-Lucknow Industrial Areas: This Industrial Region is known for cotton, woolen, and jute textiles, leather goods, fertilizers, chemicals, drugs, pharmaceuticals, electric goods, and light machinery.\nAssam valley Industrial Areas:\u00a0This region has the industries of petrochemical, jute and silk textiles, tea-processing industry, paper, plywood, match, and food processing industries.\u00a0Important industrial centres are Bongaigaon, Dlbrygarh, Digboi, Guwahati, Noonmati and Tipsukia.\nDarjeeling-Siliguri Industrial Areas: This region is known for the production of the tea processing industry and tourism.\nNorth Bihar and Eastern Uttar Pradesh Industrial Areas: This Industrial Region is known for sugar, cement, glass, jute, fertilizers, locomotive, paper, and food processing are main industries.

Read further to know more.\n\nPort infrastructure is critical to the success of any country. The length of India\u2019s coastline is roughly 7,500 kilometres. In terms of volume and value, ports handle nearly 95% and 70%, respectively, of India\u2019s exports. Iron ore, coal, crude petroleum, and other vital items are imported via the sea route.\n\nA nation\u2019s development is heavily reliant on its ports. Compared to other routes of transportation, ports are the most efficient in terms of price, volume, and ease of use.\n\nThe Indian government is an important supporter of the port industry\u2019s development. It has created an automatic path to 100% FDI for port and harbour construction and maintenance projects. It has also made it easier for firms who build, operate, and maintain ports, inland waterways, and inland ports to benefit from a 10-year tax relief.\n\nTable of Contents\n\nPort administration in India\nMajor\u00a0 ports\nMinor ports\nPort classifications based on cargo handled\nPort classifications based on location\nService port model versus the Landlord port model\nMajor ports of India\nList of Important Indian Ports\nPorts on Western Coast\nKochi (Cochin) Port\nKolkata Port\nKandla Port\nMangalore Port\nPort of Mormugao\nMumbai Port Trust\nJawaharlal Nehru Port Trust (JNPT)\n\u00a0Vadhavan Port\nPorts on the Eastern coast\nChennai Port\nEnnore Port (Kamarajar Port Ltd.)\nParadip Port\nTuticorin Port\nVisakhapatnam\nPort Blair\nIn news\nConclusion\nPort administration in India\n\nMajor and minor ports are the two types of ports in India. Major ports are owned and operated by the Central Government, while minor ports are owned and operated by state governments. India has 205 designated minor and intermediate ports that handle a significant amount of business in addition to 13 major seaports (12 government-owned and one private).\n\nMajor\u00a0 ports\n\nMajor ports are included in the Union list of the Indian Constitution and are administered under the Indian Ports Act of 1908 and the Major Port Trust Act of 1963. Each major port is overseen by a Board of Trustees appointed by the Government of India. Port development, management, and operations are among their tasks.\n\nMinor ports\n\nMinor ports, such as those in Gujarat, Maharashtra, and Tamil Nadu, are governed by the port department or, if one exists, the State Maritime Board. State marine boards perform similar functions to port trusts and have tariff-setting authority. They also work to attract private investment through concession contracts, incentives, exclusive rights, and land acquisition.\n\n\ud83d\udc49 Which year are YOU targeting for success in the IAS/IPS/IFS Exam? \ud83d\ude80\n\n(1) \u21d2 UPSC 2025: Prelims cum Mains\n\n(2) \u21d2 UPSC 2026: Prelims cum Mains\n\n(3) \u21d2 UPSC 2027 Prelims cum Mains\n\nTip: Know more about ClearIAS Courses (Online/Offline)\n\nPort classifications based on cargo handled\n\nPort classifications based on cargo handled are Commercial ports, Industrial ports, and Comprehensive Ports.\n\nIndustrial ports specialise in bulk items such as grain, sugar, minerals, oil, chemicals, and similar materials.\nCommercial ports handle general cargo, such as packaged goods and manufactured things, as well as passenger traffic.\nComprehensive ports handle massive amounts of bulk and general cargo. The bulk of the world\u2019s major ports is comprehensive ports.\nPort classifications based on location\nInterior ports are those that are not on the coast. They are connected to the sea by a river or canal. These ports can be approached by flat-bottomed ships and barges. Kolkata, for example, is situated on the Hoogli River.\nOut Ports: Deep-water ports that are located outside of the main ports. These ports help the parent ports by receiving ships that are too large to enter the parent ports.\nService port model versus the Landlord port model\nThe service port model: The port authority owns the land as well as all available equipment (both fixed and mobile) and performs all regulatory and port activities under the service port model.\nThe landlord port model: The landlord port concept involves a publicly controlled port body acting as both a regulator and a landlord, while private firms oversee port operations, notably cargo handling. The port is owned by the port authority, but the infrastructure is leased to private businesses that build and maintain their own superstructure as well as install their own cargo handling equipment.\nMajor ports of India\n\nAll Indian ports are located in nine coastal states: Kerala, Karnataka, Maharashtra, Goa, Gujarat, West Bengal, Odisha, Andhra Pradesh, and Tamil Nadu.\n\nThe country\u2019s thirteen major ports handle a large volume of container and cargo traffic.\nMumbai is India\u2019s largest natural port.\nAs you are aware, the Indian government has a federal structure, and maritime transit is to be controlled by both the Central and State governments, according to the Indian constitution.\nWhile the central government\u2019s shipping ministry is in charge of the major ports, the minor and intermediate ports are managed by the respective departments or ministries in the nine coastal states: Andhra Pradesh, Goa, Gujarat, Karnataka, Kerala, Maharashtra, Odisha, Tamil Nadu, and West Bengal.\n\nSix of India\u2019s 13 major ports are located on the western coast. The other six ports are on the east coast, with one on the Andaman\u00a0Nicobar Islands in Port Blair.\n\nAlso Read: Maritime India Vision 2030 \u2013 ClearIAS\n\nList of Important Indian Ports\n\nThe

The Himalayan mountain range has grown in the following ways:\n\nThe Oligocene period saw the formation of the Great Himalayas.\nThe Miocene era saw the formation of the Lesser Himalayas.\nThe Pliocene and Upper Pliocene epochs saw the formation of shiwaliks.\nEocene and Oligocene-era structures in Gujarat, Rajasthan, and Assam contain mineral oil.\nThe Tertiary epoch has been divided into four temporal sections: the Eocene, Oligocene, Miocene, and Pliocene.\n\nAlso Read: Exogenic Forces: Classification \u2013 ClearIAS\n\nRocks of the Quarternary System\n\nThese rocks can be found in the Ganges and Indus River plains.\n\nThe Pleistocene and Holocene epochs are separated temporally into two portions that make up the Quarternary epoch.\nThe term \u201cBangar\u201d refers to an old alluvial soil that was produced during the Upper and Middle Pleistocene.\nAt the conclusion of the Pleistocene epoch, alluvial soil production started, and it is currently ongoing in the current Holocene epoch. It is called \u201ckhadar.\u201d\nThe valley in Kashmir was created during the Pleistocene epoch.\nA lake once occupied this valley. The current form (valley), known as \u201ckareva,\u201d was created as a result of the constant deposition of the earth.\nThe Thar Desert is where Pleistocene-era deposits can be discovered. The ocean once contained the \u201cRann of Kachchh.\u201d In the Pleistocene and Holocene eras, sedimentary sediments filled it.\nConclusion\n\nIndia\u2019s geology history exhibited a distinctive and varied nature. Classification of Indian rocks is based on the geological structure of our country which includes the physical and chemical properties. Rocks from various geologic eras can be found in different parts of India. The Pangaean supercontinent once included the Indian Craton. The Himalayan mountain range was created after the Gondwanaland craton broke (225 million years ago) and drifted towards the Eurasian craton (65 my ago).\n\nThe Indo- Ganga- Brahmaputra plain region formed in the upper Pliocene and Pleistocene eras following a series of vast spared alluvial plains in the Outer Himalayas. As a result, different regions of India have rocks that represent practically every sort of geological structure from various geologic eras.\n\nArticle Written By: Atheena Fathima Riyas",

Read further to know more.\n\nA mountain is a landform that sharply protrudes above its surroundings and has notable local relief, steep slopes, and a tiny peak region. It\u2019s common knowledge that mountains are bigger than hills.\n\nNearly 27% of the world\u2019s land surface is covered by mountains. 80% of the planet\u2019s fresh surface water comes from mountans.\n\nMountains can be divided into a wide variety of categories according to, their time of origin, their height and how they formed.\n\nTable of Contents\n\nClassification on the Basis of

Mode of Origin\n\nThese were created as a result of the tectonic plates colliding and bending as a result of large-scale plate movements.\n\nThere are further classified into :\n\nBlock mountains\nFold mountains\nDome mountains\nMountains of Accumulations\nCircum-erosional/Relict\nBlock Mountains\n\nBlock Mountains are also formed by the internal or endogenic earth movements which cause the\u00a0force of tension\u00a0and faulting.\n\n\ud83d\udc49 Which year are YOU targeting for success in the IAS/IPS/IFS Exam? \ud83d\ude80\n\n(1) \u21d2 UPSC 2025: Prelims cum Mains\n\n(2)

faults results in the formation of Block Mountains.\n\nA block mountain is also called a Horst\u00a0and the rift valley formed as a result of faulting is called\u00a0Graben.\n\nHigher blocks are referred to as horsts, and troughs as grabens.\n\nExamples include the Rhila Rhodope Mountain Range, Satpura Range, Sierra Nevada Range, and Vindhya Range.\n\nFold Mountains\n\nLarge-scale tectonic plate collisions cause folding and subduction of land, which leads to the formation of fold mountains.\n\nThey are formed due to the\u00a0force of compression arising from endogenic\u00a0or internal forces.\n\nSynclines\u00a0(trough) and\u00a0anticlines (crest) are part of the Fold Mountains.\n\nThe Himalayas, Rockies, Andes, Balkan, Jura Mountains, and Zagros are the most prominent fold mountains of the world.\n\nRocks that formed under intense pressure and at low temperatures, such as sedimentary and metamorphic rocks, make up the majority of fold mountains.\n\nMany fold mountains develop when a layer of ductile minerals, like salt, is underlain.\n\nMountains Dome\n\nThese are created when the top sedimentary rock layers are forced upward by the hot, molten material (magma) emerging from the Earth\u2019s mantle into the crust.\n\nThey consequently take the shape of a \u201cdome.\u201d\n\nMagma rarely reaches the Earth\u2019s surface here, unlike a volcano.\n\nMountains of Accumulations (Volcanic Mountains)\n\nThe accumulation of volcanic material creates volcanoes, sometimes referred to as Mountains of Accumulations.\n\nThe thrown-out volcanic debris settles in the form of a mountain range around the crater.\n\nA flatter cone with a lower elevation and a softer slope results from thin, simple-composition lava spreading across a vast area.\n\nIf the composition is thick and acidic, the result will be a little volcanic cone that protrudes abruptly.\n\nSometimes the lava is sent out along with ash.\n\nMount Mauna Loa on the Hawaiian Island of Hawaii, Mount Popa in Myanmar, and Fujiyama in Japan are examples of it.\n\nCircum-erosional/ Relict /Residual Mountains\n\nThese are the exposed remains of ancient fold mountains caused to denudation (strip of covering).\n\nThese can also develop from plateaus that have been eroded into hills and valleys by rivers.\n\nThese can be found in India on hills like the Nilgiri, Palkonda, Parasnath, and Rajmahal, as well as on mountains like the Aravalli, Vindhya, and Satpura.\n\nClassification on the Basis of Period of Origin\n\nNine orogenic movements have taken occurred altogether to date.\n\nSome of them took place in the Precambrian era, between 600 and 3,500 million years ago.\n\nThe three most recent orogenies are the Caledonian, Hercynian, and Alpine.\n\nPre-Cambrian Mountains\n\nThe Precambrian era, which lasted more than 4 billion years, is when these mountains first appeared.\n\nThe rocks have been metamorphosed, denuded, and uplifted.\n\nAs a result, the relics resemble residual mountains.\n\nAlgoman and the Laurentian mountains are two examples of this.\n\nCaledonian Mountain\n\nMassive orogenic activities and associated tectonic movements throughout the late Silurian and early Devonian periods led to the formation of the Caledonian Mountains, approximately 430 million years to 380 million years ago.\n\nExamples include the Appalachians, Aravallis, Mahadeo, and others.\n\nHercynian Mountains\n\nThe Carboniferous and Permian periods are when these mountains first appeared in Europe, approximately 340 million years and 225 million years ago.\n\nThe Altai, Asia\u2019s Tien Shan, The Vosges, Black Forest Mountains, and the Ural Mountains are only a few examples of them.\n\nAlpine Mountains\n\nThe Alps, which span over 1,200 kilometres across Eight Alpine nations\u2014France, Switzerland, Monaco, Italy, Liechtenstein, Austria, Germany, and Slovenia\u2014are the highest and broadest mountain range system in all of Europe.\n\nThese were created by the collision of the African and Eurasian tectonic plates tens of millions of years ago.\n\nExtreme shortening brought on by this event caused marine sedimentary materials to shove and fold into high peaks like the Matterhorn and Mont Blanc.\n\nClassification on the Basis of Height\n\nOn the basis of height, mountains can be classified as:\n\nLow Mountains\n\nLow mountains are those that are less than 700 metres high.\n\nMount Chimneytop in Tennessee, USA is an example..\n\nRough Mountains\n\nBetween 1000 and 1500 metres high is called Rough Mountains.\n\nAustralia\u2019s Mount Donna Buang is an excellent example of this.\n\nRugged Mountains\n\nMountains that are rough range in height from 1500 to 2000 metres.\n\nIndia\u2019s Agastya Mala is an illustration of a rugged mountain.\n\nHigh Mountains\n\nThe high mountains, as their name implies, are often higher than 2000 metres.\n\nKanchenjunga is a typical example for this.\n\nClassification on the Basis of Location\n\nOn the basis of location, mountains can be classified as:\n\nCoastal Mountains\n\nCoastal refers to everything that is in the water or on land that is close to the coast. As the name suggests, coastal mountains are ones that are close to a coastline.\n\nExamples include the Rocky, Appalachians, The Alpine\u00a0 Ranges, The Western Ghats, and The Eastern Ghats.\n\nInland Mountains\n\nThe mountains that are landlocked are known as inland mountains.\n\nThey make up the majority of the mountains we come across.\n\nExamples include The Vosges and The Black Forest in Europe, The Kunlun, Tienshan, and Altai ranges in Asia, and The Urals in Russia.\n\nThe Aravallis, Himalayas, and Satpura are a few examples of this.\n\nOceanic Mountains\n\nOceanic mountains are those that are found on oceanic and continental shelves.\n\nIf mountains were measured from the ocean floor, Mauna Kea (9140 m) would be the highest peak. It is a dormant volcano in the volcanic chain of Hawaii.\n\nSignificance of Mountains\n\nFollowing are the significance of mountains:\n\n\u00a0A storehouse of natural resources\n\nLarge resources of minerals like petroleum, coal, and limestone are found in mountains. The mountains are the main source of timber, lac, medical herbs, etc.\n\nAct as Water Towers\n\nMountains are referred to as \u201cwater towers\u201d because they act as significant headwaters for several rivers and other freshwater sources.\n\nSnowmelt produces streamflow, which eventually finds its way into streams, rivers, lakes, and oceans, where it becomes fresh water. Rehydrating aquifers is another use for this meltwater.\n\nSource of Freshwater\n\nPerennial rivers, which originate in the snow- or rain-covered mountains, are regarded as a crucial source of water. They also perform a variety of functions, including providing water for local residents and aiding with agriculture.\n\nFormation of Fertile plain\n\nWhen rivers emerge from high mountains, they convey water to lower valleys along with silt. This is in charge of creating fertile plains and supporting operations related to agriculture.\n\nControl Speed of Wind\n\nThey aid in reducing the wind\u2019s velocity. The wind blows up the steep slopes, carrying air and clouds with it. As the air pressure keeping them in increases, warm, moist air masses travel up and over a mountain swell.\n\nNatural Political Frontiers\n\nThe mountains can also act as natural boundaries between the two countries. They have a prominent role in protecting the country from external threats.\n\nEffects on Climate\n\nThey serve as a climatic divide between two adjoining regions. The mountains cause orogenic rainfalls, diversion, and blocking of cold winds, etc.\n\nMajor Tourist Destination\n\nThe climate, pure air, distinctive flora and fauna, scenic beauty, local culture, history, and tradition, as well as the opportunity to experience snow and engage in winter sports, are just a few of the factors that make mountain regions attract tourists.\n\nConclusion\n\nOne-fifth of the world\u2019s area is made up of mountains, and at least one-tenth of all people live there. 26.5 per cent of the continental land area of the earth is made up of mountain ranges. 197 of the 237 countries in the world have mountains. In terms of biodiversity, water, clean air, research, cultural variation, recreation, landscape, and spiritual aspects, mountains are highly valued.\n\nTo get more Geography Notes Click Here\n\nArticle written by: Aryadevi E S",

Lithium is considered a crucial component for the production of rechargeable batteries, which are used in a variety of electronic devices, including smartphones, laptops, and electric vehicles. Read here to know more about the element and significance of the discovery.\n\nThe Geological Survey of India (GSI) has established \u201cinferred\u201d lithium resources of 5.9 million tonnes in the Salal-Haimana area of the Reasi District of Jammu and Kashmir. These resources have been established as part of the \u201cReasi Sersandu-Kherikot-Rahotkot-Darabi\u201d mineral block, where prospecting has been ongoing since 2021-22.\n\nThe recent discovery of this large deposit of metal in India could potentially help the country to meet its domestic demand for the metal, which has been increasing in recent years due to the growing popularity of electronic devices and electric vehicles.\n\nTable of Contents\n\nLithium\nApplications of Li metal\nSide-effects of lithium mining\nGlobal lithium reserves\nLithium Reserves in India\nSignificance of lithium deposits in India\nWay forward\nLithium\n\nThe chemical element lithium has the chemical symbol Li and atomic number 3 and is derived from the Greek word lithos, meaning stone.\n\nIt is a delicate, white-silver alkali metal.\nIt is the least dense metal and the least dense solid element under typical conditions.\nAs with all alkali metals, Li must be stored under a vacuum, in an inert atmosphere, or an inert liquid such as mineral oil or pure kerosene.\nIt has a shiny sheen when cut, but damp air quickly corrodes it to a dull silvery grey, then a black patina.\nIt never occurs freely in nature, but only in (usually ionic) compounds, such as pegmatitic minerals, which were once the main source of Li.\nDue to its solubility as an ion, it is present in ocean water and is commonly obtained from brines.\nLi metal is isolated electrolytically from a mixture of lithium chloride and potassium chloride.\n\nIn trace levels, Li is found in biological systems; its roles remain unknown. In the treatment of mental illnesses including bipolar disorder, Li salts have shown promise as a mood stabilizer and antidepressant.\n\nMany industrial products use lithium and its compounds, including lithium metal batteries, lithium-ion batteries, flux additives for the manufacturing of iron, steel, and aluminum, heat-resistant glass and ceramics, lithium grease lubricants, and lithium-ion batteries.\n\n\ud83d\udc49 Which year are YOU targeting for success in the IAS/IPS/IFS Exam? \ud83d\ude80\n\n(1) \u21d2 UPSC 2025: Prelims cum Mains\n\n(2) \u21d2 UPSC 2026: Prelims cum Mains\n\n(3) \u21d2 UPSC 2027 Prelims cum Mains\n\nTip: Know more about ClearIAS Courses (Online/Offline)\n\nMore than 75 percent of Li production is used for these purposes.\n\nApplications of Li metal\n\nLi is best known for its role in energy-storage technology.\n\nLithium-ion batteries, rechargeable and lightweight, power the most-used electronic devices on the planet, from cell phones to laptops.\nThe design of the battery laid the foundations for a wireless society.\n\nLithium-ion batteries do not just make for better electronic devices, but also allow for the storage of significant amounts of energy from renewable sources, such as solar and wind.\n\nThey are already used to power homes and commercial, industrial, and educational facilities around the world.\n\nIn addition, the batteries are what enable electric cars to operate with high autonomy.\n\nThese batteries also promote development through access to energy, because they allow a greater application of solutions with solar panels in isolated systems.\n\nSolar radiation is converted into electrical energy through photovoltaic solar panels. This energy can be connected to the electricity grid or it can be conducted through isolated systems.\nThe excess energy produced by these panels is stored in batteries for night-time use or during periods of low solar radiation.\nIn isolated islands or remote areas not connected to the power grid, it is necessary to store the energy through batteries to use it 24 hours a day.\nThe lithium battery allows that surplus to be stored more efficiently. These batteries can store between 95 and 99% of the energy generated, while those of lead-acid which is still commonly used to store solar energy, only reach up to 85%.\nWith the development of this technology, it is possible to store the energy that supplies electricity to regions that do not yet have this service.\n\nLithium is widely used in a variety of applications due to its unique chemical and physical properties. Some of the other most important uses of the element include:\n\nPharmaceuticals: It is used as a mood stabilizer in the treatment of the bipolar disorder, depression, and other mental health conditions.\nGlass and Ceramics: It is used in the production of special glass and ceramics, as it helps to reduce the melting temperature of these materials.\nAerospace and Military: It is used in the aerospace and military industries to cool the temperature-sensitive components in space vehicles and military equipment, such as radar systems and missile guidance systems.\nLubrication: It is used as an ingredient in high-temperature lubricating greases, due to its ability to withstand high temperatures and provide long-lasting lubrication.\nSide-effects of lithium mining\n\nThe common environmental side effects of lithium mining are water loss, ground destabilization, biodiversity loss, increased salinity of rivers, contaminated soil, and toxic waste.\n\nAfter the brine is pumped out from underneath the salt flat, it is left to evaporate through a series of ponds for 12-18 months, forming a mixture of potassium, magnesium, borax, and lithium salts.\nFor a tonne of lithium, up to 2 million liters of water are required. The majority of this is lost in evaporation.\n\nOther major side-effects of Lithium Mining are-\n\nPollutes Water Sources\nIncreases Carbon Dioxide Emissions\nMisuses Gallons of Water\nDepletes Fertile Land\nCauses Respiratory Problems\nCreates Unsustainable Water Table Reduction\nProduces Massive Mining Wastes\nTampers with the Water Cycle\n\nRead:\u00a0Battery waste management\n\nGlobal lithium reserves\nCourtesy: Economist.com\n\nChile, Australia, Argentina, China, US are a few of the countries in the world with the largest overall lithium reserves, regardless of their stage of development.\n\nArgentina, Bolivia, and Chile make up the \u201clithium triangle.\u201d The three countries, along with Peru, contain about 67% of proven lithium reserves and produce about half of the global supply, according to the U.S. Geological Survey.\n\nOne-third of the \u201clithium triangle\u201d in South America \u2013 which also comprises second and third-placed Argentina and Chile \u2013 Bolivia is home to the world\u2019s biggest lithium reserves.\nWith estimates of 21 million tonnes, Bolivia holds aboutone-quarterr of the entire global resource \u2013 including the world\u2019s single-biggest lithium deposit, the Salar de Uyuni salt flat, which is visible from space.\nArgentina has the world\u2019s second-largest lithium reserves, totaling around 17 million tonnes. Likeneighboringg Bolivia and Chile, these reserves are contained in vast salt flats, where the solar evaporation of brine pools is the technique used to extract it.\nThe Salar del Hombre Muerto salt flat is a notable lithium resource in Argentina.\nChile accounts for around nine million tonnes of lithium reserves. Chile has succeeded in developing a prolific mining industry for the metal \u2013 and in 2019 had by far the world\u2019s largest mine reserves, totaling 8.6 million tonnes.\nAlthough the US has the world\u2019s fourth-largest lithium reserves, measured at 6.8 million tonnes according to the US Geological Survey, production activity in the country is minimal.\nAustralia may only rank fifth on the list of largest overall reserves with 6.3 million tonnes, but it was by far the world\u2019s biggest lithium producer in 2019.\nChina is sixth-placed on the list, with overall lithium reserves estimated at 4.5 million tonnes. In 2019, the country produced 7,500 tonnes of the metal \u2013 the third-highest level worldwide.\nLithium Reserves in India\n\nThe recently discovered lithium deposit is estimated to be 5.9 million tonnes in the Salal-Haimana area of the Reasi District of Jammu & Kashmir (UT), making it one of the largest deposits of lithium in the world.\n\nEarlier, researchers at the Atomic Minerals Directorate (under India\u2019s Atomic Energy Commission) estimated lithium reserves of 14,100 tonnes in a small patch of land surveyed in Southern Karnataka\u2019s Mandya district.\n\nThe Atomic Minerals Directorate for Exploration and Research (AMD), a unit of the Department of Atomic Energy, has identified 1,600 tonnes of lithium resources in the Marlagalla area of Mandya district.\n\nSignificance of lithium deposits in India\n\nOne of the reasons India has been dependent on other nations for Li-Ion batteries and other EV components is the lack of lithium availability.\n\nThe latest finding of lithium reserves in J&K does come in as a new lease of life as it furthers India\u2019s desire to become self-sufficient in its energy storage needs.\nLithium is one of the key components of Li-Ion batteries and taking into consideration the financial impact of obtaining Lithium, the new discovery is significant.\n\nThe recent discovery of this sizable lithium deposit in India may be able to assist the nation in supplying its expanding domestic metal demand, which has been driven up recently by the popularity of electronic gadgets and electric vehicles.\n\nThe finding of this significant lithium deposit in India may help the nation become a significant player in the global lithium market in addition to satisfying domestic demand.\n\nLithium mining is a challenging operation that calls for hefty infrastructural and technological investments.\n\nThe government of India will need to take action to guarantee that the development of this deposit is done in a sustainable and environmentally responsible manner because the environmental impact of lithium mining is a key worry.\n\nChina even though has only the 6th largest reserves, has the upper hand when it comes to manufacturing. China is estimated to have 60 percent of the world\u2019s capacity for processing and refining lithium.\n\nIndia\u2019s lithium reserves, if manufactured and refined judiciously, can potentially make it compete against China.\n\nWay forward\n\nLithium has been dubbed \u201cwhite gold\u201d for its widespread usage in items indispensable to modern-day living.\n\nThe world\u2019s lithium supply can barely keep up with its demand. A report from the International Energy Agency says that the world could face lithium shortages by 2025.\n\nLithium, nickel, and cobalt are just a few of the minerals that India now imports to satisfy its demand.\n\nIndia is making audacious moves to establish itself as a rival in the electric vehicle supply chain as the globe works to wean itself off its reliance on China for essential battery materials.\n\nIndia only has a small amount of the raw materials required to meet the domestic demand for lithium-ion batteries.\n\nTherefore, it is anticipated that the government\u2019s aspirations to enter the EV market will receive a major boost from the discovery of lithium inferred resources (G3) of 5.9 million tonnes in Jammu and Kashmir.\n\n-Article written by Swathi Satish",

The GSI\u2019s operational and yearly programs take on importance from a national standpoint as well.\n\nGeological Survey of India\n\nGSI is headquartered in Kolkata and has six Regional offices located at Lucknow, Jaipur, Nagpur, Hyderabad, Shillong, and Kolkata and State Unit offices in almost all States of the country.\n\nPresently, the Geological Survey of India is an attached office to the Ministry of Mines.\n\nThe Charter of the Geological Survey of India outlines its functions as follows:\n\nEnable and facilitate the provision of objective, impartial, and up-to-date geological expertise and geoscientific information of all kinds, particularly for decision-making for policy, commercial, economic, and societal needs.\nSystematically document the geology and geological processes of the surface and subsurface of India and its offshore areas using the latest and most cost-effective techniques and methodologies, including geophysical and geochemical, and geological surveys.\nDevelop and continually enhance GSI\u2019s core competence in survey and mapping through continued accretion, management, coordination, and utilization of spatial databases (including those acquired through remote sensing).\nUse new and emerging computer-based technologies for the dissemination of geoscientific information and spatial data, through cooperation and collaboration with other stakeholders in the Geoinformatics\nExplore (through the ground, airborne, satellite, and marine surveys) and scientifically assess mineral, energy, and water resources for the country and facilitate their optimal exploration through proactive information dissemination.\nMaintain a leadership role in the geological field and develop partnerships with Central, State, and other institutions, to help create enhanced execution capability and capacity in the field of geology in furtherance of GSI\u2019s Vision and the objectives of this Charter.\nCoordinate geoscientific activities with stakeholders in all sectors related to geoscience to help sustainably manage our natural resources, including water.\nConduct multidisciplinary as well as fundamental Geoscientific research and studies (including geotechnical investigations, physical, chemical, and biological hazard geo-investigations, climate change geostudies, paleogeostudies, etc.).\nActively participate in international collaborative projects to improve our understanding of the earth and its ecosystems and its geology, including studies related to tectonics, global warming and climate change, and Polar studies.\nGenerally advance the cause of the geoscience by documentation, propagation, archiving, and education, including creation and management of museums, monuments and parks, archives, libraries, and other facilities for use of students, researchers, and the public.\nIn particular, constantly endeavor to popularize Geoscience at school and university levels through the production and dissemination high quality audio-visual and printed material, and through the medium of the Internet.\nAlso, hold exhibitions and special events to bring geoscientific concepts before the public.\n\nThe activities of GSI function around 5 missions and related sub-schemes:\n\nMission I \u2013 Baseline Geoscience Data generation\n\nSurvey & Mapping\n\nSpecialized Thematic Mapping, Geochemical Mapping, Geophysical Mapping, Systematic Geological Mapping, Airborne and Marine Surveys.\n\nMission II \u2013 Natural Resources Assessment\n\nMineral Exploration\n\nExploration for coal (including lignite), Ferrous, non-ferrous, Precious, and Strategic and Industrial minerals.\n\nMission III \u2013 Geoinformatics\n\nInformation/ Dissemination\n\nMap compilation and publication on various earth science subjects, Information Technology, GSI portal\n\nMission IV \u2013 Fundamental & Multidisciplinary Geosciences and Special studies\n\nSpecialized Investigation\n\nGeotechnical, environmental, landslide studies, earthquake geology, seismology, glacial, geothermal, and desert geological studies.\n\nResearch & Development\n\nResearch work on fundamental geoscience and Arctic and Antarctic studies.\n\nMission V \u2013 Training & Capacity building\n\nHuman Resource Development\n\nTraining\nSignificance of the geological survey\n\nHistorically, surveys were used to understand the processes at the interfaces between the lithosphere, the hydrosphere, the biosphere, and the atmosphere. But now their use and significance have crossed boundaries to manifold applications.\n\nGeological surveys are still useful in the twenty-first century, particularly for identifying and mitigating environmental risks brought on by unsustainable mining activities.\nRadiometric surveys have been used to identify radioactive contamination of streams near goldfields is the 90s.\nThe geological survey is an essential engineering discipline used in the extraction of minerals and hydrocarbons.\nGeological information is crucial in assisting in the mitigation of damage due to natural disasters.\nGeological surveys have led the exploration of fossil fuels (coal, oil, natural gas, etc.) and concentrations of geothermal energy.\nGeo Tourism includes the physical attributes of a region as tourism attractions. India is a country with diverse physical attributes, a rich cultural heritage, and eventful ancient history. Tourism plays a major role in showcasing this great country to the rest of the world. Of late, there has been significant initiative in promoting tourism even in the remotest corners of the country.\nGeo tourism in India\n\nIndian subcontinent exhibits an imprint of varied geological processes through the ages and is a storehouse of interesting geological features.\n\nThe geological Survey of India has already enlisted some of those locales as National Geological Monuments.\n\nIt is imperative that the Tourist Map of India would be greatly enriched by the inclusion of these geological monuments and alike so that visitors from the country and abroad can have an insight into the real past \u2013 the formation of the subcontinent, the orogeny, the palaeoenvironment and the exotic collection of paleo \u2013 flora and fauna.\n\nFossil Parks\nMarine Gondwana Fossil Park, Manendragarh, Sarguja district, Chattisgarh: Unique exposure of fossiliferous marine Permian (280\u2010 240 Ma) rocks of Talchir Formation belonging to Gondwana Supergroup\nFossil Wood Parks: Akal Fossil Wood Park, Jaisalmer District, National Fossil Wood Park, Tamilnadu, National Fossil Wood Park in Sattanur, Perambalur\nSiwalik Fossil Park, Saketi, Sirmur District, Himachal Pradesh contains a rich collection of 2.5 million years old vertebrate fossils from Siwaliks.\nStromatolite Parks: Bhojunda, Chittaurgarh District, Rajasthan is an exposure within the massive Bhagwanpura Limestone of the Lower Vindhyan age; Jhamarkotra, Udaipur District, Rajasthan is the largest & richest deposit of phosphorite associated with stromatolite.\nRock Monuments\nPeninsular Gneiss National Monument at Lalbagh, Bangalore.

Heavy tropical rains form as the air cools and releases its moisture as it rises. As a result, an air mass that is cooler and drier flows away from the Equator. The air lowers and warms up once again as it gets closer to the tropics.\nThe air is dropping, which prevents clouds from forming and causes relatively little rain to fall on the ground below.\nThe Sahara, the largest and hottest desert in the world, is located in northern Africa. Almost the whole continental United States is contained within the Sahara Desert.\nThe Tanami Desert in northern Australia and the Kalahari Desert in southern Africa are two other subtropical deserts.\nCoastal Deserts\nDeserts along the coast are a result of cold ocean currents. A layer of fog is created when cold water contacts wind that is blowing toward shore. Onto land it drifts, this dense fog.\nDespite the high humidity, there are no atmospheric shifts that would ordinarily result in rain. A coastal desert may be nearly entirely dry but foggy.\nOn Chile\u2019s Pacific coast, there is a coastal desert called the Atacama Desert. The Atacama frequently has fog covering some of its terrains. However, years may pass in this area with little rain. The driest area on Earth is, in reality, the Atacama Desert. In the Atacama, some weather stations have never recorded any rain.\nRain Shadow Deserts\nDeserts in the rain shadow can be found close to the leeward slopes of various mountain ranges. Slopes on a leeward side are windward.\nAir with moisture is forced to climb when it encounters a mountain range. After cooling, the air condenses to form clouds that release precipitation onto windward slopes. When the air crosses the peak and starts to descend the leeward slopes, there isn\u2019t much moisture remaining. It becomes challenging for clouds to develop when the air descends due to warming.\nA rain shadow desert, Death Valley is located in the American states of California and Nevada.\nThe Sierra Nevada mountains\u2019 rain shadow is where you\u2019ll find Death Valley, which is also the lowest and driest region in North America.\nInterior Deserts\nBecause no moist winds can reach interior deserts, which are found in the centre of continents, they nevertheless remain. Air masses from coastal regions have completely lost all of their moisture by the time they reach the inland. Inland deserts are another name for interior deserts.\nLocated in China and Mongolia, the Gobi Desert is hundreds of kilometres from the sea. The moisture in the winds by the time they reach the Gobi is long gone. The Himalayan mountains to the south cast a rain shadow over the Gobi as well.\nPolar Deserts\nDeserts are a category that includes parts of the Arctic and Antarctic. There is a lot of water in these arctic deserts, but the majority of it is permanently frozen in glaciers and ice sheets. So, even though there are millions of litres of water present, there isn\u2019t much that plants and animals can use.\nThe world\u2019s largest desert is also the coldest. The majority of the Antarctic continent is a polar desert with little precipitation. Few living things can survive Antarctica\u2019s icy, arid climate.\nThe climate of Deserts of the world\nDesert evenings are often frigid because there isn\u2019t much moisture in the air to absorb and hold onto the heat produced by the high daytime temperatures.\nThe desert biome is an extremely difficult land mass to live in due to the combination of high-temperature variations and exceedingly limited water availability.\nDue to the lack of moisture in the atmosphere to screen off the sun\u2019s beams, temperatures are extremely high during the day.\nThis indicates that the energy from the sun is absorbed by the ground.\nThe air around the ground then becomes warmer.\nThe exact reverse occurs as night falls.\nThe heat collected during the day is radiated back to the atmosphere by the heated ground and hot air, causing a sharp drop in temperature.\nAt night, temperatures can fall to 0 degrees Celsius.\nPrecipitation of Deserts\nThe amount of precipitation in hot, deserts differs greatly from the amount of precipitation in cold deserts.\nDeserts that are both hot and cold often only get 15 cm of rain on average annually.\nIn contrast, cold deserts receive an average of 15\u201326 cm of rain in the spring and encounter heavy snowfall.\nSeasons of Deserts\nDesert biomes experience significant seasonal climate variations.\nTemperatures in the summertime range from 30 to 49 degrees Celsius. Precipitation levels are low or nonexistent throughout the summer.\nAdditionally, precipitation usually occurs at a faster pace than evaporation.\nTemperatures in the winter range from 10 to 20 degrees Celsius. During these summer months, there is a lot of precipitation.\nNatural Vegetation of Deserts of the world\nThe very little rainfall experienced in desert biomes, as well as extreme daily temperature fluctuations, makes life difficult for plants.\nDespite these challenges, a wide range of plants grows in this biome.\nCacti, tiny shrubs, succulents, and grasses are the most typical plants that flourish in desert biomes.\nDesert plants have evolved special adaptations to survive in these challenging environmental circumstances.\nTo reduce water loss, common adaptations include storing water in stems and leaves, coating leaves with wax, and dropping leaves.\nSome plants have grown long tap roots so they can access water tables.\nWhile others go dormant until the rains come again.\nParticularly the cactus plant, which may grow up to 20 feet tall and live for over 200 years since it has successfully adapted to the extreme climatic conditions of desert biomes.\nBecause of its shallow roots, the Giant Saguaro cactus in particular has survived in this hostile habitat by soaking up rain and dew before it evaporates. Additionally, it has a pliable inside that can expand and store a lot of water. The cactus\u2019 modest growth rate is another adaptation that helps it conserve energy.\nAnother plant adapted to survive in desert biomes is the magma tree. It is made up of tiny leaves that grow peculiarly upwards and serve as a funnel during rain.\nRainwater is directed by the funnel-shaped leaves to the tree\u2019s base, where shallow roots suck it up. In general, this adaptation ensures that the tree will receive a significant amount of water when it rains. Brittle Bush, Desert Ironwood, Chainfruit Cholla, Joshua Tree, Palo Verde, Jumping Cholla, Ocotillo, Pancake Prickly Pear Cactus, Soaptree Yucca, and Mojave Aster are more plants found in the desert habitat.\nAnimal Life of Deserts of the world\nDespite the harsh climatic conditions in the desert biome, many animals live here.\nThese animals have developed unique adaptations to help them keep cool and use less water.\nFor example, a recognizable desert animal like the Camel can get by for days without food and water due to the fat stored in its hump. It also has thick fur and underwool to protect it from the harshest of winter. Its nostrils can be closed to keep out blowing sand. A camel has two rows of eyelashes to shield its eyes from the sun and blowing winds and broad hooves to prevent it from sinking in the sand.\nFoxes survive here due to their burrowing and nocturnal lifestyles. This burrowing ensures they escape the intense heat during the day. They also have large ears to aid in the dissipation of excess body heat during hot days. Their thick, sandy fur helps protect them from cold nights in the desert. The thick, sandy fur also helps reflect heat and camouflage.\nAnimals in deserts of the world have also developed adaptations such as panting to minimize heat, seasonal migration, and long periods of dormancy that lasts until triggered by moisture and temperature conditions.\nOther animals in the desert biome include Bobcats, Coyotes, Javelina, Desert Tortoise, Cactus Wren, Desert Kangaroo Rat, Sonoran Desert Toads, Thorny Devils, Desert Bighorn Ship, Armadillo Lizards, Sonoran Pronghorn Antelope, so on.\nThe Largest Deserts in the world\nThe polar regions are home to the two biggest deserts on Earth.\nAbout 5.5 million square kilometres of the Antarctic continent are covered by the Polar Desert.\nThe Arctic Polar Desert is the second-largest desert.\nParts of Alaska, Canada, Greenland, Iceland, Norway, Sweden, Finland, and Russia are included in its territory. There are roughly 5.4 million square miles of surface area.\nNon-Polar Deserts of the world\nOutside of the polar regions are the last deserts on earth.\nThe Sahara Desert, a subtropical desert in northern Africa, is the biggest.\nAbout 3.5 million square miles of the surface area make up its perimeter.\n\nSome Major Deserts of the world are tables below,\n\nMajor Deserts of the World\nName\tType of Desert\tSurface Area\tLocation\nAntarctic\tPolar\t5.5 million mi\u00b2\tAntarctica\nArctic\tPolar\t5.4 million mi\u00b2\tAlaska, Canada, Greenland, Iceland, Norway, Sweden, Finland, Russia\nSahara\tSubtropical\t3.5 million mi\u00b2\tNorthern Africa\nArabian\tSubtropical\t1 million mi\u00b2\tArabian Peninsula\nGobi\tCold Winter\t500,000 mi\u00b2\tChina and Mongolia\nPatagonian\tCold Winter\t260,000 mi\u00b2\tArgentina\nGreat Victoria\tSubtropical\t250,000 mi\u00b2\tAustralia\nKalahari\tSubtropical\t220,000 mi\u00b2\tSouth Africa, Botswana, Namibia\nGreat Basin\tCold Winter\t190,000 mi\u00b2\tUnited States\nSyrian\tSubtropical\t190,000 mi\u00b2\tSyria, Iraq, Jordan, Saudi Arabia\nChihuahuan\tSubtropical\t175,000 mi\u00b2\tMexico\nGreat Sandy\tSubtropical\t150,000 mi\u00b2\tAustralia\nKara-Kum\tCold Winter\t135,000 mi\u00b2\tUzbekistan, Turkmenistan\nColorado Plateau\tCold Winter\t130,000 mi\u00b2\tUnited States\nGibson\tSubtropical\t120,000 mi\u00b2\tAustralia\nSonoran\tSubtropical\t120,000 mi\u00b2\tUnited States, Mexico\nKyzyl-Kum\tCold Winter\t115,000 mi\u00b2\tUzbekistan, Turkmenistan, Kazakhstan\nTaklamakan\tCold Winter\t105,000 mi\u00b2\tChina\nIranian\tCold Winter\t100,000 mi\u00b2\tIran\nThar\tSubtropical\t75,000 mi\u00b2\tIndia, Pakistan\nSimpson\tSubtropical\t56,000 mi\u00b2\tAustralia\nMojave\tSubtropical\t54,000 mi\u00b2\tUnited States\nAtacama\tCool Coastal\t54,000 mi\u00b2\tChile\nNamib\tCool Coastal\t13,000 mi\u00b2\tAngola, Namibia, South Africa\nThar Desert\nThus, the collective noun for the area\u2019s sand ridges, is where the name Thar originates.\nIt is split between Punjab and Sindh provinces in eastern Pakistan and Rajasthan state in northern India.\nOver 2,000 000 square kilometres of the Thar Desert are covered by dry terrain.\nIt creates a natural barrier along the Pakistan-India border.\nThe desert has an undulating topography with low barren hills, or bakers, that abruptly emerge from the surrounding plains and high and low dunes divided by sandy plains.\nThe dunes are constantly shifting, changing in size and shape. A crescent-shaped dune called a barkhan is created by wind that blows primarily in one direction. It is one of the most prevalent kinds of the dune, and it may be found worldwide in sandy deserts.\nThe irrigated Indus River plain, the Punjab Plain, the Aravalli Range, and the Rann of Kachchh all about the Thar Desert on its western, northern, and northeastern sides, respectively.\nDue to the persistently high pressure and subsidence at that latitude, the Thar Desert has a subtropical desert climate.\nThe Thar is typically avoided by the dominant southwest monsoon winds, which bring rain to much of the subcontinent in summer.\nConclusion\n\nA type of biome known as a desert is characterised by extremely high temperatures and very little precipitation (25 cm or less in a year). It is a significant kind of ecosystem that sustains a population of unique plants and animals. Deserts make up about 30% of the planet\u2019s total land area.\n\nSince the beginning of time, there have been natural causes for desert creation; it is the manmade causes that are of concern. The UN convention to combat desertification must be followed by an action plan to counteract it (UNCCD).\n\nArticle written by Aseem Muhammed",

The literal meaning of the term vortex is the anti-clockwise movement of air that retains the cold air nearby the poles.\n\nIt is observed that throughout the winters in Northern Hemisphere, the polar low-pressure becomes comparatively less stable and often expands, sending cold Arctic air toward the south over the US with the jet stream.\n\nIt is primarily present in the upper troposphere that sometimes extends to the lower stratosphere, especially at the poles. It is a constant low-pressure area that rotates at the upper level of the north pole in an anti-clockwise direction, and at the South Pole, it rotates in a clockwise direction.\n\n\ud83d\udc49 Which year are YOU targeting for success in the IAS/IPS/IFS Exam? \ud83d\ude80\n\n(1) \u21d2 UPSC 2025: Prelims cum Mains\n\n(2) \u21d2 UPSC 2026: Prelims cum Mains\n\n(3) \u21d2 UPSC 2027 Prelims cum Mains\n\nTip: Know more about ClearIAS Courses (Online/Offline)\n\nThe polar low-pressure area has been in the bulletins afterwards the northern hemisphere faced its coldest age or phase during the winter season of 2013-2014. Furthermore, this same freezing air force came back in 2020. This time countries like the USA, Canada, and Russia suffered undergone one of their coldest winter seasons ever recorded.\n\nDuration and Strength of a\u00a0 Polar Vortex\n\nThe duration and strength of a Polar Vortex are as follows:\n\nStrength\nA Polar low-pressure area is at its highest during the winter and its lowest during the summer.\nIn the event of a volcanic eruption, a polar vortex will be further strengthened and it can stay that way for up to two years after the initial eruption\nThere will be a single vortex when the Arctic low-pressure is elongated in shape with two cyclone centres.\nThe Antarctic polar low-pressure is far more persistent than the Arctic variant.\nClimate phenomena related to the\u00a0La Nina will significantly strengthen a polar low-pressure.\nDuration\nThe Arctic polar vortex breaks up between mid-March to mid-May. This event marks the end of winter and the beginning of spring. Farming activities, ecosystems, and other weather cycles are impacted by this event\nThe same transition also impacts sea ice, ozone, air temperature, and cloud formation as well.\nAn early breakup of the polar low-pressure leads to one warming period that lasts from late February to mid-March. A late breakup period will lead to two warming periods, one in January and one in March.\nThere are times when the polar vortex breaks off before the end of the last warming period. If it is big enough then it can move into Canada and the Midwestern, Central and Northeastern United States\nPolar Vortex and Global Warming\n\nMany a time, the polar low pressure is associated with global warming. It is believed that many global warming issues are caused due to polar Vortex.\n\nThe worldwide temperature has increased by approx. 0.8\u00b0C since the 1880s.\nThe Arctic has heated and melted at more than double the rate due to the polar low pressure.\nThe North Pole, North America, and other similar regions have very little temperature difference from the Arctic region.\nThe jet stream\u2019s energy moves upward, disturbing the Polar Vortex and initiating it to split.\nImpacts of Polar low-pressure area on Earth\u2019s atmosphere\n\nA polar vortex and its related events can have the following impacts on the Earth\u2019s environment.\n\nThe Polar low-pressure breakups in the higher atmosphere can have significant sudden or delayed impacts on the environment, such as decreasing atmospheric temperature and extremely harsh cold in the winter in the Eastern United States, Western regions & Northern Europe.\nAbrupt stratospheric warming due to the polar Vortex can lead to the warm Arctic region in the stratosphere as well as the troposphere.\nThe warm Arctic region works in favour of cold air and causes more harsh winter weather in the Northern Hemisphere and mid-latitudes comprising the Eastern United States.\nFeatures of Polar Vortex\n\nA polar low-pressure swirls over the stratosphere, 10-48 Km above the ground level.\n\nA stronger or more potent polar vortex act as a protective barrier for the mid-latitudes protecting them from cold Arctic air.\nTypically, it happens when the polar low-pressure is most potent and cold air is less prone to fall deep into the mid-latitudes, including Northern US and Europe.\nHowever, the polar Vortex sometimes gets disrupted or weakens because of the wave energy rising skyward from the Earth\u2019s lower atmosphere.\nSuch happenings or events with the polar Vortex abruptly warm the stratosphere in just a few days, and this event is known as sudden stratospheric warming far above the Earth\u2019s surface.\nAs a consequence of this stratospheric warming, the polar low-pressure tends to shift its location a little toward the south of the north pole. Sometimes this shift splits the polar Vortex into \u2018sister vortices\u2019.\nSlipping or Shifting of the Polar low-pressure area\n\nA Polar vortex goes across somewhere above 650 North and South latitudes.\n\nThe polar Vortex becomes very powerful when the temperature contrast between the polar low-pressure and temperate regions is highest. At this stage, its meandering is insignificant or nearly null.\nHowever, the polar vortex meander is known as Rossby waves when this temperature contrast is slight.\nThe slight temperature contrast does not mean the summertime.\nThe meandering polar Vortex generates irregular or flashing low-pressure & high-pressure chambers.\nHigh-pressure chambers are formed underneath the ridges, and low-pressure chambers are formed underneath the troughs.\nIt happens because of the upper air circulations shaped by the polar low pressure.\nDue to the severe meandering of the Polar low-pressure, the high-pressure chambers force over to the north and shift the polar low-pressure from its standard position.\nIt means the polar low-pressure moves far from the pole and glides into the temperate regions having extremely low pressure.\nAs soon as the polar low-pressure holds back its strength, the high-pressure chambers become ineffectual and move back to their original latitudinal positions.\nThe polar vortex shifts or slips back to its original position or poles with the shift in high-pressure chambers.\nHow polar vortex shifts to the south?\n\nA high-pressure system from the west pushed the jet stream, and a portion of the polar Vortex shifted farther south than the normal position.\n\nThat brought a portion of the Polar Vortex well into North America and caused the temperature in the Midwest and the eastern US to dive to zero.\n\nPolar low-pressure area and Ozone layer Depletion\n\nEven though polar low-pressure and ozone layer depletion is two entirely diverse topics, however related phenomena of the Earth\u2019s atmosphere.\n\nThere is a constant decline in the total amount of the ozone layer, approx.\u20144% in the Earth\u2019s stratosphere. Additionally, a considerable reduction in the stratospheric ozone layer is observed in the vicinity of the Earth\u2019s polar regions.\n\nThe chemical makeup of the Antarctic polar low-pressure has led to severe ozone depletion. The nitric acid in the stratospheric clouds reacts with chlorofluorocarbons to form chlorine which further accelerates the destruction of the ozone layer.\n\nConclusion\n\nThe only threat of the Polar low-pressure to humans is the degree of cold temperatures that could get low when the polar low-pressure area spreads out and send Arctic air toward the south into the regions that are not cold usually.\n\nThe mild winters in the northern regions of the hemisphere which are particularly south of the Arctic circle have led to a decrease in energy consumption by the people.\n\nRead:\u00a0Polar Code\n\nArticle written by Aseem Muhammed",

For the promotion of agricultural mechanization in the country, a Centrally Sponsored Scheme \u2018Sub-Mission on Agricultural Mechanization\u2019 (SMAM) is being implemented through the State Governments since 2014-15. Read here to learn more about the status of agricultural mechanization in India.\n\nAgriculture and allied sectors contribute approximately 14 percent to GDP and 49.6 percent to the labor force. The importance of agriculture is higher in rural areas with 57 percent of the rural population employed in the sector and 60 percent of the household dependent on it.\n\nThe agricultural sector is facing several challenges small farm holdings, which are continuing to decrease in size, decreasing farm labor (estimated to drop to approximately 26 percent of the labor force by 2050), and a future water scarcity crisis to name a few.\n\nFarmers\u2019 income has not been able to keep pace, such as to cater to increasing costs of production including that of rising labor wages. Hence, there is a strong case for labor-substituting farm/agriculture machinery.\n\nParallelly, it is also important to note, that several activities are highly time-bound, and unless executed as per schedule, the farmer is likely to suffer loss. Agriculture mechanization is an appropriate answer to such challenges.\n\nTable of Contents\n\nMechanization of Indian Agriculture\nAdvantages of mechanization of Indian agriculture\nLimitations for mechanization of Indian agriculture\nInitiatives of the Government of India to Promote Farm Mechanization\nSub Mission on Agricultural Mechanization (SMAM)\nWay forward\nMechanization of Indian Agriculture\n\nThe farm mechanization levels assessed by the Indian Council of Agricultural Research (ICAR) for major cereals, pulses, oil seeds, millets, and cash crops indicate that:\n\n\ud83d\udc49 Which year are YOU targeting for success in the IAS/IPS/IFS Exam? \ud83d\ude80\n\n(1) \u21d2 UPSC 2025: Prelims cum Mains\n\n(2) \u21d2 UPSC 2026: Prelims cum Mains\n\n(3) \u21d2 UPSC 2027 Prelims cum Mains\n\nTip: Know more about ClearIAS Courses (Online/Offline)\n\nThe seedbed preparation operation is highly mechanized (more than 70%) for major crops\nHarvesting and threshing operation is the least mechanized (lower than 32%) for major crops except for rice and wheat crops.\nIn seedbed preparation, the mechanization level is higher in rice and wheat crops as compared to other crops.\nHowever, the mechanization level for sowing operations is the highest for wheat crops (65%).\nThe mechanization levels in planting/transplanting operations for sugarcane and rice crops are 20% and 30%, respectively.\nIn the case of harvesting and threshing, the mechanization levels in rice and wheat crops are more than 60% and very less in cotton crops.\n\nFarm power availability in India is estimated at 2.02 kW/hectare. Mechanization level in India is about 40-45 percent with states such as UP, Haryana, and Punjab having very high mechanization levels but north-eastern states having negligible mechanization.\n\nIn the dairy and livestock sector, which is largely integrated with an associated industry, the adoption of mechanization has been more common.\nIn the fisheries sector, the adoption of mechanization has been even more, and it has reaped major benefits.\n\nThe use of improved implements has the potential to increase productivity by up to 30 percent and reduce the cost of cultivation by up to 20 percent. At present, Indian farmers are adopting farm mechanization at a faster rate in comparison to the recent past.\n\nAccording to the World Bank estimates, half of the Indian population would be urban by the year 2050.\n\nIt is estimated that the percentage of agricultural workers in the total workforce would drop to 25.7% by 2050 from 58.2% in 2001.\n\nThus, there is a need to enhance the level of farm mechanization in the country. Due to the intensive involvement of labor in different farm operations, the cost of production of many crops is quite high.\n\nAdvantages of mechanization of Indian agriculture\n\nFarm mechanization or more appropriately agriculture mechanization will have a positive impact in numerous ways-\n\nIt will let off the wage labor as also the farmer of the drudgery involved in manual operations.\nenhanced manpower productivity since skills is integral to machine-based operations.\nEffective use of agriculture machinery helps to increase productivity & production of output, undertake timely farm operations, and enable the farmers to quickly rotate crops on the same land.\nMechanization also helps in animal husbandry, dairying, and fisheries.\nFarm mechanization not only provides optimal utilization of resources e.g., land, labor, and water but helps farmers to save valuable time and also reduces drudgery.\nMechanization results in a shift from \u2018subsistence farming\u2019 to \u2018commercial agriculture. This shift occurs mainly due to the need for more land and capital to be associated with farmers to reap the full technological benefits.\nIt results in a significant modification of the social structure in rural areas. It frees the farmers from much of the laborious, tedious, hard work on the farms. The pressure on land decreases and the status of the farmers improves.\nLimitations for mechanization of Indian agriculture\n\nFarm mechanization and crop productivity have a direct correlation as farm mechanization saves time and labor, reduces drudgery, cut down production costs in the long run, reduces postharvest losses, and boosts crop output and farm income.\n\nHowever, given the scale of India\u2019s agricultural sub-sectors, mechanization is yet to penetrate all across regions and farm types\n\nLack of access to farm power is one of the primary reasons for the slow uptake of farm mechanization and hence the non-intensification of farm productivity, particularly among small and marginal farmers.\nOne of the main limitations to deploying farming machines is the capacity of a farm to efficiently own such equipment.\nFarm equipment is capital-intensive, making it a major investment for small and marginal farmers.\nQuality of after-sale service is another concern due to the inadequacy of proper maintenance in remote regions of rural areas.\nThe unwillingness of commercial banks to finance farm equipment is one of the biggest impediments to the increase in mechanization level in India.\n\nThe basic defect of mechanization is that it will result in too many agricultural workers becoming surplus. Millions of farmers will be thrown out of land and will have to be provided alternative sources of employment.\n\nInitiatives of the Government of India to Promote Farm Mechanization\n\nAgricultural mechanization is crucial in the agriculture sector as it contributes towards improving the efficiency and effectiveness of the inputs used in crop production thereby also increasing the productivity of crops. This also reduces the drudgery associated with various farm operations.\n\nSub Mission on Agricultural Mechanization (SMAM)\n\nTo boost farm mechanization in the country, a special dedicated Centrally Sponsored scheme \u2018Sub Mission on Agricultural Mechanization (SMAM)\u2019 has been introduced by the Government of India in 2014-15.\n\nThe scheme aims at \u2018reaching the unreached\u2019 by making farm machines accessible and affordable for small and marginal farmers (SMFs) through the establishment of Custom Hiring Centers (CHCs), creating Hubs for hi-tech & high-value farm equipment, and Farm Machinery Banks.\nDistribution of various subsidized agricultural equipment and machines to the individual farmer is also one of the activities under the scheme.\nPurchasing farm machines for SMFs is not financially feasible therefore custom hiring institutions provide hiring options for machines to SMFs.\nCreating awareness among stakeholders through the demonstration of machine operations and skill development of farmers and youth and others are also components of SMAM.\nThe performance testing and certification of machines at designated testing centers located all over the country are ensuring farm machinery qualitatively, effectively, and efficiently.\n\nUnder this scheme, financial assistance at 40% to 50% of the cost of machines depending on the categories of farmers, is provided for the purchase of agricultural machines.\n\nFinancial assistance at 40% of the project cost is also provided to rural youth & farmers as an entrepreneur, Cooperative Societies of Farmers, Registered Farmers Societies, Farmer Producer Organizations (FPOs), and Panchayats for the establishment of Custom Hiring Centres (CHCs), and Hi-tech hubs of high-value agricultural machine.\n\nWay forward\n\nBetter mechanization of Indian Agriculture requires more establishment of custom hiring centers and the development of an institutional framework for these centers are essential steps that need to be taken.\n\nMake In India can be used to support local manufacturing of farm implements currently being imported.\n\nCorporate Social Responsibility funds can be used for the capacity-building initiative in the farm equipment space as well as promoting a sustainable agricultural ecosystem.\n\nIt is pertinent to devise a framework that would strengthen the credit policy for farm machinery in India. Credit guarantee fund currently facilitates loans for micro, small, and medium enterprises (MSMEs). Similar models should be devised for the farm machinery sector as well.\n\nAlso read: Agriculture export policy\n\n-Article written by Swathi Satish",

Meghalayan history began between 2190 and 1990 BCE.\nA 200-year drought that affected the Eastern Mediterranean, Mesopotamia, the Indus Valley, and the Yangtze River Valley marked the start of the period.\n\nAlso read: Geohazards and their Management\n\nHow are geologic time scale divisions decided?\n\nA variety of event categories are used to determine the division dates of the numerous eons, eras, periods, epochs, and ages. These occasion categories comprise, but are not restricted to:\n\nThe first occurrence of a species: All biological forms are included in this (plants, animals, bacteria, etc). The \u201cfirst of first\u201d species are of particular interest (e.g., the first oxygen-breathing organism, the first seed-producing plant, and so on).\nKey species going extinct or catastrophic extinctions: A huge number of species going extinct in a short period of geologic time is known as a mass extinction. The Cretaceous-Paleogene extinction event, when most dinosaur species became extinct, is a well-known illustration of mass extinction.\nMajor worldwide climate shifts: when the climate significantly diverges from the average for the time, as during ice ages.\nSupercontinental formation and/or breakup: When all significant landmasses on the surface of the Earth combine to form one landmass, supercontinents are created.\nCatastrophic events: Major catastrophes can result in or set off other occurrences like extinctions and climate change. Major floods, meteorite impacts, and volcanic eruptions are examples of catastrophic catastrophes.\nGlobal magnetic polarity shifts: The planet\u2019s magnetic polarity \u201cflips\u201d on an irregular basis, with the North pole switching places with the South pole.\n\nVarious significant events throughout history have been considered to divide the geologic time scale.\n\nFor instance, a significant portion of Earth\u2019s plant and animal species disappeared during a global extinction that occurred during the transition between the Permian and Triassic periods.\nAnother illustration is the transition from the Precambrian to the Paleozoic, which is shown by the emergence of the first animals with hard parts.\n\n-Article written by Swathi Satish",

The islands of the Antarctic region are:\n\nThe South Orkney Islands, South Shetland Islands, South Georgia, and the South Sandwich Islands, all claimed by the United Kingdom;\nPeter I Island and Bouvet Island, claimed by Norway;\nHeard and McDonald Islands, claimed by Australia;\nScott Island and the Balleny Islands, claimed by New Zealand.\n\nAlso read: Solstice and Equinox\n\nPhysical geography\n\nNote: Subscribe to the ClearIAS YouTube Channel to learn more.\n\nThe Antarctic Ice Sheet is the largest single piece of ice on Earth. The ice surface dramatically grows in size from about three million square kilometers (1.2 million square miles) at the end of summer to about 19 million square kilometers (7.3 million square miles) by winter.\n\nAntarctica has several mountain summits, including the Transantarctic Mountains, which divide the continent into eastern and western regions.\n\nWithout any ice, Antarctica would emerge as a giant peninsula and archipelago of mountainous islands, known as Lesser Antarctica, and a single large landmass about the size of Australia, known as Greater Antarctica.\n\nGreater Antarctica, or East Antarctica, is composed of older, igneous and metamorphic rocks.\nLesser Antarctica, or West Antarctica, is made up of younger, volcanic and sedimentary rock. It is part of the Ring of Fire around the Pacific Ocean.\nMount Erebus, located on Antarctica\u2019s Ross Island, is the southernmost active volcano on Earth.\nClimate and Waters\n\nAntarctica has an extremely cold, dry climate.\n\nWinter temperatures along Antarctica\u2019s coast generally range from -10\u00b0 to -30\u00b0C (14\u00b0 to -22\u00b0F).\nDuring the summer, coastal areas hover around 0\u00b0C (32\u00b0F) but can reach temperatures as high as 9\u00b0C (48\u00b0F).\n\nThe Antarctic region has an important role in global climate processes. It is an integral part of Earth\u2019s heat balance.\n\nIce is more reflective than land or water surfaces. The massive Antarctic Ice Sheet reflects a large amount of solar radiation away from the Earth\u2019s surface.\nAs global ice cover (ice sheets and glaciers) decreases, the reflectivity of Earth\u2019s surface also decreases.\nThis allows more incoming solar radiation to be absorbed by Earth\u2019s surface, causing an unequal heat balance linked to global warming, the current period of climate change.\n\nThe waters surrounding Antarctica are a key part of the \u201cocean conveyor belt,\u201d a global system in which water circulates the globe based on density and currents.\n\nThe cold waters surrounding Antarctica, known as the Antarctic Bottom Water, are so dense that they push against the ocean floor.\nThe Antarctic Bottom Water causes warmer waters to rise, or upwell.\nAntarctic upwelling is so strong that it helps move water around the entire planet. This movement is aided by strong winds that circumnavigate Antarctica. Without the aid of the oceans around Antarctica, Earth\u2019s waters would not circulate in a balanced and efficient manner.\n\nThe Antarctic Ocean was officially recognized as the Southern Ocean by the National Geographic Society in 2021.\n\nFlora and fauna\n\nLichens, mosses, and terrestrial algae are among the few species of vegetation that grow in Antarctica. More of this vegetation grows in the northern and coastal regions of Antarctica, while the interior has little if any vegetation.\n\nThe waters surrounding Antarctica are among the most diverse on the planet. Upwelling allows phytoplankton and algae to flourish.\n\nThousands of species, such as krill, feed on the plankton. Fish and a large variety of marine mammals thrive in the cold Antarctic waters.\nBlue (Balaenoptera musculus), fin (Balaenoptera physalus), humpback (Megaptera novaeangliae), right, minke, sei (Balaenoptera borealis), and sperm whales (Physeter macrocephalus) have healthy populations in Antarctica.\nOne of the top predators in Antarctica is the leopard seal (Hydrurga leptonyx). The leopard seal is one of the most aggressive of all marine predators.\nThe most familiar animal of Antarctica is probably the penguin. They have adapted to the cold, coastal waters.\nThe political history of Antarctica\n\nFor many European and North American powers, Antarctica represented the last great frontier for human exploration. Supported by advances in science and navigation, many explorers took on the \u201cRace for the Antarctic\u201d.\n\nBy the early 20th century, explorers started to traverse the interior of Antarctica. The aim of these expeditions was often more competitive than scientific. Explorers wanted to win the \u201cRace to the South Pole\u201d more than understand Antarctica\u2019s environment.\nBecause early explorers confronted extreme obstacles and debilitating conditions, this period became known as the \u201cHeroic Age\u201d.\n\nThe second half of the 20th century was a time of change initially fueled by the Cold War, a period defined by the division between the United States and the Soviet Union, and the threat of nuclear war.\n\nThe International Geophysical Year (IGY) of 1957-58 aimed to end Cold War divisions among the scientific community by promoting global scientific exchange.\n\nThe IGY prompted an intense period of scientific research in the Antarctic. Many countries conducted their first Antarctic explorations and constructed the first research stations in Antarctica.\n\nTo prevent conflict over Antarctica, an international treaty governing the usage of the continent was negotiated by a dozen nations, including the United States, the Soviet Union, and other major powers.\n\nThe Antarctic Treaty was agreed upon in 1959 and entered into force in 1961. Today, 47 nations have signed the treaty.\nThe treaty established that \u2018the region south of 60\u00b0S latitude remain politically neutral; no nation or group of people can claim any part of the Antarctic as territory; countries cannot use the region for military purposes or to dispose of radioactive waste, and research can only be done for peaceful purposes.\u2019\nThe Antarctic Treaty was an important geopolitical milestone because it was the first arms control agreement established during the Cold War.\n\nThe Antarctic Treaty does support territorial claims made before 1961, by New Zealand, Australia, France, Norway, the United Kingdom, Chile, and Argentina. Under the treaty, the size of these claims cannot be changed and new claims cannot be made.\n\nResearch in Antarctica\n\nWhile the Antarctic does not have permanent human residents, the region is a busy outpost for a variety of research scientists.\n\nThese scientists work at government-supported research stations and come from dozens of different countries.\nThe number of scientists conducting research varies throughout the year, from about 1,000 in winter to around 5,000 in summer.\nThe exploration of Antarctica began in the early 1800s.\nIn 1984, a meteorite from Mars was found in Antarctica. The markings on this meteorite were similar to markings left by bacteria on Earth.\n\nResearchers from a variety of scientific backgrounds study the Antarctic not only as a unique environment but also as an indicator of broader global processes.\n\nGeographers map the surface of the world\u2019s coldest and most isolated continent.\nMeteorologists study climate patterns, including the \u201cozone hole\u201d that opens over the Antarctic.\nClimatologists track the history of Earth\u2019s climate using ice cores from Antarctica\u2019s pristine ice sheet.\nMarine biologists study the behavior of marine fauna especially whales, seals, and squid.\nAstronomers make observations from Antarctica\u2019s interior because it offers the clearest view of space from Earth.\nEven astrobiologists, who study the possibility of life outside Earth\u2019s atmosphere, study materials found in the Antarctic.\nIndian Antarctic Programme\n\nThe National Centre for Polar and Ocean Research (NCPOR), inside the Ministry of Earth Sciences of India, is in charge of the multidisciplinary Indian Antarctic Programme.\n\nThe first Indian expedition to Antarctica was in 1981.\n\nThe initiative acquired acceptability on a global scale after India signed the Antarctic Treaty in 1983 and built the Dakshin Gangotri Antarctic research outpost, which was replaced by the Maitri site in 1989.\nBharati, a base made of 134 shipping containers, was the most recent one to be put into service in 2012.\nIndia, which has made 40 scientific excursions to the Antarctic, is studying atmospheric, biological, earth, chemical, and medicinal sciences as part of the program.\n\nRead here: Indian Antarctic Bill 2022\n\nFuture concerns\n\nTwo important and related issues that concern the Antarctic region are climate change and tourism.\n\nAntarctic tourism has grown substantially in the last decade.\n\nOfficials worked closely with the International Association of Antarctica Tour Operators (IAATO) to establish better practices that would reduce the carbon footprint and environmental impact of tour ships.\nThe system hopes to encourage sustainable tourism to reduce the environmental impacts of the sensitive ecosystem.\n\nClimate change disproportionately affects the Antarctic region, as evidenced by reductions in the size of the Antarctic Ice Sheet and the warming waters off the coast.\n\nOver the past 50 years, the west coast of the Antarctic Peninsula has been one of the most rapidly warming parts of the planet.\nIt has now been established that the Antarctic Circumpolar Current is warming more rapidly than the global ocean as a whole.\nThe warming of the Antarctic Peninsula is causing changes to the physical and living environment of Antarctica.\nThe distribution of penguin colonies has changed as the sea ice conditions alter.\nThe melting of perennial snow and ice covers has resulted in increased colonization by plants.\nMany glaciers have retreated and ice shelves that formerly fringed the Peninsula have been observed to retreat in recent years and some have collapsed completely.\nEast Antarctic plateau is changing wind and ocean-current patterns around the continent, and ozone-destroying industrial chemicals have caused a hole in the ozone layer to open above the continent.\n\nThe Antarctic has become a symbol of climate change. Scientists and policymakers are focusing on changes in this environmentally sensitive region to push for its protection and the sustainable use of its scientific resources.\n\nWinter heatwave in Antarctica\n\nThe temperatures are currently in the range of minus 25 degrees to minus 30 degrees Celsius in parts of East Antarctica, the relatively higher-elevation swathe that makes up two-thirds of the world\u2019s coldest continent.\n\nFor the second time in two years, a record-breaking heatwave is sweeping through Antarctica at the height of its winter season.\nGround temperatures have been 10 degrees Celsius higher than normal on average since mid-July, and up to 28 degrees higher on certain days.\nDeep-winter temperatures here usually vary between minus 50 degrees and 60 degrees Celsius.\nScientists believe that the higher temperatures are mainly a consequence of the weakening of the polar vortex, the band of cold air and low-pressure systems that spins around the poles of the Earth in the stratosphere.\nThe vortex usually remains strong and stable during winter in the southern hemisphere, keeping cold air trapped over Antarctica and not letting hot air come in. Still, it has been disturbed this year by large-scale atmospheric waves (periodic disturbances in the fields of atmospheric variables).\n\nRead:\u00a0Polar Code\n\n-Article written by Swathi Satish",

    "[CONTENT] #240": "What are the different theories related to the origin of the earth? Read further to know more.\n\nDifferent philosophers and scientists put forth a large number of hypotheses regarding the origin of the earth.\n\nOne of the earlier and popular arguments known as the Nebular Hypothesis was given by German philosopher Immanuel Kant, and later in 1796 Mathematician Laplace revised it. As per the hypothesis, the planets were formed out of a cloud of material associated with a youthful sun, which was slowly rotating.\n\nLater, it was believed by the arguments called binary theories that the sun had a companion that coexisted with it. \u00a0Otto Schmidt in Russia and Carl Weizascar in Germany each made some revisions to the \u201cnebular hypothesis\u201d in 1950, but with slightly different details.\n\nThey considered that the sun was surrounded by a solar nebula containing mostly hydrogen and helium along with dust. The friction and collision of particles led to the creation of a disk-shaped cloud and the planets were formed through the process of accretion. Later on, however, scientists began to focus on the origin of the universe as opposed to only the formation of the earth or the planets.\n\nTable of Contents\n\nModern Theories of Origin of the Universe\nThe Star Formation\nFormation of Planets\nOrigin of the Earth\nEvolution of Lithosphere\nEvolution of Atmosphere and Hydrosphere\nFurther Contribution\nOrigin of Life\nModern Theories of Origin of the Universe\n\nThe most popular argument regarding the origin of the universe is the Big Bang Theory which is also called expanding universe hypothesis. Edwin Hubble, in 1920, provided evidence that the universe is expanding and with the passage of time, galaxies move further and further apart.\n\n\ud83d\udc49 Which year are YOU targeting for success in the IAS/IPS/IFS Exam? \ud83d\ude80\n\n(1) \u21d2 UPSC 2025: Prelims cum Mains\n\n(2) \u21d2 UPSC 2026: Prelims cum Mains\n\n(3) \u21d2 UPSC 2027 Prelims cum Mains\n\nTip: Know more about ClearIAS Courses (Online/Offline)\n\nAs per the Big Bang Theory, the following stages are in the development of the universe.\n\nIn the beginning, all matter forming the universe existed in one place in the form of a \u201ctiny ball\u201d (singular atom) with an unimaginably small volume, infinite temperature, and infinite density.\nThe \u201ctiny ball\u201d exploded violently and this led to a huge expansion. Nowadays, it is generally accepted that the big band event happened 13.7 billion years ago. Even today, the expansion is still going on. As it grew, some energy was converted into matter.\u00a0 Immediately following the bang, there was an especially rapid\u00a0expansion. The expansion has since slowed considerably. The first atom started to form within the first three minutes after the Big Bang.\nWithin 300,000 years from the Big Bang, the temperature dropped to 4,500K (Kelvin) and gave rise to atomic matter. The universe became transparent.\nThe Star Formation\n\nEven in the early universe, there was no distribution of matter and energy. The early variations in densities led to variations in gravitational forces, which brought the matter together. These served as the foundation for the development of galaxies.\n\nA galaxy has a large number of stars in it. A galaxy starts to form through the accumulation of hydrogen gas in the form of a very large cloud called a nebula.\n\nEventually, the growing nebula develops localized clumps of gas. These clumps continue to grow into even denser gaseous bodies, giving rise to the formation of stars. Such formation of stars is believed to happen some 5-6 billion years ago.\n\nFormation of Planets\n\nTo understand the origin of the earth, knowledge of the formation of the planet is important. The stages in the development of planets are:\n\nAs the stars are localized lumps of gas within a nebula, the gravitational force within the lumps leads to the formation of a core to the gas cloud.\nThe gas cloud begins to condense in the following stage, and the material surrounding the core transforms into tiny spherical shapes. The cohesion process transforms these small, spherical objects into planetesimals. Gravitational attraction causes the material to stick together as larger bodies begin to form as a result of collisions.\nIn the final stage, these large numbers of small planetesimals accrete to form fewer large bodies in the form of planets.\nOrigin of the Earth\n\nEarth was originally a hot, rocky, and barren object with a thin atmosphere of hydrogen and helium. This is far from the present-day picture of the earth.\u00a0 Therefore, there must have been some occasions or processes that led to the transition from a rocky, barren, and hot earth to a planet with an abundance of water and an environment that is favorable to the existence of life.\n\nThe structure of the earth is layered. The material that is present is not uniform from the outermost end\u00a0of the atmosphere to its centre. The atmospheric matter has the least density.\u00a0The interior of the earth is divided into different zones that extend from the surface to greater depths, and each of them contains materials with special characteristics.\n\nAlso read: Leap Year: How does it work?\n\nEvolution of Lithosphere\n\nThe earth was mostly in a volatile state during its primordial stage. The temperature inside has increased due to a gradual increase in density. Because of that, the material inside the earth started getting separated according to their densities.\n\nThis process made heavier materials (like iron) sink towards the center and lighter materials move towards the surface. With time it cooled further and solidified and condensed into a smaller size.\n\nThis later led to the formation of the outer surface which is known as the crust.\n\nAlso read: Indian Ocean Geoid Low\n\nEvolution of Atmosphere and Hydrosphere\n\nThe present composition of the atmosphere of the earth is chiefly made by the composition of nitrogen and oxygen. There are three stages in the evolution of the present atmosphere.\n\nThe first stage is marked by the loss of the primordial atmosphere.\nIn the second stage, the hot interior of the earth contributed to the evolution of the atmosphere.\nFinally, the composition of the atmosphere was modified by the living world through the process of photosynthesis.\nFurther Contribution\n\nRole of Solar Winds: According to the theory, the early atmosphere, dominated by hydrogen and helium has been stripped off as a result of the solar winds.\n\nDegassing: During the cooling of the earth, gases and water vapor were released from the interior solid earth. which contributes to the evolution of the present atmosphere. Water vapor, nitrogen, carbon dioxide, methane, ammonia, and relatively little free oxygen made up the majority of the early atmosphere. Degassing is the term used to describe the procedure that released the inside gases.\n\nCondensation: Continuous volcanic eruptions released water vapor and gases into the atmosphere. As the earth cooled, the released water vapor started getting condensed. As the temperature decreased over time, more condensation formed and more rain fell as the carbon dioxide in the atmosphere was dissolved in the rainwater. The rainwater started getting collected in the depressions to give rise to oceans.\n\nOrigin of Life\n\nThe last phase in the evolution or origin of the earth relates to the origin and evolution of life. Initially, the earth or even the atmosphere of the earth was not conducive to the development of life. Scientists refer to the origin of life as a kind of chemical reaction, that first generated complex organic molecules and then assembled them. The assemblage suggested that the organic molecules could duplicate themselves.\n\nThe record of life that existed on this planet in different periods is found in rocks in the form of fossils. There have been discoveries of tiny structures that are closely akin to the current form of blue algae in geological formations that are much older than 3,000 million years. Based on that it is assumed that life began to evolve sometime 3,800 million years ago.\n\nArticle Written By: Priti Raj",

    "[CONTENT] #243": "What are Ocean Water Circulation and deep ocean/water circulation? Check all the information in detail here.\n\nOcean circulation is one of the major elements of climate, moving heat, freshwater, nutrients, and dissolved gases. Ocean circulation at the largest spatial scales and long-time scales contains many elements that are in common in the different oceans. The ocean circulation is forced by:\n\nA fast and energetic wind-driven surface circulation: The winds, through a thin frictional layer called the Ekman layer and through the response of the interior ocean to mass, convergences, and divergences in this layer, and\nA slow and large density-driven circulation dominates the deep sea: Heating and cooling that change the temperature and processes that change the amount of fresh water and hence the salinity.\n\nTable of Contents\n\nDeep Water Circulation\nWhere does the Deep Ocean Circulation Occur?\nImportance of Deep Water Circulation\nFactors Influencing Circulation\nDeep Water Circulation in the Indian Ocean\nConclusion\nDeep Water Circulation\n\nDeep Water Circulation is also called \u2018thermohaline\u2019 circulation because of the role of heating, cooling, freshening, and salification in producing regional density differences within the ocean.\n\nThe slow and deep water circulation is largely driven by water density, and thus its temperature and salinity. Whereas the thermohaline circulation or deep water/ocean circulation is forced by heating and cooling which is overshadowed by the wind-driven circulation.\n\nThe thermohaline circulation, for the most part, is an \u2018overturning\u2019 circulation in which warm water flows poleward near the surface and is subsequently converted into cold, dense water that sinks and flows equatorward in the interior.\n\nAlso read: Movements of ocean water: Waves, Tides and Ocean Currents\n\nWhere does the Deep Ocean Circulation Occur?\n\nDeep Ocean Circulation can only be formed in extremely cold regions where the air temperature is low enough to make the surface water exceedingly cold, highly salty, and denser than the water beneath it.\n\n\ud83d\udc49 Which year are YOU targeting for success in the IAS/IPS/IFS Exam? \ud83d\ude80\n\n(1) \u21d2 UPSC 2025: Prelims cum Mains\n\n(2) \u21d2 UPSC 2026: Prelims cum Mains\n\n(3) \u21d2 UPSC 2027 Prelims cum Mains\n\nTip: Know more about ClearIAS Courses (Online/Offline)\n\nDeep currents hence generally form in higher latitude areas of the Earth, such as the North Atlantic Deep Water and Antarctic Bottom Water, and they move relatively slowly toward the equator from these icy poleward regions.\n\nNo deep water is formed at the sea surface in the North Pacific or northern Indian Ocean. The global thermohaline circulation thus consists of two intersecting cells, one with a sinking in the North Atlantic and the other with a sinking in the Antarctic.\n\nImportance of Deep Water Circulation\n\nHeat Distribution: It transports heat poleward into high latitudes. The thermohaline circulation is thought to be vulnerable to the warming and freshening of the Earth\u2019s polar regions.\n\nMaintaining Carbon Dioxide Levels: It plays a crucial part in regulating the amount of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere by helping in the transportation of carbon from the surface to the deep ocean, where it can be stored for a long time.\n\nNutrition Distribution: The upwelling branch of the thermohaline circulation is important for the ocean\u2019s biota as it brings nutrient-rich deep water up to the surface.\n\nOcean Currents: They are in charge of shaping\u00a0the global oceans\u2019 circulation patterns as well as the ocean currents themselves. The marine ecosystem, weather patterns, and coastal regions are all impacted by these currents.\n\nFactors Influencing Circulation\n\nIce: The distribution of heat to the polar regions is largely dependent on thermohaline circulation. It affects the rate of sea ice formation close to the polar regions, which has an effect on other components of the climate system (such as the albedo).\n\nWind: Wind currents are the main force behind the movement of the ocean\u2019s surface layer. When surface water sinks into the deep ocean, the deep water is forced to move horizontally until it can find a region on the globe where it can rise back to the surface and complete its circulation loop.\n\nGreat Salinity Anomaly: When sea ice moves through the Fram Strait into the North Atlantic, it melts and leaves a layer of fresh water on the ocean\u2019s surface. Since it is less dense than saline water, this freshwater tends to remain at the surface of the ocean. This lower density deters the normal process of sinking at high latitudes that supports thermohaline circulation, which makes it more difficult for the northern movement of warm water from the equator.\n\nDeep Water Circulation in the Indian Ocean\n\nThere are no significant deep-water formations in the Indian Ocean on its own. It only serves as a host for Atlantic and Antarctic Bottom Water (AABW) and Northern Component Water (NCW).\n\nMoreover, the northern parts of the Indian Ocean are located at one of the terminal ends of the Global Overturning Circulation (GOC), far away from the deep-water formation regions and oceanic seaways.\n\nFew studies have been conducted in the Indian Ocean to reconstruct past deep water circulations based on iron-manganese crust records and the authigenic neodymium isotope composition of sediment cores.\n\nHowever, authigenic neodymium isotope records are only accessible from the Bay of Bengal region, and iron-manganese crusts are found at greater depths and are only bathed by Atlantic and Antarctic Bottom Water (AABW), making it suitable only for the reconstruction of the history of AABW.\n\nHowever, they too cannot help as the Himalayan rivers that flow into the Bay also carry a substantial amount of Neodymium particulates.\n\nA recent study named Nature Communications, made by a team of researchers from the Goa-based National Centre for Polar and Ocean Research and the School of Earth, Ocean and Atmospheric Sciences at Goa University brings light on the issue.\n\nThe record demonstrates a clear shift from the Pacific water-dominated deep circulation system about nine million years ago, to the onset of a modern-like deep water circulation system in the Indian Ocean which includes Antarctic bottom water and northern component water during the Miocene-Pliocene transition (about six million years ago).\n\nOur discovery suggests a widespread impact of the late Miocene Central American Seaway closure on the evolution of ocean deep water circulation and validates the so-called Panama Closure Hypothesis.\n\nConclusion\n\nFishermen, traders, and navies have all shown a practical interest in the ocean\u2019s circulation. Curiosity about currents below the ocean\u2019s surface led to more in-depth descriptions of the ocean as a three-dimensional fluid as our understanding of ocean currents and our ability to see it below the surface increased.\n\nThe processes that govern the circulation are now well understood as a result of these observations. In this era of increasing concern over the Earth\u2019s climate, understanding ocean circulation is just as important as understanding air circulation and the biosphere.\n\nAlong with it is important to increase the capacity to study and predict it with ever-improved computer resolution and power.\n\nArticle Written By: Priti Raj",

    "[CONTENT] #246": "\nJoshimath, a vital hub for travelers heading to Badrinath and Hemkund Sahib, saw fissures in the ground as a result of land subsidence, which sparked alarm and demonstrations among the local populace. What is Land Subsidence? How does it impact the daily life of people? Read further to know more.\n\nLand subsidence is defined as the downward, vertical movement of the Earth\u2019s surface, which can be brought on by both natural and human forces. Land subsidence differs from slope movement in that it requires little to no horizontal movement.\u00a0\n\nSubsidence can be caused by mining, pumping subsurface fluids like groundwater or petroleum, or tectonic forces that bend the Earth\u2019s crust.\n\nThese processes include groundwater dissolving underlying carbonate rock, gradual compaction of sediments, withdrawal of fluid lava from beneath a solidified rock crust, and pumping subsurface fluids like groundwater or petroleum.\n\nTectonic subsidence, which results from the crust\u2019s tectonic deformation, can provide space for sediment to build up and eventually lithify into sedimentary rock.\u00a0\n\nGeologists, geotechnical engineers, surveyors, engineers, urban planners, landowners, and the general public are all concerned about ground sinking on a global scale.\n\nTable of Contents\n\nCauses of Land Subsidence\nDissolution of limestone\nMining\nExtraction of Petroleum and Natural gas\nEarthquake\nGroundwater Related Subsidence\nFaulting induced Subsidence\nSeasonal Effects\nLand subsidence in Joshimath\nImpacts of Land subsidence\nSolutions To Reduce Land Subsidence\nSlope stabilization\nPlanting vegetation\nControl of drainage\nStrengthening foundations\nPlanning and zoning\nConclusion\nCauses of Land Subsidence\n\nThe following are the causes of land subsidence.\n\n\ud83d\udc49 Which year are YOU targeting for success in the IAS/IPS/IFS Exam? \ud83d\ude80\n\n(1) \u21d2 UPSC 2025: Prelims cum Mains\n\n(2) \u21d2 UPSC 2026: Prelims cum Mains\n\n(3) \u21d2 UPSC 2027 Prelims cum Mains\n\nTip: Know more about ClearIAS Courses (Online/Offline)\n\nDissolution of limestone\n\nIn karst terrains, where the degradation of limestone by fluid flow in the subsurface forms voids, subsidence frequently results in significant issues (i.e., caves).\n\n\u00a0Sinkholes that can be hundreds of meters deep can be created by this form of subsidence.\n\nMining\n\nSurface subsidence is a result of a number of subsurface mining techniques, particularly those that deliberately induce the extracted void to collapse such as pillar extraction, longwall mining, and any metalliferous mining technique that includes \u201ccaving,\u201d such as \u201cblock caving\u201d or \u201csub-level caving\u201d.\n\n\u00a0Mining-induced subsidence is reasonably predictable in its degree, appearance, and scope (usually very old workings).\n\nMining-related subsidence generally always only affects the region immediately above the mined area and a margin on all sides.\n\nThe worst damage to the natural environment, structures, and infrastructure is typically caused by the associated surface compressive and tensile strains, curvature, tilts, and horizontal displacement rather than the vertical magnitude of the subsidence itself, with the exception of drainage (including natural drainage).\n\nExtraction of Petroleum and Natural gas\n\nThe initial pressure in a natural gas field, which can reach 60 MPa (600 bar), will decrease over time if natural gas is collected from it.\n\nThe soil layers above the field are supported by pressure. If the gas is extracted, the compacted sediment caused by the overburden pressure could cause earthquakes and ground subsidence.\n\nPetroleum extraction can also result in considerable subsidence. Over the course of 34 years of petroleum extraction, the city of Long Beach, California, has seen 9 meters (30 ft) of elevation change, causing over $100 million in damage to the area\u2019s infrastructure.\n\nEarthquake\n\nVarious factors might contribute to land subsidence during an earthquake. Because of offset along fault lines, substantial sections of land are susceptible to abrupt subsidence during an earthquake.\n\nAnother cause of land subsidence is the settling and compacting of loose sediment brought on by an earthquake\u2019s shaking.\n\nGroundwater Related Subsidence\n\nThe sinking of land caused by the extraction of groundwater is referred to as groundwater-related subsidence.\n\nWithout sufficient pumping control and enforcement, it is becoming a bigger issue in developing countries as cities\u2019 populations and water usage rise.\n\nAccording to one estimate, excessive groundwater extraction is to blame for 80% of major land subsidence issues,\u00a0making it a global issue that is getting worse.\n\nThe degradation of organic matter can also be indirectly impacted by changes in groundwater levels. Lowlands, like coastal or delta plains, need to be drained in order to support human habitation.\n\nThe resultant oxygenation of the soil causes its organic constituents, including peat, to oxidize, and this process of decomposition may result in severe land subsidence.\n\nIn order to maintain ideal unsaturated zone depths and expose more and more peat to oxygen, this is particularly true when groundwater levels are frequently adjusted to subsidence.\n\nFaulting induced Subsidence\n\nWhen there are differential stresses in the Earth, they can be accommodated either by ductile flow in the hotter and more fluid mantle or by geological faulting in the brittle crust.\n\nAbsolute subsidence may happen in the normal faults\u2019 hanging wall where faults are present. The footwall can be used to measure relative subsidence in reversal or thrust faults.\n\nSeasonal Effects\n\nClay is present in large amounts in many soils. Changes in the moisture content of the soil have an impact on them because of the very small particle size.\n\nThe volume and surface of the soil are reduced as a result of seasonal drying. Building foundations move if they are over the level attained by seasonal drying, which could cause damage to the structure in the form of tapering cracks.\n\nThe seasonal drying of soils can be significantly influenced locally by trees and other vegetation. As the tree matures over several years, a cumulative drying takes place. When the tree deteriorates or is cut down, this may result in the reverse of sinking, known as heave or expansion of the soil.\n\nLand subsidence in Joshimath\n\nLand subsidence has occurred in Joshimath as a result of the town\u2019s geological location and the haphazard and widespread development that has taken place there and nearby.\n\nBecause Joshimath was constructed over the remnants of a previous landslide, even small triggers might cause the slopes to become unstable.\n\nIn India\u2019s seismic zonation plan, the town is also in Zone V, which denotes the highest danger.\n\nIt occupies a seismically active terrain because it is sandwiched between the Main Central Thrust (MCT) and the Vaikrita Thrust (VT).\n\nJoshimath is additionally vulnerable to severe weather because it is climatologically located in an area that commonly experiences concentrated, high-intensity rains.\n\nExtreme rainfall, for instance, might cause landslides because of how dangerously balanced the slopes are.\n\nJoshimath is a sand and stone deposit, thus it was not a good location to build a city since vibrations from blasting and excessive traffic would also cause natural variables to be out of balance.\n\n561 homes have reported cracks, and at least 66 families have left the area. According to a government official, more than 3000 people have been impacted thus far.\n\nImpacts of Land subsidence\nThe combined consequences of climate change (expressed as sea level rise, storm intensification, and storm surge), land subsidence, and increased urbanization lead to making sinking cities.\nDue to the city\u2019s inadequate drainage systems, land subsidence can result in the settlement of clay on upper levels, damaging the city\u2019s infrastructure (roads, bridges), and causing flood risk.\nAccording to experts, it might undermine buildings, including homes and other infrastructure, as well as cause fractures to appear in the foundations of the structures.\nWater management disturbance and associated repercussions such as changes in the gradient of streams, canals, drains, increased seawater intrusion, and increased pump power.\nFarmland production in deltaic areas has declined as a result of a reduction in freshwater availability caused by an increase in saltwater intrusion, coming from a reduction in land elevation caused by land subsidence.\nThe cessation of ground sinking can sometimes result in unexpected environmental issues.\nSolutions To Reduce Land Subsidence\n\nThe following are the various solutions\n\nSlope stabilization\n\nUsing methods like terracing or erecting retaining walls, slopes can be stabilized in order to prevent landslides and erosion.\n\nPlanting vegetation\n\nVegetation planting on slopes can aid in soil stabilization and erosion prevention. Slope stabilization is particularly effective with trees and other deep-rooted plants.\n\nControl of drainage\n\nIn hilly areas, it is crucial to effectively manage and maintain drainage systems since poor drainage can cause the land to sag. Installing culverts or other drainage systems may be necessary to direct water away from slopes and stop erosion.\n\nStrengthening foundations\n\nBuildings in mountainous communities may occasionally need to have their foundations reinforced in order to stop them from sliding or collapsing. This can entail adding strength to the foundations or underpinning them.\n\nPlanning and zoning\n\nWith careful planning and zoning, structures can be kept out of locations that are vulnerable to landslides or erosion. In order to do this, certain regions could need to be declared no-build zones or high-risk areas might need to use special construction methods.\n\nConclusion\n\nDue to the slow progression and regional nature of ground subsidence, it is simple for people from all walks of life to become unaware of its negative effects, and there is still room for improvement in the general public\u2019s understanding of the significance of ground settlement prevention and treatment.\n\nTo achieve this, we should intensify our public relations and education efforts to better inform the public about the risks that land subsidence poses to the nation\u2019s economy, society, and way-of-life, and to increase the general public\u2019s comprehension of and support measures to prevent and control it.\n\nArticle written by: Aryadevi E S",

Forms mean topographic features or geometric features (relief features) of the earth\u2019s surface.\n\nThe Earth and its Evolution\n\n\u00a0The following are the theories about the origin of the earth\n\nOrigin of Earth\n\nThere are a number of hypotheses regarding the origin of the Earth. Some of them are the following:\n\nNebular Hypothesis \u2013 This theory is developed by Immanuel Kant and later modified by Laplace. The hypothesis considered that the planets were formed out of a cloud of material associated with a youthful sun, which was slowly rotating.\nBinary Hypothesis \u2013 In 1900, Chamberlain and Moulton gave this theory. According to this theory, another wandering star approached the sun. As a result, the material\u2019s cigar-shaped extension from the solar surface was separated.\nIn 1950, Otto Schmidt in Russia and Carl Weizascar in Germany somewhat revised the \u2018nebular hypothesis\u2019, though differing in details. They considered that the sun was surrounded by a solar nebula containing mostly hydrogen and helium along with what may be termed dust.\nModern Theories \u2013 Most accepted argument about the origin of the Universe is the Big Bang Theory and Edwin Hubble provided evidence that the universe is expanding. According to The Big Bang Theory, At the beginning(13.7 Billion years ago) all the matter-forming universe existed in a tiny ball (called singularity) with infinite density. This tiny ball exploded and gradually galaxies and stars were formed.\n\nA galaxy starts to form through the accumulation of hydrogen gas in the form of a very large cloud called a Nebula. These Nebula gave rise to the formation of Stars and later small rounded objects called planetesimals. These large numbers of small bodies accrete to form fewer large bodies in the form of planets.\n\nEvolution of Earth\n\n\u00a0The Earth was mostly in a volatile state during its primordial stage. Due to a gradual increase in density, the temperature inside has increased. As a result, the inside started getting separated depending on their densities. Through the process of differentiation that the earth-forming material got separated into different layers like the crust, mantle, and core.\n\nInterior of the Earth\n\nSources to find out the interior of Earth:\n\nDirect source \u2013 Mining areas, Projects such as \u201cDeep Ocean Drilling Project\u201d, Volcanic eruption, etc.\nIndirect source \u2013 Meteors, gravitation, magnetic field, seismic activities, etc.\n\nFor instance \u2013\n\nEarthquake \u2013 The study of seismic waves provides a complete picture of the layered interior. All natural earthquakes take place in the lithosphere(A portion of depth up to 200 km from the surface of the earth). There are two types of body waves called P waves and S waves.\u00a0 P waves are similar to sound waves and can travel through gaseous, solid, and liquid materials while S waves can travel through only solid states. Hence by the study of these waves, we can understand the interior of Earth.\n\nHence shadow zones of P and S waves tell us that the interior of the earth has different layers with different densities.\n\nStructure of the Earth:\n\nThe earth is made up of the following layers-\n\nLayer\n\t\nThickness and density\n\t\nOther features\n\n\nThe Crust\n\n1.\u00a0\u00a0 Oceanic crust\n\n2.\u00a0\u00a0 Continental Crust\n\n\t\n\u00a0\n\n5 Km. and 2.7g/cm3\n\n\u00a0\n\n30 Km and 3 g/cm3\n\n\t\nOutermost solid part or the earth. The oceanic crust is thinner as compared to the continental layer.\n\nThe oceanic crust is basaltic rock.\n\n\n\nThe Mantle\n\t\n\u00a02900 km. and 3.4g/cm3\n\t\nThe upper portion of the mantle is called the asthenosphere and extends up to 400 km.\n\nThe Crust and uppermost part of the Mantle are called the lithosphere(from 10 km to 200 km).\n\n\n\nThe Core\n\t\n6300 km and 13g/cm3\n\t\nThe earthquake wave velocities helped in understanding the existence of the core of the earth.\n\nThe core is made up of very heavy material mostly composed of nickel and iron.\n\nDistribution of Oceans and Continents\n\n\u00a0Oceans cover around 71% of the earth\u2019s surface and the rest is under continents. The positions of the continents and the ocean bodies, as we see them today, have not been the same in the past.\n\nContinental drift theory\n\u00a0Given by Alfred Wegener in 1912.\nAll continents formed a single continental mass(PANGEA), a mega ocean(PANTHALASSA) surrounded by the same.\nAround 200 million years ago, the supercontinent broke into two large land masses s Laurasia and Gondwanaland.\nSubsequently, These landmasses continued to break into various smaller continents that exist today.\nEvidence includes The matching of continents (Jigsaw fit), Rock of the same age across the oceans, Tillite, Placer deposits etc.\nForce for drifting \u2013 Pole \u2013 fleeing force due to rotation of the earth and tidal force due to the attraction of the Sun and Moon.\nScholars rejected this theory because they considered these forces to be totally inadequate.\nConventional Current Theory\n\u00a0This theory was given by Arthur Holmes in the 1930s.\nThese currents are generated due to radioactive elements causing thermal differences in the mantle portion.\nHolmes argued that there exists a system of such currents in the entire mantle portion.\nThis was an attempt to provide an explanation for the issue of force.\nConcept of Sea Floor spreading\n\nConventional current theory, mapping of the ocean floor, and the concept of Continental drift theory revealed that\n\nAll along the mid-oceanic ridges, volcanic eruptions are common and they bring huge amounts of lava to the surface in this area.\nThe rocks equidistant on either side of the crest of mid-oceanic ridges show remarkable similarities in terms of the period of formation, chemical compositions, and magnetic properties.\nRocks closer to the mid-oceanic ridges have normal polarity and are the youngest. The age of the rocks increases as one moves away from the crest.\nThe ocean rock is much younger than the continental rocks.\nThe deep trenches have deep-seated earthquake occurrences while in the mid-oceanic ridge areas, the quake foci have shallow depths.\n\nThese facts and a detailed analysis of the magnetic properties of the rocks on either side of the mid-oceanic ridge led Hess (1961) to propose his hypothesis, known as the \u201cseafloor spreading\u201d. Hess argued that constant eruptions at the crest of oceanic ridges cause the rupture of the oceanic crust and the new lava wedges into it, pushing the oceanic crust on either side. The ocean floor thus spreads.\n\nPlate tectonics\n\u00a0Given by McKenzie and Parker and also Morgan.\nA tectonic plate (lithospheric Plate) is a massive, irregularly-shaped slab of solid rock, generally composed of both continental and oceanic lithosphere.\nPlates move horizontally over the asthenosphere as rigid units.\nThe theory of plate tectonics proposes that the earth\u2019s lithosphere is divided into seven major and some minor plates.\nThese plates have been constantly moving over the globe throughout the history of the Earth.\nIt is not a continent that moves as believed by Wegener. Continents are part of a plate and what moves is the plate.\nThe mobile rock beneath the rigid plates is believed to be moving in a circular manner. The heated material rises to the surface, spreads and begins to cool, and then sinks back deeper to generate what scientists call a conventional cell.\nHeat within the Earth comes from two main sources \u2013 Radioactive decay and residual heat.\nMinerals and Rocks\n\nThe earth is composed of various kinds of elements. These elements are in solid form in the outer layer of the earth and in hot and molten form in the interior.\n\nMajor Elements of the Earth\u2019s Crust:\n\nThe elements in the earth\u2019s crust are rarely found exclusively but are usually combined with the other elements and such combinations are called Minerals. Eg. Feldspar, Quartz, etc.\n\nRocks\n\nA rock is an aggregate of one or more minerals. There are the following types of rocks \u2013\n\nIGNEOUS ROCKS\n\n\u00a0An igneous rock forms out of magma and lava from the interior of the earth, also known as primary rock.\n\nEg. Granite, Gabbro, Basalts.\n\nSEDIMENTARY ROCKS\n\n\u00a0Rocks (igneous, sedimentary and metamorphic) of the earth\u2019s surface are exposed to denudational agents and are broken up into various sizes of fragments. Such fragments are transported by different exogenous agencies and deposited. These deposits through compaction turn into rocks. This process is called lithification.\n\nEg. Sandstone, coal, limestone, chert, etc.\n\nRead:\u00a0Sedimentary Basins of India\n\nMETAMORPHIC ROCKS\n\n\u00a0These rocks form under the action of pressure, volume, and temperature (PVT) change.\u00a0 Metamorphism occurs when rocks are forced down to lower levels by tectonic processes or when molten magma rising through the crust comes in contact with the crustal rocks or the underlying rocks are subjected to great amounts of pressure by overlying rocks. Metamorphism is a process by which already consolidated rocks undergo recrystallization and reorganization of materials within the original rocks.\n\nEg. Granite, syenite, slate schist, etc.\n\nRocks do not remain in their original form for long but may undergo transformation. The Rock cycle is a process through which old rocks are transformed into new ones.\n\nGeomorphic Process\n\nThe external forces are known as exogenic forces and the internal forces are known as endogenic forces these forces cause physical stresses and chemical actions on earth materials and bring about changes in the configuration of the surface of the earth are known as geomorphic processes.\n\nEndogenic Forces\n\nVarious endogenic forces include:\n\nDiastrophism \u2013 \u00a0All the processes that move, elevate or build up portions of the earth\u2019s crust.\n\nEg. Orogenic Process \u2013 Mountain building\n\nEpeirogenic Process \u2013 Uplift or wrapping of a large part of the earth\u2019s crust\n\nVolcanism\u2013 Volcanism includes the movement of molten rock onto or toward the earth\u2019s surface and also the formation of many intrusive and extrusive volcanic forms.\nExogenic Process\n\nExamples of exogenic processes include weathering, mass movement, erosion, deposition, etc.\n\nAll the exogenic processes are covered under a term called denudation. Denudation means to strip off or to uncover. eg . Mass movements, erosion, etc.\n\nWEATHERING\n\nWeathering is defined as the mechanical disintegration and chemical decomposition of rocks through the actions of various elements of weather and climate.\n\nTypes of weathering \u2013 Chemical, physical and biological weathering.\n\nWeathering processes are responsible for breaking down the rocks into smaller fragments and preparing the way for the formation of not only regolith and soils but also erosion and mass movements.\n\nWeathering is also important for the formation of the soils.\n\nMASS MOVEMENTS \u2013\n\nMass movement is the movement of weathered materials down a slope due to gravitational forces. The movement may be gradual or sudden, depending on the gradient of the slope, the weight of the weathered debris and whether there is any lubricating moisture supplied by rain.\n\nSoil Creep \u2013 a slow gradual but more or less continuous movement of soil down hills.\nSoil flow or Mudflow \u2013 When the soil is completely saturated with water the individual particles are almost suspended in the water and move easily over one another and over the underlying rock.\nLandslides \u2013 The very rapid kind of movement that occurs when a large mass of soil or rock falls suddenly.\n\nMass movements do not come under erosion because these are aided by gravity and no geomorphic agent like running water, glaciers, wind, etc. participates in the process.\n\nLandforms\n\nThe landform is a small to medium-sized part of the surface of the Earth.\n\nEach landform has its own physical shape, size, and materials and is a result of the action of certain geomorphic processes and agents.\n\nThe geomorphic agents(Running water, glaciers, winds, etc.) are capable of erosion and deposition.\n\nLANDFORMS MADE BY RUNNING WATER\n\nThere are two components of running water \u2013\n\nOverland flow on the general land surface as a sheet.\nLinear flow as streams and rivers in valleys.\n\nMost of the erosional landforms made by running water are associated with vigorous and youthful rivers flowing over steep gradients and the gentler the river channels in gradient or slope, the greater the deposition.\n\nErosional landforms\n\t\nDepositional landforms\n\n\n1.\u00a0\u00a0 Valleys \u2013 Valleys start as small and narrow rills; the rills will gradually develop into long and wide gullies; the gullies will further deepen, widen and lengthen to give rise to valleys. Eg. V-shaped valley, canyon, etc\n\n2.\u00a0\u00a0 Gorge \u2013 It is a deep valley with very steep to straight sides.\n\n3.\u00a0\u00a0 Potholes and Plunge pools \u2013 Potholes are formed because of stream erosion aided by the abrasion of rock fragments.\u00a0 At the foot of waterfalls, large potholes, quite deep and wide, form, and such potholes are called plunge pools.\n\n4.\u00a0\u00a0 Incised or Entrenched Meanders \u2013 They are very deep wide meanders (loop-like channels) found cut in hard rocks.\n\n5.\u00a0\u00a0 River Terraces \u2013 They result due to vertical erosion by the stream into its own depositional floodplain.\n\n\t\n1.\u00a0\u00a0 Alluvial fans \u2013 When the stream moves from the higher level and breaks into a foot slope plain of a low gradient, it loses the energy needed to transport much of its load. Thus, they get dumped and spread as broad low to high cone-shaped deposits called alluvial fans.\n\n2.\u00a0\u00a0 Deltas \u2013 Deltas are like alluvial fans but develop along the coast.\n\n3.\u00a0\u00a0 Floodplains \u2013 Large-sized materials are deposited first when a stream channel breaks into a gentle slope. A riverbed made of river deposits is an active floodplain.\n\n4.\u00a0\u00a0 Natural levees\u00a0 \u2013 Natural levees are low, linear, and parallel ridges of coarse deposits along the banks of rivers. When rivers shift laterally, a series of natural levees can form.\n\n5.\u00a0\u00a0 Point bars \u2013 For large rivers, the sediments are deposited in a linear fashion at the depositional side of a meander.\n\n6.\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0Braided Channels \u2013\u00a0 When selective deposition of coarser materials causes the formation of a central bar, it diverts the flow of the river towards the banks, which increases Lateral erosion. Similarly, when more and more such central bars are formed, braided channels are formed.\n\nNote: Meanders \u2013 Meanders are loop-like channel patterns developed over the flood and delta plains. They are actually not a landform but only a type of channel pattern formed as a result of deposition.\n\nAs meanders grow into deep loops, the same may get cut off due to erosion at the inflexion point and are left as oxbow lakes.\n\nLANDFORMS MADE BY GLACIERS\n\n\u00a0A large mass of ice moving very slowly through a valley or spreading outward from a centre is called a glacier. The movement of glaciers is slow, unlike water flow. Erosion by glaciers is tremendous because of friction caused by the sheer weight of the ice.\n\nErosional Landforms\n\t\nDepositional Landforms\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n1.\u00a0\u00a0 Cirque \u2013 They are deep, long, and wide troughs or basins with very steep concave to vertically dropping high walls at their head as well as sides.\n\n2.\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0Horns and serrated Ridges \u2013 If three or more radiating glaciers cut headward until their cirques meet, high, sharp-pointed, and steep peaks called horns form.\n\n3.\u00a0\u00a0 Glacial valleys/Troughs \u2013 Very deep glacial troughs filled with seawater and making up shorelines are called fiords.\n\n4.\u00a0\u00a0 Others \u2013 hanging valleys, Bergschrund, etc.\n\n\t\nThe unsorted coarse and fine debris dropped by the melting glaciers is called glacial tills.\n\n1. Marines \u2013 Moraines are long ridges of deposits of glacial till.\n\nDeposits are at the end of a glacier \u2013 Terminal moraines\n\nDeposits on both sides \u2013 Lateral moraines.\n\n2.\u00a0\u00a0 Eskers \u2013\u00a0 Eskers are meandering ridges of sediment that form in water channels beneath or within the glacier ice. The floors of these channels can be rock, sediment, or ice.\n\n3.\u00a0\u00a0 Outwash plain \u2013\u00a0 assorted roughly stratified deposits.\n\n4.\u00a0\u00a0 Drumlins \u2013 Drumlins are smooth oval shaped ridge-like features composed mainly of glacial till along with some masses of gravel and sand.\n\nLANDFORMS MADE BY GROUNDWATER\n\n\u00a0The water under the ground flows horizontally through the bedding planes, joints or through the materials themselves. It is this downward and horizontal movement of water that causes the rocks to erode.\n\nAny limestone or dolomite region showing typical landforms produced by the action of groundwater through the process of solution and deposition is called Karst topography.\n\nErosional landforms\n\t\nDepositional Landforms\n\n\n1.\u00a0\u00a0 Sinkhole \u2013\u00a0 an opening more or less circular at the top and funnel-shaped towards the bottom.\n\n2.\u00a0\u00a0 Doline \u2013\u00a0 Some sinkholes collapse due to the presence of some caves or hollows beneath them and become bigger sinkholes.\n\n3.\u00a0\u00a0 Uvalas \u2013 When several sinkholes join together to form a valley of sinks, they are called valley sinks or Uvalas.\n\n4.\u00a0\u00a0 Lapies \u2013\u00a0 the irregular grooves and ridges formed when most of the surfaces of limestone are eaten by the solution process.\n\n5.\u00a0\u00a0 Caves\n\n\t\n1.\u00a0\u00a0 Stalactites \u2013 It is a deposit of calcium carbonate (such as calcite) resembling an icicle hanging from the roof or sides of a cave.\n\n2.\u00a0\u00a0 It rises up from the floor of the caves.\n\nThe Stalagmites and stalactites eventually fuse to give rise to columns and pillars of different diameters.\n\nLANDFORMS MADE BY WAVES AND CURRENTS\n\n\u00a0Most of the changes along the coasts are accomplished by waves. When waves break, the water is thrown with great force onto the shore, and simultaneously, there is a great churning of sediments on the sea bottom.\n\nHigh Rocky Coasts \u2013 Along these coasts, the river appears to have been drowned with a highly irregular coastline. Shores do not show any depositional landforms initially. Erosion features dominate.\n\nLow Sedimentary Coasts \u2013 Along these coasts the rivers appear to extend their length by building coastal plains and details. Depositional features dominate.\n\nErosional landforms\n\t\nDepositional landforms\n\n\nCliffs, Terraces, Caves, and Stacks \u2013\n\nCliffs are common on the high rocky coasts.\n\nAt the foot of such cliffs, there may be flat or gently sloping platforms covered by rock debris derived from the sea cliff behind.\n\nSuch platforms occurring at an elevation above the average height of waves is called wave-cut terrace.\n\nSometimes, waves create hollows and these hollows get widened and deepened to form Sea Caves.\n\nSea stacks are nothing but the isolated standing rocks in the sea which were once a part of the cliff.\n\n\u00a0\n\n\t\nBar, Barrier, and spit \u2013\n\nA ridge of sand and shingle formed in the sea in the off-shore zone (from the position of low tide waterline to seaward) lying approximately parallel to the coast is called an off-shore bar.\n\nAn off-shore bar that is exposed due to the further addition of sand is termed a barrier bar.\n\nSometimes such barrier bars get keyed up to one end of the bay when they are called spits.\n\nA lagoon is formed when barrier bars and spits form at the mouth of a bay and block it.\n\nOthers \u2013 Dunes, Beaches, etc.\n\nLANDFORMS MADE BY WINDS\n\n\u00a0Winds, particularly in hot deserts, cause deflation, abrasion, and impact. Deflation means the lifting and removal of dust and smaller particles from the surface of rocks.\n\nThe impact is a sheer force of momentum which occurs when sand is blown into or against a rock surface.\n\nAbrasion is the physical process of rubbing, scouring or scraping whereby particles of rock (usually microscopic) are eroded away by friction.\n\nErosional Landforms\n\t\nDepositional Landforms\n\n\nPediplains: When the high relief structures in deserts are reduced to low featureless plains by the activities of wind.\nPlayas: Playa is a flat-bottom depression found in interior desert basins and adjacent to coasts in arid and semiarid regions, periodically covered by water\nDeflation Hollows: Deflation is the removal of loose particles from the ground by the action of wind. When deflation causes a shallow depression by persistent movements of wind, they are called as deflation hollows.\nOthers \u2013 Mushroom, Table and Pedestal Rocks\n\t\nSand dunes: According to the shape of a sand dune, there are varieties of sand dune forms like Barchans, Seifs, etc. The crescent-shaped dunes are called Barchans. They are the most common ones.\nSeif is similar to the Barchans but has only one wing or point.\nLongitudinal dunes form when the supply of sand is poor and wind direction is constant.\nTransverse dunes are aligned perpendicular to the wind direction.\nClimatology\n\nClimatology is the scientific study of climate and how it changes over time is defined as the average weather conditions over time. In climatology, we study topics like- Atmosphere, Heat budget, Jet streams, cyclones, precipitation, etc.\n\nAtmosphere\n\nThe atmosphere can be studied as follows:\n\nComposition of the Atmosphere \u2013\n\nThe atmosphere is composed of gasses, water vapour, and dust particles.\n\nDetails of gasses in the lower atmosphere \u2013\n\nCarbon Dioxide is meteorologically a very important gas as it is transparent to the incoming solar radiation but opaque to the outgoing terrestrial radiation and reflects back some part of it towards the earth\u2019s surface.(Greenhouse effect).\n\nStructure of the Atmosphere\n\nThe structure of the atmosphere is as follows\n\nTROPOSPHERE\nThe lowermost layer of the atmosphere.\nIts average height is 13 km and extends roughly to a height of 8 km near the poles and about 18 km at the equator.\nThis is the most important layer for all biological activity.\nSTRATOSPHERE\nIt extends up to a height of 50 km. It contains a high concentration of ozone (O3) in relation to other parts of the atmosphere\nWeather-related incidents do not take place in this layer. The air blows horizontally here. Therefore this layer is considered ideal for flying aircraft.\nIt contains a high concentration of ozone (O3) in relation to other parts of the atmosphere.\nMESOSPHERE\nIt is the third layer of the atmosphere spreading over the stratosphere.\nIt extends up to a height of 80 km.\nTHERMOSPHERE\nThe ionosphere is located between 80 to 400 km above the mesopause.\nRadio waves transmitted from the earth are reflected back to the earth by this layer and due to this, radio broadcasting has become possible.\nThe temperature here starts increasing with height.\n\nThe uppermost layer of the atmosphere is called the Exosphere.\n\nSolar Radiation and Heat Budget\n\n\u00a0The earth\u2019s surface receives most of its energy in short wavelengths and incoming solar radiation is called insolation.\n\nThe amount and intensity of insolation vary during the day, in a season, and in a year.\n\nThe earth after being heated itself becomes a radiating body and it radiates energy to the atmosphere in the long waveform. This energy heats up the atmosphere from below. This process is known as terrestrial radiation.\n\nThe long wave radiation is absorbed by atmospheric gasses, particularly by carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gasses. Thus, the atmosphere is indirectly heated by the earth\u2019s radiation.\n\nThe earth as a whole does not accumulate or lose heat. It maintains its temperature. This can happen only if the amount of heat received in the form of insolation equals the amount lost by the earth through terrestrial radiation. This balance between the insolation and the terrestrial radiation is termed the heat budget or heat balance of the earth.\n\nThe albedo of the Earth can be defined as a measure of how much light that hits a surface is reflected back without being absorbed.\n\nTemperature\n\n\u00a0The interaction of insolation with the atmosphere and the earth\u2019s surface creates heat which is measured in the terms of temperature.\n\nFACTORS CONTROLLING TEMPERATURE DISTRIBUTION\nLatitude\nAltitude\nDistance from the sea\nAir mass and ocean currents\nINVERSION OF TEMPERATURE\n\nWhen the temperature decreases with an increase in elevation are called the normal lapse rate. At times, the situation is reserved and the normal lapse rate is inverted. It is called inversion of temperature. Eg. Sea breeze, land breeze, Fog, etc.\n\nATMOSPHERIC PRESSURE\n\nThe weight of a column of air contained in a unit area from the mean sea level to the top of the atmosphere is called atmospheric pressure.\n\nIn the lower atmosphere, the pressure decreases rapidly with height.\n\nFORCE AFFECTING THE VELOCITY AND DIRECTION OF THE WIND\n\n\u00a0The air in motion is called wind. The wind blows from high pressure to low pressure. Forces \u2013 Gravitational force, Friction force, Pressure Gradient force, Coriolis Force.\n\nThe force exerted by the rotation of the earth is known as the Coriolis force.\n\nThe wind circulation around a low pressure is called cyclonic circulation. Around high pressure, it is called anticyclonic circulation.\n\nGENERAL CIRCULATION OF THE ATMOSPHERE\n\nIt depends on the \u2013\n\nLatitudinal variation of atmospheric heating\nThe emergence of pressure belts\nThe migration of belts following the apparent path of the sun\nThe distribution of continents and oceans\nThe rotation of the earth\n\nThe pattern of the movement of the planetary winds is called the general circulation of the atmosphere.\n\nThe air at the Inter-Tropical Convergence Zone (ITCZ), which lies near the equator, rises due to the heating caused by the reflected radiation from the surface thus creating low pressure.\nThe winds from the tropics (i.e. region around the Tropic of Cancer and Capricorn) flow from their positions towards this low-pressure area. As the air from the tropics reaches the convergence zone it begins to rise because of heating. It reaches an altitude of 14 km and then starts to move towards the poles thus creating the upper air circulation or upper atmospheric circulation.\nWhile travelling towards the poles, as the air of the upper air circulation gets cold and dense, there is accumulation around 30\u00b0 N and S latitudes. Some part of the cold air sinks towards the ground creating a subtropical high.\nAs it reaches the surface, the wind again starts moving towards the ITCZ near the equator and becomes known as easterlies. This cycle of air circulation in between the Equator and the Tropics is known as the Hadley Cell.\nThe cycle of the air in between the mid-latitudes (i.e. around the tropics) and the poles is known as the mid-latitude cell or Ferrel cell. In this case, the rising warmer air) is coming from the subtropical high and the sinking cool air is coming from the poles. Such winds near the surface are known as\nThe cycle of air circulation in-between the poles and the mid-latitudes is known as the Polar cell.\n\u00a0Air Masses\n\nWhen the air remains over a homogenous area for a sufficiently long time, it acquires the characteristics of the area.\n\nThe air masses are classified according to the source regions-\n\nWarm tropical and subtropical oceans\nThe subtropical hot deserts\nThe relatively cold high-latitude oceans\nThe very cold snow-covered continents in the Arctic and Antarctica\nTYPES \u2013\nMaritime tropical\nContinental tropical\nMaritime polar\nContinental polar\nContinental arctic\nFronts\n\nWhen two different air masses meet, the boundary zone between them is called Fronts by the process of frontogenesis.\n\nTypes of fronts \u2013\n\nCold\nWarm\nStationary\nOccluded\nExtra-Tropical Cyclones\n\nTemperate cyclones are also known as Extra-tropical cyclones where the term \u201cExtra-tropical\u201d signifies that this type of cyclone generally occurs outside the tropics with a latitude range between 30\u00b0 and 60\u00b0. They are low-pressure systems with associated cold fronts, warm fronts, and occluded fronts. These cyclones are formed along the polar front. In the beginning, the front is stationary. These cyclones move from west to east.\n\nTropical Cyclones\n\nTropical cyclones are violent storms that originate over oceans in tropical areas and move over coastal areas and move over to the coastal areas bringing about large-scale destruction caused by violent winds, very heavy rainfall and storm surges.\n\nConditions:\n\nLarge sea surface with a temperature higher than 270 C\nPresence of the Coriolis force\nSmall variations in the vertical wind speed\nA pre-existing weak-low-pressure area or low-level cyclonic circulation\nUpper divergence above the sea level system\n\nA mature tropical cyclone is characterized by the strong spirally circulating wind around the centre, called the Eye.\n\nThe Cyclone creates storm surges and they inundate the coastal lowlands. The storm peters out on the land.\n\nJet streams\n\nAccording to World Meteorological Organisation (WMO), \u201ca strong narrow current concentrated along a quasi-horizontal axis in the upper troposphere or the stratosphere characterized by strong vertical and lateral wind shear and featuring one or more velocity maxima is called the jet stream.\u201d\n\nWater in The Atmosphere\n\nThe following are the properties of water in the atmosphere.\n\nEvaporation and Condensation\nThe water vapour in the air is known as humidity and the actual amount of water vapour present in the atmosphere is known as the absolute humidity. The percentage of moisture present in the atmosphere as compared to its full capacity at a given temperature is known as relative humidity.\nThe amount of water vapour in the atmosphere is added or withdrawn due to evaporation and condensation respectively. Evaporation is the process by which water is transformed from liquid to a gaseous state. The transformation of water vapour into water is called condensation.\nDew- When the moisture is deposited in the form of water droplets on cooler surfaces of solid objects (rather than nuclei in the air above the surface) such as stones, grass blades and plant leaves, it is known as dew.\nFrost \u2013 Frost forms on cold surfaces when condensation takes place below the freezing point (00C), i.e. the dew point is at or below the freezing point.\nFog \u2013 When the temperature of an air mass containing a large quantity of water vapour falls. All of a sudden, condensation takes place within itself on fine dust particles. So, the fog is a cloud with its base at or very near the ground.\nClouds\n\nA cloud is a mass of water drops or ice crystals suspended in the atmosphere. Clouds form when water condenses in the sky. The condensation lets us see the water vapour. There are many different types of clouds \u2013 Cirrus, Cumulus, Stratus, Nimbus, etc.\n\nA combination of these four basic types of clouds can be again divided into three types:\n\nHigh clouds- Cirrus, cirrostratus etc.\nMiddle clouds \u2013 Altostratus, altocumulus; etc\nLow clouds \u2013 Stratocumulus and nimbostratus.\nPrecipitation\n\nThe process of continuous condensation in free air helps the condensed particles to grow in size. When the resistance of the air fails to hold them against the force of gravity, they fall onto the earth\u2019s surface. So after the condensation of water vapour, the release of moisture is known as precipitation.\n\nSleet is frozen raindrops and refrozen melted snow water. When a layer of air with a temperature above freezing point overlies a sub-freezing layer near the ground, precipitation takes place in the form of sleet. Raindrops, which leave the warmer air, encounter the colder air below.\n\nTypes of Rainfall\n\nThe following are the various types of rainfalls:\n\nCONVECTIONAL RAINFALL\n\nThe air getting heated becomes light and rises in convection currents.\n\nAs the air rises, it expands and drops the temperature and subsequently, condensation takes place and cumulus clouds are formed.\n\nThis type of rainfall generally takes place in the equatorial regions and internal parts of the continents, predominantly in the northern hemisphere.\n\nOROGRAPHIC RAIN\n\nWhen the saturated air mass comes across a mountain, it is forced to ascend and as it rises, it expands; the temperature falls, and the moisture is condensed. The chief characteristic of this sort of rain is that the windward slopes receive greater rainfall.\n\nThe area situated on the leeward side, which gets less rainfall is known as the rain-shadow area. It is also known as the relief rain.\n\nCYCLONIC RAIN\n\nCyclonic activity causes cyclonic rain and it occurs along the fronts of the cyclone. As the warm air rises, it cools, and the moisture present in it condenses to form clouds. This rain falls gradually for a few hours to a few days.\n\nWorld Climate and Climate Change\n\nThe world climate is classified based on the scheme developed by V. Koeppen. He identified a close relationship between the distribution of vegetation and climate.\n\nClimate change refers to long-term shifts in temperatures and weather patterns.\n\nOceanography\n\nOceanography is a scientific discipline concerned with all aspects of the world\u2019s oceans and seas, including their physical and chemical properties, their origin and geologic framework, and the life forms that inhabit the marine environment.\n\nIn Oceanography, we learn about Hydrological cycles, Currents, waves, tides, marine life such as coral life, major and minor relief features, etc.\n\nHydrological Cycle\n\nWater can be used and reused. Water undergoes a cycle from the ocean to land and land to ocean. The hydrological cycle is the circulation of water within the earth\u2019s Hydrosphere in different forms.\n\nRelief of Ocean Floor\n\nThe floors of the oceans are rugged with the world\u2019s largest mountain ranges, deepest trenches and the largest plains.\n\nThe oceanic part can be divided into \u2013 Pacific, Atlantic, Indian and Arctic.\n\nDivisions of The Ocean Floors \u2013\nThe Continental shelf \u2013 It is the shallowest part of the ocean showing an average gradient of 1\u00b0 or even less. The shelf typically ends at a very steep slope, called the shelf break. The continental shelves are covered with variable thicknesses of sediments brought down by rivers, glaciers, and wind, from the land and distributed by waves and currents. Massive sedimentary deposits received over a long time by the continental shelves become the source of fossil fuels.\nThe continental Slope \u2013 The continental slope connects the continental shelf and the ocean basins.\nThe deep sea Plain- Deep sea plains are gently sloping areas of the ocean basins. These are the flattest and smoothest regions of the world.\nThe oceanic Deep- These areas are the deepest parts of the oceans. The trenches are relatively steep-sided, narrow basins.\nOther Relief-\n\n\u00a0The various other relief features are:\n\nMid oceanic Ridge \u2013 It is composed of two chains of mountains separated by a large depression. Eg. Atlantic Ridge\nSeamount \u2013 It is a mountain with pointed summits, rising from the seafloor that does not reach the surface of the ocean. Seamounts are volcanic in origin.\nGuyots \u2013 It is a flat-topped seamount. They show evidence of gradual subsidence through stages to become flat-topped submerged mountains.\nAtolls \u2013 These are low islands found in the tropical oceans consisting of coral reefs surrounding a central depression. It may be a part of the sea (lagoon), or sometimes form enclosing a body of fresh, brackish, or highly saline water.\nThe temperature of Ocean Waters\n\nFactors Affecting \u2013\n\nLatitude\nUnequal distribution of land and water\nPrevailing wind\nOcean currents\nThe salinity of oceanic water\n\nHorizontal and vertical Distribution of Temperature \u2013\n\nTemperature decreases with the increased depth.\nThe boundary region( 100-400 m), from where there is a rapid decrease in temperature, is called the thermocline.\nBelow the thermocline, the Temperature changes very slightly.\nThe average temperature of surface water is about 270\nIt gradually decreases from the equator towards the poles.\nThe oceans in the northern hemisphere record relatively higher temperatures than in the southern hemisphere.\nSALINITY IN THE OCEAN WATER\n\n\u00a0The total content of dissolved salts in seawater is termed Salinity.\n\nA salinity of 24.7 %0 has been regarded as the upper limit to fix \u2018brackish water\u2019\n\nFactors affecting Oceanic salinity \u2013\n\nDepend upon evaporation and precipitation.\nInfluenced by freshwater flow from rivers in coastal regions.\nWInd\nOcean currents\nHorizontal and vertical\u00a0 distribution of salinity\n\u00a0The salinity of a normal open sea \u2013 is between 33 to 37.\nIn estuaries and the Arctic sea, it fluctuates between 0 to 35.\nIn the hot and dry regions where the evaporation of water is high, it may reach 70.\nIn landlocked countries such as the Red sea, it is recorded 41 due to higher evaporation.\nIn the Indian Ocean the average salinity \u2013\nSalinity at the surface decreases by freshwater input or increases by loss of water to evaporation and Ice.\nSalinity in the depth is very much fixed as there is no water added or lost.\nSalinity generally increases with an increase in depth.\nThere is a distinct zone called Halocline, in this zone, there is a sharp increase in salinity.\nMovements of Ocean Water\n\nThe movements of ocean water can be horizontal or vertical. The horizontal motion of oceanic water refers to the ocean currents and waves while vertical motion refers to tides.\n\nWAVES\n\nWaves are formed by energy passing through water, resulting in it moving in a circular motion. Water particles travel only in a small circle as a wave passes. The Wind causes waves to travel in the ocean and the energy is released on coastlines. When the depth of water is less than half the wavelength of the wave, the wave breaks.\n\nA wave\u2019s size and shape reveal its origin. Steep waves are fairly young ones and are probably formed by local wind. Slow and steady waves originate from faraway places, possibly from another hemisphere.\n\nWaves travel because the wind pushes the water body in its course while gravity pulls the crests of the waves downward.\n\nOCEAN CURRENTS\n\nOcean currents are rivers in the oceans and represent a regular volume of water in a definite path and direction. The strength of the Current refers to the speed of the current.\n\nForces that influence currents \u2013\n\nHeating by solar energy\nGravity\nWind\nCoriolis force\nThe difference in water density\nTYPES OF OCEAN CURRENT\nSurface currents \u2013 constitute about 10% of all the water in the ocean. These waters are the upper 400m of the ocean. They can be divided into \u2013\nCold currents \u2013 bring cold water into warm water areas. They are usually found on the west coast of the continents in low and middle latitudes. Eg. Peruvian current, Labrador current etc\nWarm Currents \u2013 Bring warm water into cold water areas and are usually observed on the east coast of constituents in the low and middle latitudes. Eg. Brazilian Current, Agulhas Current etc.\nDeep Water currents \u2013 make up the other 90% of the ocean Water.\nTIDES\n\nThe periodical rise and fall of the sea level once or twice a day, mainly due to the attraction of the sun and moon,is called a tide.\n\nFactors \u2013\n\nThe gravitational pull of the sun and moon\nCentrifugal force\n\nThe tide-generating force is the difference between these two forces \u2013 The gravitational attraction of the moon and the centrifugal force.\n\nTYPES OF TIDES\n\nThe height of rising water varies appreciably depending upon the position of the sun and moon with respect to the earth.\n\nSpring tides \u2013 When the sun, the moon and the Earth are in a straight line \u2013 Tide will be higher.\n\nThey occur twice a month, one during the full period and another during the new moon period.\n\nNeap tides- Sun and moon are perpendicular to each other.\n\nThe forces of the sun and moon tend to counter one another.\n\nTide will be low.\n\nTidal flows are of great importance in navigation. These tides are also helpful in desilting the sediments and in removing polluted water from river estuaries.\n\nIslands and Coral Reefs\n\n\u00a0An island is a piece of land surrounded on the sides by water.\n\nTypes of Islands\nContinental Islands \u2013 These islands were formerly part of the mainland and are now detached from the continent. They may be separated by a shallow lagoon or a deep channel.\n\nEg. Madagascar, Formosa etc\n\nOceanic Islands \u2013 These islands are normally small and are located in the midst of oceans.\nMauna Loa in Hawaii, Volcanic islands such as the Canary islands\nCoral reefs\n\nThey are very tiny creatures with the ability to secrete calcium carbonate within their cells has given rise to a particular type of landform.\n\nFavourable conditions corals survive \u2013\n\nWater Temperature \u2013 Not below 200C\nArea \u2013 Tropical and subtropical zones\nShallow water area\nSaltish and free from sediment water\n\nThere are different types of coral reefs such as Fringing Reefs, Barrier Reefs and Atolls.\n\nSoil Formation\n\nSoil is a dynamic medium in which many chemical, physical and biological activities going on constantly. Soil can be defined as \u2013 a collection of natural bodies on the earth\u2019s surface containing living matter and supporting or capable of supporting plants.\n\nProcess of Soil Formation\nA precondition for soil formation is weathering. It is a weathering mantle which is the basic input for soil to form.\nThe weathered material or transported deposits are colonized by bacteria and other inferior plants.\nThe dead remains of organisms and plants help in humus accumulation.\nMinor grasses and ferns may grow in starting and later big plants and trees.\nPlants\u2019 roots penetrate down, burrowing animals bring up particles, and the mass of material becomes porous and sponge-like with a capacity to retain water and to permit the passage of air and finally a mature soil.\nSoil forming factors\nParent material \u2013 a passive control factor and soil formation depend upon the texture and structure.\nTopography \u2013 a passive control factor. The amount of exposure of a surface covered by parent materials to sunlight etc. depends on topography.\nClimate \u2013 an active control factor. Factors such as precipitation, moisture in the soil, temperature, etc. play a major role in soil formation.\nBiological Activity \u2013 The vegetative cover and organisms that occupy the parent materials from the beginning and also at later stages help in adding organic matter and moisture retention, nitrogen etc\nTime \u2013 The length of time the soil-forming processes operate, determines the maturation of soils and profile development.\nSalient features of the world\u2019s physical geography: Examples\n\nThe world\u2019s physical geography is characterized by a wide diversity of landforms, climates, and ecosystems. Some of the most salient features of the world geography include:\n\nOceans and seas: The Earth is mostly covered by water, with the Pacific Ocean being the largest. There are five main oceans on Earth: the Atlantic Ocean, the Indian Ocean, the Southern Ocean, the Arctic Ocean, and the Pacific Ocean. These oceans are connected by a network of smaller seas, straits, and channels.\nContinents: The Earth\u2019s land is divided into seven continents: Africa, Antarctica, Asia, Europe, North America, Australia, and South America.\nMountains: Some of the world\u2019s most iconic mountain ranges include the Himalayas, the Andes, the Rockies, the Alps, and the Karakoram.\nPlateaus and uplands: Major plateaus include the Tibetan Plateau and the Deccan Plateau.\nPlains and lowlands: Major lowlands include the Amazon River Basin, the Ganges-Brahmaputra Delta, the Mississippi River Valley, and the European Lowlands.\nDeserts: Major deserts include the Sahara, the Arabian Desert, the Gobi Desert, and the Atacama Desert.\nRainforests: The world\u2019s largest rainforests are found in the Amazon and Congo Basins, as well as in Indonesia and Malaysia.\nOceans currents and winds: The ocean currents and winds are major drivers of the Earth\u2019s climate, helping to distribute heat and moisture around the globe.\nRivers and lakes: Some of the world\u2019s longest rivers include the Nile, the Amazon, the Yangtze, and the Mississippi. Some of the largest lakes include the Caspian Sea, Lake Superior, and Lake Victoria.\nGlaciers and ice caps: Some of the world\u2019s most iconic glaciers and ice caps include those in Antarctica, Greenland, and the Canadian Arctic.\n\nThe study of physical Geography is essential for the sufficient allocation of natural resources on the earth. It is essential for enabling human resolution as per the adjacent conditions and to be improved in order to protect our planet earth.\n\nArticle written by -Ankit Sharma",

earthquake event)\nvolcanic eruptions, lahars, and ash fall.\n\nAlso read: Geomorphic Processes and Earth Movements\n\nGeohazard management in India\n\nIndia is home to more than 17% of the world\u2019s population despite having only 2% of the planet\u2019s total land area.\n\nThe country experiences a variety of geohazards, including earthquakes, landslides, tsunamis, glacial lake outburst floods, landslide-dammed lake outburst floods, etc., that negatively impact life, the economy, and the environment.\nVarious calamities, which also result in the deaths of thousands of people, cost the economy on average 2% of its gross domestic product and 12% of its income each year.\n\n59% of the earth\u2019s surface is impacted by earthquakes, and seismic intensities of VII, VIII, and IX are possible in seismic zones III, IV, and V, respectively.\n\nIn addition to being very susceptible to earthquakes, the Himalayan belt in the country\u2019s north is also dynamically active, climatically sensitive, and vulnerable to landslides and flash floods.\n\nThe frequencies and effects of these geohazards are growing as a result of changing climatic conditions, expanding population, and dangerous development and urbanization practices.\n\nThe national disaster management authority in India has made efforts to evaluate the types and severity of these disasters that have previously affected the nation and identified potential risks to various vulnerable elements based on inputs from various sectors and disciplines.\n\nProfessional geologists and engineers have made significant contributions to improving our understanding of geohazards and developing practical solutions for more secure, sustainable development.\n\nIn 2021 the Ministry of Road Transport and Highways entered into an MoU with the Defence Research and Development Organisation (DRDO) to strengthen cooperation in sustainable geohazard management.\n\nThe Ministry and DRDO had agreed to work together in areas that would be beneficial to both parties, such as conceptual planning of integrated avalanche/landslide protection schemes or all-weather connectivity in our country\u2019s snowy regions, including the preliminary feasibility of tunnels and viaducts.\nAdditionally, they agreed to work together on the planning and construction of various avalanche and landslide control structures, as well as on the creation of tunnel proposals and project reports.\nThis effort was designed to protect users of the nation\u2019s national highways from the damaging impacts of landslides and other natural disasters.\nWith an emphasis on terrains and avalanches, the Defence Geo Informatics Research Establishment (DGRE), a DRDO laboratory, is the pioneer in the creation of vital technologies for boosting combat effectiveness.\nMap-making, forecasting, monitoring, controlling, and mitigating landslides and avalanches in the Himalayan terrain are all part of its responsibilities and mandate.\nBoth organizations had agreed to employ DRDO\u2019s knowledge through DGRE to provide long-term solutions to damage brought on by landslides, avalanches, and other natural disasters on different national highways across the nation.\n\nThe integration of disaster risk reduction and development has been a focus of national-level policy, guidelines, plans, programs, initiatives, and procedures as well as regulatory measures focused on technical, administrative, financial, legal, and sociocultural issues.\n\nGeohazard risk reduction- UNESCO\n\nUNESCO\u2019s work on Geohazard Risk Reduction operates by the four Priorities for Action of the Sendai Framework for Disaster Risk Reduction 2015-2030:\n\nUnderstanding disaster risk\nStrengthening disaster risk governance to manage disaster risk\nInvesting in disaster risk reduction for resilience\nEnhancing disaster preparedness for effective response and Build Back Better in recovery, rehabilitation, and reconstruction.\nGeological hazard mitigation\n\nGeotechnical engineers work to avoid or lessen issues brought on by geohazards. Geological Hazards Mitigation is the application of geological engineering principles to minimize or prevent the effects of naturally occurring geologic hazards.\n\nA risk assessment and analysis of natural and artificial systems in urban and coastal zones are necessary to successfully defend geotechnical engineering projects that are likely to be endangered by geohazards.\nGeotechnical engineers may precisely ascertain the material characteristics of geomaterials including soils, rocks, minerals, and concrete through site investigations and afterward evaluate the potential risk they offer to people, property, and the environment.\nRisk reduction technologies that are based on the detection, analysis, and assessment of possible geohazards must be developed because geohazards cannot be discovered until they occur.\nTherefore, improving safety risk assessment and management approaches as well as creating tools and processes to quantify the uncertainties of geomaterials is of utmost importance.\nWay forward\n\nGeohazards are increasing across the globe due to climate change and increase the risk of long-term disruption to transport systems. A reliable and efficient transport system/network is a major catalyst for the development of a country and the backbone of its functioning.\n\nDisruption of the transport system will cause economic setbacks and impact citizens\u2019 security and access to critical infrastructure such as hospitals, schools, or shelters.\n\nTherefore, a geohazard risk management perspective that incorporates people, the environment, hydrology, geology, and transportation infrastructure needs to be adopted for a robust and resilient transport network.\n\nThe traditional approach to maintaining a transport network is reactive and remediates geohazard events as they occur. A proactive approach that evaluates hazards, monitors the network and manages the infrastructure can result in 60-80% life-cycle cost savings.\n\n-Article written by Swathi Satish",

    "[CONTENT] #258": "What is a heat dome? Is heat dome and heat wave are same? How were they formed? What are the impacts of heat dome? Read further to know more.\n\nOver the New Year\u2019s holiday, a number of regions of Europe experienced an unusual winter heat wave. Ten to twenty degrees Celsius above average temperatures were recorded. Due to the development of a heat dome over the area, the continent is currently going through an extremely warm period.\n\nAccording to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), a heat dome happens when the atmosphere traps hot ocean air like a lid or cap.\n\nWhen the waters of the eastern and western Pacific are both warm, a heat dome is more likely to form during La Nia years.\n\nTable of Contents\n\nWhat is Heat Dome?\nAre Heat Domes and Heat Waves the Same?\nHeat Domes and Jet Stream\nWhat are The Causes of the Formation of Heat Domes?\nHow Do Heat Domes Impact Humans?\nWhat Are The Effects Of Heat Dome?\nWhat Are The Steps to Avoid?\nWay Forward\nWhat is Heat Dome?\n\nA heat dome is a high-pressure weather pattern that can cause extreme heat and humidity. It is a type of atmospheric circulation that is characterized by a dome or ridge of high pressure aloft, with descending air at the surface.\n\nThis sinking air can lead to clear skies and very hot temperatures, as the air becomes compressed and warms as it sinks. It can also cause drought conditions, as the sinking air suppresses the development of clouds and precipitation.\n\nA heat dome forms when warm air is trapped over a region for a long time, much like a pot lid. Every day that passes brings warmer conditions because the sun works harder to heat the air the longer it is trapped.\n\n\ud83d\udc49 Which year are YOU targeting for success in the IAS/IPS/IFS Exam? \ud83d\ude80\n\n(1) \u21d2 UPSC 2025: Prelims cum Mains\n\n(2) \u21d2 UPSC 2026: Prelims cum Mains\n\n(3) \u21d2 UPSC 2027 Prelims cum Mains\n\nTip: Know more about ClearIAS Courses (Online/Offline)\n\nHeat domes typically last a few days, but they occasionally last for up to weeks, which could result in deadly heat waves.\n\nScientists contend that air is forced to sink in any area of high pressure, whether or not it is a heat dome. Once the air reaches the ground, it is compressed and becomes even hotter.\n\nAdditionally, as air sinks, it becomes drier, pushing the temperature of the area even higher.\n\nThese are often associated with extreme heat waves and can be dangerous to people, especially those who are sensitive to heat or have certain medical conditions.\n\nAre Heat Domes and Heat Waves the Same?\n\nHeat domes and heat waves are related, but they are not the same thing. A heat dome is a weather pattern characterized by a high-pressure system aloft and sinking air at the surface. This can lead to clear skies and very hot temperatures.\n\nA heat wave, on the other hand, is a prolonged period of excessively hot weather. The definition of a heat wave can vary depending on the region and the time of year, but it generally refers to a period of several days during which the temperature is significantly higher than the average temperature for that time of year.\n\nHeat waves can be caused by a variety of weather patterns, including heat domes, but they can also be caused by other factors such as a strong ridge of high pressure or a lack of cloud cover.\n\nHeat Domes and Jet Stream\n\nThe jet stream is a strong, fast-flowing wind current that typically blows in the upper levels of the atmosphere. It is found at the boundary between cold air to the north and warm air to the south, and it typically flows from west to east.\n\nThe jet stream is an important factor in the formation and movement of weather systems, and it can influence temperature, precipitation, and other weather conditions.\n\nHeat domes are often associated with a strong, broad ridge of high pressure in the upper atmosphere, which can cause the jet stream to become \u201cstuck\u201d or slowed down. When this happens, the jet stream can be deflected north or south, leading to a persistent weather pattern that can last for several days or even weeks.\n\nIn the case of a heat dome, the jet stream may be deflected northward, allowing warm, humid air to flow into the region and leading to hot and potentially dangerous conditions.\n\nWhat are The Causes of the Formation of Heat Domes?\n\nHeat domes can be caused by a variety of factors, including:\n\nA strong, broad ridge of high pressure aloft: When a high-pressure system is particularly strong and covers a large area, it can create a \u201cdome\u201d of sinking air at the surface. This sinking air can lead to clear skies and very hot temperatures.\nA lack of cloud cover: It can also form when there is a lack of cloud cover, as clouds can help to keep temperatures cooler by reflecting sunlight back into space and by releasing heat through the process of evaporation.\nWarm, moist air: This is often associated with warm, moist air, as the humidity can make the air feel even hotter.\nA lack of wind: When the wind is light or calm, it can allow heat to build up at the surface, leading to the formation of a heat dome.\nClimate change: Some research suggests that heat domes may be becoming more common and more intense due to climate change, as rising temperatures can create conditions that are more conducive to heat dome formation.\nHow Do Heat Domes Impact Humans?\n\nHeat domes can have significant impacts on humans, as they can lead to extreme heat and humidity. Exposure to extreme heat can be dangerous, especially for vulnerable populations such as the elderly, young children, and people with certain medical conditions.\n\nHeat exhaustion and heat stroke are common health problems that can result from prolonged exposure to extreme heat.\n\nDizziness, fatigue, and headaches are some of the symptoms of heat exhaustion, a condition where the body becomes dehydrated and overheated. When the body\u2019s temperature regulation system is overworked, a more serious condition known as heat stroke develops. If it is not treated quickly, heat stroke can be fatal.\n\nIn addition to the health impacts, heat domes can also lead to other problems such as power outages, due to the increased demand for air conditioning, and decreased air quality due to the buildup of pollutants. It can also have impacts on agriculture, as extreme heat and drought conditions can damage crops.\n\nWhat Are The Effects Of Heat Dome?\n\nThis can have a variety of effects, including:\n\nExtreme heat and humidity: Heat domes are characterized by very hot temperatures and high humidity, which can make the air feel even hotter.\nClear skies: Heat domes often result in clear skies, as the sinking air suppresses the development of clouds and precipitation.\nDrought conditions: The sinking air associated with heat domes can also lead to drought conditions, as it suppresses the development of clouds and precipitation.\nHealth impacts: Prolonged exposure to extreme heat and humidity can lead to heat exhaustion and heat stroke, which can be dangerous, especially for vulnerable populations such as the elderly, young children, and people with certain medical conditions.\nPower outages: The increased demand for air conditioning during heat domes can lead to power outages.\nDecreased air quality: The build-up of pollutants during heat domes can lead to decreased air quality.\nAgricultural impacts: Extreme heat and drought conditions can damage crops and have other impacts on agriculture.\n\nHeat domes can also have other impacts, depending on the specific region and the weather conditions associated with the heat dome.\n\nWhat Are The Steps to Avoid?\n\nThere are several steps that you can take to avoid heat domes and stay safe during extreme heat:\n\nStay indoors in air-conditioned places: The best way to avoid heat is to stay inside in an air-conditioned environment. This can help to keep you cool and reduce your risk of heat-related illness.\nStay hydrated: Drink plenty of water to stay hydrated, even if you do not feel thirsty. Avoid drinks that contain alcohol or caffeine, as they can increase your risk of dehydration.\nWear loose, lightweight, and light-coloured clothing: Wearing loose, lightweight clothing can help to keep you cooler, as it allows air to circulate around your body. Light-coloured clothing can also help to reflect sunlight and heat.\nUse fans and other cooling devices: Fans and other cooling devices can help to keep you comfortable, but they are not as effective at cooling the body as air conditioning.\nTake frequent breaks: If you must be outside during a heat dome, take frequent breaks in a cool, air-conditioned place. Avoid strenuous activity during the hottest part of the day, and try to do any outdoor work in the early morning or late evening when it is cooler.\nCheck on vulnerable individuals: Check on elderly neighbours, friends, and family members regularly to make sure they are staying cool and hydrated.\nKnow the symptoms of heat-related illness: If you or someone you know experiences symptoms such as dizziness, nausea, headache, or muscle cramps, seek medical attention immediately. These can be signs of heat exhaustion or heat stroke, which can be serious and potentially life-threatening if not treated promptly.\nWay Forward\n\nThere are several steps that can be taken to address the issue of heat domes and their impacts:\n\nIncrease awareness: Educating the public about the dangers of heat domes and the steps that can be taken to stay safe during extreme heat can help to reduce the number of heat-related illnesses and deaths.\nImprove infrastructure: Ensuring that buildings and homes are well-insulated and equipped with air conditioning can help to reduce the impacts of heat domes.\nDevelop early warning systems: Establishing early warning systems that can alert people to the onset of a heat dome and provide information on how to stay safe can help to reduce the number of heat-related illnesses and deaths.\nIncrease green spaces: Increasing the amount of green space in urban areas can help to reduce the heat island effect, as trees and other vegetation can help to cool the air and reduce the temperature.\nAddress climate change: Climate change is a major factor in the formation and intensity of heat domes, and addressing the root cause of climate change can help to reduce the frequency and severity of heat domes in the future.\nEnhance emergency response: Improving emergency response systems and increasing the capacity of hospitals and other medical facilities can help to ensure that people who are affected by heat domes receive the care that they need.\n\nArticle written by: Remya",

There is no distinct winter climate in this area.\nIn some areas of Tamil Nadu and Kerala, the temperature frequently reaches 30 degrees.\nThe north has distinct winter weather with an average temperature below 21\u00b0C.\nThe Gangetic plains have a mean minimum temperature of about 10\u00b0C, compared to a mean minimum of about 5\u00b0C in north-western India.\nIndia\u2019s coldest place is the Dras Valley in Kashmir. The lowest temperature ever at Dras was -45\u00b0C in 1908.\nPressure During the Winter\nHigh air pressure is present across a significant portion of north-western India due to low temperatures and divergence caused by the STJ (SubTropical Jet Streams) ridge.\nThe pressure in South India is lower than it is in the rest of the nation.\nFrom a north-westerly high-pressure area to a south-easterly low-pressure area, the winds start to blow.\nThe low-pressure gradient and low wind velocity are related.\nThe pressure gradient and physiography determine the wind\u2019s route.\nWestern Upheavals during the Winter\nIn northwest and northern India, the arrival of western disturbances frequently interrupts a period of favorable weather.\nIn Rajasthan, Punjab, and Haryana, they intensify.\nThey go through the sub-Himalayan belt in an easterly direction, eventually arriving in Arunachal Pradesh.\nThey produce modest rain in the Indus Ganga lowlands and snow in the Himalayan region.\nAfter the disturbance passed, extensive fog and cold waves arrived and caused the minimum temperature to drop by 5\u00b0 to 10\u00b0C.\nVisibility is drastically reduced by fog, which is very problematic when traveling.\n\nAlso read: Unseasonal Rains in India\n\nTropical cyclones during the winter\nDuring this time of year, tropical cyclone activity is at its lowest.\nThe low sea surface temperature and the ITCZ\u2019s furthest south egress are to blame for this ( Intertropical Convergence Zone).\nTamil Nadu is battered by storms with origins in the Bay of Bengal, which produce a lot of rain.\nFrom the southern peninsula, some of them span the Arabian Sea.\nThere aren\u2019t many storms that develop in the Arabian Sea and move north or west.\nPrecipitation in Winter Season\nThe receding winter monsoons take up moisture while crossing the Bay of Bengal, resulting in winter rainfall in Tamil Nadu, south Andhra Pradesh, south-east Karnataka, and south-east Kerala (Usually in the first weeks of November).\nThe largest seasonal rainfall of roughly 75 cm occurs between October and December.\nThe majority of it takes place in Andhra Pradesh\u2019s surrounding regions and along the southern coast of Tamil Nadu.

Very High Vulnerability Zone\n\nThis zone includes the Himalayas, Andaman, and Nicobar, high rainfall regions with steep slopes in the Western Ghats and Nilgiris, the northeastern regions, along with regions that frequently experience ground shaking due to earthquakes, etc. It also includes regions that have a high concentration of human activity, especially that related to building roads, dams, etc.\n\n2. High Vulnerability Zone\n\nThis group also includes areas with almost identical conditions to those found in the very high vulnerability zone. The only difference between these two is how the governing factors are integrated, how intensely, and how frequently they occur. Except for the Assam plains, all of the Himalayan states and those from the northeastern areas are included in the high vulnerability zones.\n\n3. Moderate to Low Vulnerability Zone\n\nAreas that receive less precipitation such as TransHimalayan areas of Ladakh and Spiti (Himachal Pradesh), undulated yet stable relief and low precipitation areas in the Aravali, rain shadow areas in the Western and Eastern Ghats and Deccan plateau also experiences occasional landslides. The states of Jharkhand, Orissa, Chhattisgarh, Madhya Pradesh, Maharashtra, Andhra Pradesh, Karnataka, Tamil Nadu, Goa, and Kerala are those where subsidence and mining-related landslides occur most frequently.\n\nA Case Study\n\nA significant landslide damaged a 200-meter section of the historic Hindustan-Tibet road, National Highway 22 when it hit the Pangi village near Reckong Peo in the Kinnaur region of Himachal Pradesh. The intense blasting at Pangi village caused this landslide. The blasting caused this slope\u2019s weak spot to collapse, severely damaging the road and the nearby villages.\n\nNational Disaster Management Authority\n\nAs per the Disaster Management Act, of 2005 the National Disaster Management Authority (NDMA), a statutory and apex body under the Chairmanship of the Prime Minister, is mandated to lay down the policies, plans, and guidelines for disaster management to ensure a timely and effective response to disasters.\n\nNational Landslide Risk Management Strategy\n\nA Task Force of Experts has been made for the formulation of a National Landslide Risk Management Strategy. The Task Force comprised of six Sub-Groups of experts addressing different components of landslide disaster risk reduction.\n\nThe Task Force was divided into six Sub-Groups as under:-\n\nSub-Group I: Generation of User-Friendly Landslide Hazard Maps\nSub-Group II: Development of Landslide Monitoring and Early Warning System\nSub-Group III: Awareness Programmes\nSub-Group IV: Capacity Building and Training of Stakeholders\nSub-Group V: Preparation of Mountain Zone Regulations & Policies\nSub-Group VI: Stabilization and Mitigation of Landslides and Creation of Special Purpose Vehicle (SPV) for Landslide Management\nCauses of Landslides\n\nLandslides can be triggered by both natural and anthropogenic means.\n\nNatural Causes of Landslide\n\nClimate: Soil stability may be significantly impacted by long-term climatic changes.\n\nEarthquakes: Seismic activities have, for a long time, contributed to landslides across the globe. Any moment tectonic plates move, the soil covering them also moves along.\n\nWeathering: Weathering is the natural procedure of rock deterioration that leads to weak, landslide-susceptive materials.\n\nErosion: Slope support is destroyed by erosion brought on by sporadic running water, such as streams, rivers, wind, currents, ice, and waves, which makes landslides more likely to happen.\n\nVolcanoes: Volcanic eruptions can trigger landslides. The stratovolcano is a typical example of a volcano responsible for most landslides across the globe.\n\nHuman causes of landslides\n\nMining: Landslides are greatly amplified by mining activities that use blasting techniques. The explosives\u2019 vibrations have the potential to damage the soil in other regions prone to landslides.\n\nTimber Harvesting: Clearcutting is a method of harvesting timber that involves cutting all old trees from the area. This method is hazardous since it completely destroys the local mechanical root system.\n\nEffects of Landslides\n\nImpact on the Economy: Landslide causes destruction of the property. Its rehabilitation and rebuilding cost millions.\n\nDamages to infrastructure: The force flow of mud, debris, and rocks as a result of a landslide can cause serious damage to personal property and other significant infrastructures such as roads, railways, leisure destinations, buildings, and communication systems.\n\nLoss of life: Communities living at the foot of hills and mountains are at greater risk of landslides. Most of the disaster-prone areas are highly populated which makes lives more miserable.\n\nAffects the beauty of landscapes: The flow of mud, rock, and debris disturbs the natural sight or beauty of a place.\n\nDecline river ecosystems: The substances landslide carries with themselves block or hinder their natural flow. It causes a serious impact on many river habitats like fish as they can die due to interference with the natural flow of water.\n\nTrigger Flood: It can lead to the diversion of river water that can lead to flood in areas and loss of properties as well.\n\nImpact on Livelihood: Communities depending on the river water or coasts for household activities, livelihood, and irrigation will suffer from it.\n\nAffect Development: Landslides make the development and other infrastructural projects risky as well as costly, which, in turn, adversely affects the developmental activities in these areas.\n\nMitigation\n\nThe following are the mitigation measures.\n\nArea-Specific Measures: It is always advisable to adopt area-specific measures to deal with landslides.\n\nRestriction on the Construction in Certain Areas: Restriction on the construction and other developmental activities such as roads and dams, limiting agriculture to valleys and areas with moderate slopes, and control on the development of large settlements in the high vulnerability zones, should be enforced.\n\nHazard Maps: Hazard mapping to locate areas prone to landslides. Hence, such areas can be avoided for building settlements.\n\nAfforestation: Some positive actions like promoting large-scale afforestation programs and the construction of bunds to reduce water flow.\n\nTerrace Farming: Terrace farming should be encouraged in the northeastern hill states where Jhumming (Slash and Burn/Shifting Cultivation) is still prevalent.\n\nLandslide Monitoring and Early Warning System: To warn people residing in landslide-prone areas in advance.\n\nScientific Technique Advancement: Advancement in scientific techniques will empower us to understand what factors cause landslides and how to manage them.\n\nConclusion\n\nLandslide-related disasters are typically much less dramatic than those brought on by earthquakes, volcanic eruptions, tsunamis, and cyclones, but their effects on the environment and the country\u2019s economy are no less catastrophic.\n\nThey are mostly influenced by extremely localized factors, in contrast to other disasters that are sudden or unpredictable, and are generally controlled by macro or regional factors.\n\nTherefore, gathering information and keeping an eye on the probability of a landslide is not only challenging but also quite expensive. However, certain mitigation methods can undoubtedly aid in lowering the cause and effect related to them.\n\nArticle Written By: Priti Raj",

The point where the energy is released is called the hypocenter, and the point on the surface directly above it is called the epicentre.\nVolcanic eruptions: Can cause damage through ash flows, mudflows, lava flows, landslides, and the release of gases.\nTsunamis: Can be caused by earthquakes, volcanic eruptions, landslides, underwater explosions, and meteorite impacts. For example, the 2004 Indian Ocean Tsunami was caused by an earthquake, and the 2018 tsunami was caused by the collapse of Anak Krakatoa.\nTropical cyclones: Are often found in the Bay of Bengal, the Gulf of Mexico, and the South China Sea.\n\nOther examples of geophysical phenomena include floods and landslides.\n\nEarthquake\n\nWe often hear about earthquakes in the news. They have a huge potential for destruction wherever they occur. Do you know what causes earthquakes?\n\nAn earthquake is a quick shaking or trembling of the earth\u2019s surface brought on by seismic waves or earthquake waves that are produced as a result of an abrupt movement (an abrupt release of energy) in the earth\u2019s crust (earthquakes with shallow foci) or upper mantle (some shallow-focus and all intermediate and deep-focus earthquakes).\n\n\ud83d\udc49 Which year are YOU targeting for success in the IAS/IPS/IFS Exam? \ud83d\ude80\n\n(1) \u21d2 UPSC 2025: Prelims cum Mains\n\n(2) \u21d2 UPSC 2026: Prelims cum Mains\n\n(3) \u21d2 UPSC 2027 Prelims cum Mains\n\nTip: Know more about ClearIAS Courses (Online/Offline)\n\nA seismograph, sometimes known as a seismometer, is a device to identify and document earthquakes.\n\nTo learn more about earthquakes, click here\n\nTsunami\n\n\u2018Tsunami\u2019 is a Japanese word meaning, \u2018harbour wave\u2019. A tsunami is a succession of waves with extremely long wavelengths that occur in vast bodies of water, such as seas or lakes, as a result of a significant disturbance above or below the water\u2019s surface or as a result of the displacement of a significant amount of water.\n\nAlthough the Moon and Sun\u2019s attractions have no bearing on how they arise, they are commonly referred to as tidal waves due to their long wavelengths.\n\nA tsunami can be produced by earthquakes (such as the Indian Ocean Tsunami in 2004), volcanic eruptions (such as the tsunami brought on by Krakatoa\u2019s violent eruption in 1883), landslides (such as the tsunami brought on by the collapse of a portion of Anak Krakatoa in 2018), underwater explosions, meteorite impacts, etc.\n\nTo know more about tsunamis, click here\n\nVolcanic Activity\n\nA volcano is an opening in the earth\u2019s crust through which gases, molten rock materials (lava), ash, steam etc. are emitted outward in the course of an eruption. Such vents or openings occur in those parts of the earth\u2019s crust where the rock strata are relatively weak. Volcanic activity is an example of endogenic process. Depending upon the explosive nature of the volcano, different landforms can be formed such as a plateau (if the volcano is not explosive) or a mountain (if the volcano is explosive in nature).\n\nTo learn more about volcanoes click here\n\nCyclones\n\nCyclones are the centres of low pressure. They are surrounded by closed isobars having increasing pressure outward.\n\nThe\u00a0wind circulation is from outside towards the central low pressure.\u00a0The inward flow of air is due to the pressure gradient force and the lowest pressure at the centre.\n\nDue to\u00a0Coriolis force, blowing winds are deflected from their paths-\u00a0rightwards in the Northern hemisphere\u00a0and\u00a0leftward in the Southern hemisphere. Thus, they rotate anti-clockwise in the Northern hemisphere and clockwise in the southern hemisphere.\n\nTo learn more about cyclones, click here\n\nAlso Read: Cyclones in the Arabian Sea: Why are they uncommon?\n\nEl Nino and La Nina\n\nYou might have heard about El Nino and La Nina. The El Ni\u00f1o/La Ni\u00f1a Southern Oscillation (ENSO) has a major influence on climate patterns in various parts of the world.\n\nIn addition to changes in the atmosphere, this naturally occurring geophysical phenomenon is caused by shifting ocean temperatures in the central and eastern equatorial Pacific.\n\nEl Nino\n\nEl Ni\u00f1o means Little Boy or Christ Child in Spanish.\n\nThe extraordinary warming of surface waters in the eastern tropical Pacific Ocean is referred to as El Nino, a climate pattern.\n\nIt is the \u201cwarm phase\u201d of a larger phenomenon known as the El Nino-Southern Oscillation (ENSO).\n\nIt happens more often than La Nina.\n\nLa Nina\n\nThe unusual cooling of the tropical eastern Pacific is referred to as La Nina, the \u201ccold phase\u201d of ENSO.\n\nContrary to El Nino, which typically lasts little longer than a year, La Nina occurrences may last between one and three years.\n\nEl Nino and La Nina peak during the winter in the Northern Hemisphere.\n\nTo learn more about El Nino and La Nina click here\n\nHeatwave\n\nAccording to the IMD, a heatwave is defined as a maximum temperature of at least 40 degrees Celsius for plains, 37 degrees Celsius for coastal regions, and at least 30 degrees Celsius for hilly regions.\n\nTo learn more about heat waves click here\n\nAtlantic Meridional Overturning Circulati0n (AMOC)\n\nThe Atlantic Meridional Overturning Circulation (AMOC) is a major ocean current system that transports warm surface waters from the tropics toward the northern Atlantic and colder deep waters that are part of the\u00a0thermohaline circulation, southward. One of the main ways the ocean circulates heat, salt, carbon, and nutrients throughout the world\u2019s oceans is through overturning circulation.\n\nTo learn more about AMOC click here\n\nHot Springs\n\nA hot spring, often referred to as a geothermal spring, is an actual water spring that erupts as a result of heated groundwater. Either magma within the Earth\u2019s crust or fault movement within the crust causes heat to be created.\n\nLandslides\n\nThe movement of a mass of rock, rubble, or dirt down a slope is referred to as a landslide. Landslides are a sort of \u201cmass wasting,\u201d which refers to any downward movement of soil or rock caused by gravity alone.\n\nA landslide is a natural occurrence that occurs when soil, rock, or other debris falls as a result of gravity.\n\nIt is brought on by several terrain-specific geo factors (such as slope, lithology, rock structure, land use/cover, geomorphology, etc.), but is typically brought on by torrential rain or earthquake shocks.\n\nRead: Mass wasting\n\nGlacial Lake Outburst Flooding (GLOF)\n\nA glacial lake outburst flood (GLOF) occurs when a moraine dam or ice-dam glacial lake fails, releasing meltwater. They result in terrible floods downstream, resulting in significant loss of life and property.\n\nGLOFs have three main characteristics:\n\nThere is an abrupt release of water\nThese are typically brief episodes that last for a few hours to many days.\nThey create significant river outflows downstream.\n\nTo learn more about GLOF click here\n\nCloudbursts\n\nCloudbursts are localised, intense downpour occurrences that last only for a short duration.\nIt is a weather phenomenon where unanticipated precipitation exceeds 100 mm per hour across an area of around 20 to 30 square kilometres.\n\nTo learn more about cloudbursts click here\n\nArticle written by: Caroline",

For eg: the Aravallis of India formed during Precambrian times, denuded and lowered in height over time, now stands as a relic of ancient fold mountains.\n\n\ud83d\udc49 Which year are YOU targeting for success in the IAS/IPS/IFS Exam? \ud83d\ude80\n\n(1) \u21d2 UPSC 2025: Prelims cum Mains\n\n(2) \u21d2 UPSC 2026: Prelims cum Mains\n\n(3) \u21d2 UPSC 2027 Prelims cum Mains\n\nTip: Know more about ClearIAS Courses (Online/Offline)\n\nCHANGES IN MOUNTAINS AND THEIR REASONS\nGradual denudation and lowering of reliefs due to geomorphic processes such as weathering and erosion by rivers, wind, groundwater, etc\nEndogenetic forces such as volcanism lead to the development of new volcanic mountains or changes in old formations.\nAnthropogenic causes such as urbanization, tourism, agriculture, and other developmental activities affect the morphology of mountains.\nNatural disasters such as earthquakes and landslides bring major structural and morphological changes in mountainous regions.\nEFFECTS OF THESE CHANGES\nPositive\n\t\nNegative\n\n\n\u25cf\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Weathering and erosion help in soil formation downslope For eg: Great Indian Plains\n\t\n\u25cf\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Loss of surface soil from slopes devoid of mountains of fertile soils\n\n\n\u25cf\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Helps in understanding the formation and development of\u00a0 reliefs and their compositions\n\t\n\u25cf\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Lack of knowledge of slope management practices renders developmental activities vulnerable to exceeded weathering and erosion as well as natural hazards\n\n\n\u25cf\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Mining helps in the extraction of various mineral resources.\n\t\n\u25cf\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Natural disasters such as earthquakes and landslides cause damage to human life and property. For eg: the Himalayan region is under Zone 4 and Zone 5 of Earthquake mapping zones in India\n\n\n\u25cf\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Better planning and management practices. For eg: The watershed development program\n\t\n\u25cf\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Threat to water security as mountains provide nearly 70% of freshwater to the planet\n\n\n\t\n\u25cf\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Threat to livelihood as mountains provide nearly 20% of global tourism.\nWater bodies\n\nThe following are the various water bodies and the changes associated.\n\nRIVER\n\nAlthough rivers cover only 0.1% of the land, these are considered a critical part of landscapes due to their major role in human life.\n\nThis is corroborated by the fact that major settlements around the world have been around major rivers.\n\nFor example Prayagraj, Agra on banks of Ganga River System; Shanghai- Yangtze River; New york\u2013Hudson River, etc. Therefore, studying changes in the river and its regime becomes important.\n\nCHANGES IN RIVER AND THEIR REASONS\nThe cycle of Erosion- of the river defines its ever-changing nature depicted through different stages i.e, the young stage(small, swift river with vertical corrasion), mature stage(large volume with lateral erosion), and old stage(senile, less volume with only deposition work).\nHeadward erosion leads to the retreat of slopes causing river captures as well as a reduction in relief height.\nClimate change and resultant Changes in Rivers.\nRise in water temperature For ex: According to a recent study by Scientific Report, river water temperatures could rise to 35 degrees Celsius from the present 30 degrees Celsius by 20270-2100, and dissolved oxygen concentrations could drop in Indian rivers.\nDepleting sources of rivers such as glaciers and lack of snow deposition on mountain tops.\nFrequent changes in river courses.\nIncreasing pollution in rivers- Central Pollution Control Board in 2018 found 351 polluted stretches of rivers in India. This is largely due to sewage and industrial waste discharge into the rivers.\nConstruction of Multipurpose projects on rivers for energy as well as drinking and agricultural purposes.\nInterlinking of Rivers to effectively manage water resources by providing excess water from water-rich states to water-deficient states.For ex-: The Ken-Betwa link project\nOther Anthropogenic factors affecting changes in river flows such as illegal sand mining for constructions, overexploitation of fish resources, discharge of untreated sewage and industrial waste, etc.\nEFFECTS OF CHANGES ON RIVER SYSTEMS\n\nThe following are the major changes associated\n\nPositive:\n\nThe cycle of erosion not only maintains the natural ecology of rivers but also:\nDeposit the fertile alluvium on flood plains necessary for agriculture.\nThis leads to the formation of picturesque features such as waterfalls, canyons, gorges,ox-bow lakes, deltas, etc which help the tourism industry to flourish and provide a livelihood to local people\nNatural changes help in maintaining the ecological flow and aquatic life of rivers\nMultipurpose projects have added to the clean, green, and renewable energy capacity of countries.\nInterlinking of rivers is a noble solution for water-stressed areas\n\n\u00a0Negative:\n\nClimate change has impacted rivers in varying degrees right from depleting their sources, rising water temperatures, etc to threatening the natural habitats of native fish and other organisms\nPollution in rivers has only added to the already scarce water resources which have threatened water security. For eg: More than 600 million people in India are suffering from severe water shortages, according to the NITI Aayog\u2019s Composite Water Management Index.\nFrequent changes in river courses lead to floods causing damage to human life and property and it also affects river ecosystems. For example, A significant flood in India in 2008 prompted the Kosi River to switch to an older channel, displacing 3 million people and claiming more than 250 lives.\nMultipurpose projects are not without negative effects such as sedimentation on river beds, dislocation of people, and destruction of flora and fauna, especially aquatic life.\nFluctuations in river flow also affect the Hydrological cycle as these are an essential component that further aggravates the scarcity of freshwater.\nInterlinking of rivers also affects the natural flows of rivers which will affect aquatic ecosystems, ecological flow, etc. of the rivers.\nRising disputes between states over sharing of river water due to water shortages among different regions. For eg: the Cauvery water dispute between Tamil Nadu, Kerala, Karnataka, and Puducherry.\nDams and reservoirs over transboundary rivers threaten water security in downstream countries. For eg: India\u2019s concern since 2015 when China operationalized its project at Zangmu on the Brahmaputra river\u00a0\nGroundwater\n\nA part of the rainwater percolates in the rocks and the soils and is available as groundwater.\n\nGroundwater is vital to human welfare and development, and in many countries, it is the principal source of water for drinking, irrigation, and industry.\n\nAs a core component of the hydrological cycle, groundwater is also critical to sustaining many aquatic and terrestrial ecosystems.\n\nHowever, various issues have emerged regarding its sustainable use and management especially in the present scenario when there are severe water shortages around the world.\n\nCHANGES IN GROUNDWATER\nDepletion of groundwater resources\u2013 Dynamic Ground Water Resource Assessment Report 2022 states that the total annual groundwater recharge is 437.60 Billion Cubic Meters (BCM) and the annual groundwater extraction is 239.16 BCM.\nAgriculture -accounts for nearly 90% of groundwater withdrawals. Practices such as power subsidies for irrigation, MSP for water-intensive crops such as rice, green revolution, and lack of regulations have expedited its extraction.\nUse for drinking and cooking purposes in water-stressed areas\nDeforestation, urbanization, metalled road construction, etc has led to a decline in the percolation of water underground and hence the recharge of aquifers.\nIndustries, the second-largest users of groundwater i.e approx.5%, likewise rely on groundwater to meet their water requirements.\nVirtual water trade plays a major role in depleting groundwater.\nOverexploitation of existing resources. Out of the country\u2019s total of 7089 assessment units, 1006 units have been labeled as over-exploited.\nPollution with the addition of contaminants such as arsenic, fluoride, iron, and other heavy metals is caused due to human activity, such as residential sewage, agricultural practices, industrial effluents, etc.\nCONSEQUENCES\nThe hydrological cycle is interrupted as groundwater acts as its major component\nWater stress and insecurity are already on the rise and depleting groundwater resources amplify this many folds. The rising population and increased urbanization also increase the demand for domestic water.\nThreat to food security as more than 60% of irrigation in agriculture is met by groundwater in India. This especially has risen after the green revolution.\nIncreased incidents of droughts around the world.\nHealth issues, such as groundwater contamination such as arsenic and fluoride cause cancer and skin problems.\nHealth also impacts Human Capital formation because of high mortality and lifelong diseases among children and adults.\nThe economy of the country is also impacted due to the dependence of many industries on groundwater\nOcean\n\nOceans cover approximately 70.8% of the surface of Earth and contain 97.2%(including ice) of Earth\u2019s water and are divided into five major oceans namely the Arctic, Atlantic, Indian, Pacific, and Southern Oceans.\n\nIn addition to this oceans represent the largest aquatic ecosystem on planet earth i.e, the Marine ecosystem. Also, oceans contain large reserves of various important resources such as petroleum, fish and other food resources, mineral resources, etc.\n\nOceans and oceanic currents play a major role in maintaining the earth\u2019s climate and wind patterns. Hence these become an important part of the study of changing critical geographical features.\n\nCHANGES IN OCEANS\nNatural changes such as:\nSea Floor Spreading along Mid Oceanic Ridge(Plate Tectonics).\nCreation of new oceans such as the Great African Rift Valley which is in the nascent stage in the process of ocean formation.\n\nThese, however, are prolonged processes that take millions of years to complete.\n\nClimate change results in changes such as:\nOcean acidification\u00a0lowering of ocean pH is a shift in ocean chemistry brought on by the ocean\u2019s uptake of carbon compounds from the atmosphere.\nOcean warming\u2013 According to IPCC since 1970, the world\u2019s oceans have continued to warm, absorbing more than 90% of the extra heat in the climate system.\nSea level rise due to temperature rise( Thermal expansion of oceans), melting of glaciers, etc. IPCC Sixth Assessment Report- Global mean sea level increased by 0.20m between 1901 and 2018.\nPollution: creates the following changes\nEutrophication occurs when the environment becomes\nenriched with nutrients, increasing the amount of plant and algae growth in estuaries and coastal waters.\nPlastic pollution \u2013 Land-based activities such as urban and stormwater runoff, sewer overflows, littering, improper waste management, industrial operations, tire abrasion, building, and illegal dumping are the main sources of plastic debris detected in the ocean.\nCoral Bleaching due to climate change, increased ocean temperature, and eutrophication.\nHuman-induced changes such as increased exploration for oil and mineral resources, ocean thermal energy extraction, fishing, transportation of goods, etc impact oceans and their ecosystem. For eg: oil spills create dead zones in oceans.\nIMPACTS OF SUCH CHANGES\nNatural changes help us understand the evolution of the earth and its crust such as the presence of a relatively new oceanic crust near Mid Oceanic Ridge which becomes older away from it as well as the oceanic crust being relatively new concerning continental crust.\nOceans absorb extra heat from the atmosphere therefore these changes help regulate the Earth\u2019s climate\nEnergy security by harnessing ocean wave energy.\nFood and nutritional security through fishing, whaling, ocean ranching, etc., and alternate livelihood opportunities for the poor.\n\nNevertheless, the above benefits are availed at a much larger cost:\n\nClimate change \u2013 has led to the following harmful impacts on oceans:-\nChanges in oceanic current patterns and the reduction difference between cold and warm currents have impacted the earth\u2019s heat budget, fish production, the livelihood of fishers, etc\nChange in wind and weather patterns for ex: the frequency of El NINO \u2013 Southern Oscillations has increased.\nSea level rise has become a major problem for Small Island Nations as they face submergence danger. This also impacts coastal erosion, coastal livelihood, etc.\nThe increased temperature of oceans has also impacted their biodiversity due to the increased demand for oxygen.\nPollution in oceans has threatened marine species as well as humans on a larger scale.\nFor example, Eutrophication contaminates water, negatively affects seashore recreational opportunities, creates a dead water zone or hypoxia, and depleted oxygen levels impair or could kill fish in large numbers and change species composition.\nPlastic, mainly in the form of microplastic, enters the food web through bioaccumulation and biomagnification.\nOther pollutants such as disposal of harmful chemicals, industrial waste, Agri nutrients, etc also deteriorate ocean ecosystems.\nCoral bleaching also is dangerous for many reasons. Corals are an indicator of a healthy marine ecosystem and play a major role in its food chain, their destruction can impact coastal protection and biodiversity. Their destruction also impacts tourism and therefore the livelihood of people.\nOverexploitation of fish resources through unscientific practices such as trawling has impacted ocean diversity.\nExtraction of petroleum, polymetallic nodules, other metallic and non-metallic minerals, and oil spills also disrupt marine life.\nGlaciers and Ice-Caps\n\nCurrently, glaciers and ice caps cover around 10% of the earth\u2019s land surface, especially in regions like Greenland and Antarctica. Glaciers can be found in mountain ranges also, although, on Earth, 99% of the glacial ice is stored within enormous ice sheets in the polar regions.\n\nThe amount, variability, and water quality of runoff in their immediate vicinity are all impacted by glaciers, which are significant components of Earth\u2019s water cycle.\n\nThese also provide some of the most spectacular landforms such as Moraines, fiords, cirques, icebergs, etc. on the surface of Earth.\n\nHowever, with the advent of human-induced climate change, these experience various changes some of which are irreversible.\n\nCHANGES EXPERIENCED BY GLACIERS AND ICE CAPS\n\nThe following changes are associated with icecaps\n\nClimate change\n\nClimate change is the leading cause of changes in the mass of ice cover over the earth\u2019s surface. This process of climate change affecting ice cover is natural as is evident from the geological time scale.\n\nThere have been numerous warm periods\u2014as when the dinosaurs were alive\u2014and many cold ones, like the most recent ice age, which lasted for around 20,000 years. A large portion of the northern hemisphere was covered in ice and glaciers during the last ice age.\n\nHowever, at present, this change is more prominent due to anthropogenic activities such as agriculture, industrialization, carbon emissions, deforestation, vehicular emissions, etc causing global warming.\n\nGreenland ice sheet- lost ice mass at an average rate of 278 billion tonnes every year between 2006 and 2015(IPCC report). Also, another phenomenon is called zombie ice, which does not accumulate fresh snow even while continuing to be part of the parent ice sheet.\nAntarctica\u2019s Melting Ice \u2013 for ex: Doomsday Glacier also known as The Thwaites Glacier is 120 km wide at its widest point, moving quickly, and melting rapidly over time.\nThawing of Permafrost regions \u2013 Permafrost is a permanently frozen layer on or under Earth\u2019s surface. It consists of soil, gravel, and sand, usually bound together by ice. Permafrost usually remains at or below 0\u00b0C (32\u00baF) for at least two years. Permafrost can be found on land and below the ocean floor. According to a recent study, an additional 1.5 million square miles of permafrost may eventually disappear for every 1.8\u00b0F (1\u00b0C) of warming.\nChanges in glacial landforms such as an increased number of glacial lakes, moraines, glacial till, etc.\nIMPACT OF MELTING GLACIER AND ICE CAPS\nSea Level Rise\u2013 for ex: Thwaites glaciers\u2019 melting already contributes 4% annually to the rise in sea level causing storm surges and coastal erosion, coastal storms like hurricanes and typhoons brought on by warming air and ocean temperatures.\nChange in Weather patterns \u2013 Because of modifications to the jet stream brought on by a combination of warming air and ocean temperatures in the Arctic and the tropics, the polar vortex is surfacing outside of the Arctic more regularly. This is due to the change in circulations in oceans brought about by melting Antarctic and Greenland Ice.\nLoss of wildlife habitats as glacier mountains are home to critical species such as snow leopards, polar bears, etc.\nDepleting sources of freshwater as many major glaciers feed the headstreams of major rivers. In the Himalayan, for example, the Ganga River, Yamuna River, and Indus River are all fed by glaciers such as Gangotri and Yamunotri.\nIncreased incidents of floods and Glacial Outbursts due to increasing water influx lead to loss of life and property.\nLoss of livelihood especially in coastal areas due to coastal erosion, submergence, increased storm surges due to sea level rise\nImpacts of Permafrost Thawing \u2013\nIncreasing incidents of Viruses and Bacteria- The potential danger was highlighted by a 2016 anthrax epidemic in Siberia that was connected to a decades-old reindeer carcass revealed by melted permafrost.\nThawing of frozen soil \u2013 recommences the decomposition process of dead organic matter that was earlier paused due to the freezing of dead plants and animals which results in the emission of greenhouse gases.\nFlora and Fauna\n\nThe term \u201cflora\u201d refers to all plant life that is present in a certain area or time, usually only the native, naturally occurring plants. Whereas, all of the animal life that is present in a certain area or time is known as fauna.\n\nBecause they make up the delicate web of life, where each organism has something to offer, even if only in a very small way, the flora and fauna are essential.\n\nThe earth\u2019s plants create the oxygen that the fauna breathes, and the fauna then exhales the carbon dioxide that the flora needs to survive. Humans are unable to survive without either of these substances.\n\nTherefore it is important to understand any changes in flora and fauna for us to implement better planning and management practices concerning sustainable development.\n\nChanges in Flora\n\nThe following are the various changes associated\n\nGrasslands\nGrasslands make up 40% of the land area. These typically exist between mountainous and desert climates. Only 10% of the world\u2019s grasslands are protected, though.\nOnly 1% of the original tallgrass prairie remains today, while over 50% of all temperate grasslands and 16% of tropical grasslands have been converted to agriculture or industrial purposes.\nConversion of grasslands for economic activities such as ranching, Dairy Farms, Sheep rearing for wool, etc in North and South America, New Zealand, Australia, etc.\nDegradation of grasslands due to unscientific agricultural practices such as monocropping, chemical fertilizers, and overgrazing.\nThe advent of invasive species has impacted local vegetation.\nTherefore, the fauna inhabiting these grasslands is also in decline such as African Cheetah being vulnerable under IUCN.\nClimate Change has also impacted grasslands as their relatively flat geography makes them more vulnerable to the effects of climate change and animals must travel great distances to adapt to temperature changes.\nCONSEQUENCES\nBiodiversity loss due to the extinction of plant and animal species.\nLand degradation and desertification.\nFood insecurity will further as these sustain major agricultural activities.\nImpact on cultural and recreational activities such as Savanna Safari where people interact with nature and wild animals.\nThreat to the livelihood of tribal people who are dependent on grassland and its fauna for survival.\nForest\n\nAccording to the Global Forest Resources Assessment 2020 (FRA 2020), representing almost 31% of the world\u2019s surface area, forests were reported to encompass 4.06 billion hectares in 2020.\n\nForests offer more than just habitat for animals and means of subsistence for people. They also protect watersheds, stop soil erosion, and lessen the effects of climate change.\n\nGiven these advantages, the forest area around the world is still in decline.\n\nCHANGES IN FORESTS\nLoss of Forests due to deforestation which in turn is caused by various activities such as agriculture, urbanization, mineral exploration, etc. According to the State of the World\u2019s Forests 2022\u00a0 420 million hectares of forests have been lost between 1990 and 2020 from deforestation.\nForest Degradation due to illegal logging.\nDeclining floral and faunal biodiversity of forests due to human encroachments, climate change, etc.\nConversion of forests into conservation reserves and protected areas to protect local flora and fauna.\nInvasive species of trees are on the rise.\nIncreased incidence of Forest fires. For eg: Wildfires in the Amazon forests in Brazil and in Australia in the last two years, were caused by both climate change and human activities.\nWestern Maharashtra, Southern Chhattisgarh, regions of Telangana and Andhra Pradesh, together with central Odisha, are \u201cextremely prone\u201d forest fire hotspots, according to the MoEFCC 2020\u20132021 annual report.\nEFFECTS OF CHANGES IN FORESTS\nIncreased Greenhouse Gas Emissions as 15% of greenhouse gas emissions are due to deforestation and forest degradation.\nRise in temperatures, changes in patterns of weather and water, and an increased frequency of extreme weather events due to climate change caused by such emissions.\nSoil Erosion increases due to shifting cultivation, removal of forests for agriculture, etc.\nDisruption of the Hydrological cycle because by assisting in maintaining equilibrium between water on the ground and water in the atmosphere, trees play a significant part in the local water cycle. However, this equilibrium can be upset by deforestation or environmental degradation, changing precipitation, and river flow.\nDestruction and Loss of biodiversity due to wildfires.\nDisruption of Livelihoods- Around the world, 1.25 billion people depend on forests for their homes, means of subsistence, and access to water, fuel, and food. And 750 million people live in the woods, which is almost one-fifth of all rural residents.\nLoss of culturally significant sacred groves.\nIncrease in Infectious Diseases: Forests are related to 15% of 250 Emerging Infectious Diseases.\nMangrove\n\nMangrove forests are fertile wetlands that grow in coastal intertidal zones. They are also known as mangrove swamps, mangrove thickets, or mangals. Due to mangroves\u2019 inability to survive subfreezing temperatures, mangrove forests are primarily found in tropical and subtropical latitudes.\n\nAround 80 different species of mangroves have been identified as existing on maritime beaches throughout the world. Based on remote sensing and worldwide data for 2010, the Global Mangrove Watch Initiative published a global baseline in 2018.\n\nAccording to this, there are mangrove forests in 118 different countries and territories with a total area of 137,600 km2 (53,100 sq mi) as of 2010.\n\nCHANGES IN MANGROVE FORESTS\u00a0\nIn the face of infrastructural development, urbanization, and agricultural land conversion, mangroves are disappearing at a rate that is three to five times faster than the overall loss of world forest cover, according to UNESCO.\nA fifth of the degradation of mangrove ecosystems is due to shrimp cultivation.\nClimate Change \u2013 Greater sea level increases have been linked to the breakdown of the mangrove ecosystem, according to recent studies.\nIllegal logging, invasive species, and a decline in biodiversity have also altered mangrove distribution.\nIMPACTS OF CHANGES IN MANGROVES\u00a0\nEcological Destabilization as mangroves serves as a reservoir in the tertiary absorption of waste, helping to construct and preserve the soil.\nLoss of Biodiversity with loss of mangroves as diverse varieties of fauna, including birds, fish, insects, mammals, and plants, find habitat and safety here.\nMangrove forests protect the shoreline from erosion caused by storm surges, currents, waves, and tides. Hence, these also protect human life and property in coastal areas. For example, during the 2004 Tsunami coastal communities in Tamil Nadu suffered minimal damage.\nPositive Feedback to Climate Change \u2013 because these represent 10\u201315% of carbon burial.\nLoss of LIvelihood to many coastal communities dependent upon mangroves for their fuel and fodder.\nCHANGES IN FAUNA\u00a0\nAccording to scientific research, Earth\u2019s wildlife populations have decreased by an average of 69% in just under 50 years.\nThe average size of the wildlife population has seen the steepest decline which is 94% in 48 years in Latin America and the Caribbean, including the Amazon.\nThe sixth mass extinction, which is the biggest loss of life on Earth since the extinction of the dinosaurs, is widely believed to be occurring right now, and many scientists feel that humans are to blame.\nFreshwater populations have decreased the most, according to the WWF, with an average reduction of 83% between 1970 and 2018. According to the IUCN Red List, amphibians are the species that are most in danger, followed by corals and an ancient group of seed plants called cycads.\nExtinction of species \u2013 most recently such Pinta Giant Tortoise, Yangtze River Dolphin, Western Black Rhinoceros, and Ivory Billed Woodpecker with more than 42,100 species facing extinction.\nHabitats of many species such as Asiatic lions, African Cheetahs, tigers, etc. have come to only a few restricted places. For example, Asiatic Lions are only found in Gir National Park.\nIncreasing the number of conservation areas around the world to protect the loss of biodiversity.\n\nReasons for changes in Fauna\n\nNatural causes: Floods, landslides, earthquakes, volcanic eruptions other natural disasters also cause loss of biodiversity.\nHabitat loss and fragmentation \u2013 are the main factors causing the extinction of animals and plants. Natural forests are cut down to provide room for businesses, farms, dams, homes, recreational activities, etc. Tropical rainforests are the most shocking examples of habitat loss.\nLand use change is still the biggest current threat to nature, destroying or fragmenting the natural habitats of many plant and animal species on land, in freshwater, and the sea.\nOverexploitation by humans over the past 500 years has led to the extinction of numerous species (Steller\u2019s sea cow, passenger pigeon), etc.\nClimate Change \u2013 Animals have reacted differently to climate change than humans. Climate change causes species to migrate, adapt, or, if neither of those things happens, to go extinct.\nIntroduction of alien invasive species \u2013 The native catfish in Indian rivers are in danger due to the recent illegal introduction of the African catfish for aquaculture reasons.\nIllegal Poaching and Hunting are the main cause of extinction of many animal and fish species, for ex: Asian cheetah while others are on the brink of extinction such as the one-horned rhino, Tiger, Elephants\nIllegal trade in wildlife for their use in medicines and decorative purposes eg Mongoose hair, rhino horn, snake skins, tiger and leopard claws, etc\n\nEffects of Changes in Fauna\n\nDisruption in Ecosystems \u2013 If a species has a unique function in its ecosystem, it\u2019s the extinction of other species and the ecosystem itself.\nMultiple Effects of Losing Apex Predators \u2013 Scientists claim that the loss of these species has contributed to pandemics, fires, the invasive spread of species, the deterioration of ecosystem services, and a drop in carbon sequestration.\nPollination is negatively impacted as approximately all blooming plants in the tropical rainforest are pollinated by animals, as are 75% of the world\u2019s food crops, which are either entirely or partially pollinated by insects and other animals.\nLosing the healing benefits of nature \u2013 More than 25% of prescription drugs include compounds that were found in plants or animals. The source of penicillin was a fungus.\nIncreased Human-Wildlife conflict due to habitat loss and deforestation. For ex: In reserves, 125 people were killed by tigers between 2019 and 2021. With 6 deaths, Maharashtra accounted for almost half of these.\nThis also leads to other Impacts such as damage to crops, increased cruelty towards animals, the economic burden on farmers, etc.\nDestruction of livelihood \u2013 According to a study for the U.N., the continued loss of species could cost the world 18 percent of global economic output by 2050.\n\nArticle Written By: Ankit Sharma",

Thus, through the processes of evaporation, transpiration, condensation, and precipitation, there is a constant exchange of water between the atmosphere, the seas, and the continents.\nWith height, the amount of water vapour drops. It likewise gets smaller as you get closer to the poles from the equator (or from low latitudes) (or towards the high latitudes).\nIts maximum amount of water in the atmosphere could be up to 4% which is found in the warm and wet regions.\nWater in the atmosphere (vapour) retains the heat that the planet radiates by absorbing some of the incoming solar radiation (insolation) from the sun. As a result, it works as a blanket, keeping the ground from getting too hot or too cold.\nWater vapour also contributes to stability and instability in the air.\n\nTo know about atmospheric circulation, click here.\n\n\u00a0Humidity\n\nWater vapour present in the air is known as Humidity.\n\nAbsolute humidity\nRelative humidity\nABSOLUTE HUMIDITY\nAbsolute humidity is the measure of the actual water vapour content of the air.\nIt is measured in terms of grams per cubic meter and represents the weight of water vapour per volume of air.\nThe absolute humidity\u00a0differs\u00a0from place to place on the surface of the earth.\nThe temperature of the air determines simply whether or not it can hold water vapour (Warm air can hold more moisture than cold air).\nRELATIVE HUMIDITY\nThe relative humidity is the ratio of the amount of moisture in the air to its maximum capacity at a particular temperature.\nThe ability to hold moisture increases or decreases as the air temperature changes and the relative humidity is also impacted.\nOver oceans, the relative humidity is higher, whereas, over continents, it is lower (absolute humidity is greater over oceans because of the greater availability of water for evaporation).\nThe amount and rate of evaporation are determined by the relative humidity, making it a crucial climatic component.\nDEW POINT\nAt a specific temperature, the air is considered to be saturated when it is fully saturated with moisture.\nIt signifies that at that point, the air at the specified temperature is unable to hold any more moisture.\nThe dew point is the temperature at which a given sample of air becomes saturated.\nDew point occurs when Relative Humidity is 100%\nEvaporation And Condensation\n\nWater in the atmosphere consists of evaporation and condensation forms.\n\nEVAPORATION\nWater changes from a liquid to a gas through the process of evaporation.\nEvaporation is mostly caused by heat. The latent heat of vapourization is the term used to describe the temperature at which water begins to evaporate.\nThe given parcel of air can absorb and hold more water when the temperature rises. Similar to this, low moisture content air has the potential to absorb and hold moisture. The saturated layer is replaced by the unsaturated layer as a result of air movement. Therefore, evaporation increases in direct proportion to air movement.\nCONDENSATION\nIt is the process by which water vapour turns into actual water.\nCondensation is caused by the loss of heat.\nThe degree of cooling and the relative humidity of the air affect condensation.\nThe amount of air present, the temperature, the pressure, and the humidity all affect condensation.\nBoth when the dew point is lower than the freezing point and when it is greater than the freezing point, condensation occurs.\nIt takes place:\n\nwhen the temperature of the air is dropped to dew point while maintaining its volume constant (adiabatically);\n\nwhen both the volume and the temperature are reduced;\n\nAnd when moisture is added to the air through evaporation.\n\nAfter condensation, the water vapour or the moisture in the atmosphere takes one of the following forms \u2014 dew, frost, fog, and clouds.\u00a0\n\nDEW\nDew is formed when moisture is deposited as water droplets on cooler surfaces of solid objects (rather than nuclei in the air on the surface) such as stones, grass blades, and plant leaves.\nThe ideal conditions for its formation are\u00a0a clear sky, calm air, high relative humidity, and\u00a0cold and long nights.\nFor the formation of dew, it is necessary that the\u00a0dew point is above the freezing point.\u00a0\nFROST\nFrost forms on cold surfaces when condensation takes place\u00a0below the freezing point (0\u00b0 C), i.e. the\u00a0dew point\u00a0is at or below the freezing point.\nInstead of water droplets, the extra moisture is deposited as minute ice crystals.\nThe optimum conditions for the creation of white frost are the same as those for the formation of dew, with the exception that the air temperature must be at or below freezing.\nFOG\nWhen the temperature of an air mass containing a substantial amount of water vapour suddenly drops, condensation occurs on small dust particles inside the air mass.\nSo, the fog is a\u00a0cloud with its base at or very near the ground. Because of the fog and mist, the visibility becomes poor to zero.\n\nRadiation smog\u00a0often arises at night when surface heat is reflected into space. As the earth\u2019s surface cools, the air becomes completely humid, transforming into a fog.\n\nAdvection fog\u00a0is similar to radiation fog in appearance, but it is generated when warm moist air travels horizontally over a cold surface, generating condensation. Sea fog is a typical kind of advection smog.\n\nIce fog\u00a0is formed from ice crystals. Ice fog forms when the air temperature is below freezing.\u00a0\n\nFreezing fog\u00a0is made up of supercooled water droplets that turn from liquid to ice when they come into touch with a cold surface. Objects exposed to freezing fog frequently develop ice covering.\n\nFog is generally associated with hazardous driving conditions. Because drivers cannot see very far in front of them (oftentimes, their depth perception becomes skewed), foggy weather can cause many dangerous accidents.\n\nSmoke generates a large number of nuclei that aid in the development of fog and mist in urban and industrial areas. Smog is a phenomenon that occurs when fog and smoke mingle.\n\u00a0COMPARISON BETWEEN FOG AND SMOG\nFog\n\t\nSmog\n\n\n\u00a0Water droplets condensed around a dust particle.\n\t\nWater droplets condensed around a particle of pollutant like SO2.\n\n\n\u00a0It reduces visibility and damages the crops.\n\t\nReduces visibility.\n\n\n\t\nCauses health issues.\n\u00a0Clouds\nA cloud is a mass of minute water droplets or microscopic ice crystals generated by the condensation of water vapour in free air at high altitudes.\nAs the clouds are formed at some height over the surface of the earth, they take various shapes.\nAccording to their height, expanse, density, and transparency or opaqueness, clouds are grouped under four types :\nCIRRUS\nCirrus clouds are formed at high altitudes (8,000 \u2013 12,000m)\nThey are thin and detached clouds having a\u00a0feathery appearance.\u00a0\nThey are always white.\n\u00a0 CUMULUS\nCumulus clouds look like\u00a0cotton wool.\nThese are generally formed at a height of 4,000 \u2013 7,000 m.\nThey exist in patches and can be seen scattered here and there.\nThese clouds have a flat base.\n\u00a0\u00a0 STRATUS\u00a0\nThese are layered clouds covering large portions of the sky.\nThese clouds are generally formed either due to loss of heat or the mixing of air masses with different temperatures.\nNIMBUS\nNimbus clouds are black or dark grey.\nThey form at middle levels or very near to the surface of the earth.\nThese are extremely dense and opaque to the rays of the sun.\nNimbus clouds are shapeless masses of thick vapour.\n\nA combination of these four basic types can give rise to the following types of clouds:\n\nHigh clouds \u2013 cirrus, cirrostratus, cirrocumulus;\u00a0\nMiddle clouds \u2013 altostratus and altocumulus;\u00a0\nLow clouds \u2013 stratocumulus and nimbostratus (long duration rainfall cloud) and\u00a0\nClouds with extensive vertical development \u2013 cumulus and cumulonimbus (thunderstorm cloud)\u00a0\nPrecipitation\n\nAfter condensation, the release of moisture is known as precipitation.\n\nIt can occur in the following forms:\n\nRain:\u00a0Precipitation in the form of water is called rain.\n\nDrizzle:\u00a0It sprays like rainfall which is very slow with water droplets having 0.5mm diameter. They mostly happen via stratus clouds.\n\nSnow:\u00a0When the temperature falls below 0\u00b0 C, precipitation falls in the form of thin flakes of snow and is referred to as snowfall. Hexagonal crystals are formed as a result of the discharge of moisture. These crystals combine to make snowflakes.\n\nSleet:\u00a0It\u2019s made of frozen raindrops and refrozen melted snow. Sleet forms when a layer of air with a temperature above freezing overlies a layer of air with a temperature below freezing near the ground.\n\nTypes Of Rainfall\n\nBased on origin, rainfall may be classified into three main types \u2013\u00a0convectional, orographic or relief,\u00a0and\u00a0cyclonic or frontal.\u00a0\n\nConvectional Rainfall\nConvectional rainfall happens when the sun\u2019s energy heats the Earth\u2019s surface, forcing water to evaporate and produce water vapour.\nWhen the land warms, the air above it warms as well. As a result, the air expands and rises. The rising air cools and condenses. This condensation mechanism creates clouds high in the atmosphere.\nThis type of rainfall is very common in tropical areas.\nBecause convective clouds are more vertical than horizontal, their strength changes rapidly and across a smaller area.\nIn the tropics, convective rainfall results in hail storms whereas in mid-latitudes it results in cold fronts, squalls, and warm fronts.\nOrographic Rainfall\nWhen warm wet air is blocked by a mountain, it climbs to a high altitude along the mountain slope.\nIt condenses at high altitudes, resulting in severe rains. This is referred to as orographic rainfall.\nCyclonic Rain\nCyclonic Rainfall is\u00a0convectional rainfall on a large scale.\nPrecipitation in a tropical cyclone is convectional, whereas precipitation in a temperate cyclone is due to frontal activity.\nWorld Distribution of Rainfall\nDifferent places on the earth\u2019s surface receive different amounts of rainfall in a year.\nRainfall steadily decreases as we move from the equator to the pole.\nThe equatorial zone and the monsoon region of Southeast Asia have the most rainfall. Precipitation is modest in the middle latitudes, but it is scarce in the desert regions of the subtropics and around the poles.\nRain is greater on the eastern shores between latitudes 35\u00b0 and 40\u00b0 N and S of the equator and gradually decreases towards the west. However, due to the westerlies, rainfall is first obtained on the western borders of the continents and then decreases towards the east between 45\u00b0 and 65\u00b0 N and S of the equator.\nMajor precipitation regimes of the world are characterized based on total yearly precipitation as follows: o The trade winds from both hemispheres converge in the equatorial belt, causing a general upward motion of air that becomes intensified locally in tropical storms that produce very heavy rains in the Caribbean, the Indian and southwest Pacific oceans, and the China Sea, as well as thunderstorms that are particularly frequent and active over land areas.\nRainfall in the interior continental areas is moderate, ranging from 100 to 200 cm per year. The continents\u2019 coastal parts receive a moderate quantity of rainfall.\nRainfall in the central tropical area and the eastern and inner temperate lands ranges between 50 and 100 cm per year.\nLow precipitation at high latitudes, particularly in the polar regions, is caused partly by the subsidence of air in high-pressure belts and partly by cold temperatures. Snow and rainfall from time to time, but evaporation from the freezing sea and land surfaces is slow, and the frigid air has limited moisture capacity.\n\nTo learn more about the Composition and Structure of the Earth\u2019s Atmosphere click here\n\nArticle Written by: Remya",

Also dyewoods.\nLianas, epiphytic and parasitic plants are also found.\nIn such vegetation, trees of a single species are rare.\nSavanna or Sudan Climate (or Tropical Wet and Dry Climate)\n\n\ud83d\udc49 Which year are YOU targeting for success in the IAS/IPS/IFS Exam? \ud83d\ude80\n\n(1) \u21d2 UPSC 2025: Prelims cum Mains\n\n(2) \u21d2 UPSC 2026: Prelims cum Mains\n\n(3) \u21d2 UPSC 2027 Prelims cum Mains\n\nTip: Know more about ClearIAS Courses (Online/Offline)\n\nBetween equatorial woods and trade wind-heated deserts, the savanna or Sudan climate can be found.\nIt is restricted to the tropics (Tropics of Cancer and Capricorn) and is most developed in Sudan, where dry and wet climates are most distinct, therefore the name Sudan climate.\nIt covers much of Africa (Keya, Nigeria, Gambia) as well as large areas of Australia, South America (Brazilian highlands), and India.\nThe Savana Climate features a distinct dry season in the winter compared to other world climates. The region\u2019s rainfall is concentrated throughout the summer. Much vegetation dies during the lengthy dry season, and waterways dry up, causing animals to migrate.\nDISTRIBUTION\nIt is located on either side of the equator in tropical latitudes. It is well developed in Sudan, where there are distinct rainy and dry seasons, hence the name.\nAfrica (African Sudan, East Africa) and South America have this climate in the northern hemisphere (Llanos grasslands of Orinoco river basin).\nThis climate is prevalent in Australia, South America (Campos grasslands of the Brazilian Highlands), and the southern hemisphere (in Northern Australia \u2013 south of its monsoon strip).\n\nAlso read: International Climate Action in Civil Aviation\n\nTEMPERATURE\nFor lowlands, monthly temperatures in this area might vary from 20 to 32 degrees Celsius, but the range widens as one gets farther from the equator.\nThe annual average temperature is around 18 degrees centigrade\nThe greatest temperature is in April in the northern hemisphere and October in the southern hemisphere, right before the start of the rainy season. The summer solstice falls in the northern hemisphere in June, but it is not the hottest month.\nA cloudy sky causes temperatures to fall during the rainy season. Midday temperatures frequently exceed 37 degrees Celsius in the summer.\nTemperatures dip below 10 degrees centigrade even in the hot season due to rapid radiation loss at night caused by clear skies. A frequent occurrence during this season is night frost.\nThus, a typical characteristic feature of the Savanna climate is the extreme diurnal range of temperature.\nPRECIPITATION\nThe region is characterized by a hot, rainy season and a cool, dry season.\nThe hot and humid season lasts from May until September in the northern hemisphere (e.g., Kano, in Nigeria). The remainder of the year is chilly and dry. Over 80 centimetres of rain occur annually in Kano, which is more than 1500 metres above mean sea level, with the majority of it falling during the summer.\nIn the southern hemisphere, the rainy season begins in October and ends in March.\nAs one proceeds away from the equator and towards the desert borders, the length of the rainy season and total annual rainfall both decrease significantly.\nWINDS\nThe prevailing winds of the region that deliver rainfall to the coastal areas are known as trade winds. Easterly breezes blow from east to west, so rainfall is most on the east coasts.\nIn the summer, when the ITCZ is located over a scorching desert, they are at their strongest. They move over the coastal regions, expelling all the moisture, and by the time they get to the interiors of the continent, they are comparatively dry.\nThe easterly trade winds in West Africa blow offshore, bringing dry, dusty winds from the Sahara to the coast of Guinea. This hot, dry, dusty breeze is referred to locally as \u201cthe doctor\u201d or \u201cHarmattan.\u201d\nAlthough Harmattan has a terrible impact on the crops, it also has a cooling effect. By speeding up evaporation, it offers some relief from Guinea\u2019s humid air.\nTrade winds are to blame for the region\u2019s distinct, alternating dry and wet seasons. Rainfall is brought on by onshore trade winds during the summer. Off-shore winds keep the weather dry during the winter.\nVEGETATION\nTall grass and little trees make up much of the local vegetation. \u2018Parkland\u2019 or \u2018bush-veld\u2019 are other terms for grassland.\nAlong with the river banks, tree cover is maximum towards the equator and declines in density and height further from it.\nThe trees are deciduous, which means they lose their leaves in the cool, dry months to reduce transpiration losses. Acacia is a classic representative of this kind.\nOther tree varieties include those with wide trunks that function as water reservoirs to assist them to endure dry spells or droughts. For instance, bottle trees, baobabs, etc.\nThey are hardwood trees, sometimes thorny, which exude gum like the \u2018gum Arabic.\nThis region\u2019s grass is unusually tall and coarse, reaching heights of 6-12 feet. Elephant grass, the highest type of grass, may reach heights of 15 feet.\nThe grass is dense, with lengthy roots that stretch down for water. The grass appears dormant throughout the dry season and blooms during the rainy season.\nAs one approaches the desert, the grasses give way to prickly shrubs.\nWILDLIFE\nThe savanna is home to some of the world\u2019s largest terrestrial species.\nThe two main groups of animals include \u2013 herbivores and carnivores.\nZebra, giraffe, elephant, antelope, and other savanna herbivores are well-known. Herbivores are either blessed with exceptional speed to flee or have camouflage abilities to avoid carnivores.\nThis region\u2019s carnivores include lions, hyenas, leopards, panthers, pumas, and jaguars, among others. For attacking other animals, they have powerful jaws and teeth.\nAside from rhinos and hippos, reptiles such as crocodiles, monitor lizards, and giant lizards can be found in rivers and marshy areas.\nWorld Climate: Tropical Monsoon Climate\n\nThe area between the Tropics of Cancer and Capricorn is home to the monsoon climate, commonly referred to as the tropical monsoon climate.\nThe inter-tropical convergence zone (ITCZ), which moves through the area, influences its world climate, which is hot and muggy throughout the year.\nMonsoons are seasonal breezes that blow over land from the oceans and vice versa.\nThey are distinguished by a seasonal reversal in wind direction, which causes temperature and precipitation changes.\nSummer, winter, and rainy seasons are the three prominent and distinct seasons of this climatic region.\nDISTRIBUTION\nThey are confined within 5 \u2013 30 degrees latitudes on either side of the equator.\nThailand, India, and Indo-China (Laos, Vietnam, and Cambodia). This world climate can be found in southern China and northern Australia.\nWINDS\nSeasonal wind reversal is caused by the differential pace of heating and cooling of continental landmasses and seawaters.\nDuring the summer, as the sun passes overhead the Tropic of Cancer, a low-pressure zone forms over Central Asia. As a result, the Asian continent warms quicker than the surrounding oceans, which remain at a higher pressure in the northern hemisphere.\nIn the southern hemisphere, winter conditions prevail, leading to a high-pressure zone over northern Australia.\nWinds blow out from the Australian landmass towards Java (Indonesia) and are drawn to the low-pressure region over the Indian subcontinent after crossing the equator due to the Coriolis force. These are the South-West monsoon winds.\nDuring winters, a reversal in the wind direction occurs.\nTEMPERATURE\nSummers are warm to hot due to the region\u2019s proximity to the tropics.\nThe average monthly temperature is over 18 degrees Celsius, however, in the summer, the maximum temperature can reach 45 degrees Celsius.\nThe average temperature in the summer is around 30 degrees centigrade, with an overall temperature range of 30 to 45 degrees centigrade.\nWinter temperatures range from 15 to 30 degrees Celsius. In the winter, the average temperature is around 25 degrees Celsius.\nPRECIPITATION\nThe region receives a lot of rain in a short period of time.\nThe annual average rainfall is roughly 200-250 cm. However, some areas have a very high average of around 350 cm.\nMaysynram and Cherrapunji in the Khasi Hills (Meghalaya) receive over 1000cm of rain per year. They are positioned on the hills\u2019 windward side, resulting in significant orographic rains (caused by a lift of the monsoon winds). These areas receive a lot of rain because of their placement between mountains, which generates a concentration of rain-bearing clouds, also known as the funnelling effect.\nSEASONS\n\nUnlike the tropical world climate, which has no distinct seasons, the monsoon climate has significant seasonal changes in meteorological conditions.\n\nTHE HOT DRY SEASON\nThis lasts from March to mid \u2013 June.\nThe sun is in a northward shift to the Tropic of Cancer. This causes the temperatures to rise sharply.\nIn Central India, average daytime temperatures exceed 35 degrees Celsius. Temperatures in Sindh and south India can reach 44 degrees Celsius.\nTemperatures are lower at the seaside due to the influence of sea breezes.\nExcept for the occasional thunderstorms, there is little rainfall during this season.\nTHE RAINY SEASON\nThis lasts from mid \u2013 June to September\nThe rains begin with a monsoon \u2018burst\u2019 over the subcontinent. It causes torrential rains over the country.\nDuring this season, the country receives more than 70% of its annual rainfall.\nThis is a typical aspect of the monsoon type of climate, with concentrated heavy rainfall throughout the summer months.\nTHE COLD DRY SEASON\nThis season begins in October and lasts until February.\nAlso known as the receding monsoon season. The southwest monsoon begins to withdraw southwards when the sun begins its southward journey, eventually leaving the Indian landmass entirely.\nAs the land mass\u2019s temperatures start to drop, the Indian subcontinent experiences a higher pressure than the nearby seas. This makes the winds blow away from the continent and toward the sea.\nIn the months of November and December, winds from the northeast start to blow over the Bay of Bengal, bringing some rain to India\u2019s southeast coastline area.\nThe Western Disturbances bring some rain and snow to the north, but overall the area is dry. Winter crops require frontal (cyclonic) rains brought on by the western disturbances in order to survive.\nMONSOON FORESTS\nAlso known as the Tropical Monsoon Forests.\nThe majority of these are deciduous trees, which have a specific season for leaf loss. To reduce transpiration losses during the dry/drought season, they shed their leaves.\nThey are classified as moist deciduous when the annual rainfall exceeds 150cm and dry deciduous when the annual rainfall is less than 150cm.\nSimilar to equatorial rainforests, they consist of broad-leaf hardwood trees. However, the forests are less dense, more open, and have a smaller variety of species (flora as well as fauna).\nEvergreen rainforests of the tropical kind can be found anywhere there is a rainfall of more than 200\u2013250 cm. These are prevalent in India\u2019s Andaman and Nicobar islands, forests in the northeast, and the southern Western Ghats. Southeast Asian islands also include them.\nSavanna-like grasslands with sporadic trees are present anywhere there is little rainfall.\nAs a result, monsoon vegetation ranges from thick forests to thorny scrublands (savanna).\nWorld Climate: Desert Climate\n\nDesert regions are distinguished by little rainfall and sparse vegetation. The growing season is restricted to a brief rainy season.\nDue to a lack of moisture and food, the region\u2019s landscape is devoid of plants and animals.\nThey can be of two types:\n\nhot deserts\u2013 like the Saharan desert\n\nmid-latitude deserts\u2013 like the Gobi desert.\n\nHOT DESERTS \u2013 DISTRIBUTION\nThe world\u2019s most important hot deserts are located on the western margins of continents between latitudes 15 to 30 degrees north and south.\nThe Sahara desert, which has an extent of 3.5 million square miles, is the largest of the hot deserts. The Great Australian Desert, Arabian Desert, Kalahari Desert, Thar Desert, and others are notable examples of hot deserts.\nAmerica also contains hot deserts. They are referred to in North America as the Mohave, Sonoran, Californian, and Mexican deserts. They run from the United States to Mexico. The Atacama or Peruvian deserts are found in South America.\nHOT DESERTS \u2013 TEMPERATURE\nThese deserts have some of the highest temperatures on earth and experience scorching weather all year round.\nThey do not have a distinct cold weather season.\nSummertime averages are consistently above 30 degrees Celsius.\nLibya had the highest recorded temperature in 1922. The temperature increased to a maximum of 57 degrees Celsius.\nSuch high temperatures are caused by clear skies, intense insolation, dry air, and a quick rate of evaporation.\nHowever, because of the regulating effect of the seas, the coastline regions of these deserts enjoy a comparatively temperate climate. The cooling influence of cold currents also lowers the region\u2019s typical temperatures.\nThe interior regions experience extreme temperatures \u2013 hot summers and cold winters.\nThe temperature varies greatly throughout the day. The temperature rises with the sun during the day due to strong solar radiation, dry air, and clear skies.\nHowever, as soon as the sun sets, the mercury falls below the mean temperature because of the constant radiation-driven heat loss and the lack of cloud cover that would normally trap the heat.\nThe average diurnal range of temperatures is around 14 to 25 degrees centigrade.\nDuring winter nights, frost is a common occurrence.\nHOT DESERTS \u2013 PRECIPITATION\nThe average annual precipitation in these regions is not more than 25 cm.\nThese deserts are situated in the Sub-Tropical High-Pressure Belts, often referred to as the Horse Latitudes, where the air masses are descending, making it difficult for clouds that could produce precipitation to form.\nThe Trade Winds, which blow offshore and prevent any moisture-laden winds from the sea from blowing over these regions, are the dominant winds in these areas.\nOn-shore westerlies do not pass over desert areas, which lowers the likelihood of any precipitation.\nThe relative humidity of the winds that travel over deserts is reduced since they originate in cooler climates. This lessens the likelihood of water vapour condensation and consequent precipitation.\nFrom 60% in the coastal regions to less than 30% in the interior, relative humidity falls. This makes these desert regions permanently dry by increasing the rate of evaporation and decreasing the likelihood of precipitation.\nDesiccating these deserts is the result of the cold currents that travel over the west coasts of the continents. Only drier winds blow over the deserts because any sea-borne winds carrying moisture condense into mist or fog over the cold currents.\nHowever, convectional rainfall occurs in these areas for shorter periods of time in the form of intense thunderstorms. Landslides are a common and disastrous result of these abrupt downpours.\nWith less than 2 cm of annual precipitation, the Atacama Desert is the driest place on earth.\nMID-LATITUDE DESERTS \u2013 DISTRIBUTION\nThese deserts are frequently found on plateaus and are found in continental interiors.\nThey include the Gobi desert, Turkestan desert, Patagonian desert, etc.\nIn India, the Ladakh desert falls under this category.\nMID-LATITUDE DESERTS \u2013 CLIMATE\nThe world climate conditions of these deserts are comparable to those of hot deserts in many aspects.\nBecause these deserts are located far from the shore or are surrounded by high mountains, they are shut off from the moisture-laden breezes blowing from the seas.\nAverage annual precipitation does not exceed 25 cm.\nHowever, depressions may infrequently enter these Asian deserts, bringing wintertime little precipitation. Convectional precipitation is a possibility in the summer.\nThese areas see a wider range of yearly temperatures than hot deserts. Continentality, a phenomenon linked to landmasses located far from the coast, is the cause of these severe temperatures.\nThese areas have extremely cold winters with subfreezing temperatures. In rare cases, summertime ice thawing results in widespread flooding.\nDESERT VEGETATION\nAll deserts have some form of vegetation such as grass, scrub, weeds, etc.\nAlthough they may not always appear green, they are dormant and waiting for unpredictable rainfall.\nThe xerophytic or drought-resistant scrub is the most prevalent plant type in both hot and mid-latitude deserts.\nBulbous cactus, long-rooted wiry grasses, thorny bushes, and dwarf acacia are some significant species of this kind.\nClusters of date palms can be found in a few places with plenty of groundwater, particularly in hot deserts.\nThese areas support a unique species of vegetation that has evolved to withstand extreme aridity.\nDue to the lack of moisture, which decreases the pace at which organic matter decomposes, soils are lacking in humus.\nThese desert shrubs have a sophisticated network of extended roots that expand in quest of moisture. To reduce water loss through transpiration, they have few or no leaves and foliage that is hairy, waxy, or needle-shaped.\nThese plants\u2019 seeds, which have thick, hard exterior surfaces, have unique defences to keep them safe while they\u2019re dormant. They begin to sprout as soon as the rain moistens them.\nLIFE IN THE DESERTS\nDespite their inhospitable conditions, different types of human settlements have come up in these deserts\nPrimitive hunters and gatherers: These are tribes that do not domesticate any animals or grow any crops. They include the Bindibu, the Australian Aborigines, and the Bushmen of the Kalahari Desert.\nNomadic herdsmen: They survive off of their herds and travel through the deserts in quest of water and lush pastures. They consist of the Mongols of the Gobi Desert, Tuaregs of the Sahara, and Arabian Bedouins.\nSettled cultivators: They have survived close to rivers such as the Nile in Egypt, Indus in Pakistan, Colorado in the USA, and Tigris-Euphrates in Iraq. They cultivate crops like wheat, barley, sugarcane, fruits, and vegetables\nMining settlers: Prominent among these include the gold mines in Australia, Diamond mines in Kalahari, Copper mines in Chile, Silver mines in Mexico, and Oil in the Persian Gulf countries.\nWorld Climate: Steppe Climate\n\nThe term steppe refers to a region that is a semi-desert with grassland or shrub vegetation.\nSteppes are intermediate regions, not receive enough rainfall to support a forest but are also not as dry as a desert.\nThe Steppe Climatic region is also known as Temperate Grasslands.\nThese grasslands are some of the most developed agricultural fields and are termed grain baskets.\nLivestock ranching is another major activity carried out in these areas due to the availability of natural grasses.\nDISTRIBUTION\nSteppes are found in the continental interiors.\nThey are usually found in temperate latitudes and hence come under the influence of Westerly winds.\nSteppes are characterized by vast grasslands which are, by and large, devoid of trees.\nSteppes typically refer to the vast temperate grasslands of Eurasia, which stretch between the Black Sea coast on the east to the Altai mountains in the west, covering a length of over 2000 miles.\nSteppes are known by their regional names in different parts of the world. They include,\nPrairies \u2013 North America\nPustaz \u2013 Hungary\nPampas \u2013 Argentina and Uruguay\nVelds (High Veld) \u2013 South Africa\nDowns \u2013 Australia\nCanterbury \u2013 New Zealand\nPRECIPITATION\nThe average annual rainfall over the steppes varies from 25 to 75 cm, depending upon the region.\nThe highest rainfall occurs in the spring season, or just prior to the onset of summer. In the northern hemisphere, it occurs in the months of June and July.\nDuring the winters, Westerlies bring in occasional depressions which often cause snowfall over these regions. However, the overall precipitation in the winter is low, at an average of 25 cm.\nIn the southern hemisphere, due to a larger influence of maritime weather, higher rainfall occurs over these regions as compared to their counterparts in the northern hemisphere.\nTEMPERATURE\nThese regions are under the effect of continentality and hence experience extremities in temperature.\nSummers are warm with the average temperature in the range of 18-20 degrees centigrade.\nWinters are usually cold with occasional snowfall.\nThe steppes in the northern hemisphere have a very high annual range of temperatures.\nIn contrast, the steppes in the southern hemisphere, due to maritime influence, have a moderate climate throughout the year.\nWINDS\nThe prevailing winds of these regions are the Westerlies, which are responsible for precipitation during the winters.\nApart from these, there are many local winds that blow over these regions and have a significant impact on the local weather.\nThey are known by various names such as Mistral (France), which is cold dry wind; Loo (Gangetic plains), Sirocco (Sahara), Foehn (Alps), etc. are warm, dry winds.\nOver the North American Prairies, the Chinook is a hot, dry local wind. Flowing from the southwest, it is a katabatic wind that is descending from the Rocky Mountains.\nIt is a scorching breeze, and in only 20 minutes it elevates the temperature in the area by more than 5 degrees centigrade.\nBecause it melts the snow covering the pastures so the animals may graze there, it is helpful for local agriculture.\nVEGETATION\nIn contrast to tropical savanna grasslands, which are interspersed with trees, temperate grasslands are nearly treeless. Furthermore, the grass in these grasslands is substantially shorter than in the savanna.\nUnlike the coarse grass found in savannas, the grass here is fresh and healthy. This is primarily true for North American prairies, as well as the Chernozem grasses of Ukraine. The prairie soils are also rich in nutrients.\nThe grass is lean, thin, and scattered.\nThis makes them suitable for ranching, or large-scale cattle husbandry.\nThe grass growing season lasts all year, despite seasonal fluctuations in temperature and precipitation.\nConifers can be found in a transitional zone of woods near the poleward spread of prairies.\nTrees are placed around croplands in steppe farmlands to protect them from severe winds.\nMediterranean Climate (Western Margin Climate)\n\n\u00a0\n\nThe Mediterranean climate or warm temperate western margin climate is found between 30o and 45o North and South of the Equator.\nThis climate is found in relatively few regions of the planet and is nearly entirely restricted to the western borders of continental landmasses.\nThe basic cause of this climate is the seasonal shift of the wind belts.\nDISTRIBUTION\nCentral Chile,\nCalifornia (around San Francisco),\nThe south-western tip of Africa (around Cape Town),\nSouthern Australia (in southern Victoria and\nAround Adelaide bordering St, Vincent, and Spencer Gulfs), and south-west Australia.\nCLIMATE\nThe Mediterranean climate is distinguished by its dry, warm summers and rainy, chilly winters, as well as local winds.\nDRY, WARM SUMMERS WITH OFF-SHORE TRADE WINDS\nDuring the summer, the sun is directly overhead the Tropics of Cancer and Capricorn.\nThe Westerlies\u2019 influence belt has drifted poleward, and rain-bearing tradewinds are expected to be off-shore.\nThus, the areas basically experience no summertime rain, remaining dry.\nThe heat is intense and the days are excessively warm.\nDurable droughts are frequent in the interior. There is typically little relative humidity.\nSummer temperatures are relatively high, with the highest recorded temperatures occurring away from the shore in the continental interiors of the Balkan peninsula, the Anatolian plateau, and the Mediterranean Middle East.\nWET, COLD WINTERS WITH ON-SHORE WESTERLIES\nDuring the winter months, the Westerlies belt swings equatorward, bringing on-shore Westerlies to the Mediterranean.\nHence, these lands receive almost all of their precipitation during the winter months.\nIn September and October in Mediterranean Europe, the rain falls in torrential downpours and causes flooding.\nLOCAL WINDS\n\nBecause of the topography of the region, which includes the Alps in the north, the Sahara desert in the south, continental interiors in the east, and the open Atlantic in the west, the Mediterranean climatic region in Europe experience several local winds. Temperature, pressure, and precipitation all vary greatly as a result. The two most important local winds are:\n\nSIROCCO\nThis is a hot, dry, and dusty wind.\nIt originates in the Sahara desert and can happen at any time of the year, but it\u2019s most common in the springtime.\nNormally it lasts only for a few days.\nIt blows into the Mediterranean Sea from the interior Saharan desert and is typically connected to Atlantic Ocean depressions.\nAlthough it is significantly cooled after crossing the Sea due to the absorption of water vapour, the heat causes the local vegetation and crops to wither.\nHence it is also called \u201cBlood Rain\u201d because it is carrying the red dust of the Sahara desert.\nMISTRAL\nMistral is a cold wind from the north.\nIt rushes down the Rhone valley, accelerating due to the valley\u2019s funnelling action between the Central Massif and the Alps [Plateau in France].\nIn very severe situations, the wind\u2019s velocity can be so strong that trains and trees can be uprooted.\nIn winter, if the Mistral is frequent the temperatures could go below the freezing point.\nOTHER LOCAL WINDS\nBora: Cold north-easterly wind along the Adriatic coast.\nTramontana and Gregale: cold winds in the Mediterranean Sea.\nNATURAL VEGETATION\nThe vegetation of the region is not luxuriant.\nTrees with small broad leaves are widely spaced.\nThis climate\u2019s distinctive lack of shade and the growth that occurs nearly exclusively in the fall and spring are other peculiarities.\nHeat, dry air, high evaporation, and protracted droughts are continuous targets of plants.\nHence they are generally xerophytic or drought resistant in nature.\nTYPES OF MEDITERRANEAN VEGETATION:\n\nThe vegetation consists of Evergreen forests, evergreen coniferous forests, grass, bushes and shrubs.\n\nEVERGREEN FORESTS\nThey are open forests with evergreen oaks, only found in climatically favourable areas with annual precipitation of over 25 inches.\nThe cork oaks are used for making wine-bottle corks.\nIn Australia, the eucalyptus forests replace the evergreen oak.\nThe giant sequoia or redwood is typical of Californian trees.\nEVERGREEN CONIFEROUS FORESTS\nThey include various kinds of pines, firs, cedars, and cypresses.\nWhere there are fewer severe droughts and higher temperatures, they are more common.\nBUSHES AND SHRUBS\nThis is the most prominent type of Mediterranean vegetation.\nThe low bushes grow in scattered clumps and are often thorny.\nGRASS\nBecause most of the rain falls during the cool season, when development is slow, the conditions in this region are unsuitable for grass.\nThey are generally wiry and bunchy and are not suitable for animal farming.\nThus cattle rearing is not an important occupation in the Mediterranean\nWarm Temperate Eastern Margin Climate\n\nIt is located near the eastern edges of the continents between 20 and 35 N and S latitude.\nThe region has a monsoonal climate, with rain in the summer and dry weather in the winter.\nVARIATIONS OF WARM TEMPERATE EASTERN MARGIN CLIMATE\nChina Type: Temperate monsoon or China type is found in most parts of China and is a modified form of monsoonal climate.\nGulf Type:\u00a0Though less pronounced, the overall climate resembles the China Type. It is found in the southeastern parts of the USA bordering the Gulf of Mexico. The continental heating during summers induces an inflow of air from the cooler Atlantic Ocean.\nNatal Type: In Southern Hemisphere, this climate is witnessed in New South Wales, Natal, and Parana-Paraguay-Uruguay basin. This is often referred to as the Natal Type of climate and is influenced by the on-shore Trade winds all around the year.\nCLIMATE\nIt is typified by a warm moist summer and a cool, dry winter.\nOccasionally, the penetration of cold air from the continental interiors may bring down the temperature to the freezing point.\nThe relative humidity is a little high in mid-summer but most of the time, the climate is pleasantly warm.\nRainfall is more than moderate and ranges between 60 cm to 150 cm and there is a uniform distribution of temperature throughout the year.\nRain comes either from convectional sources or as orographic rain in summer, or from depressions in prolonged showers in winter.\nLocal storms also occur. Examples: typhoons, and hurricanes.\nThe rainfall is adequate for all agricultural purposes and hence the areas are densely populated.\nCHINA TYPE\nIt is the most typical of the warm temperate eastern margin climate.\nIn summer due to intense heating of the continental interiors of the heart of Asia including Tibet, a low-pressure system is set in which attracts the tropical Pacific air stream.\nThis is witnessed as the South-East monsoon in the region.\nIn winter, there is intense high pressure over Siberia and the continental polar air stream flows outwards as the North-West Monsoon, bitterly cold and very dry.\nThere is little rain but there is considerable snow.\nThe region also experiences intense tropical cyclones called typhoons that originate in the Pacific Ocean and are most frequent in the late summer.\nTHE GULF TYPE\nThe Gulf-Atlantic regions of the USA experience this type of climate similar to the China type but with less monsoonal characteristics.\nThe warm Gulf Stream and the on-shore Trade winds help bring down the range of temperatures and there is a heavy annual rainfall of around 59 inches.\nThe amount of rain is increased by thunderstorms in summer and by hurricanes in September and October.\nDue to intense local heating, the region also experiences violent tornadoes leading to heavy destruction.\nNATAL TYPE\nThe narrowness of the continents and the dominance of maritime influence eliminate the monsoonal elements.\nThe South-East Trade winds bring about a more even distribution of rainfall throughout the year.\nThe annual range of temperature is low and rain comes in prolonged showers.\nNATURAL VEGETATION\nDue to heavier rainfall, the region supports luxurious vegetation.\nThere is perennial plant growth and the conditions are well-suited to a rich variety of plant life.\nThe lowlands carry both evergreen broad-leaved forests and deciduous trees, similar to the tropical monsoon forests.\nIn the highlands, are various species of conifers such as pines and cypresses which are important softwoods.\nEastern Australia \u2013 Eucalyptus\nSouth-Eastern Brazil, eastern Paraguay, north-eastern Argentina \u2013 Parana pine, the quebracho, wild yerba mate trees.\nNatal: palm trees\nWorld Climate: British Type Climate\n\nBritish-type climatic regions are under the permanent influence of the Westerlies all around the year.\nThese are also regions of high cyclonic activity., typical of Britain and thus said to experience the British climate.\nThis climate is also referred to as the cool temperate western margin climate or the North-west European Maritime Climate.\nDISTRIBUTION\n\nThere are exists of the northern hemisphere and southern hemisphere distributions.\n\nNORTHERN HEMISPHERE\nThe climatic belt stretches from Britain into North-West Europe, including northern and western France, Belgium, the Netherlands, Denmark, western Norway, and also north-western Iberia.\nIt primarily affects the coastlands of British Columbia in North America. The North American Rockies prohibit on-shore Westerlies from penetrating far inland.\nSOUTHERN HEMISPHERE\nThe majority of New Zealand, especially the South Island, Tasmania, southern Chile, and southern Australia all enjoy this climate.\nThe surrounding wide stretches of water have made these areas\u2019 climates more marine.\nCLIMATE\nMild winters and moderately warm summers. Temperature extremes are unlikely.\nAdequate rainfall throughout the year.\nTEMPERATURE\nThe mean annual temperature is usually in the range of 5 C \u2013 15 C.\nThis range is comparatively small for such high latitudes.\nWinters are unusually mild with no station recording temperatures below freezing, while summers are seldom particularly warm.\nThe North Atlantic Drift\u2019s warming influence and the South-Westerlies\u2019 predominance are to blame for this.\nHence, they are some of the most advanced regions of the world.\nPRECIPITATION\nAdequate rainfall throughout the year.\nFrom cyclonic sources, there is a propensity for a tepid winter or autumn maximum.\nThe western edges have the most rainfall because the rain-bearing winds originate in the west.\nMoving eastward from the sea, the amount of rainfall diminishes.\nSEASONS\nThere are four distinct seasons.\nThe long, sunny summers are followed by the roar of the wind-filled autumn.\nWinter is a season marked by overcast skies, foggy mornings, and numerous days with rain brought on by cyclonic depressions.\nThe driest and most pleasant season after the gloomy winter is spring, and then the cycle repeats itself.\n\nAlso read: Seasons in India\n\nNATURAL VEGETATION\nThe natural vegetation of this climatic type is the deciduous forest.\nIn the winter, trees lose their foliage. This modification serves as a defence against winter snow and ice.\nAutumnal or fall-related shedding starts and is dispersed by the winds.\nSome of the common species of temperate hardwood include oak, elm, ash, birch, beech, hornbeam, and poplar.\nIn the wetter areas grow willows, alder, and aspen.\nThe deciduous trees grow in pristine stands and have significant logging value from a business standpoint.\nThe sparse undergrowth is useful in logging operations.\nThe deciduous hardwoods are great for industrial and fuel uses.\nThe conifers, which can endure a higher altitude, a lower temperature, and poorer soils, typically replace the deciduous trees further up the mountains in the Scandinavian highlands, the Rockies, the southern Andes, and the Southern Alps of New Zealand.\nWorld Climate: Taiga Climate (Coniferous Forests & Lumbering)\n\nTaiga Climate is sometimes referred to as the Cool Temperate Continental Climate and is also known as Siberian Climate and Boreal Climate.\nDue to the Southern Hemisphere\u2019s little populated landmass, this sort of climate is primarily seen in the Northern Hemisphere.\nKoppen has defined the Taiga Climatic region as D type in his climatic classification.\nAccording to Koppen\u2019s classification, the winter temperature can drop below 3 degrees C while the summer months can be pleasant with temperatures over 10 degrees C.\nDISTRIBUTION\nIt spans central Canada, the majority of central and southern Russia, and certain areas of Scandinavia from 50 to 70 N along a continuous strip.\nAround the Arctic Circle, it combines with the Arctic tundra of Canada and Eurasia to the north or poleward. The \u201cSubarctic climate\u201d is another name for this environment.\nIn the south, the climate becomes less severe and merges into the temperate Steppe climate.\nDue to the narrowness of the continents at high latitudes, the Siberian climate is absent in the Southern Hemisphere.\nThe Southern Hemisphere\u2019s considerable maritime influence lessens the severity of the winter.\nCLIMATE\n\nIn the Taiga climate region, the summers can be moderate or cool, while the winters can be quite cold because of the polar and Arctic air masses\u2019 strong winds and snowstorms.\n\nTEMPERATURE\nThese areas have exceptionally cold winters that last for a very long time and have temperatures between \u2013 30 C and \u2013 40 C.\nThe summers are cool and brief. Spring and autumn are very brief and transitional periods.\nThe annual range of temperature is very high, almost 50 C to 60 C.\nThe coolest place on earth, Verkhoyansk is situated in this climatic region.\nIn this location, significant snowfall and frosts are frequent due to the year-round extremely low temperatures.\nRivers and lakes are frozen, while arctic winds to the north, like the Buran and Blizzards of Eurasia, blow ferociously.\nSiberian climate zones have extremely scarce populations due to the harsh conditions.\nPRECIPITATION\nThe interiors have almost no maritime influences, which results in low annual precipitation, often between 38 and 63 cm.\nIt falls evenly throughout the year, with a summer peak from convectional rain as the continental interiors heat up.\nIn winter, the precipitation is in the form of snow.\nNATURAL VEGETATION\nThe predominant vegetation of this region is evergreen coniferous forests.\nConifers are highly adapted to this environment and can resist such harsh conditions.\nThe greatest single band of the coniferous forest is the taiga in Siberia.\nThe region\u2019s coniferous forests mostly consist of pine, fir, spruce, and larch trees.\nThe richest sources of softwood are the coniferous forest belts in North America and Eurasia.\n\nConiferous forests are of huge commercial value due to the following reasons:\n\nThey occur in pure stands and there exist only a few species.\nConiferous woods occur at consistent heights, grow straight and tall, and are of moderate density, in contrast to the dense and challenging-to-exploit equatorial rain forests.\nAlmost all conifers are evergreen. There is no annual replacement of new leaves as in deciduous trees.\nEvergreens greatly benefit from the low yearly temperatures, with more than half of the year being below the growing-point temperature.\nConifers have a conical shape, which allows them to live in the subarctic climate.\nThe sloping branches discourage snow build-up and provide weak wind support.\nLeaves are small, thick, leathery, and needle-shaped to check excessive transpiration.\nPoorly podzolized soils in the area cause undergrowth because they are highly acidic and leached.\nEvergreen forests don\u2019t have falling leaves, thus there is limited humus development and the leathery needles take a long time to decompose because of the cold temperatures.\nOther obstacles to sparse vegetation include the lack of direct sunshine and the brief summer season.\nConiferous forests are also found in areas with high altitudes and low temperatures in addition to the continental interiors of high latitudes. In the Himalayas, for instance.\nWorld Climate: Laurentian Climate\n\nThe Cool Temperate Eastern Margin climate is also known as the Laurentian climate.\nIt is the intermediate between the British and Siberian types of climates.\nDISTRIBUTION\nIt is found only in two regions and only in the northern hemisphere.\nThe climate combines elements of the coastal and continental climates.\nNorth American region:\u00a0One region is north-eastern North America including eastern Canada, north-east USA, and Newfoundland.\nAsiatic region:\u00a0The other region is the eastern coastlands of Asia, including North China, eastern Siberia, Manchuria, Korea, and northern Japan.\nDue to the little amount of continental landmass that extends south of latitude 40 S, the climate is completely missing in the southern hemisphere.\nThe only possible regions are in eastern Patagonia.\nHowever, the Southern Andes obstruct the westerlies, making the area arid rather than continental.\nOnly 10 inches of precipitation fall there annually due to its rain-shadow status.\nTEMPERATURE\nThe climate of this type has cold, dry winters and warm, wet summers.\nWinter temperatures can be well below freezing, and snowfall can reach quite a depth.\nThe off-shore cold currents from the Arctic helped to temper down the summers, which are as warm as those in the tropics.\nPRECIPITATION\nRain falls throughout the year.\nThe easterly winds from the oceans do, however, bring rain, thus there is a noticeable summer maximum.\nTwo-thirds of the annual precipitation is in summer.\nDry, chilly winds from the interiors of the continent blow during the winter.\nNATURAL VEGETATION\nThe predominant vegetation in this climate is cool temperate forests.\nTrees thrive best in regions with high rainfall, mild summers, and damp air from fogs.\nForest tends to be coniferous north of the 50 N latitude.\nSouth of this latitude, deciduous forests is seen.\nWorld Climate: Polar Climate (Tundra & Ice Caps)\n\nThe polar climate has cold climatic conditions all through the year.\nIn his climatic classification, Koppen (World climate classification) categorised Polar Climate as E type.\nKoppen (World climate classification) claims that the area\u2019s summer temperature is less than 10 degrees. Polar Tundra and Polar Ice Caps were his additional divisions of the polar climate.\nDISTRIBUTION\n\nThere are exists of the northern hemisphere and southern hemisphere distributions.\n\nNORTHERN HEMISPHERE\nIn the northern hemisphere, the polar climate is mostly found north of the Arctic Circle.\nThe ice caps are only found in Greenland and highlands at high latitudes where the ground is always covered in snow.\nThe lowlands which are ice-free for a few months have tundra vegetation.\nThis comprises the Arctic seaboard of Eurasia, the Greenlandic coastal strip, and the desolate regions of northern Canada and Alaska.\nSOUTHERN HEMISPHERE\nThe largest single ice cap where the layers of permanent ice are visible in the southern hemisphere is found in Antarctica, an uninhabited continent.\nTEMPERATURE\nA very low mean annual temperature characterizes the tundra or polar temperature.\nThere are just four months with temperatures above freezing. With the exception of four months, the ground is always frozen.\nInteriors are much colder than in the coastal regions.\nWinters are long and very severe, and summers are cool and brief.\nThere are weeks of nonstop darkness outside the Arctic and Antarctic circles.\nFrosts and blizzards that occur are very hazardous to the polar inhabitants.\nPRECIPITATION\nIn the winter, precipitation primarily takes the form of snow, which is drifting by blizzards.\nConvectional rainfall is generally absent because of the low rate of evaporation and the lack of moisture in the cold polar air.\nIn summer, there is a maximum and the precipitation is in the form of rain or sleet.\nCyclones are felt in the coastal areas and there is a tendency towards a winter maximum.\nNATURAL VEGETATION\nIn severe environments like that of Tundra, few plants survive.\nThe greatest inhibiting factor is the lack of heat and energy.\nThe growing season is for less than three months and there are no trees in the tundra.\nHence only the lowest forms of vegetation are supported like mosses, lichens, and sedges.\nIn the more sheltered spots, stunted birches, dwarf willows, and undersized alders struggle to survive.\nIn the brief summers when snow melts and the days are warmer and longer, berry bushes and Arctic flowers bloom.\nThey are short-lived but they brighten the monotonous polar landscape into Arctic prairies.\n\nThe most widely used classification of world climate is the empirical world climate classification scheme developed by Wladimir Koppen.

These are complex paths.\nThe water is afterward released back into the atmosphere.\nThe fact that the hydrologic cycle has no beginning and no end is a basic aspect of it.\n\nAccording to studies, over 90% of the moisture in our atmosphere comes from the evaporation of oceans, seas, and other bodies of water (lakes, rivers, and streams), which is the process by which water transforms from a liquid to a gas.\n\nPlants release the majority of the remaining 10% that is found in the atmosphere through transpiration. Water is absorbed by plants through their roots, and it is then expelled through tiny pores on the underside of their leaves.\n\nIn addition, a tiny amount of water vapor is released into the atmosphere as a result of sublimation, which is the direct transformation of water from a solid (ice or snow) to a gas.\n\nWhen the temperature remains below freezing, sublimation causes snow banks to gradually diminish.\n\nStages of the hydrologic cycle\nImage: National Weather Service\n\nEvaporation, condensation, precipitation, interception, infiltration, percolation, transpiration, runoff, and storage are a few of the processes.\n\nEvaporation\n\nA material changes from a liquid to a gas through evaporation. In meteorology, water is the element that concerns us the most.\n\nThe process of evaporation needs the energy to occur. The sun, the atmosphere, the planet, or anything on the earth like people are all potential sources of energy. Everyone has first-hand experience with evaporation.\n\nThe body sweats, secreting water onto the skin when it becomes hot due to the atmospheric temperature or due to exertion. The idea is to get the body to use its heat to make the liquid evaporate, taking the heat out and cooling the body. It has a similar effect to what you experience after exiting a shower or swimming pool.\n\nTranspiration\n\nWater from plants evaporates through stomata during transpiration.\n\nSmall apertures called stomata, which are related to vascular plant tissues can be seen on the underside of leaves.\n\nThe atmosphere\u2019s humidity and the soil\u2019s moisture content play a significant role in controlling the passive process of transpiration in the majority of plants.\n\nOnly 1% of the water lost during transpiration by a plant is utilized for the plant\u2019s growth. 99.9% of it is released into the atmosphere.\n\nCondensation\n\nCondensation is the process by which atmospheric water vapor transforms into a liquid state. Condensation in the atmosphere can take the form of clouds or dew.\n\nThe dewpoint temperature and the air temperature are two different temperatures that must differ for condensation to occur. The dew point, in its simplest form, is the temperature at which dew can develop.\n\nIt is the temperature that causes the air to become saturated if it is cooled to that point. Water vapor condenses with any further cooling. When the dew point and air temperature are the same, foggy conditions frequently develop.\n\nCondensation is the opposite of evaporation. Since water vapor has a higher energy level than that liquid water, when condensation occurs, excess energy in the form of heat energy is released. This release of heat aids in the formation of hurricanes.\n\nPrecipitation\n\nWhen the tiny condensation particles grow too large through collision and coalescence for the rising air to support, they form precipitation and fall to the ground. There may be precipitation in the form of snow, sleet, hail, or rain.\n\nOn Earth, precipitation is the main source of fresh water. Overland and oceans alike, the world receives roughly 38 1/2\u2033 (980 mm) of precipitation per year.\n\nRunoff\n\nWhen the earth is saturated and there has been a lot of precipitation, runoff occurs (cannot absorb any more water). Runoff causes rivers and lakes to form. Although some runoff evaporation occurs in the atmosphere, most of the water in rivers and lakes flows back into the oceans.\n\nEvaporation is the sole way for runoff water to return to the atmosphere if the lake is the only place where it flows (there is no exit for the water to flow out of the lake). Salts or contaminants are left behind as water evaporates. The lake then turns salty, much like the Great Salt Lake in Utah or the Dead Sea in Israel.\n\nThis runoff evaporates into the atmosphere, restarting the hydrologic cycle.\n\nAlso read: Atmospheric River\n\nHydrologic cycle and water storage\n\nIn the planetary water cycle, water is stored primarily in three different places- the sky, the earth\u2019s surface, and the ground.\n\nFrom one area of the earth to another, water that is stored in the atmosphere can be transported rather quickly.\n\nThe kinds of storage that take place on the surface of the land and underground mostly depend on the geologic factors associated with the different kinds of soil and rocks that are present where the storage is taking place.\n\nOceans, lakes, reservoirs, and glaciers are examples of surface storage, while soil, aquifers, and cracks in rock formations are examples of subsurface storage.\n\nWater can travel erratically through the eight additional primary physical stages of the water cycle.\n\nThe water in the atmosphere gets replaced every 16 days on average.\nEach year, the soil moisture is roughly replaced. Waters in wetlands are replenished on average every five years, whereas lake water stays in one area for almost seventeen years.\nGroundwater regeneration can last more than 1,400 years in places where society has not yet fully developed.\nExtreme occurrences like floods and droughts can occur as a result of the uneven flow and distribution of water throughout time, as well as the spatial distribution of water in both geographic and geologic locations.\n\nAlso read:\u00a0Atmospheric River\n\n-Article written by Swathi Satish",

Although some are made of land and others of more granular particles, such as sand, they all link two land masses together and have water on both sides.\nIsthmuses have been strategic locations for centuries. They are natural sites for ports and canals linking terrestrial and aquatic trade routes.\nIsthmuses are also key sites for communications and cultural exchange, as well as military outposts.\nIsthmus vs land bridge vs peninsula\nIsthmus\u00a0and\u00a0land bridge\u00a0are related terms, with isthmus having a broader meaning.\nAn isthmus bridging the largest geographic masses on Earth is known as a land bridge. The phrase \u201cland bridge\u201d is typically used in biogeology to refer to land linkages that once existed across continents and were significant for human migration as well as that of numerous animal and plant species, such as Beringia and Doggerland.\nA peninsula is more of a land protrusion that is connected to a larger landmass on one side alone and completely surrounded by the ocean on the other. An isthmus is a land connection between two larger land masses.\nTechnically, an isthmus can resemble two peninsulas because of canals that stretch from coast to coast (such as the Panama Canal), but canals are man-made features as opposed to straits.\nMajor isthmuses in the world\nIsthmus of Panama:\nThe Pacific and Atlantic Oceans are divided by the Isthmus of Panama in Panama, which also connects the continents of North and South America.\nThe Panama Canal, which spans the isthmus for 77 kilometres (48 miles), enables freight ships to pass directly from eastern to western North America without having to sail around South America.\nThe Panama Canal revolutionised shipping and travel in the 20th century by making it possible for goods and people to be transported more quickly and effectively.\nIsthmus of Suez:\nThe Mediterranean and Red Seas are divided by the Isthmus of Suez, which is located in eastern Egypt.\nThe 192 km (119 mi) long Suez Canal allows cargo ships to pass through Africa and directly transit between Europe, North Africa, Western Asia (through the Mediterranean Sea in the north), and Eastern and Southern Asia.\nIn the 19th century, the Suez Canal boosted trade and travel; it still shapes the oil trade today.\nThe\u00a0city of\u00a0Seattle:\nSeattle, Washington, is situated on an isthmus that connects Lake Washington and Puget Sound, a region of the Pacific Ocean.\nOver 4,000 years have passed since there has been continuous habitation in the area. The Duabish and the Hachuabish were the first people to settle in the region, respectively, close to the seashore and a freshwater lake.\nThese Native Americans were collectively known as the Duwamish by European settlers who saw the isthmus\u2019 potential for trade both across the Pacific and along North America\u2019s west coast.\nMount Maunganui- A tombolo town:\nThe tombolo town of Mount Maunganui, New Zealand, is situated on a sandbar that connects the mainland to the volcanic island of Mauao.\nAn extinct volcano, Mauao is a well-liked location for beach hopping and climbing. Because of the tombolo formation, such beaches have a variety of alternatives.\nThe beaches facing Tauranga Harbor on the isthmus of Mount Maunganui are tranquil and safe. Beaches on the opposite side of Mount Maunganui face the Pacific Ocean, which has imposing waves that are well-liked by surfers.\nRock of Gibraltar- Most famous tombolo:\nThe Rock of Gibraltar, a linked island that is just barely connected to the southwest tip of Europe\u2019s Iberian Peninsula, is arguably the most well-known tombolo.\nThe \u201cPillars of Hercules,\u201d which make up the confined western entrance to the Mediterranean Sea, are joined at their northernmost points by the Rock of Gibraltar.\nSince the Phoenicians, the Rock of Gibraltar has been a vital location for traders and explorers due to its advantageous location.\nAlthough it is now a part of British Gibraltar, the Rock of Gibraltar borders Spain.\nSome other major Isthmus in the world\u00a0:\nThe world\u2019s major Isthmus of Tehuantepec is in Middle America.\nOf historic importance were the Isthmus of Corinth in Greece and the Isthmus of Catanzaro in Italy.\nThe Isthmus of Mansheya connects Egypt\u2019s island of Pharos to the city of Alexandria on the country\u2019s mainland.\nThe Isthmus of Kra links the Malay Peninsula with mainland of Asia.\nThe Isthmus of Kushimoto in Japan joins Cape Shiono-Misaki and Honsh\u016b.\nIn the Quezon Province of Luzon in the Phillippines, the Tayabas Isthmus unites the mainland of Luzon with the Bicol Peninsula.\nAdam\u2019s Bridge, also known as Rama\u2019s Bridge, is an isthmus that connects Sri Lanka and India.\nThe Karelian Isthmus is found between Lake Ladoga and the Gulf of Finland (the Baltic Sea).\nIn the northern portion of Russia, Olonets Isthmus is located between Lake Ladoga and Lake Onega, and Onega Isthmus lies between Lake Onega and the White Sea.\nCanals built across the major Isthmus in the world\nIt is common practice to construct canals across isthmuses, where they may provide a particularly useful marine transportation shortcut.\nFor instance, the Panama Canal connects the North Atlantic and Pacific Oceans by passing through the Panama Isthmus;\nBy traversing the western side of the Sinai Peninsula-created Isthmus of Suez, the Suez Canal links the Mediterranean Sea with the Red Sea; & the Crinan Canal connects the Kintyre peninsula to the rest of Scotland by spanning the isthmus between Loch Crinan and Loch Gilp.\nThe Welland Canal in the Niagara Peninsula serves as another illustration (technically an isthmus). It links Lake Ontario and Lake Erie together. On New Zealand\u2019s North Island, the city of Auckland is located on an isthmus.\n\nArticle written by: Aseem Muhammed",

    "[CONTENT] #285": "Coastal Erosion is wearing away and redistributing solid elements of the shoreline as well as sediment.\n\nIn most cases, coastal erosion is caused by natural forces including waves, tidal and littoral currents, and deflation.\n\nA substantial percentage of the Indian population, about 20% lives along the coast, and developmental activities have put tremendous pressure on the fragile coastal environment.\n\nTable of Contents\n\nCurrent Status of Coastal Erosion\nCauses of Coastal Erosion\nNatural Causes\nMan-Made Causes\nCoastal Erosion Protection Measures\nNon-structural measures\nStructural Measures\nCombination of the Structural and Non-Structural Measures\nSuccessful Coastal Erosion Mitigation Measures\nShoreline Change Atlas of Indian Coast\nConclusion\nCurrent Status of Coastal Erosion\n\nRecently, the Ministry of Earth Sciences informed that a sizable portion of the 6,907.18 km long Indian coastline of the mainland is under varying degrees of Coastal erosion.\n\nApproximately 34% of the coastline is under varying degrees of erosion, 26% is accreting, and the remaining 40% is stable.\n\nOver the years from 1990 to 2018, West Bengal experienced erosion along around 60.5% (323.07 km) of its coastline followed by \u00a0Kerala (46.4%) and Tamil Nadu (42.7%).\n\nEarlier, the Indian National Centre for Ocean Information Services (INCOIS) published an atlas of Coastal Vulnerability Index (CVI) maps for the entire Indian coastline.\n\n\ud83d\udc49 Which year are YOU targeting for success in the IAS/IPS/IFS Exam? \ud83d\ude80\n\n(1) \u21d2 UPSC 2025: Prelims cum Mains\n\n(2) \u21d2 UPSC 2026: Prelims cum Mains\n\n(3) \u21d2 UPSC 2027 Prelims cum Mains\n\nTip: Know more about ClearIAS Courses (Online/Offline)\n\nCauses of Coastal Erosion\n\nThere are several causes of coastal erosion that can be a result of either natural or man-made activities. Sometimes, it is a combination of both natural and man-made factors.\n\nNatural causes are often not possible to resist or avoid but the damage caused by man-made reasons is the result of ill-planned activities. The effects of climate change, sea-level rise and other long-term causes of erosion are still unaccounted for.\n\nNatural Causes\n\nWaves, winds, tides, near-shore currents, storms, sea level rise, etc. are examples of natural factors that affect coastal erosion.\n\nAlso, the natural variation in the supply of sediments to the coastline from the river can affect the erosion of the coastline.\n\nAn increasing sea level will promote shoreline setbacks.\n\nAnother factor is the subsidence occurrence. Subsidence is a regional phenomenon that reduces a region\u2019s surface area. It has similar effects on the coastline to sea level rise.\n\nSevere storms, tidal surges, and cyclones are examples of catastrophic events that create abnormally high sea levels and significant erosion.\n\nMan-Made Causes\n\nThe majority of erosion that is caused by humans is a result of human interference with both the rivers\u2019 sediment load and the natural transportation process. Coastal defence buildings, river management projects, sand and aggregate mining, oil and gas exploration (which results in long-term subsidence), and ports and harbours that affect sediment flow are examples of human activity.\n\nAlso read: Erosion and Deposition: Action of Running Water and Groundwater\n\nCoastal Erosion Protection Measures\n\nCoastal protection measures moderate the long-term average erosion rate of shoreline change. Nature not only erodes but also has the capacity to protect. Protection of the coastline from erosion is provided by nature in the form of a stable beach, capable of dissipating incident wave energy. Nature\u2019s coastal protection is also demonstrated at the headlands, reefs, shores, dunes, etc.\n\nThe measure to control erosion includes non-structural and structural or their combination. A brief description of these measures is given below:\n\nNon-structural measures\n\nThe non-structural measures try to dissipate wave energy by mirroring natural forces and preserving the coast\u2019s natural topography. These actions are frequently referred to as soft solutions. These include:\n\nArtificial nourishment of beaches\nCoastal vegetation such as mangrove and palm plantation\nSand bypassing at tidal inlets\nDune reconstruction/rehabilitation\nStructural Measures\n\nStructural measures are also known as hard structural or engineering measures. It includes the use of physical structures constructed near the coast to prevent or restrict water from reaching the potential damage areas. These solutions influence the coastal processes to reduce the rate of coastal erosion.\n\nThe structural measures used for coastal erosion prevention include seawalls, revetment, breakwaters, off-shore groins, groynes, offshore reefs, artificial headland, etc.\n\nCombination of the Structural and Non-Structural Measures\n\nThe combination of Structural and Non-Structural Measures to control coastal erosion gives synergetic outcomes and provides an environmentally and economically acceptable coastal protection system.\n\nThe hard solutions have a wide range of drawbacks, including the fact that they are expensive, lead to erosion, and occasionally damage the aesthetic value of the site, lowering its economic value. It should be mentioned that soft solutions are not quick fixes, they take time to work, and they only do so from a medium- to long-term perspective.\n\nThese combinations act as interim hard structures and some of the common approaches of combinations are:\n\nCombining beach nourishment with artificial\nHeadlands or groynes\nRevegetation with temporary offshore breakwaters/ artificial reefs is commonly used.\nSuccessful Coastal Erosion Mitigation Measures\n\nA few success examples are:\n\nPuducherry Beach Restoration Project, Puducherry\n\nThe Submerged Reef has been implemented by MoES and beach nourishment is implemented by Govt of Puducherry. This helped in the restoration of a 1.5 km long city beach after 30 years and helped in improving tourism and fishing activities in addition to protection of the coast during extreme cyclonic events.\n\n\u00a0Kadalur Periya Kuppam, Tamil Nadu\n\nAn Offshore submerged dyke was implemented. This helped in the protection of three fishing Villages during extreme cyclonic events and restored the lost beach that is being used for the landing of fishing boats and other fishing activities.\n\nShoreline Change Atlas of Indian Coast\n\nThe Coastal Protection and Development Advisory Committee (CPDAC), which was established by the Department of Water Resources, River Development, and Ganga Rejuvenation (Govt. of India) suggested a coastal atlas showing data on coastal erosion derived from satellite data and protection measures implemented by all maritime states of India.\n\nAs a result, Space Applications Centre (ISRO), in coordination with Central Water Commission, launched a project titled \u201cShoreline Change Atlas of the Indian Coast\u201d at the behest of the Coastal Management Directorate.\n\nThis Atlas comprises shoreline change maps prepared using satellite data for 2004-06 and 2014-16 time-frame for the entire country. The maps indicate the status of the coastal protection measures implemented by maritime States/UTs as well as the eroding, stable, and accreting coasts.\n\nConclusion\n\nSea level rise, variations in storm frequency and intensity, increases in precipitation, and warmer ocean temperatures all have an impact on coasts. In addition, when atmospheric carbon dioxide (CO2) concentrations rise, the seas take in more of the gas, contributing to ocean acidification. The coastal and marine ecosystems may well be significantly impacted by this increase in acidity.\n\nWe are aware that coastline erosion is a complicated and important issue for a large country like ours. Efforts are being undertaken to counter the threat of coastal erosion and protect our coastlines using both the traditional ways (using hard structures like a seawall, etc.) and also the new, innovative soft measures like dune rehabilitation.\n\nArticle Written By: Priti Raj",

The Indus River System, a Himalayan river system, is one of the world\u2019s largest river basins.\n\nAround this river, \u201cThe Indus Valley Civilization\u201d first emerged.\n\nSindhu is another name for the Indus River. As a result, the Sindhu River System is a component of one of the world\u2019s and the Indian subcontinent\u2019s most fertile regions.\n\nThe river passes through Pakistan, India, and China\u2019s Tibetan areas. It is referred to as Singi Khambai or Lion\u2019s mouth in Tibet.\n\nThe Indus River System consists of the Indus, Jhelum, Chenab, Ravi, Beas, and Satluj, and is made up of the principal tributaries of the Indus River. The Indus water pact was established in 1960 to share water because the Indus River passes through both India and Pakistan.\n\nAccording to the Indus Water Treaty of 1960, the rivers Indus, Jhelum, and Chenab are under the control of Pakistan, while the rivers Rabi, Beas, and Satluj are under the control of India. Through the canal, the Indus River System also reaches Rajasthan and Haryana.\n\nIndus River System\n\nIt comes from a glacier in Bokhar Chu in the Tibetan area, located at an elevation of 4,164 m, in the Kailash Mountain range close to Mansarovar Lake.\n\nThe river originates in an area called Demchok and runs northwest before joining the Ladakh region of India. The Indus River flows between the Ladakh and Karakoram ranges but is more closely situated to the latter.\n\nThe other Himalayan tributaries of the Indus include Gilgit, Garstang, Dras, Shiger, and Hunza. After passing through Gilgit, the river makes a southerly bend before turning west and entering Khyber Pakhtunkhawa, Pakistan\u2019s northwest frontier province.\n\nThe collected waters of the five eastern tributaries\u2014the Jhelum, the Chenab, the Ravi, the Beas, and the Satluj\u2014arrive at the Indus from Panjnad (Panchnad) just before Mithankot.\n\nIts principal left-bank tributaries include the Zaskar River, Suru River, Soan River, Jhelum River, Chenab River, Ravi River, Beas River, Satluj River, and Panjnad River.\n\nIts principal right-bank tributaries include the Shyok River, Gilgit River, Hunza River, Swat River, Kunnar River, Kurram River, Gomal River, and Kabul River.\n\nRiver Chenab\n\nThe Bara Lacha Pass area of the Lahul-Spiti section of the Zaskar Range is where the Chenab originates. In the upper Himalayas in the Lahul and Spiti District of Himachal Pradesh, the confluence of the Chandra and Bhaga rivers at Tandi creates the Chenab River.\n\nIt is also referred to as the Chandrabhaga in its upper reaches. According to the Indus Water Treaty, Pakistan is given access to the Chenab\u2019s waters.\n\nThe world\u2019s tallest railroad bridge, known as Chenab Bridge, spans the river in J&K. It passes through the Jammu area of J&K before entering Pakistan\u2019s Punjab plains.\n\nRiver Sutlej\n\nSometimes, Sutlej is referred to as the red river. It begins beyond the Indian border on the southern slopes of the Kailash Mountain, not far from Mansarovar Lake and Rakas Lake.\n\nThe river flows south-westerly through the districts of Kinnaur, Shimla, Kullu, Solan, Mandi, and Bilaspur before entering HP at Shipki La.\n\nSutlej exits Himachal and enters the Punjabi plains near Bhakra. Here the highest gravity dam in the world, the Bhakra Nangal Dam, has been built.\n\nAccording to the Indus Water Treaty between India and Pakistan, India is given access to the Sutlej River\u2019s waters, mostly used for power generation and irrigation of numerous major canals.\n\nRiver Beas\n\nRohtang pass in HP is where the Beas Watercourse, a vital river of the Indus River System, originates. At Hari-Ke-Pattan in Punjab, the river combines with the Sutlej River before entering Pakistan.\n\nIt travels through the Dhaola Dhar mountain range before turning southwest and merging with the Satluj river in Harike in Punjab.\n\nIt is a relatively little river, barely 460 km long, and wholly located within Indian territory. Manali\u2019s tourist resorts are on the River Beas\u2019s right bank.\n\nRiver Ravi\n\nThe Kullu Hills near the Rohtang Pass in Himachal Pradesh is where the Ravi originates. It drains the region between the Pir Panjal and the Dhaola Dhar peaks and flows between the Pir Panjal and Dhauladhar Ranges\u2019 Shahdara Bagh, home to Jahangir\u2019s and Noor Jahan\u2019s tombs\n\nIt turns southwest after crossing Chamba and carves a deep valley in the Dhaola Dhar mountain. Near Madhopur, it reaches the Punjab Plains before moving to Pakistan below Amritsar.\n\nIn Pakistani Punjab, it empties into the Chenab just above Rangpur.\n\nRiver Jhelum\n\nIn the southeast corner of the Kashmir Valley, at Verinag, spring serves as the Jhelum\u2019s source. It empties into Wular Lake from the north (north-western part of Kashmir Valley). It shifts its path southward from Wular Lake. The river flows into a gorge in the hills of Baramulla.\n\nBelow Baramula, the river carves out a slender valley through the Pir Panjal Range. The river makes a tight zigzag curve southward at Muzaffarabad.\n\nFollowing that, it creates the border between India and Pakistan for 170 km before emerging at the Potwar Plateau close to Mirpur.\n\nIt debouches (emerges from a confined space into a broad, open area) into the plains close to the city of Jhelum after running through the spurs of the Salt Range.\n\nAt Trimmu, it connects to the Chenab.\n\nArticle written by Elizabeth",

The Bastar, Telangana, and Karnataka plateaus\u2019 tips, as well as the Tamil Nadu uplands, are located to the west.\nIts eastern portion is constrained by the Eastern Coastal area.\nThe Eastern Ghats span southern Tamil Nadu, passing through sections of Karnataka, from northern Odisha through Andhra Pradesh and Telangana.\nMountains in the Eastern Ghats\nThe tallest mountain in the Eastern Ghats is Jindhagada, located near Araku, Andhra Pradesh.\nSouthwest, the hills become more gentle as the Godavari River cuts through a gorge that is 65 kilometres (40 miles) long.\nThe Eastern Ghats can be seen as a collection of low ranges and hills, including the Erramala, Nallamala, Velikonda, and Palkonda, further southwest, beyond the Krishna River.\nThe Eastern Ghats continue as the Javadi and Shevaroy hills to the southwest of Chennai (Madras), where they converge with the Western Ghats.\nDue to fractured hills, the Eastern Ghats\u2019 altitude is uneven from a topographic perspective. The typical altitude is 600 m. (2000 ft).\nRivers flowing through\nThe Eastern Ghats are intervein by major rivers like the Godavari, Krishna and Pennar.\nA number of small rivers rise in the Eastern Ghats and debit into the Bay of Bengal.\nThree major lakes present are Chilka, Kolleru and Pulicat lakes.\nThe climate of Eastern Ghats\nRed, Black, Laterite, and Alluvial soils are the most common types of soil in the Eastern Ghats.\nThe region\u2019s mean annual temperature ranges from a low of 14.5 \u00b0C to a high of 36.5 \u00b0C.\nThe tropical monsoon climate can be seen in the Eastern Ghats. Both the South-West and the North-East retreating monsoons bring rain to the area.\nIn the Northern Ghats, the mean annual rainfall distribution exceeds 1500 mm. In and surrounding the Nallamalai highlands, it progressively drops to 1000 mm. Along the East Coast\u2019s Coastal plain, rainfall also tops 1000 mm.\nProtected Areas in the mountains region\nSome major protected areas are Simlipal, Coringa, Satyamangalam, Sri Lankamalleswara wildlife sanctuaries and Satkosia Tiger reserve.\nThe important ecoregions consist of Eastern Highlands moist deciduous forests, East Deccan dry evergreen forests, Deccan thorn scrub forests, Shrub lands and South Deccan Plateau dry deciduous forests.\nBiological diversity in the Eastern Ghats\nAlong its length on India\u2019s East Coast, from south to north, this region comprises various ecoregions.\nAlthough the Eastern Ghats\u2019 biospheres are not as well known as the Western Ghats, they are still significant because of their abundant forests, perennial and semi-perennial streams, and other natural resources.\nThe forests include tropical dry scrub forests, dry savannah forests, semi-evergreen forests, and dry evergreen forests, among others.\nHere you may find valuable trees including Eetti, Mahagony, Semmaram, Vengai, Pala, and Rosewood.\n2,500 flowering plants live in the range, protecting 13% of all flowering plants in India. Additionally, they serve as the homes for various bird, reptile, and insect species.\nBiodiversity Crisis of Eastern Ghats\nIntensive agriculture:\u00a0 In these hills, large-scale monocultures of rice, coffee, tea, and orchards are being grown, which is weakening the delicate ecosystem and removing natural plants.\nCommercial activities:\u00a0 The natural topography of the Eastern Ghats is being dangerously impacted by large-scale mineral exploration for bauxite and iron ores, their transportation, and the transmission of power lines. For instance: Forests have been indiscriminately destroyed as a result of the massive quantities of bauxite and magnesite ore that have been removed from the Kolli Hills and Servarayan Hills.\nOver-exploitation:\u00a0 The over-exploitation of forests by plant-based industries, such as plywood, paper, and pulp-making facilities, illegal firewood collection, illegal grazing, and illegal tree cutting, is also contributing to their degradation. Denudation of hilltops is occurring on a large scale as a result of the Chenchu tribes\u2019 nomadic lifestyle in search of arable land.\nLogging:\u00a0 Trees like the fragrant and priceless sandal and rosewood have been indiscriminately cut down and illegally removed by taking advantage of gaps in conservation laws and other government regulations.\nInvasive species:\u00a0 The number of species in the Eastern Ghats has decreased as a result of the invasion of alien species like Lantana Camara, which compete with native plants for nutrients and space.\nForest fires:\u00a0 The ghats\u2019 deciduous woodlands are particularly prone to forest fires. Large fires are destroying the landscape more frequently due to rare precipitation. Fire-cleared areas are further eroded by wind or become overrun by alien species.\nClimate change:\u00a0 By increasing the average annual temperature and the microclimate of flora to levels unfavorable for their physiological activity, delayed and infrequent monsoons and frequent forest fires have reduced the quality of biodiversity.\nRelated Posts\nWestern Ghats: Explained\nGadgil Report and Kasturirangan Report on Western Ghats\n\nArticle written by: Aseem Muhammed",

Through the 42nd Amendment Act, 1976 Forests and Protection of Wild Animals and Birds was transferred from State to Concurrent List.\n\nArticle 48 A in the Directive Principles of State policy, mandates that the State shall endeavour to protect and improve the environment and to safeguard the forests and wildlife of the country.\n\nArticle 51 A (g) of the Constitution states that it shall be the fundamental duty of every citizen to protect and improve the natural environment including forests and Wildlife.\u00a0\n\nStatutes relating to the forest\n\nIndia\u2019s forests are currently governed by the National Forest Policy, 1988 which has environmental balance and livelihood at its centre.\n\nClassification of forest types\n\nA great variety of forests are found in different parts of India due to unequal distribution of rainfall and temperature as well as their seasonal variation, besides varied biotic conditions.\u00a0\n\nForests have a great relationship with the surrounding atmosphere. The range of forests in India is very diverse.\n\nWe can find here from the rain forest of Kerala in the South to the alpine pastures of Ladakh, from the desert of Rajasthan in the west to the evergreen forest in the North East.\n\nAccordingly, the forests in India can be divided as\n\n1.

    "[CONTENT] #297": "The word tsunami comes from the Japanese words \u201ctsu\u201d for harbour and \u201cnami\u201d for wave.\n\nBased on the High-Powered Committee on Disaster Management\u2019s report (2001), the term \u201ctsunami\u201d refers to an ocean wave that is caused by an ocean event, such as an earthquake, landslide, or volcanic eruption.\n\nA tsunami is not just one wave; rather, it is a sequence of waves brought on by geological processes occurring near or below the ocean\u2019s surface.\n\nThese waves have the potential to grow to tremendous sizes.\n\nTable of Contents\n\nFormation of Tsunamis\nUndersea Earthquakes\nLandslides\nVolcanic Eruptions\nMeteorites and Asteroids\nPropagation of the Tsunamis\nEffects of Tsunamis\nTsunami in the Indian Ocean\nDamages Caused by Tsunami\nTsunami Disaster Management and Mitigation\nAdvance Warning about Tsunamis\nTsunami Warning System in India\nWhy the Problem is Consistent\nFormation of Tsunamis\n\nSeveral factors and incidents can lead to the formation of tsunamis, a few important of them are-\n\nUndersea Earthquakes\n\nAlthough landslides, volcanic eruptions, or even the impact of a sizable meteorite striking the water can all result in tsunamis, the most catastrophic tsunamis are produced by massive undersea earthquakes.\n\nThese destructive tsunami waves are produced by the vertical movement of the entire water column, and such a situation may arise as a result of sudden, jerky motions of fault blocks on the seabed.\n\n\ud83d\udc49 Which year are YOU targeting for success in the IAS/IPS/IFS Exam? \ud83d\ude80\n\n(1) \u21d2 UPSC 2025: Prelims cum Mains\n\n(2) \u21d2 UPSC 2026: Prelims cum Mains\n\n(3) \u21d2 UPSC 2027 Prelims cum Mains\n\nTip: Know more about ClearIAS Courses (Online/Offline)\n\nIt should be emphasised that horizontal displacement of the sea floor usually does not cause a tsunami.\n\nIn addition, not all undersea earthquakes create tsunamis, as it depends upon the nature and degree of displacement of the seawater columns.\n\nLandslides\n\nOther natural disasters like rock fall, landslides, and icefalls can cause the displacement of seawater which can lead to tsunami waves. These waves rapidly travel away from the source due to the dissipation of energy and create havoc in the nearby coastlines.\n\nVolcanic Eruptions\n\nWhen a powerful underwater volcanic eruption occurs, a significant amount of seawater is abruptly displaced, which results in the formation of tsunami waves.\n\nMeteorites and Asteroids\n\nIn the event that meteorites and asteroids fall into the water, there is a chance that a tsunami could emerge.\n\nDespite the extreme rarity of such an impact, the researcher gives\u00a0the destructive potential of a tsunami brought on by a near-Earth asteroid.\n\nPropagation of the Tsunamis\n\nTsunamis are made up of a series of extremely long waves that travel away from their point of origin on the ocean\u2019s surface in all directions.\n\nThe tsunamis cannot be seen or heard because of their extremely long wavelength and very low amplitude in deep water. Therefore, as the killer waves pass by underneath boats at fast speeds, passengers cannot feel or see the tsunami waves.\n\nAs the tsunamis leave the deep water of the open ocean and travel towards the shallow water, they are transformed in two ways.\u00a0 They first experience a significant reduction in speed, then a massive increase in height.\n\nEffects of Tsunamis\n\nResidents of coastal areas are in serious danger from tsunamis. They emerge out of nowhere and strike the seashore like a water bomb with enormous, powerful waves that are travelling with great speed.\n\nLoaded with enormous energy, the killer waves create havoc by flooding hundreds of metres inland, past the typical high water level.\n\nTsunami in the Indian Ocean\n\nMultiple times, tsunamis have been caused in the Indian Ocean. On Indonesia\u2019s Java and Sumatra islands in 1883, tsunamis generated by Krakatoa eruptions killed 36,000 people.\n\nDamages Caused by Tsunami\n\nVarious types of damages caused by the tsunami are briefly described below.\n\nDeath Toll\n\nTsunamis always claim lakhs of lives.\n\nThe Andaman and Nicobar Islands in India were the most vulnerable because they were situated closest to the earthquake\u2019s epicentre and the source of the tsunamis.\n\nThe coastal regions of Tamil Nadu were the primary targets of the tsunami attack on the Indian subcontinent.\n\nIndonesia and Sri Lanka were the nations that recorded death tolls that were higher than those in India.\n\nLoss of Property\n\nAs a result of tsunami attacks, property worth millions of rupees gets\u00a0damaged. Houses, public buildings, transportation systems, and other infrastructure components\u00a0suffer\u00a0damage that is\u00a0practically irreparable.\n\nIn the tsunami of 26th December 2004, the coastal regions of India, which include sizable coastal tracts in Tamil Nadu, Andhra Pradesh, Pondicherry, and Kerala, have incurred billions of rupees worth of financial losses, according to preliminary findings of the Indian government.\n\nPhysiographical Changes\n\nAccording to reports, the tsunami on December 26, 2004, many islands\u2019 water levels has risen, causing a number of their beaches to split in two. Indira Point, the southernmost point of the Indian Union, was nearly entirely washed out, reducing the coastline inward.\n\nThe Motion of the Earth\n\nAccording to a US Geological Survey, the earthquake\u2019s enormous energy release caused the earth to tilt slightly. According to NASA\u2019s geophysicist Richard Gross, the earthquake may have permanently accelerated the rotation of the planet due to a shift of mass toward its centre.\n\nA Decline in Soil Fertility and Agricultural Production\n\nVast, low-lying coastal areas were submerged by water, which made the soil more saline and decreases\u00a0agricultural production. The soil\u2019s extreme salinity renders\u00a0the field unproductive.\n\nEffect on Marine Life\n\nThe marine life of the Ocean gets severely impacted by deadly tsunamis.\n\nThe coral reefs of the Andaman and Nicobar Islands archipelago were severely damaged or destroyed as a result of the tsunamis that occurred in 2004. It was possible that some of the archipelagic species might get extinct.\n\nThe destructive tsunamis caused severe losses in the fishing industry as well.\n\nLarge marine mammals including whales, dolphins, and other species were negatively impacted in their breeding, feeding, and other activities.\n\nTsunami Disaster Management and Mitigation\n\nOceanic waves known as tsunamis are so strong that it is impossible for humans to contain or control them. However, in the event that tsunamis are approaching, the following advice can be useful.\n\nGet off the beaches and head for higher ground.\nStay away from rivers leading into the ocean.\nWait for all clear as there can be several giant waves in succession.\nAdvance Warning about Tsunamis\n\nThe most effective strategy to protect vulnerable communities from the wrath of deadly tsunami waves is to provide them with advance notice of impending tsunamis. The common individual will benefit from the following advice in understanding the threat posed by tsunamis.\n\nIt is possible to predict the onslaught of tsunamis by studying their speed, wavelength and depth of the sea.\u00a0 Tsunamis often take some time to reach the seashore from their point of origin because, as they get closer to the shallow sea, their wavelength and speed are drastically reduced.\n\nHowever, when they get to the shallow coastal seas, their energy is compressed, and they turn into deadly waves that destroy the coastal inhabitants.\n\nTherefore, a timely warning of tsunamis a few hours in advance can prevent the loss of thousands of lives and millions of rupees worth of property.\n\nTsunami Warning System in India\n\nUnfortunately, India and other Indian Ocean-rim countries did not have tsunami warning systems in 2004 when the deadly tsunamis hit the coasts of the Indian Ocean.\n\nAfter the catastrophe, India decided to install its own tsunami warning system rather than becoming a part of the Pacific Warning System.\n\nThe system comprises a real-time network of seismic stations, bottom pressure recorders (BPR) and tide gauges to monitor earthquakes in the sea and tsunamis triggered by them.\n\nWhy the Problem is Consistent\n\nAlthough tsunamis constitute a natural tragedy and man has hardly any control over such a powerful natural phenomenon yet man\u2019s own misdeeds have made the situation very dangerous and helped in aggravating the fury of tsunamis.\n\nFor instance, no building is permitted within\u00a0500 metres of\u00a0the coast. In India, it is required by law to keep this area of land undeveloped, yet many development projects (residential, commercial, recreational, etc.) are still carried out without regard for the law. The population in this region is most susceptible to tsunamis and other maritime dangers.\n\nMining sand and other minerals from the sea makes the concerned area highly vulnerable to tsunamis. The sand deposited on the sea coast absorbs much energy from the waves and saves much of the coastal areas from their fury. There is an urgent need to check unwanted construction and mining in ecologically sensitive coastal areas.\n\nArticle Written By: Priti Raj",

On 28 March, at least 369 ships were queuing to pass through the canal. This prevented an estimated US$9.6 billion worth of trade. This shows the importance of straits and canals in world trade.\n\nTable of Contents\n\nWhat are straits?\nHow straits are formed?\nWhat is the significance of straits?\nDifferences between Gulf and Strait\nSome of the major straits in the world\n1. Strait of Hormuz:\n2. Strait of Malacca:\n3. Bab al-Mandab:\n4. Palk Strait:\n5. Sunda Strait:\n6. Mozambique Channel:\n7. Gibraltar Strait:\n8. Bosphorus strait and Dardanelles strait:\nConclusion\nWhat are straits?\n\nStrait is a naturally formed, narrow, typically navigable waterway that connects two larger bodies of water. Most commonly it is a channel of water that lies between two landmasses. Some straits are not navigable, for example, because they are too shallow, or because of an unnavigable reef or archipelago.\n\nHow straits are formed?\n\nIt is possible that the narrow-shaped isthmus fracture will result in straits. It connects different water bodies. According to legend, straits occur as a result of plate tectonic activity. For instance, the tectonic activity in Africa is what created the Strait of Gibraltar.\n\nIt is a breakdown of the Gibraltar Isthmus. However, human activity also creates straits which are named canals. It is used for directing water flow for domestic and commercial consumption. One such strait is Suez Canal, built-in 1869.\n\nBetween the Mediterranean and the Red Sea, it serves as a watershed. Originally constructed for commerce, it today serves as a waterway connecting Europe and Asia. Without a watershed, one would have to travel into Africa to convey goods, which lengthens the journey time. Therefore, certain straits are constructed to stimulate commercial activity.\n\n\ud83d\udc49 Which year are YOU targeting for success in the IAS/IPS/IFS Exam? \ud83d\ude80\n\n(1) \u21d2 UPSC 2025: Prelims cum Mains\n\n(2) \u21d2 UPSC 2026: Prelims cum Mains\n\n(3) \u21d2 UPSC 2027 Prelims cum Mains\n\nTip: Know more about ClearIAS Courses (Online/Offline)\n\nStraits can also created when water bodies flood. Straits are also formed as a result of erosion and landslides. The Bosporus connects the Black Sea to the Aegean Sea. Bosporus was created as a result of weathering and erosion occurring naturally. As the only physical boundary between the continents of Europe and Asia, the Bosporus is crucial for geologists.\n\nAlso read: Marginal seas of the world\n\nWhat is the significance of straits?\nStraits play an important role in the Seaborne trade for commercial shipping.\nThey play an important role in geopolitics.\nStraits have played an essential role in human civilization for millennia.\nThey play an important role in economic and military matters.\nMajor straits of the world are used for commercial shipping to travel from one exclusive zone or sea to another.\nStraits are immensely commercially and strategically important. Straits provide various navigable routes to many ships. For instance, the strait of Hormuz plays an important role as the world\u2019s one-third of oil trade takes place through this strait.\nStraits are also used in generating tidal power with the help of turbines. For example, 5.6 GW of energy is produced by Cook\u2019s strait of New Zealand.\nThe Strait plays a vital role in serving as a channel through which ocean currents are passed which helps in mortifying the climate of that area. That is why straits are playing an essential role both in physical and human geography.\nDifferences between Gulf and Strait\n\nGulfs and Straits have been considered geographical features on the earth\u2019s surface. Both gulfs and straits are part of the water body.\n\nGulf refers to an inlet within the sea which is deep and has a narrow opening. Gulf refers to the portion of the ocean which penetrates within the land. It can be different in shape, deepness and size.\n\nStraits refer to a narrow waterway that acts as a connector toward a large water body. The connector is a link between two watersheds; hence, it is formed due to a fracture of the isthmus. Straits are generally formed due to tectonic shifts.\n\nThe gulf and Straits are both man-made and natural; they are used for economic purposes. The Gulf of Mexico and Oman has been used as economic sites for transport and trading. The Gulf of Mexico is the largest gulf used for recreational activities, commercial, and sports. Suez Canal is the largest man-made strait used for trading and transportation purposes.\n\nGulf\n\t\nStrait\u00a0\n\n\nThe gulf is a sea portion that penetrates within the land.\n\t\nStraits are narrow watersheds that act as a connector between two huge water bodies.\n\n\nIt connects both land and sea.\n\t\nIt is a connector of water bodies only.\n\n\nThe gulf is usually formed naturally.\n\t\nIt is majorly man-made, like canals.\n\n\nThe gulf is very helpful for harbouring ships.\n\t\nThey are very small and cannot be used for harbouring purposes.\n\n\nSometimes, it is also considered a large bay.\n\t\nThey are very narrow and are used as canals.\n\n\neg: Gulf of Mannar, Persian gulf\n\t\neg: Hormuz straits, Malacca strait\nSome of the major straits in the world\n1. Strait of Hormuz:\nIt links the Persian Gulf (West) with the Gulf of Oman and the Arabian Sea (southeast).\nIt contains the Islands of Qeshm, Hormuz and Hengam.\nIt is of crucial strategic and economic significance, particularly given that oil tankers bringing in cargo from several Persian Gulf ports must cross the strait.\nOPEC members Saudi Arabia, Iran, the UAE, Kuwait and Iraq export most of the crude via the strait.\nQatar, the world\u2019s biggest LNG exporter, sends almost all of its LNG through the strait.\n2. Strait of Malacca:\nIt connects the Andaman Sea (Indian Ocean) and the South China Sea (Pacific Ocean)\nIt is the longest strait in the world, measuring roughly 800 kilometres, and it not only makes it easier for locals to travel about, but it also serves as a hub for trade, culture, ideas, and information between East and West.\nThe Strait of Malacca connects the Indian Ocean with the South China Maritime, making it the shortest sea route between China and India and one of the busiest shipping lanes in the world.\nThe importance of this region has grown as a result of the worldwide shift in economic power from the West to the East as well as booming commerce, investments, and production in areas spanning the Indian and Pacific Ocean basins.\n3. Bab al-Mandab:\nThe strait known as Bab al-Mandab is what divides the Arabian Peninsula from the Horn of Africa.\nIt connects the Red Sea to the Indian Ocean and the Gulf of Aden.\nThe strait, which is bordered by Yemen on one side and Djibouti and Eritrea on the other, is barely 29 km wide at its narrowest point.\nIt is a crucial strategic route for trade and commerce, with an estimated 4% of the world\u2019s oil supply travelling through it.\n4. Palk Strait:\nIt links Palk Bay in the southwest with the Bay of Bengal in the northeast.\nThe strait is less than 330 feet (100 metres) deep, 40 to 85 miles (64 to 137 km) long, and 64 to 137 km broad.\nOn the Sri Lankan side, it has several islands and receives various rivers, notably the Vaigai (India).\nThe Adam\u2019s Bridge is a collection of sand shoals formed over time by sedimentation.\nA calcareous foundation of dead reef and sand supports every island.\nPart of the Gulf of Mannar between Rameswaram and Tuticorin, which includes 21 islands and the nearby shallow coastal waters, was designated as a Marine National Park in 1986 due to its great biodiversity of over 4,000 species of varied flora and wildlife.\n5. Sunda Strait:\nIt connects the Indian Ocean to the Java Sea in the Pacific Ocean (south).\nBetween the east Java and Sumatra islands is the Sunda Strait, or Selat Sunda in Indonesian. Its width ranges from 16 to 70 miles (26 to 110 kilometres).\nAn essential route linking eastern Asia and the Indian Ocean is the Sunda Strait.\nThis shallowness, very powerful tidal currents, sandbanks, and man-made obstacles like oil rigs off the Java coast make it infamously challenging to navigate.\nMany big, contemporary ships utilise the Strait of Malacca instead of the strait due to its narrowness, shallowness, and lack of good mapping.\n6. Mozambique Channel:\nIt is situated between the eastern island country of Madagascar and Mozambique on the continent of Africa (west).\nThe northern entrance is marked by the Comoro Archipelago, and the southern entry is marked by the islands of Bassas da India and Europa.\nIt receives all main Madagascar rivers and has the ports of Mahajanga (Majunga) and Toliary (Tul\u00e9ar) on the same coast, making it a crucial route for commerce in eastern Africa.\nThe mouth of the Zambezi River and the ports of Maputo (formerly Louren\u00e7o Marques), Mo\u00e7ambique, and Beira are located on the opposite shore.\nThe strait is traversed by the Mozambique Current.\n7. Gibraltar Strait:\nIt is a waterway that runs between the southernmost point of Spain and the westernmost point of Africa, bridging the Mediterranean Sea and the Atlantic Ocean.\nBetween Point Marroqu (Spain) and Point Cires, it is 36 miles (58 km) long and narrows to 8 miles (13 km) in width (Morocco).\nBecause it allows for seaborne transit for commerce between the Atlantic and Mediterranean, as well as via the Suez Canal into the Indian Ocean and beyond, it is one of the most important worldwide sea lanes.\nThe Strait is the busiest shipping waterway in the world after the English Channel.\n8. Bosphorus strait and Dardanelles strait:\nThe Bosphorus sometimes referred to as the Strait of Istanbul, is a narrow, naturally occurring waterway that connects northwest Turkey to the rest of the world.\nThe Bosporus links the Black Sea to the Sea of Marmara and, indirectly, to the Aegean and Mediterranean Seas via the Dardanelles.\nIt is the narrowest strait in the world that is used for international shipping.\nThe Dardanelles, a strait that separates Asian Turkey from European Turkey, is a narrow, naturally occurring, and globally significant waterway that is located in northwest Turkey.\nThe Sea of Marmara is linked to the Aegean, Mediterranean, and, indirectly through the Bosphorus, the Black Sea by the Dardanelles.\nConclusion\n\nImportant geological features created by biological processes include the gulf and straits. However, the differences may be distinguished by their size, shape, and depth in addition to other characteristics. The gulf is a sea portion that penetrates with the landmass while straits are surrounded by ocean on all sides. The Gulf has a narrow opening while the entire shape and size of the strait is narrow. Both are used for trade and commercial purposes\n\nArticle written by: Aseem Muhammed",

On average India receives 118 cm of annual rainfall which is considered to be the highest anywhere in the world for a country of comparable size.\n\n\ud83d\udc49 Which year are YOU targeting for success in the IAS/IPS/IFS Exam? \ud83d\ude80\n\n(1) \u21d2 UPSC 2025: Prelims cum Mains\n\n(2) \u21d2 UPSC 2026: Prelims cum Mains\n\n(3) \u21d2 UPSC 2027 Prelims cum Mains\n\nTip: Know more about ClearIAS Courses (Online/Offline)\n\nHowever, the southwest monsoons\u2019 unpredictable, unreliable, and variable rainfall causes drought conditions in many parts of the country. The major causes of meteorological drought are:\n\nDue to the lack of depressions over India, there have been weak monsoons and below-average rainfall.\nEarly monsoon withdrawal or late monsoon onset\nprolonged breaks in monsoon.\nRe-establishment of the southern branch of the jet stream.\nHydrological Drought\n\nHydrological drought is associated with a reduction in water. A meteorological drought often leads to a hydrological drought. In most cases, it takes two consecutive meteorological droughts before a hydrological drought manifests itself. There are two types of hydrological droughts viz.,\n\nSurface water drought\nGroundwater drought.\n\nSurface-water Drought\n\nIt is concerned with the drying up of surface water resources such as rivers, streams, lakes, ponds, tanks, reservoirs, etc.\n\nThere are many processes, besides meteorological drought, which lead to surface water drought. Surface water drought is primarily caused by extensive deforestation. Other undesirable human activities that enhance the drought condition are the expansion of non-terraced agriculture, environmentally hazardous mining, and indiscriminate road construction.\n\nGroundwater Drought\n\nGroundwater drought is associated with a reduction in the groundwater level. This phenomenon happens due to excessive groundwater pumping without compensatory replenishment and creating more or less irreversible groundwater drought even during normal rainfall conditions.\n\nThere are soft, permeable alluvial soils in India\u2019s northern plain. These soils allow water to penetrate and aid in replenishing groundwater. The peninsular plateau, in contrast, contains hard, impervious rocks that obstruct the replenishment of groundwater. Still, a situation of reduction in groundwater level pertains to the Northern Indian Plain too.\n\nAgricultural Drought\n\nAgricultural drought is concerned with the impact of meteorological/hydrological drought on crop yields. Agricultural drought results when soil moisture and rainfall levels are insufficient to support a healthy crop\u2019s growth to maturity, leading to high moisture stress and the withering of important crop areas.\n\nHigh-yielding varieties (HYV) of seeds have taken the place of conventional drought-resistant seeds since the beginning of the green revolution in India in the 1960s. The water needs of various crops have increased as a result of the use of fertilizers.\n\nThe Green Revolution-based agriculture is incredibly reliant on irrigation, and any delay in the water supply will result in severe agricultural drought.\n\nMoreover, the Green Revolution brought changes in cropping patterns.\n\nFor example, rice cultivation was practically unknown in Punjab, Haryana, and Western Uttar Pradesh before Green Revolution and this region is not suitable for rice cultivation considering the amount of rainfall received by this region.\n\nDue to the changing cropping patterns, limited water supplies are under severe stress, which occasionally results in severe droughts.\n\nSoil Moisture Drought\n\nThis is a concern with insufficient soil moisture, especially in locations that receive rain, which may not sustain agricultural growth. This occurs during a meteorological drought when there is less water available to the soil and more water is lost through evaporation.\n\nSocio-Economic Drought\n\nIt reflects the reduction of availability of food and loss of income because of crop failures that endanger the food and social security of individuals in the affected areas.\n\nFamine\n\nA famine happens when access to food is reduced significantly, which\u00a0could result in widespread starvation if assistance is not provided.\n\nEcological Drought\n\nEcological drought occurs when environmental harm caused by distress causes a natural eco-productivity system to decrease significantly.\n\nCauses\nIndia experiences droughts when the southwest monsoon is weak. Droughts occur as a result of a weak monsoon\u2019s inadequate rainfall.\nDroughts can also be brought on by the monsoons\u2019 late arrival\u00a0or early departure.\nDroughts are another consequence of prolonged monsoon breaks during the rainy season.\n\nAlthough a drought may occur at any time and in any part of the country, most of the drought-prone areas are those having marginal rainfall and high variability of rainfall.\n\nEffects\n\nDroughts have a wide range of effects on the masses, especially in developing countries like India. The following categories best describe the impact of droughts in India:\n\nPhysical Impact: adverse effect of drought on the recharge of soil moisture, surface runoff, and groundwater table.\nImpact on Agriculture:\u00a0Indian agriculture is largely dependent on monsoon rainfall. Approx two-thirds of the arable land is rainfed and lacks irrigation facilities. The effect results in the shortfalls of agricultural production in drought years.\nSocial and Economic Impact:\u00a0A drought can have more severe social and economic effects than it does physically or agriculturally. Drought is associated with famine which has its own social and economic consequences.\n\nThe effects of drought appear can cause severe damage, a few important them are mentioned below:\n\nResults in decline in cultivated area and fall in agricultural production.\nFall in purchasing power.\nFall in employment in the agricultural sector.\nCan create a scarcity of drinking water, fodder, and food.\nCauses Inflation\nLivestock deaths and distressed sales of cattle.\nWidespread malnutrition.\nSpread of diseases like diarrhea, cholera, and ophthalmia caused by malnutrition, hunger, and starvation.\nSale and mortgage of property, jewelry, etc. in distress.\nMigration of people from drought-hit areas to other areas for livelihood.\nDeath due to malnutrition/starvation/diseases.\nHarsh impact on secondary and tertiary activities due to falling of primary production.\nSocial stress and tension, disruption of social institutions, and an increase in social crime.\n\nThe weaker segments of society\u00a0are most affected by a drought. These people include migrant workers, small-scale and marginal farmers, and artists like weavers.\n\nDrought Prone Areas\n\nA drought-prone area is defined as one in which the probability of a drought year is greater than 20%.\n\nA chronic drought-prone area is one in which the probability of a drought year is greater than 40%.\n\nA drought year occurs when less than 75% of the normal rainfall is received.\n\nIn India, 16 percent of the total area and 12 percent of the population is drought-affected, although the total average drought-prone area may be as much as 10 lakh sq km or about one-third of the total land area of the country.\n\nAlso read: Cloud Seeding\n\nFrequency\n\nThe number of times a drought occurs over a specific period is referred to as its frequency. Depending on the amount, fluctuation, and need for water, different regions of the country experience different frequencies of droughts.\n\nThe first systematic attempt at famine relief measures could be traced to the Great Famine or the Orissa Famine of 1866. Under Sir George Campbell\u2019s chairmanship, the then\u00a0government formed\u00a0the first Famine Commission.\n\nThe formation of a Famine Commission in 1880 in the wake of the famines of 1873 and 1876\u20131878 was the second step. As a result of the Famine Commission\u2019s suggestions, the government chose to introduce the Famine Codes started\u00a0in 1883, bringing in the modern approach to relief administration.\n\nRead:\u00a0Famines in Colonial India\n\nMoving from Drought Relief to Drought Management\n\nAfter Independence, India experienced major droughts in the years 1965-67, 1972-73, 1979 80 and 1985-88.\n\nThe High-Powered Committee on Disaster Management\u2019s report 2002 states that \u201cdrought management is often done by focusing on water conservation and supply, standing crop saving, and public distribution supplies of essential commodities.\u201d\n\nDrought Prone Area Programmes (DPAP)\n\nThis programme was initiated in 1974. The intention was to change DPAP from a relief and employment-oriented programme into one aimed at \u2018drought-proofing\u2019 through the adoption of an integrated area development approach which sought to mitigate the impact of future droughts by stabilizing both production and employment.\n\nThe objectives of the programme are:\n\nTo minimize the adverse effects of drought on the production of crops and livestock and productivity of land, water, and human resources through integrated development of the natural resource base of the area and adoption of appropriate technologies.\nto long-term preservation, development, and utilization of land, water, and other natural resources, especially rainfall.\nIntegrated Watershed Management\n\nThe prevention of drought conditions is greatly aided by integrated watershed management.\n\nThis strategy guarantees coordinated planning, combined use of surface and groundwater, prioritization of rational water use, and planning based on the entire amount of available water resources.\n\nVarious watersheds have been constructed throughout the country\u2019s different rainfed regions as part of the National Watershed Programme for Rainfed Areas.\n\nArticle Written By: Priti Raj",

Scheduled Tribes in the country (excluding Jammu and Kashmir), make up 8.08 per cent of the overall population. India\u2019s tribal population increased to 10.43 Cr. from 8.43 Cr. in 2001\n\nAs per the 2011 census, 10.42 crore Indians are notified as \u2018Scheduled Tribes\u2019 (ST), which constitute 8.6% of countries total population.\n\nThe growth of the Scheduled Tribes population was due to the following two reasons:\n\nThere has been a rapid natural growth of tribal population, and\nThe list of Scheduled Tribes has frequently been expanded.\nWhy Demographic Study of Tribal Population is Difficult?\n\nThe use of arbitrary criteria for \u201cscheduling the tribes\u201d has severely harmed the demographic study of tribal populations.\n\nDue to a lack of precise and scientific standards, the research of indigenous people suffers from major abnormalities.\n\nFor instance, in Madhya Pradesh, the Gonds are a Scheduled Tribe, whereas, in Uttar Pradesh, they are a Scheduled Caste.\n\nDistribution of Scheduled Tribes\n\nThe distribution pattern is characterised by a striking tendency of clustering and concentrating in pockets, making them suffer from isolation and situated in areas where the environmental setting is, by and large, not suitable for settled agriculture.\n\nAs a result, the majority of tribal settlements are found in remote regions of the nation that are covered with\u00a0hills and forests. The tribal groups have created their own distinct traditional way of life. After Independence, however, there was some interaction between tribal and non-tribal people that altered the situation substantially.\n\nThe distribution of Scheduled Tribes is markedly different from that of Scheduled Castes.\u00a0 Scheduled Castes\u00a0exhibit a very high concentration in the fertile Indo-Gangetic Plain and the Coastal Plains, where they work as agricultural labourers. Scheduled Tribes, on the other hand, tend to concentrate in remote and less hospitable regions.\n\nState Level Patterns\n\nThere are wide variations in the state-level distribution of the tribal populations.\n\nWhile, on one hand, no tribes have been scheduled in Punjab and Haryana, and the union territories of Delhi, Chandigarh and Puducherry; as much as 94.43 per cent of the total population in Mizoram and 94.79 per cent in Lakshadweep belongs to Scheduled Tribes.\n\nAmong the 15 major states, Chhattisgarh has the largest proportion of the Scheduled Tribe population at 30.62 per cent followed by Jharkhand at 26.21 per cent.\n\nFurther, 71% of\u00a0India\u2019s Scheduled Tribes population\u00a0is also mostly concentrated in six states: Madhya Pradesh, Maharashtra, Odisha, Gujarat, Rajasthan, and Jharkhand.\n\nTribal Economy\n\nFor the Indian classification of Scheduled Tribes, tribal economy plays a significant role. The following are the tribes\u2019 primary economies:\n\nHunting, fishing and food gathering,\nShifting cultivation and lumbering, and\nSedentary cultivation and animal husbandry.\n\nA brief account of tribes practising these economies is given as under:\n\nHunting, Fishing and Gathering\n\nA huge number of tribes rely on hunting, fishing, and food collecting and live in isolation in forests. Some of the tribes only engage exclusively in these activities.\n\nA list of a few main tribes engaged in such activities from different states is given-\n\nRaji in Uttar Pradesh;\nKharia, Birhor, Korwa, Pariha and Birgias in Jharkhand;\nKuki in West Bengal;\nHill-Maria in Chhattisgarh,\nJuang in Odisha,\nChenchu and Yanadi in Andhra Pradesh and Telangana,\nKoya, Reddi, Kadar and Paliyan in Tamil Nadu,\nBhil, Garasia in Maharashtra and Gujarat;\nBhil, Garasia and Sahariya in Rajasthan\nKuki, Konyak and Naga in Assam, Meghalaya, Nagaland and Arunachal Pradesh.\n\nShifting Cultivation and Lumbering\n\nShifting cultivation is said to be as old as the history of agriculture itself.\n\nIn this kind of farming, an area of forestland is cleared using the slash-and-burn method so that crops can be produced there.\n\nAfter two to three years, the soil\u2019s fertility declines, and the farmer moves to another plot of land. It is termed shifting agriculture. Different regions of the country have different names for them. It is referred to as Jhum or jum.\n\nThe main tribes practising shifting cultivation and lumbering are-\n\nKoria, Saharia, Bhutias and Kharwar in Uttar Pradesh,\nKorwa and Asur in Jharkhand;\nGaro, Mal-Paharia in West Bengal;\nGonda, Baiga, Maria, and Dhora in Chhattisgarh and Madhya Pradesh;\nSaora, Khond, Kurumba and Bagola in Andhra Pradesh:\nSaora, Keria and Khond in Odisha;\nKhond, Gond, Kurumba and Muduwan in Tamil Nadu;\nGharasia and Bhil in Maharashtra and Gujarat;\n\nSedentary Cultivation and Animal Husbandry\n\nSedentary farming is a style of agriculture where the farmer grows food primarily for his personal needs, with a little left over to sell on the market.\n\nThis is hardly an advanced form of cultivation, and indigenous people typically practise it together with animal husbandry.\n\nThe primary tribes that have adopted these occupations include-\n\nTharu, Khasa, Bhoksa, Maghi, Kol and Bhotias in Uttar Pradesh;\nMunda, Ho, Korwa, Oraon, Tamaria, and Santhal in Jharkhand;\nPolia, Santhal, and Bhumji in West Bengal;\nParja, Bhatra, Baija and Gond in Chhattisgarh and Madhya Pradesh,\nBadaga, Irula, Parga and Malydi in Tamil Nadu,\nBadaga, Koya, Irula and Kota in Andhra Pradesh and Telangana;\nBhil, Dubla, Raiwari, Barali, Koli, Dhamalia, etc. in Maharashtra and Gujarat,\nBhil, Garasiya and Meena in Rajasthan.\n\nRelated article:\u00a0De-notified, Nomadic, and Semi-Nomadic Tribes (DNTs)\n\nArticle Written By: Priti Raj",

To answer these questions, read further.\n\nThe Himalayan Mountains are part of India\u2019s northern mountain range. They are the world\u2019s tallest mountain ranges. These mountain ranges begin at Pamir Knot in the west and continue to Purvanchal in the east.\n\nThe Himalayas are the result of the Indian and Eurasian plates colliding. Indian Peninsula split off from Gondwana during the Cretaceous Period and began moving north. Between the two plates, the Tethys was squeezed, creating a geosyncline.\n\nThe Indian Plate\u2019s oceanic boundary was subducted\u00a0as the plate moved north, leaving some of these rocks in the Ladakh region.\n\nThe northward drift along with the Tethys sea compression caused the Himalayas to rise. The mountains continued to converge, creating fold mountains known as the Main Himalayas or Greater Himalayas, and south of them, the Main Central Thrust.\n\nEastern Himalayas were generated by the collision of the Indian and Eurasian plates 60 million years ago, which caused the construction of the Potwar plateau and an anticlockwise spin in the plate.\n\nAs the process continued, the Main Boundary Fault line developed south of the Lesser Himalayas. It is\u00a0referred to as the Middle Himalayas.\n\nForedeep was formed on the foothills of the Greater and Lesser Himalayas, where deposition and subsequent compression resulted in the construction of the Shivalik Mountains and a new fault line emerged which came to be known as the Himalayan frontal line.\n\n\ud83d\udc49 Which year are YOU targeting for success in the IAS/IPS/IFS Exam? \ud83d\ude80\n\n(1) \u21d2 UPSC 2025: Prelims cum Mains\n\n(2) \u21d2 UPSC 2026: Prelims cum Mains\n\n(3) \u21d2 UPSC 2027 Prelims cum Mains\n\nTip: Know more about ClearIAS Courses (Online/Offline)\n\nFrom the Indus gorge in the west to the Brahmaputra gorge in the east, the Himalayas stretch in an east-west pattern.\n\nAt these gorges, the Himalayan ranges make abrupt bends to the south. These bends are known as the Himalayan syntaxial bends.\n\nThe western syntaxial bend is located close to Nanga Parbat, where the Indus river has built a large gorge. The Namche Barwa is close to the eastern syntaxial bend.\n\nThe Himalayas is one of the three mountain ranges that constitute the Himalayan mountain range system. These were created by the tectonic collision of the Indian Plate and the Eurasian Plate. The Purvanchal Hills, Trans Himalayas, and Himalayas are the three Himalayan mountain ranges that constitute up the northern mountain chain.\n\nTable of Contents\n\nThe Great Himalayas\nTrans Himalayas\nLesser Himalayas\nShivalik\nPurvanchal or Eastern Himalayas\nSignificance\nThe Great Himalayas\n\nIt is also known as Himadri, the Central Himalayas, or the Inner Himalayas. The hogback topography\u2014a long, steep hill or mountain ridge\u2014is created by the asymmetrical folds in this range, which have a high south slope and a mild north slope.\n\nIts typical height is 5000 kilometers. It has tall mountains and vast glacier snowfields and is mostly made up of crystal-rich igneous or metamorphic rocks.\n\nIts core is comprised of Archean rocks, and there are very few gaps and antecedent rivers. The range is also continuous. It forms an arc from Nanga Parbat in the west to Namcha Barwa in the east.\n\nFew of the current passes are Zojila and Brazil in Kashmir, Bara Lapcha La and Shipki La in Himachal Pradesh, Niti pass and Lipu lekh in Uttarakhand, and Nathula and Jelep La in Si.\n\nTrans Himalayas\n\nThe Trans himalaya is a 1,600-kilometer (990 mi) long mountain range that runs parallel to the main Himalayan range in a west-to-east orientation. It is on the southern edge of the Tibetan Plateau, north of the Yarlung Tsangpo river.\n\nThe Trans-Himalayas is mostly made up of granite and volcanic materials. The mountains lack a clear alignment and are not split by large river gorges like the main Himalayas.\n\nThe Great Karakoram Range, also known as the Krishnagiri Range, is the northernmost range of the Trans-Himalayan Ranges in India.\n\nThe Karakoram Range stretches around 800 kilometers east of the Pamir. It is a mountain range with high peaks (elevations of 5,500 m or more). Some of the largest glaciers in the world outside of the polar regions call this place home.\n\nThe second-highest peak in the globe and the highest mountain in the Indian Union is K2.\n\nThe Ladakh Plateau is located to the northeast of the Karakoram Range. It is divided into several plains and mountains.\n\nLesser Himalayas\n\nThe Greater Himalayas in the north and the Shiwaliks in the south have a nearly parallel alignment with both ranges.\n\nIts typical height ranges from 1300 to 5000 kilometers. Typically, it is made up of crystalline sediments.\n\nWhile the arrangement is considerably distinct and reflects very heavily folded and complex structures, its lithology is identical to the Main Himalayas.\n\nDhauladhar, Pirpanjal, Nagatibba, Mussorie, and Mahabharat ranges are significant ranges. While northern slopes are rocky, southern slopes are steep. Small pastures known as Merg can be found on slopes.\n\nThe Mussoorie and Nag Tibba ranges in Uttarakhand serve as landmarks for the Middle Himalayas.\n\nHuman contact is easier in the Middle Himalayan ranges.\n\nThe lower Himalayas are represented by the Sapt Kosi, Sikkim, Bhutan, Miri, Abor, and Mishmi hills east of the Kosi River. The Mahabharat Lekh, in southern Nepal, is a continuation of the Mussoorie Range.\n\nThis region is the location of the majority of Himalayan hill resorts, including Shimla, Mussoorie, Ranikhet, Nainital, Almora, and Darjeeling, among others.\n\nShivalik\n\nThis range, which is not continuous, is also known as the outer Himalayas. It looks like a hogback and its slopes are more steep in the south.\n\nThere are valleys in the north called Doon in the west and Duar in the east. They go by the name Dehradun.\n\nMostly fossiliferous sedimentary rocks, such as sandstone, sand rocks, clay, conglomerate, and limestone, constitute this zone.\n\nThick trees cover the Shiwalik range from North-East India to Nepal, but as you move west from Nepal, the amount of forest cover reduces. The quantum of rainfall decreases from east to west in Shiwaliks and Ganga Plains.\n\nNearly no trees cover the southern slopes of the Shiwalik mountain in Punjab and Himachal Pradesh. Seasonal torrents are known as Chos deeply slash these slopes. The hills belong to antisynclines or anticlines, while valleys belong to synclines.\n\nShiwalik Hills were created by the conglomerate\u2019s accumulation. During the first stages of deposition, these conglomerates created transient lakes.\n\nThese transient lakes gathered an increasing amount of conglomerates over time. At the bottom of the lakes, the aggregates were firmly established.\n\nConglomerate-filled lakes were drained away when rivers were able to cut through them, leaving behind plains known as \u201cduns\u201d or \u201cdoons\u201d in the west and \u201cduars\u201d in the east. The best illustration is Dehra Dun in Uttarakhand.\n\nPurvanchal or Eastern Himalayas\n\nThe Himalayas\u2019 southern extension, known as the Eastern Hills or The Purvanchal, runs along India\u2019s northeastern border.\n\nThe Purvanchal is a group of relatively low hills that are formed when the Himalayas abruptly curve southward near the Dihang canyon.\n\nThey stretch from Arunachal Pradesh in the north to Mizoram in the south along the border between India and Myanmar.\n\nSignificance\n\nIt is a heaven for naturalists because of the incredible variety of plants and animals, which is brought about by the general temperature changes as one ascends higher.\n\nDeodars, azaleas, pines, firs, tigers, snow leopards, sparrows, cormorants, snow partridges, snow cocks, and snow pigeons are just a few of the plants and animals that alter with elevation and temperature.\n\nThe Himalayas have protected India from foreign incursions as a protective barrier since ancient times.\n\nIndia\u2019s climate is significantly impacted by the Himalayas. The summer monsoons from the Arabian Sea and Bay of Bengal are successfully deflected by them.\n\nThe Himalayan mountains are the source of almost all of India\u2019s major rivers. Ample rainfall serves as the food source for India\u2019s powerful rivers.\n\nRead:\u00a0Hindu Kush Himalaya\n\nArticle written by Chetna Yadav.",

The Western Ghats are home to 30% of flora and fauna species found in India.\n\n39 Western Ghats series sites were added to UNESCO\u2019s list of World Heritage Sites.\n\nThe Western Ghats are known as Sahyadri in northern Maharashtra, Sahya Parvatam in Kerala and Nilagiri Malai in Tamil Nadu.\n\nStates and Union Territories under the Western Ghats\n\nSix states\u2014Gujarat, Maharashtra, Goa, Karnataka, Tamil Nadu, and Kerala\u2014as well as two Union Territories\u2014Dadra & Nagar Haveli and Pondicherry\u2014are home to the mountain region.\n\nThe range begins near the Gujarati border, south of the Tapti river, where the eastern part of Dadra and Silvassa in D&N is occupied by the foothills of the mountains. It ends at Kerala\u2019s Anamudi peak, almost 1600 kilometres south of where it began.\n\nMahe in Pondicherry is situated on the Malabar coast on the Western Ghats surrounded by Kerala.\n\nMountains in the Western Ghats\nNumerous hill towns, including Matheran, Lonavala-Khandala, Mahabaleshwar, Panchgani, Amboli Ghat, Kudremukh, and Kodagu, may be found in the mountain region.\nThe extreme northern parts of Western Ghats fall in the Dangs district of Gujarat, known for the Dang (Bamboo) forests.\nThe Eastern and Western Ghats converge in Karnataka near Biligirirangan Hills. The highest peak in the mountain region is Anamudi, which is 2,695 metres high. The highest peak in Karnataka is Mullayanagiri, which rises 1,950 metres.\nThey conjoin the Anaimalai Hills to the northwest, the Palni Hills to the northeast and the Agasthyamalai Hills to the south as far as the Ariankavu pass.\nThere are many important passes in the Western Ghats such as Tamhini Ghat, Palakkad Gap, Naneghat, Kasara ghat etc.\nThe short coastal plain between the mountain region and the Arabian Sea is divided into three parts: the northern part, known as the Konkan Coast, the centre part, known as Kanara, and the southern part, known as the Malabar area or the Malabar Coast.\nThe foothill region east of the Ghats in Maharashtra is known as Desh, while the eastern foothills of the central Karnataka state are known as Malenadu.\nRivers in the Western Ghats\nPeninsular India is home to 245 million people, most of whom depend on rivers coming from the mountain region for their water supply.\nThe rivers that originate in the Western Ghats and flow towards the west are Periyar, Bharathappuzha, Netravati, Sharavathi, Mandovi etc.\nThe Western Ghats\u2019 westward-flowing rivers move quickly because of their short travel distance and greater grade. Because of this, the Western Ghats are more advantageous for producing hydroelectricity than the Eastern Ghats.\nThe steep gradient makes the Jog Falls on the Shravasthi River in Karnataka one of the most spectacular waterfalls in India. Narmada and Tapti although don\u2019t rise from the Western Ghats but flow westwards.\nThe rivers that originate in the mountain region and flow towards the east include three major rivers viz.\u00a0 The Godavari, Krishna and Kaveri, and many smaller / tributary rivers such as Tunga, Bhadra, Bhima, Malaprabha, Ghataprabha, Hemavathi, and Kabini.\nThese east-flowing rivers are comparatively slower moving and eventually merge into larger rivers such as the Kaveri and Krishna.\n\nAlso read: Hills of Peninsular India\n\nClimate of Western Ghats\nDue to the mountains\u2019 ability to obstruct rain-bringing westerly monsoon winds, the western side of the Western Ghats receives more rainfall than its eastern side. It, therefore, has a significant impact on the pattern and intensity of India\u2019s monsoonal rainfall.\nThe dense forests also contribute to high orographic precipitation. The climate is humid and tropical in the lower reaches tempered by the proximity to the sea.\nElevations of 1,500 m and above in the north and 2,000 m and above in the south have a more temperate climate.\nHere, the yearly average temperature is close to 15 \u00b0C. Some regions frequently get frost, and the winter months have temperatures below freezing. 20 \u00b0C in the south to 24 \u00b0C in the north are the average temperatures. Additionally, it has been shown that the South Western Ghats\u2019 coldest and wettest seasons are related.\nDuring the monsoon season between June and September, the unbroken Western Ghats chain acts as a barrier to the moisture-laden clouds. The heavy, eastward-moving rain-bearing clouds are forced to rise and in the process deposit most of their rain on the windward side. Rainfall in this region averages 3,000\u20134,000 mm.\nThe eastern region of the mountain region which lies in the rain shadow receives far less rainfall averaging about 1,000 mm bringing the average rainfall figure to 2,500 mm.\nVegetation of Western Ghats\nThe vegetation on high hills differs from that on low slopes as well. As a result, the Western Ghats are home to a wide variety of plants.\nThe western slopes have tropical and subtropical moist broadleaf forests marked predominantly by Rosewood, Mahogany, Cedar etc. These slopes appear green in almost all parts of the year. No time is fixed when these trees would shade their leaves.\nThe eastern slopes of the mountain region have dry as well as moist deciduous forests marked predominantly by Teak, Sal, Shisham, Sandalwood etc. trees.\nFurther, on the northern side of the Wayanad forests; we find dry deciduous forests while on the southern side there are wet deciduous forests. The evergreen Wayanad forests of Kerala mark the transition zone between the northern and southern ecoregions of the mountain regions.\nThe southern ecoregions are generally wetter and more species-rich. South Western Ghats Montane rain forests are the most species-rich ecoregions in peninsular India. 80% of the flowering plant species of the entire Western Ghats range are found in this ecoregion.\nThe areas which are high in elevation are cooler and wetter in the north and so the forests there are called North Western Ghats Montane rain forests. There are montane grasslands as well as stunted forests also in the Western Ghats.\n\u00a0Protected Areas in the Western Ghats\n\nThe Western Ghats is home to India\u2019s two biosphere reserves, 13 National parks, several wildlife sanctuaries and many Reserve Forests.\n\n1. The Nilgiri Biosphere Reserve comprises 5500 km\u00b2 of the evergreen forests of\n\nNagarahole\nDeciduous forests of Bandipur National Park\nNugu in Karnataka\nWayanad\nMudumalai National Park in the states of Kerala and Tamil Nadu forms the largest contiguous protected area in the Western Ghats.\n\n2. The Silent Valley National Park in Kerala is among the last tracts of virgin tropical evergreen forest in India.\n\nBiological diversity\n\nNumerous types of flora and wildlife, including hundreds of species that are threatened with extinction globally, may be found in the Western Ghats. Many of these species are also endemic to the region. Covering an area of 180,000 sq. km, or just under 6 per cent of the land area of India,\n\nThe Western Ghats are home to over 5000 species of flowering plants, 139 mammal species, 508 bird species 179 amphibian species, and many undiscovered species.\n\nIt contains more than 30 per cent of all the plant, fish, herpeto-fauna, bird, and mammal species found in India.\n\nThe mountain region includes a diversity of medicinal plants and important genetic resources such as the wild relatives of grains, fruit and spices.\n\nSome endemic species of the mountain region include the Malabar large-spotted Civet, Lion-tailed Macaque, Nilgiri Tahr and Brown Palm Civet\n\nBiodiversity Crisis\n\nThe Western Ghats are under rising population and development pressure, according to the International Union for Conservation of Nature 2020.\n\nThis requires intensive and targeted management efforts to conserve the existing values and also remediate past damages.\n\nMadhav Gadgil\u2019s committee reiterated that human interference and unscientific land use had worsened the already damaged ecosystem of the mountain region.\n\nClimate change and Global warming have led to big variations in the duration and intensity of rainfalls in the region.\n\nRelated Posts\nEastern Ghats: Explained\nGadgil Report and Kasturirangan Report on Western Ghats\n\nArticle written by: Aseem Muhammed",

    "[CONTENT] #321": "What is Permafrost? What Is Permafrost Made Of? What are the consequences of Permafrost thawing? Read all about this\n\nThe primary cause of the 20,000-tonne oil leak at a Russian power station in the Arctic area is now recognized to have been the sinking ground surface caused by permafrost thawing.\n\nAlso, read about Cold deserts in India.\n\nTable of Contents\n\nWhat is Permafrost?\nWhat is Permafrost made of?\nPermafrost thawing\nCauses\nConsequences of Permafrost thawing\nWay forward\nConclusion\nWhat is Permafrost?\nPermafrost is any ground that remains completely frozen\u201432\u00b0F (0\u00b0C) or colder\u2014for at least two years straight.\nThe higher latitudes and elevations of Earth\u2014close to the North and South Poles\u2014are where these permanently frozen lands are most prevalent.\nAt lower latitudes, permafrost is found at high-altitude locations such as the Alps, the Tibetian plateau, South American Andes, the Rocky mountains etc.\nThe permafrost is believed to have formed during glacial periods dating several millennia.\nPermafrost covers a huge section of the planet. Over 25% of the area in the Northern Hemisphere is covered with permafrost.\nAlthough the surface layer that covers permafrost, known as the \u201cactive layer,\u201d is constantly frozen. The active layer freezes in the winter and thaws in the summer. Even in the summer, the ground in frigid areas rarely thaws. The active layer is barely 4 to 6 inches thick there (10 to 15 centimetres). The active layer can reach heights of several metres in permafrost regions that are warmer.\nIts thickness gradually decreases towards the south and is influenced by various additional elements, including the heat of the planet\u2019s interior, the amount of snow and vegetation, the presence of water bodies, and geography.\nWhat is Permafrost made of?\nIce holds together a mixture of soil, boulders, and sand to form permafrost. In permafrost, the soil and ice remain frozen throughout the year.\nNear the surface, permafrost soils are also rich in organic carbon, which is a by-product of dead plants that the cold prevented from decomposing or rotting away. Soils comprised primarily of minerals can be found in the lower permafrost layers.\nThe dead remains of plants, animals, and microbes that were frozen before they could decompose can be found in great quantities beneath the surface of permafrost. It also contains a vast collection of pathogens.\nPermafrost thawing\nPermafrost thawing means the ice inside the permafrost melts, leaving behind water and soil.\nPeat, the partially decomposed vegetation that accumulates in water-saturated conditions without oxygen, helps to preserve permafrost from the effects of climate change. Peat, which can cover or completely enclose the active layer or be frozen as permafrost, is a common substance throughout much of the low Arctic.\nCauses\nArctic warming: The pace of temperature change in the Arctic is currently the highest in the past 2,000 years, with the region rising twice as quickly as the rest of the planet. Temperatures in the Arctic permafrost were 3.5 degrees Celsius higher in 2016 than they were at the start of the 20th century.\nWildfires can peel back the peat and make permafrost more sensitive to climate change and hence leading to thawing.\nPositive feedback loop: It will speed up warming when permafrost releases its carbon as CO2 or methane, which will subsequently cause more permafrost to melt.\nConsequences of Permafrost thawing\nInfrastructure collapse: Many constructions are there on permafrost. Permafrost is more durable than concrete when it is frozen. Permafrost thawing, however, can ruin buildings, roads, and other infrastructure. Using the Thermal Power Plant of Norilsk-Taimyr Energy as an example, a fuel storage tank failed.\nAltered landscapes: As temperatures rise, the permafrost\u2019s binding ice melts, leaving the ground unstable and increasing the likelihood of significant landslides, floods, and potholes.\nEmission of Greenhouse gases: Microbes start breaking down this substance as the permafrost thaws. Methane and carbon dioxide are two greenhouse gases that are released during this process. Permafrost grounds could release greenhouse gases equivalent to 4-6 years\u2019 worth of coal, oil, and natural gas emissions for every 1 degree Celsius increase in average temperature, according to research, becoming a significant contributor to climate change in and of itself.\nRelease of microorganisms: Ancient bacteria and viruses present in the soil and ice also defrost when permafrost melts. Animals and humans could become seriously ill from these recently unfrozen microorganisms. In permafrost that has thawed, researchers have found bacteria that are more than 400,000 years old.\nBoth Arctic animals and indigenous people are in danger of thawing.\nWay forward\nReducing our carbon footprint.\nInvesting in energy-efficient products.\nSupporting climate-friendly businesses, legislation, and policies.\nConclusion\n\n\u00a0In comparison to the near eradication of permafrost under our current warming trajectory, 55 to 70% of the permafrost land area might be preserved if countries adhere to the Paris Agreement and keep the global average temperature to 1.5 to 20C over pre-industrial levels.\n\nArticle Written by: Remya",

Typically, a drainage divide is a ridge or a high platform.\n\nDifferent Drainage Pattern Types\n\nSeveral drainage patterns depend on the shape and creation of river patterns. It can be broadly divided into two types:\n\nDiscordant Drainage Pattern\nConcordant Drainage Pattern\n\nDiscordant Drainage Pattern\n\nIt has no relation to the local topography or geology. Despite topographic changes, the river in the discordant drainage pattern stays on its original course.\n\nThe discordant drainage pattern is further divided into Antecedent and the Superimposed drainage pattern.\n\nAntecedent Drainage (Discordant Drainage)\n\nIt is also known as inconsequential drainage. When a piece of a river slope and its surroundings are raised, the river maintains its previous slope while cutting through the uplifted area, creating deep gorges known as vertical erosion or vertical downcutting.\n\nRivers like the Indus, Sutlej, Brahmaputra, and other Himalayan rivers are examples of antecedent rivers or drainage.\n\nSuperimposed Drainage Pattern(Discordant Drainage)\n\nThe harder basal rocks appear unrelated to the tougher rock bed when a river flowing over a softer rock stratum reaches them while following the initial slope. The term \u201csuperimposed drainage\u201d refers to this sort of drainage.\n\nThe hardness and softness of the rock and the patterns of faults or fractures frequently have a significant impact on the drainage patterns (dendritic, trellis, etc.).\n\nHowever, on occasion, the land swiftly rises with the stream\u2019s initial level. Increasing the stream\u2019s gradient increases the erosive force of the stream.\n\nSome excellent examples of superimposed drainage may be seen in the rivers flowing at the Rewa Plateau, including the Damodar, Subarnarekha, Chambal, Banas, and others.\n\nConcordant Drainage Pattern\n\nIt is related to the local topology and geology. The slope of the river and the topography have a significant role in determining the course of the river in a concordant drainage pattern.\n\nThese drainage systems are the most prevalent and can be divided into two groups: Consequent drainage rivers and Subsequent drainage rivers.\n\nConsequent Drainage Rivers (Concordant Drainage)\n\nWhen the river flows generally in the direction of the slope, there is a consequent drainage system.\n\nPeninsular Indian rivers including the Godavari, Krishna, and Cauvery pour into the Bay of Bengal after descending from the Western Ghats. They are the examples of the consequent Drainage pattern.\n\nSubsequent River System (Concordant Drainage)\n\nStreams that are formed after the original stream (which is consequent rivers) are considered as the Subsequent River System.\n\nOnce the primary drainage pattern has been formed, it is a subsidiary stream that erodes along an underlying band of non-resistant rock.\n\nFor instance, the Yamuna and the Ganga are met at right angles by the drainage rivers Chambal, Sind, Ken, Betwa, Tons, and Son.\n\nDifferent Drainage Pattern Types\nDendritic Drainage Pattern\n\nThe most typical type is called a dendritic drainage pattern. It resembles tree roots\u2019 branching pattern.\n\nA dendritic pattern forms where the river channel follows the terrain\u2019s slope.\n\nThe pattern appears where there is no distinctive structure in the rock under the stream and where erosion is equally easy in all directions.\n\nE.g. The Indus, Ganga, and Brahmaputra rivers that flow through the northern plains.\n\nParallel Drainage Pattern\n\nIt grows in areas with elongated, parallel landforms and a sharp slope to the surface.\n\nIn general, tributary streams follow the slope of the surface by spreading out in a parallel-like pattern.\n\nLike the Godavari, Kaveri, Krishna, and Tungabhadra rivers, which have their source in the Western Ghats.\n\nRadial Drainage Pattern\n\nThe radial drainage pattern, which forms around a central high point, is typical of conically shaped objects like volcanoes.\n\nThe drainage pattern is referred to as \u201cradial\u201d when the rivers originate on a hill and flow in all directions.\n\nFor instance, the Narmada and Son rivers, flow from the Amarkantak range.\n\nThe pattern of Centripetal Drainage\n\nIt is the exact opposite of the radial as here streams move in the direction of a central depression.\n\nThese streams nourish ephemeral lakes throughout the rainier seasons of the year, but they vanish during the drier seasons.\n\nWhen salt dissolved in lakewater precipitates out of the solution and is left behind when the water evaporates, salt flats can also occasionally be formed in these dry lake beds.\n\nFor instance, Manipur\u2019s Loktak Lake.\n\nTrellis Drainage Pattern\n\nHard and soft rocks are parallel to one another in folded topography, where trellis drainage arises.\n\nSynclines, which are downturned folds, create valleys where the main channel of the stream is located.\n\nWhen secondary tributaries join principal tributaries of main rivers at right angles, a pattern similar to this is created.\n\nFor instance, the Indus, Ganga, and Brahmaputra rivers in the high Himalayan region.\n\nRectangular Drainage Pattern\n\nIn areas that have experienced faulting, the rectangular drainage pattern is present. It grows on rocky ground that is tightly connected.\n\nStreams cluster in areas where exposed rock is weakest because they take the path of least resistance. The tributary streams enter the mainstream at acute angles and create steep bends. E.g. streams in Chambal, ken, and betwa.\n\nBarbed Drainage Pattern\n\nIt is a drainage pattern in which the confluence of a tributary with the main river is indicated by a discordant junction, as if the tributary meant to flow upward rather than downstream.\n\nThis pattern develops when the main river is captured and changes its flow direction, while the tributaries continue to point in the previous flow direction.\n\nAn intriguing example of a barbed drainage system is the Arun River in Nepal, a tributary of the Kosi.\n\nAnnular Drainage Pattern\n\nThe radial streams develop further tributaries. These tributaries attempt to follow a circular drainage pattern around the top when the upland has an outer soft layer. In India, this drainage pattern is not particularly typical.\n\nFor instance, South Dakota\u2019s Black Hill streams\n\nDeranged Drainage Pattern\n\nThe rivers and lakes do not follow a logical pattern.\n\nThese patterns are developed when the previous drainage system is disturbed.\n\nFor instance, the glaciated valleys of the Karakoram.\n\nAngular Drainage Pattern\n\nThese patterns are created where the bedrock joints and faults connect at sharper angles.\n\nThis pattern is typical in the foothills of the Himalayas.\n\nArticle written by Chetna Yadav.",

According to how they begin, environmental hazards and associated natural disasters are divided into two groups:\nDisasters with a slow start, like drought or desertification, develop gradually, making it challenging to predict when they will start and stop. There is no single indicator or index that can accurately pinpoint the beginning and severity of the event; the duration might range from months to years. The effects are typically non-structural and challenging to measure.\nDrought occurrences, which can be categorised as meteorological, hydrological, or agricultural droughts, occur when there is insufficient water to meet the regular needs of agriculture, cattle, industry, or the human population.\nDesertification takes place on bigger time- and space scales. Additionally, because of their possible length of time, the focal point frequently changes over time, necessitating ongoing monitoring of climate and water supply indicators.\nRapid-onset disasters are defined by the impacts\u2019 suddenness and acute intensity over a brief period of time. The loss of lives and property caused by a specific disaster event is typically used to measure the severity of rapid-onset disasters. Rapid-onset catastrophes do not allow individuals enough time to reduce the danger of an event happening because of the way they start.\nThe Himalayan region is extremely vulnerable to rapid-onset hydrologic, meteorological, and geologic disasters because of its fragility, geo-tectonic features, and extraordinary susceptibility to climate change. Due to the area\u2019s remoteness and accessibility, it is difficult to respond in a timely manner, and the lack of a thorough understanding of its natural dynamics makes it difficult to take precautions or issue alerts or early warnings.\nGeo-physical Disasters: They come from events or natural earth processes. The term \u201cgeological hazard\u201d refers to both geomorphic processes such as mass movements like landslides, rockslides, rock falls, avalanches, the surface collapses, etc. as well as internal earth processes of tectonic origin, such as earthquakes, geological fault activity, tsunamis, and volcanic activity.\nThe mass movements occurring at a greater pace are more dangerous e.g. rock falls, which often occur without any warning.\nDrought frequency is rising due to global warming, which dries up water holes. The frequency of wildfires that change desert landscapes by destroying slow-growing trees and shrubs and replacing them with quickly-growing grasses may increase as temperatures rise.\nThe low adaptive capacity of the socio-ecological system.\nWay Forward\n\nIt can be challenging to try to stop desertification in some situations. Research and technological developments that push the boundaries of what we currently know is required under certain circumstances. We might discover more strategies to avert the devastation it brings about, thanks to advancements.\n\nThe worrying trend is the increase in desertification and expansion of both types of deserts. Natural causes for desert formation have been from times immemorial, it is the anthropogenic causes that are a cause of concern. The plan of action to combat desertification needs to be in line with the UN Convention to Combat Desertification (UNCCD).\n\nArticle Written by: Remya",

As a result, low pressure is created.\nOn the contrary, cooling results in contraction. As a result, the density rises and the pressure rises.\nExamples of thermal lows and highs are the formation of equatorial lows and polar highs, respectively.\n\nDynamic Elements:\n\nIn addition to temperature changes, the dynamic elements resulting from pressure gradient forces and earth rotation can be used to explain how pressure belts form Coriolis force.\nClassification\n\nBased on the mass-energy exchange mechanism between the earth and the atmosphere and within the atmosphere several sequential pressure belts can be classified from the equator toward the pole.\n\nThere are seven pressure belts on the surface of the world. There are the two Subtropical highs, the two Subpolar lows, the two Polar highs, and the Equatorial Low.\n\nEquatorial low-pressure belt\n\nIt is a thermally induced pressure belt created by almost vertical solar insolation throughout the year. It is found near the equator between 5 degrees north and south latitude.\n\nHigh range of insolation heating and extreme thermal conditions. Air parcels over the surface of the earth remain relatively warmer and up well from the surface in the form of convection currents to create low-pressure conditions over the surface.\nSince insulation heating and convection remained persistent and permanent phenomena over the equator, a vacuum type of atmospheric condition developed over the surface, called Doldrums.\n\nSignificance:\n\nContributes to the development of the Intertropical Convergence Zone (ITCZ), where trade winds converge and result in significant rainfall.\nPlays a crucial role in the Earth\u2019s heat redistribution by initiating the Hadley cell circulation.\nSubtropical high-pressure belt\n\nIt is a dynamically induced pressure belt developed over subtropical latitudes by regular subsidence of air masses originating from the equator. It is found around 30 degrees north and south latitudes.\n\nSubtropical latitudes are referred to symbolically as horse latitudes. It is because subsiding air parcels apply tremendous pressure over the earth\u2019s surface and wind drifts away from the surface to fill the low-pressure vacuum of the equator and sub-polar latitude.\nConsequently, a vacuum type of atmospheric conditions develops over the surface where the horizontal movement of air parcels remains very low.\n\nSignificance:\n\nLeads to the formation of subtropical deserts, such as the Sahara in Africa and the Sonoran in North America.\nInfluences the trade winds that blow towards the equator.\nSubpolar low-pressure belt\n\nIt is developed between 55 to 65 degrees northern and Southern hemispheres by several dynamic and thermal components. Relative low-pressure condition is acknowledged over the polar surface since they lie between two prominent high-pressure zones of sub-trophic and polar origin.\n\nAtmospheric conditions over subpolar latitude remain comparatively high to the Polar surface. Consequently, warm and comparatively like their forces of subpolar origin apply less pressure over the surface, creating a low-pressure condition\nCold and dense air masses initially meeting from polar high-pressure belts and advancing towards subpolar low-pressure vacuum also cover more surface area and the net pressure applied by them shall subsequently decrease.\n\nThe surface of some polar latitude always remains a converging zone of two contrasting air masses. Air masses originating from polar and subtropical high-pressure belts are distinct in their physical properties and implications.\n\nWhen these contrasting air masses converge with each other a transition zone or boundary known as a front develops between the distinct air masses and the boundary ultimately transforms into a zone of turbulence between the contrasting air masses.\nAlong the boundary of the front always a warm air mass up well or take up lifted from the surface chased by the high-pressure condition of a cold air parcel originating from a higher latitude.\nAs a result, both warm and cold air parcels get up and lifted from the surface and the next pressure applied by themselves subsequently be low.\n\nSignificance:\n\nContributes to the development of the polar front, a zone of weather systems and storms.\nInfluences the westerlies, the prevailing winds in the mid-latitudes.\nPolar high-pressure belt\n\nIt is again a thermally induced Pressure Belt characterized by almost incline and solar insolation, less insulation and heating, and subsidence of cold and denser air parcels.\n\nThis pressure belt system is an abstract representation. The Pressure belt placement is not fixed.\nAs they move between the Tropics of Cancer and Capricorn, they move northward in July and southward in January, following the shifting positions of the sun\u2019s direct rays. The belt of maximum temperature usually referred to as the thermal equator also moves north and south of the equator.\nThere is a shift in pressure belts to the north and south of their yearly average location along with the thermal equator\u2019s movement northward in summer and southward in winter.\nIntertropical Convergence Zone (ITCZ)\n\nA region near the equator where the trade winds converge.\n\nAssociated with low pressure and rising warm, moist air.\nExperiences intense convection and thunderstorm activity.\n\nSignificance:\n\nPlays a crucial role in the global water cycle and tropical weather patterns.\nAffects the distribution of rainfall and the development of monsoons.\nOverall Significance of Pressure Belts\nGlobal Wind Patterns:\u00a0Pressure belts influence the development of global wind patterns, including trade winds, westerlies, and polar easterlies.\nClimate Zones:\u00a0Pressure belts contribute to the establishment of major climate zones, such as tropical, subtropical, and polar climates.\nWeather Systems:\u00a0The interaction of pressure belts leads to the formation of weather systems, including cyclones, anticyclones, and monsoons.\nOcean Circulation:\u00a0Atmospheric circulation driven by pressure belts influences ocean currents, playing a role in the distribution of heat around the globe.\n\nUnderstanding pressure belts is fundamental to comprehending the Earth\u2019s atmospheric circulation and the resulting weather and climate patterns.

Kachchh was formerly a gulf. During the monsoons, the Kachchh region is separated into the Great Rann in the north and the Little Rann in the east by shallow water. Kathiawar, on the other hand, is located south of Kachchh.\n\nKonkan coast: It stretches from Goa in the south to Daman in the north. The two main crops in this area are cashews and rice.\n\nKannada coast: It stretches between Marmagaon and Mangalore and is known as the Kannada coast.\n\nMalabar coast: The comparatively broad Malabar coast stretches from Mangalore to Kanyakumari. Lagoons that run parallel to the coast are also part of this area in southern Kerala.\n\nIndian Eastern Coastal Plains\n\nThe eastern coastal plains pass through Andhra Pradesh and Odisha as they travel from West Bengal in the north to Tamil Nadu in the south. The eastern coastal plain contains the deltas of the Mahanadi, Krishna, Godavari, and Cauveri rivers.\n\nThe deltas are incredibly fertile and agriculturally productive. As a result, the River Krishna\u2019s delta is referred to as the \u201cGranary of South India.\u201d\n\nThree groups make up the Eastern coast\n\nUtkal coast: The Utkal coast is substantially wider than the western coastal plains and experiences a great deal of rainfall.

Usually, this is referred to as a moraine.\n\nAn unstable mound of debris and submerged ice has the potential to contain these lakes.\n\nThe majority of today\u2019s moraine-dammed lakes were created as mountain glaciers started to retreat from sizable moraines built during the Little Ice Age.\n\nIce-Dammed lakes\n\nIn contrast to lakes that have been dammed by moraines, lakes that have been blocked from draining by advancing or thicker glaciers are known as ice-dammed lakes.\n\nAnywhere a glacier obstructs the drainage of meltwater, lakes become ice-dammed.\n\nWhile ice-dammed GLOFs pose the greatest threat during times of glacier growth, moraine-dammed GLOFs typically pose the greatest threat during times of glacier retreat.\n\nTherefore, it is anticipated that as mountain glaciers continue to recede globally, the number of GLOFs dammed by moraines will rise.\n\nWhy does a glacier break?\n\nDue to Erosion.\nA rise in water pressure.\nAn avalanche of snow or rocks.\nAn earthquake under the ice.\nMassive water displacement in a glacial lake is caused by the collapse of a large portion of an adjacent glacier into it.\nSignificance of GLOFs\n\nOver 5,000 glacier lakes that are being held back by potentially unstable moraines have been slowly created by the Himalayan Mountains\u2019 ongoing glacier melt.\n\nThe GLOFs that result from such dam failures can have disastrous social and geomorphic effects.\n\nMany new glacial lakes, which are the main cause of GLOFs, have formed as a result of glacial retreat brought on by climate change that is present in the majority of the Hindu Kush Himalayas.\n\nTo know more about urban flooding click here.\n\nHow we can mitigate the impacts of GLOFs\nIn the wake of the disaster in Chamoli, the National Disaster Management Authority released guidelines on how to deal with disasters caused by GLOFs.\nThe guidelines state that risk reduction starts with the identification and mapping of glacial lakes, followed by the implementation of structural measures to prevent a breach and the development of reliable systems to protect people and property in the event of a breach.\nIdentification of potentially hazardous lakes \u2013 By using field observations, historical event records, the geotechnical and geomorphologic characteristics of the lake or dam, and the surroundings, it is possible to identify potentially dangerous lakes. And determining additional physical problems.\nUse of technology \u2013 During the monsoon season, Synthetic-Aperture radar imagery is used to automatically detect changes in water bodies, including the formation of new lakes. Allow remote monitoring of lake bodies from space.\nTo reduce the amount of water in lakes so that they can be managed structurally, the NDMA suggests techniques like controlled breaching, pumping or diverting out water, digging a tunnel through the moraine barrier, or beneath an ice dam.\nUniform codes for construction activity: Establishing a comprehensive framework for excavation, construction, and infrastructure development in vulnerable areas. In areas where GLOFs are likely to occur, land use planning procedures must be accepted.\nTraining local people\u2013 Since residents are often the first to respond to a disaster before trained rescue personnel, it is important to train them in search and rescue procedures.\nImprovement of early warning systems: Even on a global scale, there are very few GLOF EWS that have been implemented and are in operation. Three instances of the use of sensor and monitoring-based technical systems for GLOF early warning in the Himalayan region have been documented (two in Nepal and one in China).\n\nGLOFs now present a threat to infrastructure and communities downstream. In the Indus, Ganga, and Brahmaputra basins, there are, respectively, 352,283 and 1,393 glacial lakes and water bodies, according to a study funded by the Central Water Commission and conducted between 2011 and 2015.\n\nArticle Written by Remya",

According to the Indian Jute Mills Association (IJMA), there are about 93 jute mills in India.\n\nAt Rishira, 20 km north of Calcutta, the first jute mill/factory in India was founded in 1854. After gaining its independence, India experienced a setback because the majority of the jute-growing areas were still in Bangladesh and the jute factories were still located in India.\n\nThe jute textile industry has recently emerged as one of the key sectors serving East India, particularly West Bengal.\n\nAround 40 lakh agricultural families are supported by this business, which also directly employs 1.4 lakh people in the tertiary sector and 2.6 lakh people in the manufacturing sector.\n\n\ud83d\udc49 Which year are YOU targeting for success in the IAS/IPS/IFS Exam? \ud83d\ude80\n\n(1) \u21d2 UPSC 2025: Prelims cum Mains\n\n(2) \u21d2 UPSC 2026: Prelims cum Mains\n\n(3) \u21d2 UPSC 2027 Prelims cum Mains\n\nTip: Know more about ClearIAS Courses (Online/Offline)\n\nWhat are the steps involved in the cultivation of raw jute?\n\nThe production process in the jute industry involves several steps, including the processing of jute fibres, spinning, weaving, bleaching, dyeing, finishing, and selling of both the raw jute and its completed goods.\n\nAs a result, despite the industry\u2019s many challenges, its labour-to-output ratio is likewise high.\n\nKnow more about Major Crops and Cropping Patterns in Various Parts of the Country click here.\n\nChallenges/Concerns of Jute Industry in India\n\u00a0Because of the lack of modernization by the majority of jute mills and the availability of high-quality raw jute, the industry is now reliant on government assistance such as packaging reserves.\nOnly a section of the industry has diversified into non-packaging segments.\nThe majority of these industries continue to make venerable goods like jute sacking, hessian used as packing material, and to a lesser extent carpet backing.\nThe machines\u2019 efficiency falls short of expectations because they are made of extremely outdated, primitive technology.\nDue to frequent breakdowns, defective and inferior quality products are being made.\nInput cost is increasing day by day which is affecting its competitiveness.\nThe international export market is currently facing fierce competition from Bangladesh, Sri Lanka, Thailand, and China, which poses a danger to India. Despite India\u2019s proportion of global output gradually declining, its net export value is rising daily.\nThe jute business experiences significant losses as a result of various political meddling, labor issues, and a scarcity of jute fiber due to insufficient rainfall.\nAlternative Materials: The Indian subcontinent has a highly localized jute industry. To counteract India\u2019s monopoly over jute products, other nations were driven to develop jute alternatives due to their heavy reliance on India\u2019s irregular jute supply. Some of the nations built their jute mills in which Bangladesh supplied the raw material. Jute mills have been constructed in Japan, Korea, and the West European nations.\nGovernment Initiative to support Jute Industry in India\nJute Integrated Development Scheme (JIDS)\n\nThe JID Scheme intends to establish local agencies and units in remote areas of the nation by working with legitimate organizations to carry out various tasks.\n\nThe role of ID agencies is that of a facilitator, delivering Basic, Advanced, and Design Development training programs.\n\nThey also provide backward and forward links to the existing and potential entrepreneurs at the grass-roots level.\n\nAnd focusing primarily on technology application and design/product development and dissemination.\n\nJute Technology Mission (JTM)\n\nJute Technology Mission (JTM) was approved by the government of India in 2006 and it has 4 mini Missions.\n\n\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 MINI MISSION\n\t\n\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 ACTIVITY\n\t\nRELATED ORGANISATION\n\n\n\u00a0Mini Mission \u2013 I\n\t\nResearch activities on Jute\n\t\nICAR (DARE)\n\n\n\u00a0Mini Mission \u2013 II\n\t\nDevelopment/extension of raw jute agriculture\n\t\nMinistry of Agriculture(DAC), Govt. of India, State Govt.\n\n\n\u00a0Mini Mission \u2013 III\n\t\nMarketing of raw jute\n\t\nMinistry of Textiles Govt. of India\n\n\n\u00a0Mini Mission \u2013 IV\n\t\nProcessing, utilisation and industrial aspects of raw jute\n\t\nMinistry of Textiles, Govt. of India\n\nThe Jute Technology Mission (JTM) was executed during the XIth five-year Plan with an overall outlay of Rs. 355.56 crores.\n\nThe main objectives are:\n\nDevelop high-yielding varieties to improve productivity and acceptability in markets.\nImprove retting practices to get better quality fiber.\nTransfer of cost-effective technologies to the farmers.\nCreate strong market linkages.\nExpand the scope for the marketing of diversified jute products within the country and abroad.\nJute Raw Material Bank (JRMB) Scheme\nThe program\u2019s goal is to make domestically produced jute raw material affordable for small and independent business owners and artisans while also ensuring the long-term viability of the nation\u2019s decentralized JDP industry.\nJUTE \u2013ICARE (Jute: Improved Cultivation and Advanced Retting Exercise)\n\nThrough this program, farmers have been encouraged to grow jute by utilizing certified seeds, implementing scientific jute cultivation practices, and retting to produce quality jute, boost productivity, and lower the cost of jute production for jute farmers.\n\nThe Jute Foundation (TJF)\n\nTJF is trying to address many issues about the environment-friendly product.

However, the prospects to profit from Jute diversification strategies would remain slim without supporting initiatives of research-based commercialization supported by good government policies.\nSuggest norms of efficiency for the jute industry to eliminate waste, obtain optimum production, improve quality and reducing costs.\nTo advance the growth of jute and jute products, organize workshops, conferences, lectures, seminars, refresher courses, study groups, and training programs.\nEnsure higher pay, benefits, and incentives are in place for jute industry workers, as well as improved amenities.\nJute manufacturers must maintain and expand their current markets, as well as create new ones both inside and outside the nation. Marketing plans must be developed to meet this demand in both domestic and worldwide markets.\nProvide and create necessary infrastructural facilities and conditions conducive to the development of diversified jute products by way of assisting the entrepreneurs, artisans, craftsman, designers, manufacturers, exporters, non-Governmental agencies in the following manner, namely\nTransfer of technology from research and development institutions and other organizations in India and abroad;\nProviding support services to the entrepreneurs for the implementation of their projects including technical guidance and training;\nOrganizing entrepreneurial development programs;\nPlanning and executing market promotion strategies including exhibitions, demonstrations, media campaigns in India and abroad.\n\nThe Jute industry occupies an important place in the national economy of India. It is estimated that the jute industry provides direct employment to 0.37 million workers in organized mills and diversified units including tertiary sector and allied activities and support the livelihood of around 4.0 million farm families. Besides, there are a large number of persons engaged.\n\nJute products that are biodegradable and environmentally friendly have a very large global market. But the domestic jute market urgently needs to diversify.\n\nThe urgent requirement is to modernize, adopt new industry standards and technologies, and progress through time. Through proper policy changes, the government must assist the jute industry and increase its competitiveness.\n\nPrelims Facts\n\nJute is the crop of hot and humid climate.\nIt is Carbon neutral crop.\nAlso known as \u2018golden fibre\u2019, is one of the longest and most used natural fibre for various textile applications.\nIncessant and untimely rainfalls as well as prolonged droughts are detrimental to this crop.\nLarge quantity of water is required not only for growing the crop but also for processing the fibre after the crop is harvested.\nIt requires high temperature varying from 24 Degrees Celsius to 35 Degrees Celsius and heavy rainfall of 120-150 cm with 80-90% relative humidity during the period of its growth.\nThe cultivation of jute in India is mainly confined to the eastern region of the country. The jute crop is grown in seven states \u2013 West Bengal, Assam, Orissa, Bihar, Uttar Pradesh, Tripura and Meghalaya. West Bengal alone accounts for over 50% of the total raw jute production.\nJute is the 2nd abundant natural fibre in the World after Cotton. Almost 85% of world\u2019s jute cultivation is concentrated in the Ganges Delta.\nIndia is the World\u2019s biggest producer of Jute (raw jute and jute goods, contributing to over 50 percent and 40 percent respectively of global production), followed by Bangladesh.\n\nRead:\u00a0Golden fibre revolution\n\nArticle Written by: Remya",

It covers an area of over 500,000 square kilometres (200,000 square miles). It rises to 1000 m in the south but dips to 500 m in the north.\nThe Deccan Plateau is triangular in shape and is bounded by the Satpura and Vindhya mountain ranges to the north, the Western Ghats to the west, and the Bay of Bengal to the east.\u00a0\nThe average elevation of the plateau is 600 metres above sea level. The highest point is Doddabetta Peak in Tamil Nadu, which rises to 2637 metres.\nThe Deccan Plateau: Rivers\nIts general slope is from west to east which is indicated by the flow of its major rivers. Rivers have further subdivided this plateau into a number of smaller plateaus. The majority of the rivers on the Deccan plateau flow south.\nThe Godavari River, which flows southeast, the Krishna River, which splits the peninsula into two parts, and the Pennai Aaru River, which flows north, all drain the plateau.\nThe Godavari River and its tributaries, notably the Indravati River, drain much of the northern half of the plateau, beginning in the Western Ghats and going east to the Bay of Bengal.\nThe Tungabhadra River, Krishna River, and its tributaries, notably the Bhima River, drain the majority of the central plateau.\nThe Kaveri River rises in Karnataka\u2019s Western Ghats and bends south to break through the Nilgiri Hills at the island town of Shivanasamudra.\nThen flows into Tamil Nadu at Hogenakkal Falls before flowing into the Stanley Reservoir and the Mettur Dam that created the reservoir, and finally emptying into the Bay of Bengal, which drains the southernmost part of the plateau.\nMoist deciduous, dry deciduous, and tropical thorn woods cover the plateau.\nThe Deccan Plateau: Climate\nThe Deccan Plateau has a tropical climate. The summers are hot and dry, while the winters are milder and drier. The plateau experiences very little rainfall, averaging only about 600 millimetres (24 inches) per year.\nThe climate of the Deccan Plateau varies from tropical in the lower regions to temperate in the higher regions. The rainfall also varies from region to region, depending on the monsoon winds.\nThe driest areas include\u00a0Rayalaseema and Vidarbha. Rain falls from June through October during the monsoon season.\nThe months of March through June may be extremely dry and hot, with temperatures often topping 35 degrees Celsius.\nThe climate on the plateau is drier than on the beaches, and it can be dry in some areas.\nAlthough the term Deccan is frequently used to refer to all of India south of the Narmada River, it refers to a region in the northern half of the peninsula with rich volcanic soils and lava-covered plateaus between the Narmada and Krishna rivers.\nThe Deccan Plateau: Population\nThe Deccan Plateau has a population of over 200 million people. The majority of the population is Hindu, with sizable minority populations of Muslims and Christians. Telugu is the most widely spoken language on the plateau, followed by Marathi and Kannada.\nThe Deccan Plateau is home to a large number of Indian tribes and languages.\u00a0\nThe major tribes are the Gonds, Bhils, Kols, Santhals, and Munda.\nBhil and Gond people reside in the hills of the plateau\u2019s northern and northeastern boundaries, speaking languages from both the Indo-Aryan and Dravidian families.\nThe plateau\u2019s huge expanses of residual forest are still home to a variety of grazing species, including the four-horned antelope chinkara and blackbuck, as well as the gaur and wild water buffalo.\nThe plateau is home to a variety of animal species, including the Bengal tiger, Indian leopard, Asiatic elephant, and sloth bear.\u00a0\nThe Deccan Plateau: Economy\nThe Deccan Plateau is home to many industries, including mining, steel production, textiles, and chemicals. Agriculture is also an important part of the economy, with crops such as cereals, oilseeds and pulses (legumes) being grown on the plateau.\nThe Deccan Plateau is rich in mineral resources. Coal, iron ore, manganese, mica, bauxite, copper, limestone, and chromite are found in abundance here.\nAgriculture is the main occupation of the people living on the plateau.\nCotton textiles, sugar, foodstuffs, tobacco, paper, machine tools, and medicines are produced at industries located in Hyderabad, Warangal, and Kurnool.\nForest-based cottage businesses (timber, firewood, charcoal, bamboo goods) and mineral-based cottage industries (asbestos, coal, chromite, iron ore, mica, and kyanite).\nLivestock rearing is also an important economic activity.\nThe Deccan Plateau: Tourism\nThe Deccan Plateau has a rich cultural heritage.\nThe Deccan Plateau is home to several historical sites, including the Ajanta and Ellora caves, as well as the temples at Hampi.\nThe city of Hyderabad is also a popular tourist destination, with its Charminar monument and Hussain Sagar Lake.\nEcological structure of the Deccan Plateau:\n\nThe general meaning of geologic structure is the study of the distribution and types of rock on the surface and inside the surface. Geogolicaly structurally, the Deccan plateau can be divided into the following parts.\n\nArchaean Rock (4.5 Billion to 2.5 Billion years)\nArchaean rocks are first formed on the earth and it is the oldest rock and has no sign of fossil.\nArchean rocks are found in Kerala, Tamil Nadu, Andhra Pradesh, and Telangana.\nDharwar Rocks (2.5 Billion to 1.8 Billion years)\nIt is the earliest sedimentary rock.\nIt is mainly found in Karnataka in the Deccan plateau.\nThe presence of Dharwar rocks is also present in Madhya Pradesh, Jharkhand, Aravali, and Meghalaya.\nCuddapha Rocks (1.8 Billion to 540 million years)\n\nIt is mainly found in the Nallamalai hills of Andhra Pradesh and Telangana.\n\nGondwana Rocks (400 Million to 200 Million years)\nAbout 98 % of Indian rocks are found in Gondwana rocks.\nIt spreads in the Mahanadi and Godawari regions of the Deccan plateau.\nIt is also found in Chhotanagpur and Meghalaya plateau.\nDeccan Trap (80 to 66 Million years)\nIt is a basaltic volcanic origin.\nIt spreads in Maharashtra, Gujarat, Madhya Pradesh, Karnataka, and Telangana.\nRead more about the Deccan trap here.\nSignificance of Deccan Plateau:\nMinerals and precious stones abound on the Deccan level.\nNumerous marsh kings, especially those of the Mauryan (fourth second century BCE) and Gupta (fourth sixth century CE), fought for the level\u2019s mineral wealth.\nCoal, iron metal, asbestos, chromite, mica, and kyanite are among the significant minerals identified here.\nLow precipitation made agriculture difficult until the water system was introduced. At the moment, the zone under development is quite low, ranging from 60% in Maharashtra to roughly 10% in the Western Ghats.\nRice is the most important crop in high-precipitation areas, whereas sorghum is the most important crop in low-precipitation areas.\nCotton, tobacco, oilseeds, and sugar sticks are examples of massive crops.\nEspresso, tea, coconuts, areca, pepper, elastic, cashew nuts, custard, and cardamom are all widely grown on ranches in the Nilgiri Hills and the Western Ghats.\n\nArticle written by: Aseem Muhammed",

(Geo means \u201cearth,\u201d and thermal means \u201cheat\u201d in Greek.) It is a renewable resource that can be harvested for human use.\n\nGeothermal power is electrical power generated from geothermal energy. Technologies in use include dry steam power stations, flash steam power stations and binary cycle power stations. Geothermal energy is derived from a clean source, is dependable, and is unaffected by swings in fuel prices, allowing more financial resources to be given to economic development\n\nIt is found in the rocks and fluids beneath the earth\u2019s crust, down to the boiling molten rock, magma.\n\n\ud83d\udc49 Which year are YOU targeting for success in the IAS/IPS/IFS Exam? \ud83d\ude80\n\n(1) \u21d2 UPSC 2025: Prelims cum Mains\n\n(2) \u21d2 UPSC 2026: Prelims cum Mains\n\n(3) \u21d2 UPSC 2027 Prelims cum Mains\n\nTip: Know more about ClearIAS Courses (Online/Offline)\n\nWells are excavated a mile down into underground reservoirs to obtain the steam and hot water, which may then be used to operate turbines attached to electricity generators.\n\nTable of Contents\n\nThe global trend in geothermal energy\nIndia\u2019s geothermal energy potential\nExtraction of Geothermal Heat Resources\nHydrothermal Heat source\nDeep\u00a0Geothermal System\nPower Produced by Geothermal Energy\nBenefits of geothermal energy\nDemerits\nGovernment initiatives\nDraft Geothermal Energy National Policy\nIndia\u2019s geothermal energy development framework\nConclusion\nThe global trend in geothermal energy\n\nGeothermal energy, first employed in Italy in 1904, has been a stable and expanding source of energy in recent years.\n\nOver 20 countries use geothermal energy.\n\nThe United States is the world\u2019s greatest generator of geothermal energy and is home to the world\u2019s largest geothermal field.\n\nIndonesia has 40% of the world\u2019s geothermal energy resources as the country has 130 active volcanoes and is a hub of tectonic plate movement.\n\nIndia\u2019s geothermal energy potential\n\nIndia includes seven geothermal provinces and around 340 geothermal springs.\n\nAccording to the Ministry of New and Renewable Energy, geothermal resources in India have been mapped, and a general estimate estimates that there could be a 10 gigatonne (GW) geothermal power potential (MNRE).\n\nTectonic factors mostly determine the occurrence of geothermal resources in India.\n\nThe primary zone of geothermal resources extends from Puga in Ladakh to Manikaran in Himachal Pradesh and Takshing in Arunachal Pradesh.\n\nThe development of geothermal resources in India was languishing due to a lack of appropriate machinery and a lack of incentives.\n\nExtraction of Geothermal Heat Resources\nHydrothermal Heat source\n\nWater conducts heat to the surface and is recharged into the earth by rain or surface bodies (such as rivers, lakes, or glaciers) before being heated by underlying hot rock caused by seismic or volcanic activity.\n\nThe presence of hot springs in Iceland, the Himalayas, and the Alps demonstrates this.\n\nThe area\u2019s lithology must be porous in order for water to flow freely, both to replenish the system and to deliver hot water to the surface.\n\nDeep\u00a0Geothermal System\n\nDeep Geothermal systems, in which a deep borehole is excavated to reach the hot basal rock, and water is injected into the holes to produce steam\n\nThis way of resource extraction is utilised to power a turbine.\n\nThis method is rarely utilised since accessing the deep basal rock substrate is expensive.\n\nPower Produced by Geothermal Energy\n\nIn geothermal power plants, steam is used to generate electricity.\n\nHot water reservoirs a few miles or more beneath the earth\u2019s surface produce steam.\n\nThe steam turns a turbine, which turns a generator, which produces electricity.\n\nGeothermal power plants are classified into dry steam, flash steam, and binary steam.\n\nDry Steam \u2013 Dry steam power plants extract subterranean steam. Steam is delivered directly into a turbine/generator unit from subterranean wells.\nFlash Steam \u2013 The most popular type of power plant uses geothermal reservoirs of water with temperatures above 360\u00b0F (182\u00b0C). This boiling water rises via wells in the ground under its own pressure. As it goes upward, the pressure falls, and some hot water condenses into steam. The steam is utilised to power a turbine/generator after it has been extracted from the water. Any remaining water and condensed steam are injected back into the reservoir, ensuring the resource\u2019s long-term viability.\nBinary Steam \u2013 Binary cycle power plants operate at lower temperatures ranging from 225 to 360\u00b0F (107 to 182\u00b0C) and use water as fuel. The heat from the hot water is utilised to boil a working fluid, which is typically a low boiling point organic chemical. The working fluid of a heat exchanger is evaporated and used to turn a turbine. The water is then injected back into the earth to be warmed.\u00a0 There are minimal or no air emissions since the water and working fluid are maintained separate throughout the operation.\n\nBenefits of geothermal energy\nIt is cleaner fuel as it emits only one-sixth of the CO2 that a natural gas plant does.\nThe ongoing flow of heat from the Earth makes it infinite and inexhaustible making it a renewable resource\nIt is the only renewable energy available to mankind 24 hours a day, seven days a week that does not require storage and is unaffected by day-night or seasonal variations.\nGiven the need to replace coal-based electricity with alternative energy sources, it is critical in\u00a0 creating new energy sources such as geothermal energy.\nDepending on geothermal properties and local geographical conditions, geothermal energy can be used as a primary power source as well as a substitute for electricity as a source of heat.\nIt is a site-specific renewable energy source that is ideal for meeting the energy needs of remote/interior communities.\nGeothermal heat pump systems use 25% to 50% less electricity than conventional systems for heating or cooling and take up less space for gear.\nMineral byproducts from hot springs, such as silica, borax, and caesium, could be used.\nDemerits\nDespite producing little CO2, geothermal has been linked to other pollutants such as sulphur dioxide and hydrogen sulphide.\nInfluences the landscape. Geothermal generating facilities, influence the landscape and causes fractures and minor earthquakes in the areas where they operate.\nIt has a high initial cost to build in a specific location.\nBecause of its activity along the earth\u2019s tectonic plates, it is also referred to as \u201cthe most location-specific energy source known to man.\u201d\nGovernment initiatives\nDraft Geothermal Energy National Policy\nThe scheme\u2019s objective is to establish India as a global leader in geothermal power by deploying 1000 MWth of geothermal energy capacity in the first phase until 2022.\nThe initiative would examine the country\u2019s geothermal resource potential and promote R&D projects for power generation and geo-exchange pumps.\nIndia\u2019s geothermal energy development framework\nIt targets capturing 1,000 MW of geothermal energy by 2022 and 10,000 MW by 2030.\nIt intends to significantly contribute to India\u2019s long-term energy supply and reduce our national greenhouse gas emissions by building a socially and environmentally responsible geothermal energy business that is sustainable, safe, and secure.\nIt aims to encourage international collaboration with world leaders in geothermal energy such as the United States, the Philippines, Indonesia, Mexico, and New Zealand in order to accelerate geothermal energy deployment through international investment promotion, customised capacity building, and technical assistance.\nConclusion\n\nAs geothermal discovery is capital-intensive, financial incentives may be announced to encourage geothermal resource exploration.\n\nExploration funding will encourage exploration agencies to pursue geothermal energy projects for power generation and direct heat usage. It will also attract private investors for geothermal energy development. Foreign financing and knowledge transfer, as well as appropriate financial incentives, may be promoted to attract private parties to develop geothermal energy in India.\n\nSo far, research in India has been primarily superficial, leaving a data void for power project design. It is critical in decoding the characteristics of deep reservoirs, which will be valuable in determining the feasibility of resources for power generation.\n\nIf there is strong international cooperation and support from wealthier countries, geothermal energy can help underdeveloped countries tackle climate change while simultaneously boosting living standards.\n\nArticle Written By:\u00a0 Atheena\u00a0 Fathima Riyas\n\n\u00a0",

La Ni\u00f1a is also sometimes called El Viejo, anti-El Ni\u00f1o, or simply \u201ca cold event.\u201d\n\nLa Nina has the opposite effect of El Ni\u00f1o.\n\nDuring La Nina events, trade winds are even stronger than usual, pushing more warm water toward Asia. Off the west coast of the Americas, upwelling increases, bringing cold, nutrient-rich water to the surface.\n\nThese cold waters in the Pacific push the jet stream northward.\n\nThis tends to lead to drought in the southern U.S. and heavy rains and flooding in the Pacific Northwest and Canada.\nDuring a La Nina year, winter temperatures are warmer than normal in the South and cooler than normal in the North.\nLa Ni\u00f1a can also lead to a\u00a0more severe hurricane season.\n\nDuring La Ni\u00f1a, waters off the Pacific coast are colder and contain more nutrients than usual.\n\nThis environment supports more marine life and attracts more cold-water species, like squid and salmon, to places like the California coast.\n\nA neutral state is when neither El Nino nor La Nina is present. During this time the sea surface temperatures in the tropical Pacific are close to average.\n\nMonitoring El Nino-La Nina Phenomenon\nCourtesy: NOAA\n\nThere are several methods used to predict developments in the Pacific Ocean. Complex dynamical models predict how the tropical Pacific Ocean will change from its current condition.\n\nSome of the precursors to such developments can also be captured by statistical forecasting models.\nAdditional value is added by expert analysis of the current situation, particularly when evaluating the consequences of the changing condition below the ocean\u2019s surface.\nThe consequences of ocean-atmosphere interactions within the climate system are taken into account by all forecasting techniques.\nThe meteorological and oceanographic data that allow El Nino and La Nina episodes to be monitored and forecasted are drawn from national and international observing systems.\n\nThe exchange and processing of the data are carried out under programs coordinated by the World Meteorological Organization (WMO).\n\nThe International Research Institute for Climate and Society (IRI) and WMO work together to produce the WMO El Nino/La Nina Update on a semi-regular basis (about every three months) as a contribution to the United Nations Inter-Agency Task Force on Natural Disaster Reduction.\nIt is based on contributions from top global monitoring and forecasting centers and an expert consensus that WMO and IRI helped to create.\nImpact of El Nino-La Nina on different parts of the world\n\nEl Nino:\n\nOcean temperatures, speed, and power of ocean currents are impacted.\nThe coastal fisheries and local weather of Australia to South America are affected.\nRainfall increases drastically in South America, contributing to coastal flooding and erosion. But causes droughts in Indonesia and Australia.\nEl Nino-related flooding is associated with increases in cholera, dengue, and malaria in some parts of the world, while drought can lead to wildfires that create respiratory problems.\nIt decreases the occurrences of hurricanes in the Atlantic.\nUpwelling on the coasts of Ecuador, Peru, and Chile.\nWeaker monsoons and sometimes drought in India and Southeast Asia.\n\nLa Nina:\n\nMilder winters in northern Europe and colder winters in southern and western Europe around the Mediterranean region.\nIn North America, it causes stronger winds along the equatorial region, hurricanes in the Caribbean and central Atlantic, and more tornados in the US.\nDrought in South America especially in Peru and Ecuador.\nIncreased rainfall in the western pacific eventually affected continental Asia and China.\nHeavy floods in Australia.\nIncreased temperatures in the western Pacific, Indian Ocean, and Somalia coasts.\nColder winters in India as it pipes strong cold air from Siberia and forms a north-south low-pressure system.\nLesser impact of western disturbances.\nIndian Ocean Dipole (IOD) and ENSO\n\nIt was observed that a positive IOD index often negated the effect of ENSO, resulting in increased Monsoon rains in several ENSO years like 1983, 1994, and 1997.\n\nIndian Ocean Dipole is a varying ocean-atmosphere system in the Indian Ocean like ENSO in the Pacific Ocean.\n\nThe Indian Ocean Dipole (IOD) is defined by the\u00a0difference in sea surface temperature between two areas\u00a0(or poles, hence a dipole), a western pole in the\u00a0Arabian Sea (western Indian Ocean), and an eastern pole in the\u00a0eastern Indian Ocean\u00a0south of Indonesia.\nIOD develops in the equatorial region of the Indian Ocean from April to May peaking in October.\nWith favorable IOD winds over the Indian Ocean blow from east to west (from the Bay of Bengal towards the Arabian Sea). This results in the Arabian Sea (the western Indian Ocean near African Coast) being much warmer and the eastern Indian Ocean around Indonesia becoming colder and dry.\nIn the negative dipole year (negative IOD), the reverse happens to make Indonesia much warmer with increased rainfall.\nPrevious ENSO events\n\nEl Nino:\n\n1982-83 and 1997-98 were very intense events of the 20th century.\n1997-98 was the first scientifically monitored full event.\nThe \u201cyear without a winter\u201d was a time when temperatures in the Midwest broke records for warmth.\n\nLa Nina:\n\nThe 2010 La Nina event correlates with one of the worst floods in the history of Queensland, Australia.\n\n-Article written by Swathi Satish",

Are you aware of Atlantic meridional overturning circulation? Read further to know more.\n\nThe extensive, interconnected network of water currents in the oceans is known as ocean circulation.\n\nIt includes both surface and deep currents.\n\nAtlantic meridional overturning circulation (AMOC) is one such example of ocean circulation.\n\nTable of Contents\n\nWhat is Atlantic Meridional Overturning Circulation (AMOC)?\nWhat is thermohaline circulation?\nWorking of Atlantic Meridional Overturning Circulation\nSignificance of AMOC\nIs the AMOC slowing down?\nConsequences of a slowing AMOC?\nImpact of the Indian Ocean\nWhat is Atlantic Meridional Overturning Circulation (AMOC)?\n\nThe Atlantic Meridional Overturning Circulation (AMOC) is a major ocean current system that transports warm surface waters from the tropics toward the northern Atlantic and colder deep waters that are part of the\u00a0thermohaline circulation, southward. One of the main ways the ocean circulates heat, salt, carbon, and nutrients throughout the world\u2019s oceans is through overturning circulation.\n\nNow you might be wondering what is thermohaline circulation. Let us quickly look into it and come back to AMOC.\n\nWhat is thermohaline circulation?\n\nThe thermohaline circulation, also known as the ocean\u2019s conveyor belt, is part of the ocean circulation and is powered by temperature and salinity differences causing density differences. These are deep ocean currents occurring thousands of meters below the sea surface.\n\n\ud83d\udc49 Which year are YOU targeting for success in the IAS/IPS/IFS Exam? \ud83d\ude80\n\n(1) \u21d2 UPSC 2025: Prelims cum Mains\n\n(2) \u21d2 UPSC 2026: Prelims cum Mains\n\n(3) \u21d2 UPSC 2027 Prelims cum Mains\n\nTip: Know more about ClearIAS Courses (Online/Offline)\n\nIt leads to intermixing of salt and heat. Thus, it effectively describes a driving mechanism.\n\nNow let us come back to Atlantic meridional overturning circulation. We shall discuss in detail the working of AMOC.\n\nWorking of Atlantic Meridional Overturning Circulation\nThe Atlantic Ocean\u2019s warm water cools as it travels north, and evaporation raises its salt content.\nThe water sinks deep into the ocean due to its increased density brought on by a combination of a low temperature and a high salt content.\nDeep below, the chilly, dense water steadily moves southward.\nIt eventually returns to the surface, warms up once more, and the circulation is complete.\n\nSignificance of AMOC\nAMOC helps to disperse heat and energy throughout the earth (heat budget).\nBecause of AMOC, the climate in Western Europe is less severe even during the winter (Gulf Stream, North Atlantic Drift).\nBy absorbing and storing carbon from the atmosphere, it serves as a carbon sink.\nCarbon sequestration by AMOC has profound effects on how anthropogenic global warming develops.\nThe distribution of heat to the polar regions is largely dependent on thermohaline circulation. As a result, it impacts how quickly sea ice forms at the poles, which in turn affects other components of the climate system (such as the albedo, and thus solar heating, at high latitudes)\nIs the AMOC slowing down?\n\nAccording to the\u00a0IPCC\u2019s Report\u00a0(AR6), it is very likely that AMOC will decline over the 21st century.\n\nThis is due to the fact that as the atmosphere heats, the surface ocean below it holds onto more heat. Meanwhile, the ocean\u00a0gets fresher due to increases in rainfall and ice melt. All of these modifications lighten the ocean water, which lessens the sinking in the \u201cconveyor belt\u201d.\n\nThis results in a weaker AMOC. The AMOC will therefore most certainly diminish. But it is quite improbable that it would undergo the kind of huge, abrupt shifts in the 21st century as have been\u00a0observed in the past.\n\nConsequences of a slowing AMOC?\n\nSlowing down of the AMOC would have the following consequences:\n\nFurther decline in marine productivity in the North Atlantic (less sinking will result in less mixing of water)\nAn increase in regional sea level along the northeast coast of North America\nMore storms in Northern Europe\nA decrease in Sahelian summer rainfall\nDecrease in South Asian summer rainfall.\nImpact of the Indian Ocean\n\nOne of the footprints of global warming is the Indian Ocean. The Indian Ocean produces more precipitation as it warms up more quickly. More air, particularly air from the Atlantic, is drawn to the Indian Ocean as a result.\n\nThere will be less precipitation in the Atlantic Ocean due to the Indian Ocean receiving so much precipitation. Higher salinity in the tropical Atlantic Ocean waters will result from less precipitation.\n\nAs it travels north through the AMOC, this saltier water will cool considerably more quickly than usual and sink more quickly. However, it\u2019s unclear how long the Indian Ocean\u2019s increased heat will last, according to scientists.\n\nThe advantage for AMOC will end if warming in other tropical oceans, particularly the Pacific, catches up with that in the Indian Ocean.\n\nArticle written by: Caroline Abraham",

    "[CONTENT] #360": "The geography of India is extremely diverse, with landscapes ranging from snow-capped mountain ranges to deserts, plains, hills and plateaus. In the southern part of Peninsular India, there is a flood basalt province named the Deccan traps. Read more about the Deccan traps here.\n\nThe name Deccan is derived from the Sanskrit word \u2018d\u00e2kshin\u2019, meaning \u201csouth.\u201d\n\nThe west-central parts of the Indian peninsula are dominated by flood basalts which form a prominent terraced landscape.\n\nFlood Basalt volcanoes out-pour highly fluid lava that flows for long distances to form larger flood basalt province\n\nTable of Contents\n\nWhat are Deccan Traps?\nDistribution of Deccan Traps:\nHow are Deccan traps formed?\nCharacteristics of Deccan Trap:\nPetrology of Deccan Traps:\nClassification of Deccan Traps:\nLife of Deccan Traps:\nAge of Deccan Traps:\nBlack Soil/ Regur Soil/ Cotton Soil:\nDistribution of Black Soil:\nCharacteristics of Black Soil:\nContents of Black Soil:\nWhat are Deccan Traps?\n\nA thick succession of (3200 metres) late Cretaceous basaltic lava flows known as the Deccan Traps covers around 500 000 square kilometres of peninsular India. This basaltic lava soil has gradually eroded due to erosion, resulting in the formation of a Deccan trap.\n\nThe Deccan Traps is an area of black dirt on the Peninsular Plateau. The rocks are igneous and have volcanic origins. Black dirt has been produced as a result of the erosion of these rocks over time.\n\n\ud83d\udc49 Which year are YOU targeting for success in the IAS/IPS/IFS Exam? \ud83d\ude80\n\n(1) \u21d2 UPSC 2025: Prelims cum Mains\n\n(2) \u21d2 UPSC 2026: Prelims cum Mains\n\n(3) \u21d2 UPSC 2027 Prelims cum Mains\n\nTip: Know more about ClearIAS Courses (Online/Offline)\n\nDistribution of Deccan Traps:\n\nThe majority of these volcanic rocks are found in Gujarat\u2019s Kutch and Kathiawar regions, as well as in Andhra Pradesh, Madhya Pradesh, and Maharashtra.\n\nIts thickness varies depending on whether the surface is flat or sloppy, being midway between deep and shallow.\n\nThese (the Deccan Traps) might be considered Peninsular India\u2019s most widespread geological formations after the Archean Rocks.\n\nHow are Deccan traps formed?\n\nCretaceous vulcanicity, the development of many linear cracks in the earth\u2019s crust, is what causes the formation of decan traps. This eruption did not produce any volcanic domes since it was of the quiet kind.\n\nThis incident started 66.25 million years ago (End of the Cretaceous period) when India was near present placed Madagascar and during its movement north, it passed over Reunion Hotspot. Presently this hotspot is dormant in nature.\n\nFrom a general study of the Deccan Traps, the following broad conclusions can be drawn about their mode of eruption:\n\n(a) They erupted in a sub-aerial environment. Their relationship with the older rocks suggests this.\n\n(b) Eruptions of the lava took place along linear fissures, forming fissure-type of eruptions and not from any central cone-type volcanoes. This is explained by numerous flows and their remarkably consistent horizontal attitude.\n\n(c) The lava when erupted was in a highly liquid form, which is indicated by the long distances over which the individual flows could spread. This fact also suggests that the lava might have been super-heated to reach that state of mobility.\n\n(d) A large number of dykes that have been found occurring intersecting many lava flows might be quite younger than those flows, but some such dykes might have also been the feeder dykes for the volcanic eruptions.\n\n(e) The lava flows, especially after the beginning and before the close of the activity, passed through definite periods of no volcanic activity. During such periods streams and lakes appeared on the cooled and congealed volcanic landforms here and there and both animal and plant life domiciled these areas. This is indicated by the occurrence of inter-trappean layers found in the lower and upper flows and their fossil contents.\n\nCharacteristics of Deccan Trap:\nIt is frequently referred to as regur soil or black dirt. Due to their high clay content.\nthey get sticky when wet and are therefore challenging to plough.\nThey develop in semi-arid regions that are coated with basalt.\nThe soil is almost devoid of humus and is black due to the presence of titanium salt in the lava land that makes up the Deccan trap. They have a lot of lime in them.\nParticularly in the lowlands and river valleys where it is deep and clayey, the soil holds moisture well and is extremely productive.\nThe construction of traps is very constant and regular; they are layered and the strata are practically horizontal everywhere, with an average dip (angle of inclination) of 5\u00b0\u201310\u00b0. This is similar to a homogenous mineralogical and chemical composition.\nThe thickness of the individual strata, known as lava flows, can range from 3 metres to 30 metres or even more.\nThe area of the flows is frequently much larger than the layer thickness, sometimes even reaching 100 km.\nThe Inter-Trappean Beds, which are non-volcanic sedimentary levels, frequently interrupt the consecutive flows. These show deposits in rivers and lakes with shallow water that developed during the lulls in the age\u2019s volcanic activity.\nThere are several excellent fossils of animals and plants that may have survived during those times when there was no volcanic activity to be found in the inter-trappean strata. The age of the Traps has been interpreted using these fossils.\nPetrology of Deccan Traps:\n\nThe most significant rock in the Deccan Trap is augite-basalt basalt, which has a greyish-green colour. Vesicular and amygdaloidal textures are frequently seen. There have also been discoveries of intrusions formed by basic volcanic rocks like gabbro and limburgite as well as acidic volcanic rocks like rhyolites and granophyres in places like Kutch and Bombay.\n\nTrap basalts are shown by microscopic investigation to be fine-grained basalts that are surprisingly devoid of olivine. While calcite, quartz, glauconite, etc. are some of the typical accessory minerals that frequently fill the voids in the original basalts, augite and felspars are the principal ingredients.\n\nClassification of Deccan Traps:\n\nThe Traps have been classified into three groups namely, Upper Traps, Middle Traps and Lower Traps.\n\nLife of Deccan Traps:\n\nIn the lower and upper divisions of the Traps, fossilised remains of several animals and plants have been discovered in the inter-trappean deposits.\n\nThe primary constituents of the Inter-Trappean beds include eroded volcanic debris, clay, impure limestones, and other related materials. Many locations in Gujarat, Madhya Pradesh, and Maharashtra have investigated these beds.\n\nThe inter-trappean beds, which are composed of dark-shaded shales, may be found in fine arts in the Malabar Hills of Bombay.\n\nCerithium, Potamides, Hydraspis, Rana, and Paudina, all of which are freshwater or estuary environment species, are among the fossils produced by Inter-trappean deposits. From Deccan Traps, no marine life fossils have been found.\n\nAge of Deccan Traps:\n\nOn the precise geological age of the Deccan Traps, there is still no widespread consensus. There have been two potential placements.\n\nThe Deccan Traps should be compared to the Danian Stage of the Upper Cretaceous based on stratigraphic data. The second theory, which mostly relies on fossil data, contends that a Lower Eocene age is more acceptable.\n\nThe discovery of certain typical fish and palm fossils from the Tertiary system lends weight to this. However, it can be generally concluded that the activity that led to the deposition of the Deccan Traps began somewhere in the Upper Cretaceous and continued through the era change right up until and even into the Lower Eocene period of Tertiary times, given the enormous thickness of the Traps (more than 2000 m at some locations).\n\nBlack Soil/ Regur Soil/ Cotton Soil:\n\nBlack Soil, commonly referred to as \u201cRegur Soil,\u201d is dark soil. It is also known as \u201ccotton soil\u201d since it is ideal for producing cotton.\n\nThese lava flow-derived soils, which cover the north-western Deccan plateau and are most typical of the Deccan trap (Basalt) area, are widespread.\n\nBlack soil is thought to have formed as a result of a combination of environmental causes and parent rock composition.\n\nDistribution of Black Soil:\n\nParticularly in the locations where basalt is present, black soil grows in semi-arid environments. They extend eastward in the south along the Godavari River and Krishna River Valleys, covering the plateaus of Maharashtra, Saurashtra, Malwa, and southern Madhya Pradesh.\n\nUnder the necessary semi-arid climatic conditions, granites and gneisses with iron content also generate black soil in Tamil Nadu\u2019s southern area.\n\nThe districts of Surat and Bharuch, as well as the Narmada Valley and Tapti Valley, all produce black soil.\nThe soil in these areas has essentially little humus, and the black colour of the soil is caused by the presence of certain salts. Black soils are often thin, deficient, and sandy in the mountainous portion of the nation.\n\nCharacteristics of Black Soil:\n\nBlack soils are very sensitive. Due to their high clay content, black soils become sticky when wet and are therefore challenging to plough. They have a reputation for holding onto moisture. In the field, the heat causes thick cracks to form. This aids in their ventilation, which accounts for their dominance in self-ploughing. After the initial or pre-monsoon rainfall, this soil becomes sticky and impossible to work unless it is immediately tilled.\n\nContents of Black Soil:\n\nLime is abundant in black soils and Regur soils. In nature, it is rich soil made up of a combination of sand, clay, and organic components. Additionally, this soil is quite productive and moisture-retentive, especially on the plains and in river valleys where it is deep and clayey.\n\nAdditionally, they are rich in soil nutrients including potash, calcium carbonate, and magnesium carbonate. However, the Black or Regur soil does not contain enough nitrogen, which is thought to be important for plant development.\n\nThe soil in the Deccan Trap is nearly devoid of humus and exhibits a dark black hue as a result of the presence of titanium salt. They contain a lot of lime.\n\nThe lowlands and river valleys, where the soil is deep and clayey, as well as the slopes and high hills, have exceptionally fertile soil that retains moisture well. These soils are often poor, thin, and sandy. These soils are deficient in phosphorus, potassium, and nitrogen, all of which are crucial for the establishment of dense plants and grain crops, respectively.\n\nArticle written by: Aseem Muhammed",

Read here to know in detail about the Rossby waves.\n\nCarl-Gustaf Arvid Rossby, an American meteorologist of Swedish descent, made the initial discovery of Rossby waves in 1939.\n\nAccording to scientists, Rossby waves are a naturally occurring phenomenon like La Ni\u00f1a and El Ni\u00f1o. These waves have been responsible for some extreme weather events in recent times.\n\nIn recent years, many changes and extreme weather events have been observed all over the globe-\n\nExtreme floods are devastating Pakistan, caused by a combination of heavy monsoon rains and melting glaciers.\nWestern Europe\u00a0and\u00a0central and eastern China\u00a0have experienced record-breaking heatwaves and droughts leading to water restrictions.\nSevere downpours have caused floods in places ranging from\u00a0Dallas in the United States\u00a0to\u00a0Seoul in South Korea, which experienced its heaviest torrential rain in a century.\nRecord-breaking heat extremes have also been recorded in Japan, the central US, and the UK, where temperatures exceeded 40\u2103 for the first time.\n\nTable of Contents\n\nWhat are Rossby waves?\nTypes:\nOceanic waves\nAtmospheric waves\nPoleward propagating atmospheric/ Topographic waves\nDifference between jet streams and Rossby waves:\nSignificance of Rossby waves\nThe twin cyclones:\nWhat are Rossby waves?\n\nRossby waves are a type of inertial wave and are also referred to as a planetary waves.

These waves are related to the jet stream and pressure systems.\n\nOceanic Rossby waves travel along the thermocline, which separates the warm surface layer from the colder, deeper ocean.\n\nWhen air from the polar area moves towards the Equator while air from the tropics moves towards the poles, these waves are created.\n\nHeat tends to flow from high low to high latitudes due to variations in the solar radiation received.\n\nThe operation of high-pressure cells and low-pressure cells like cyclones, which are crucial in generating the weather of middle and higher latitudes is explained by the existence of waves.\n\nA true Rossby wave needs to meet some specific criteria. For one thing, these waves only occur inside\u00a0barotropic fluids, a category of fluids whose densities are a function of pressure alone\n\nTypes:\nOceanic Rossby waves\nAtmospheric Rossby waves\nPoleward propagating atmospheric/ Topographic Rossby waves\nOceanic waves\n\nUnlike waves that break along the shore, Rossby waves are huge, surging movements of the ocean that\u00a0stretch horizontally across the planet for hundreds of kilometers in a westward direction.\n\nThey are so large and massive that they can change Earth\u2019s climate conditions.\n\nAlong with\u00a0rising sea levels,\u00a0King Tides, and the effects of\u00a0El Ni\u00f1o, oceanic Rossby waves contribute to high tides and coastal flooding in some regions of the world.\nAtmospheric waves\n\nAtmospheric Rossby waves form primarily as a result of the Earth\u2019s geography.\n\nRossby waves help transfer heat from the tropics toward the poles and cold air toward the tropics in an attempt to return the atmosphere to balance.\n\nThey also help locate the jet stream and mark out the track of surface low-pressure systems.\n\nThe slow motion of these waves often results in long, persistent weather patterns.\n\nThey are influenced by Coriolis force and pressure gradient.\n\nThe rotation causes fluids to turn to the right as they move in the northern hemisphere and to the left in the southern hemisphere.\n\nPoleward propagating atmospheric/ Topographic waves\n\nOver extremely warm sea surfaces in the tropics, such as during El Nio episodes, deep convection (heat transfer to the troposphere) is intensified.\n\nRossby waves in the atmosphere are produced as a result of this tropical force, and they migrate both eastward and poleward.\n\nThe waves explain the statistical connections between low and high-latitude climates.\n\nDifference between jet streams and Rossby waves:\n\nThe major difference between these is their circulation or movement pattern-\n\nA jet stream is a circulation of fast-moving air that is thousands of miles away and is not very dense.\nWhile Rossby is the name given to the swirling or meandering motion of the jet stream.\nSignificance of Rossby waves\n\nRossby waves are a dominant component of Ferrel circulation.\n\nThe tropical air carries heat poleward, and the polar air absorbs heat as it moves toward the Equator.\n\nThe existence of these waves explains the low-pressure cells (cyclones) and high-pressure cells (anticyclones) that are important in producing the\u00a0weather\u00a0of the middle and higher latitudes.\n\nSun and other planets like Venus and Jupiter have these waves in their atmosphere as well.\n\nSolar Rossby waves were first observed in the movement of magnetic structures in the solar corona.\nBy studying the sun\u2019s Rossby waves, scientists hope to gain a better understanding of environmental changes known as \u201cspace weather,\u201d which affects everything from TV broadcasts and power grids to GPS systems and military satellites.\n\nThese waves have been suggested as an important mechanism responsible for the heating of the ocean on Europa, a moon of Jupiter.\n\nRossby wave instabilities\u00a0are also thought to be found in astrophysical\u00a0discs, for example, around newly forming stars.\n\nThe twin cyclones:\n\nThe interplay of the wind and the monsoon system combined with the Earth system produces these synchronous cyclones which are caused by equatorial Rossby waves.\n\nThis system has a vortex in the northern hemisphere and another in the southern hemisphere, and each of these is a mirror image of the other.\nThe vortex in the north spins counterclockwise and has a positive spin, while the one in the southern hemisphere spins in the clockwise direction and therefore has a negative spin.\nBoth have a positive value of the vorticity which is a measure of the rotation.\nVery often twin cyclones are formed from these Rossby waves.\n\n-Article written by Swathi Satish",

    "[CONTENT] #366": "We have often heard about cloudburst occurrences in states like Himachal Pradesh and Uttarakhand. It causes the widespread destruction of both human and material resources. What is the cause of cloudbursts? How is it different from rainfall? Read to know more.\n\nNatural disasters are associated with the negative impacts of a natural hazard.\n\nShort spells of very heavy rainfall over a small geographical area can cause widespread destruction, especially in hilly regions.\n\nNot all instances of very heavy rainfall, however, are cloudbursts. To understand the difference let us dive deep into the topic.\n\nTable of Contents\n\nWhat are cloudbursts?\nAtmospheric changes during the occurrence of a cloudburst\nHow common are they?\nConsequences of a heavy downpour\nCan we forecast sudden rains?\nCloudbursts and climate change: Are cloudburst events increasing?\nWhat are cloudbursts?\n\nA cloudburst is a localized but intense rainfall activity. It has a very specific definition: Rainfall of 10 cm or more in an hour over a roughly 10 km x 10 km area is classified as a cloudburst event. By this definition, 5 cm of rainfall in a half-hour period over the same area can also be categorized as a cloudburst. From this, it is clear that cloudbursts are different from rainfall.\n\nAtmospheric changes during the occurrence of a cloudburst\nCloudbursts happen when drenched clouds are not able to cause rain because of the rising movement of the extremely hot current of air. Rather than falling down, raindrops get larger in dimension and are forced up because of the air current.\nThe relative humidity and cloud cover is at the maximum level with low temperature and slow winds because of which a huge mass of clouds may get condensed at a very rapid rate and result in a cloudburst.\nAs temperatures increase, the atmosphere can hold more and more moisture. This moisture comes down as a short, very intense rainfall, probably in half an hour or one hour.\nHow common are they?\n\nCloudbursts are not uncommon events, particularly during the monsoon months. Most of these happen in the Himalayan states where the local topology, wind systems, and temperature gradients between the lower and upper atmosphere facilitate the occurrence of such events. Some of the recent instances of cloudbursts are:\n\nOn December 2nd, 2015, Chennai recorded 494 mm rainfall causing the 2015 South India floods.\nOn May 4th, 2018, a cloudburst occurred above Belagavi, Karnataka. It reported 95mm of rain in an hour.\nOn October 20th, 2021, it occurred in the Salem district of Tamil Nadu. It recorded 213 mm of rain in one day. The Vasishta river flooded due to this.\nConsequences of a heavy downpour\nIt can result in flash floods in mountainous areas and urban floods in the cities.\nCan lead to mudflows, landslides and land caving.\nLoss of lives of humans and animals.\nLoss of buildings and property damage.\nLoss of forests and wild flora and fauna.\nCan we forecast sudden rains?\n\nThe India Meteorological Department (IMD) forecasts rainfall events well in advance, but it does not predict the quantum of rainfall. The forecasts can be about light, heavy, or very heavy rainfall. But weather scientists do not have the capability to predict exactly how much rain is likely to fall at any given place.\n\n\ud83d\udc49 Which year are YOU targeting for success in the IAS/IPS/IFS Exam? \ud83d\ude80\n\n(1) \u21d2 UPSC 2025: Prelims cum Mains\n\n(2) \u21d2 UPSC 2026: Prelims cum Mains\n\n(3) \u21d2 UPSC 2027 Prelims cum Mains\n\nTip: Know more about ClearIAS Courses (Online/Offline)\n\nAdditionally, the forecasts are for a relatively large geographical area, usually a region, a state, a meteorological sub-division, or at best a district. As they zoom in over smaller areas, the forecasts get more and more uncertain. Theoretically, it is not impossible to forecast rainfall over a very small area as well, but it requires a very dense network of weather instruments and computing capabilities that seem unfeasible with current technologies.\n\nAs a result, specific cloudburst events cannot be forecast. No forecast ever mentions a possibility of a cloudburst. But there are warnings for heavy to very heavy rainfall events, and these are routinely forecast four to five days in advance. The possibility of extremely heavy rainfall is forecast six to 12 hours in advance.\n\nCloudbursts and climate change: Are cloudburst events increasing?\n\nThere is no definitive evidence that suggests that cloudbursts are increasing due to climate change. However, as we have been witnessing, the intensity of heavy rainfall occurrences in a short spell of time has been increasing. That means that the wet spells are very wet, and are interspersed with prolonged dry spells even in the rainy season.\n\nThis kind of pattern, attributed to climate change, does suggest that cloudburst events might also be on the rise.\n\nArticle written by: Caroline Abraham",

In this ecosystem, the vegetation is dominated by herbs and grass.\n\nThese ecosystems are mainly found in regions, where there is a scarcity of water and not enough regular rainfall to support the growth of plants and forests.\n\nThe grassland ecosystem lies between the deserts and the forest ecosystems.\n\nSavanna grasslands and temperate grasslands are some examples of grassland ecosystems.\u00a0\n\nGrasslands are one of the intermediate stages in ecological succession and cover a part of the land at all altitudes and latitudes at which climatic and soil conditions do not allow the growth of trees.\n\nThis ecosystem makes up almost a quarter of the total land surface and covers areas where rainfall is usually low and/or the soil depth and quality are poor.\n\nThe low rainfall prevents the growth of numerous trees and shrubs but is sufficient to support the growth of grass cover during the monsoon.\n\nWhere grasslands are found?\n\nGrassland occurs where there is sufficient moisture for grass growth, but where environmental conditions, both climatic and anthropogenic prevent tree growth.\n\nIts occurrence, therefore, correlates with a rainfall intensity between that of desert and forest and is extended by grazing or fire to form a plagioclimax in many areas that were previously forested.\n\nThese ecosystems are particularly fragile because water is scarce.\n\nTypes of Grasslands:\n\nAs climate plays an important role in the formation of grasslands, it is generally used as a basis to divide the world\u2019s grasslands into two broad categories: those that occur in the temperate region and those that occur in the tropical regions.\n\nTROPICAL GRASSLAND\tTEMPERATE GRASSLAND\n\nThese occur on either side of the equator and extend to the tropics\n\t\nFound in the mid-latitudinal zones and in the interior part of the continent\n\n\nDry and wet seasons that remain warm all the time\u00a0\nReceive 50-130cm rainfall\u00a0\n\t\nCold

communities.\nPerennial natural grasses are the most common species.\n\t\nNorthern portions of Gujarat, Rajasthan (excluding the Aravallis), Western Uttar Pradesh, Delhi, and Punjab.\n\n\nDry Sub-Humid Zone\n\t\nThe biodiversity of dry sub-humid regions is well adapted to the difficult conditions characterized by unpredictable rainfall patterns that result in droughts and floods, as well as high temperatures in many cases.\nMany of the world\u2019s crops, such as wheat, barley, and olives, are grown in dry and sub-humid environments.\n\t\nIn India, this zone encompasses all of peninsular India (except Nilgiri).\n\n\nMoist Sub Humid Zone\n\t\nThe moist sub-humid zone describes areas where the climate is intermediate between semi-arid and humid, and the precipitation supports the dense development of tall or short grasses but not forests.\n\t\nIt includes the Ganga alluvial plain in Northern India, and the landscape is flat, low-lying, and poorly drained.\n\n\nHumid Montane Regions\n\t\nHumid montane grasslands are grasslands and shrublands found at high elevations around the world.\nThe term \u201cmontane\u201d in the biome\u2019s name denotes \u201chigh altitude\u201d.\nThe savanna is derived from humid forests due to shifting cultivation and sheep grazing\n\n\u00a0\n\n\t\nAssam, Manipur, West Bengal, Uttar Pradesh, Punjab, Himachal Pradesh, and Jammu & Kashmir\u2019s humid montane regions and moist sub-humid zones.\n\nIn India, grasslands are found as village grazing grounds (Gauchar) and extensive low pastures in dry regions of the western part of the country and also in the Alpine Himalayas. Perennial grasses are the dominant plant community seen here.\n\nIn the Himalayan mountains, there are high, cold Himalayan pastures. There are tracts of tall elephant grass in the low-lying Terai belt south of the Himalayan foothills.\n\nThere are semi-arid grasslands in Western India, parts of Central India, and the Deccan Plateau. Patches of shola grasslands occur on hill slopes alongside the extremely moist evergreen forests in South India.\n\nEconomic Importance of grasslands:\nWheat, corn, and rice are the three main plants that are grown on grasslands all over the world.\nFarmers who keep cattle or goats, as well as shepherds who keep sheep, are highly dependent on grasslands. It provides a significant food source for cows and sheep.\nDomestic animals are grazed in the \u2018common\u2019 land of the village.\nThey are the grazing areas of many rural communities.\nWater from semi-natural grasslands is currently in short supply.\nThese natural grasslands create an efficient system for water absorption, high infiltration, and reduced erosion.\nGrassland/pasture can sustain plants that honey bees have a long relationship with (clovers and other non-native weeds). Grasslands have diverse species of insects that pollinate crops.\nThere are also predators of these insects such as small mammals like shrews, reptiles like lizards, birds of prey, and amphibia such as frogs and toads.\nAll these carnivorous animals help to control insect pests in adjoining agricultural lands.\nThe grass is also used to thatch houses and farm sheds.\nGrasslands, both natural and semi-natural, play a significant role in the cultural landscape.\nSome grasslands are designated as nature reserves or national parks, and they are frequently promoted as tourist destinations both locally and nationally.\nThe thorny bushes and branches of the few trees that are seen in grasslands are used as a major source of fuelwood.\nLocally, however, stakeholders, including regional specialists and local farmers, recognize their importance.\nFlora and Fauna of the ecosystem:\nGrasses are the dominating plants, with scattered drought-resistant thorny trees in the tropical grasslands.\nBadgers, foxes, asses, zebra, and antelope are found grazing on grasslands that support the dairy and leather industries.\nGrasslands also support the large population of rodents, reptiles and insects.\nIn some regions, grasslands also support a variety of other herbaceous plants like sedges, legumes and members of the sunflower family. Grasslands support numerous herbivores, from minute insects to very large mammals.\u00a0\nRats, mice, rodents, deer, elephants, dogs, buffalo, tigers, lions, and ferrets are some common mammals in grasslands.\u00a0\nIn northeast India, the one-horned rhinoceros is among the threatened animal of grassland in this region.\u00a0\nA large number of avian fauna seen\nCharacteristics features of this ecosystem:\nShort plants: Grasslands normally have a very short growing season as the climate is dry and the soil is poor. This condition inhibits the growth of woody and large trees and favours the growth of small plants like grass and shrubs.\nFast-growing grass: Grasses have a tendency to grow back in spite of grazing or overgrazing. Moreover, most grass species can grow quickly after a fire has swept through the grassland and some have seeds that can grow after being burned in a fire.\nMostly hot and Dry Areas: Nearly all large grasslands are hot, at least in summer and dry. In general tropical grasslands receive 500 to 1500 mm of about 15 to 35 degrees.\nChange in appearance: These ecosystems change their appearance throughout the year. While in winter grasslands look drab and lifeless. A similar change can be seen in tropical grasslands where the onset of the rainy season changes the landscape from dull brown to bright green.\nGrassland also performs Energy flow through the food chain, Nutrient cycling (biogeochemical cycles).\nEcological succession or ecosystem development.\nHomeostasis (or cybernetic) or feedback control mechanisms.\nTo increase the fertility of the soil and regulate the productivity of the ecosystem.\nTo reduce the leaching of minerals due to low rainfall.\nConclusion:\n\nThe grasslands are one of the most important landforms. They assist agriculture by providing essential ecosystem services such as water and climate regulation, as well as biogeochemical cycling, carbon storage, cultural, and recreational benefits. They are also the major reservoirs of agricultural gene pools, and many of the crops that enable human life, such as wheat, corn, rice, and millet, originated in these ecosystems. Grasslands are also important habitats for a variety of flora and animals.\n\nArticle written by Aseem Muhammed",

It promoted capitalist farming as big land owners profited the most.\nIndustrialization: The large-scale mechanization of farms created a demand for machinery like tractors, harvesters, threshers, combines, diesel engines, electric motors, pumping sets, etc. Demand for chemical fertilizers, pesticides, insecticides, weedicides, etc. also increased considerably.\nAgro industries: Several agricultural products came to be used as raw materials in various industries giving rise to agro-based industries.\nEmployment: The demand for labor force increased rural employment, and the industrial workforce at the same time.\nNegative effects\n\nImpact on ecology\n\nIndigenous seeds did not have the inherent ability to withstand the chemical fertilizers used hence they started dying out of usage.\nThe newly introduced high-yielding seeds had a narrow genetic base compared to the indigenous species.\nThe overuse of chemical fertilizers to get high yield caused physical and chemical degradation of the soil by altering the natural microflora and increasing the alkalinity and salinity of the soil.\n\nImpact on other food crops\n\nNon-food grains were not included- major commercial crops like cotton, jute, tea, and sugarcane were also left almost untouched by the Green Revolution.\nThe High Yielding Variety Programme (HYVP) was restricted to only five crops: Wheat, Rice, Jowar, Bajra, and Maize.\nThe green revolution impacted only a few states creating economic disparity among regions.\n\nImpact on farmers\n\nThe excessive use of groundwater for irrigation depleted the water table in many parts of the country.\nEventually, small farmers sold their lands to large commercial farmers as they were unable to withstand the increasing expenses of farming and debts.\nMany farmers left farming unable to withstand the food inflation and economic crisis.\n\nImpact on food consumption and nutrition\n\nThe per capita net availability of other cereal grains such as millets and pulses decreased over the years.\nThis led to the change in the consumption pattern over the years and the shift in focus from the minor cereals and pulses to the major cereals, rice and wheat.\nThe consumption of major cereals such as rice and wheat along with pulses and a decrease in the addition of coarse cereals, foods of animal origin, and fruits and vegetables in the diet lead to a deficiency of micronutrients such as iron, zinc, calcium, vitamin A, folate, and riboflavin among the population causing anemia, keratomalacia, blindness, and infertility in severe cases.\nGreen Revolution \u2013 Krishonnati Yojana\n\nThe government of India introduced the\u00a0Green Revolution Krishonnati Yojana\u00a0in 2005 to boost the agriculture sector.\n\nThe government through the scheme plans to develop the agriculture and allied sector in a holistic & scientific manner to increase the income of farmers.\n\nIt comprises 11 schemes and missions under a single umbrella scheme:\n\nMission for Integrated Development of Horticulture (MIDH)\nNational Food Security Mission (NFSM)\nNational Mission for Sustainable Agriculture (NMSA)\nSubmission on Agriculture Extension (SMAE)\nSub-Mission on Seeds and Planting Material (SMSP)\nSub-Mission on Agricultural Mechanization (SMAM)\nSub-Mission on Plant Protection and Plan Quarantine (SMPPQ)\nIntegrated Scheme on Agriculture Census, Economics, and Statistics (ISACES)\nIntegrated Scheme on Agricultural Cooperation (ISAC)\nIntegrated Scheme on Agricultural Marketing (ISAM)\nNational e-Governance Plan in Agriculture (NeGP-A)\nConclusion\n\nThe green revolution pulled India out of a major food crisis and provided unprecedented food security. The success story helped the country achieve self-sufficiency and even an export market of food grains.\n\nBut the negative impacts on the environment and lack of knowledge on heavy-duty chemical fertilizers among Indian farmers weren\u2019t taken into account, which led to failures towards the end of it.\n\nThe advantages of indigenous crops should be realized and they should be revived as food security must also ensure the nutrition security of the nation.\n\nProper planning and intensive collaborative research work should be initiated by the stakeholders for the conservation of the traditional varieties and the inclusion of these varieties and practices into the food and nutrition security plans for the nation owing to their nutritional benefits.\n\nThe impact on ecology and the water table must be specially focused upon.\n\nRelated Posts\n\nGenetically Modified Crops and Regulations in India\nGreen Agriculture",

    "[CONTENT] #378": "Irrigation systems are an integral part of agriculture. There are numerous types of irrigation systems aiding the growth of agriculture. Read here to know more.\n\nAgriculture is the key to the development of human civilization and the nerve of the economic well-being of any country. Irrigation systems are a major process aiding agriculture for centuries.\n\nAncient civilizations in many parts of the world practiced irrigation. Civilization would probably not be possible without some form of irrigation.\n\nThe earliest form of\u00a0irrigation\u00a0probably involved people carrying buckets of water from wells or rivers to pour on their\u00a0crops. As better techniques developed, societies in Egypt and China built\u00a0irrigation\u00a0canals,\u00a0dams,\u00a0dikes, and water\u00a0storage\u00a0facilities.\n\nAncient Rome built structures called\u00a0aqueducts\u00a0to carry water from\u00a0snowmelt\u00a0in the Alps to cities and towns in the valleys below. This water was used for drinking, washing, and\u00a0irrigation.\n\nTable of Contents\n\nIrrigation system\nTypes\nSurface irrigation\nSprinkler Irrigation\nWell and tube\nCanal irrigation\nTank\nDrip irrigation\nSurge irrigation\nDitch irrigation\nSub-irrigation\nChallenges faced by agriculture\nGovernment initiatives for irrigation system\nWay forward\nIrrigation system\n\nIrrigation is the artificial application of water to the soil or agricultural field. It is like supplementing rainwater with another source of water. It is mostly used in dry areas and during periods of insufficient rainfall.\n\n\ud83d\udc49 Which year are YOU targeting for success in the IAS/IPS/IFS Exam? \ud83d\ude80\n\n(1) \u21d2 UPSC 2025: Prelims cum Mains\n\n(2) \u21d2 UPSC 2026: Prelims cum Mains\n\n(3) \u21d2 UPSC 2027 Prelims cum Mains\n\nTip: Know more about ClearIAS Courses (Online/Offline)\n\nThe main idea behind these systems is to assist in the growth of crops and plants by maintaining the minimum amount of water required, suppressing weed growth in fields, and preventing soil consolidation.\n\nIt is considered a basic infrastructure and vital input required for agricultural production. The major aim is to maintain the agricultural output with a minimum amount of water, maintenance of landscapes, and re-vegetation of disturbed soils.\n\nThese systems are also used for dust repression, removal of sewage, and mining. Irrigation is often studied together with drainage, which is the natural or artificial removal of surface and sub-surface water from a given region.\n\nIt also has effects on crop production, which include:\n\nProtecting plants against frost\nSuppressing weed growth in a grain field\nPreventing soil consolidation.\nfor dust suppression,\nDisposal of sewage, and mining.\nTypes\n\nThe three basic and broad classifications of methods are:\n\nSurface\nSprinkler\nSub-surface\nSurface irrigation\n\nIn this technique, water flows and spreads over the surface of the land. Varied quantities of water are allowed on the fields at different times.\n\nSurface irrigation technique is broadly classified as basin irrigation; border irrigation; furrow irrigation and uncontrolled flooding.\n\nBasin Irrigation\n\nThe Basin system is suitable for many field crops. Paddy rice grows best when its roots are submerged in water, so basin irrigation is the best method for this crop.\nIt is generally not suited to crops that cannot stand in wet or waterlogged conditions for periods longer than 24 hours.\nThese are usually root and tuber crops such as potatoes, cassava, beet, and carrots which require loose, well-drained soils.\n\nFurrow irrigation\n\nIn the furrow technique, trenches or \u201cfurrows\u201d are dug between crop rows in a field.\nFarmers flow water down the furrows (often using only gravity) and it seeps vertically and horizontally to refill the soil reservoir. Flow to each furrow is individually controlled.\nThe Furrow technique is suitable for row crops, and tree crops, and because water does not directly contact the plants, crops that would be damaged by direct inundation by water such as tomatoes, vegetables, potatoes, and beans.\nIt is one of the oldest systems of irrigation.\n\nBorder irrigation\n\nBorder irrigation is a type of surface irrigation where the field is divided into strips separated by border ridges running down the gradient of the field.\nThe area between the ridges is flooded during irrigation.\nIt can be viewed as an extension of basin irrigation to include long rectangular or contoured field shapes.\n\nUncontrolled flooding\n\nIn uncontrolled flooding, the water is spread or flooded into the field without control of water and preparation of land.\nIt is also called wild flooding.\nThe efficiency of this method depends upon the depth of flooding, the size of the stream, the rate of intake of water into the soil, and the topography of the field.\nThis method is suitable for inundation irrigation systems, pastures & forage crops and is inexpensive.\nSprinkler Irrigation\nIn this method, water is sprayed into the air and allowed to fall on the ground surface somewhat resembling rainfall.\nThe flow of water develops the spray under pressure through small orifices or nozzles.\nThe sprinkler irrigation system is a very suitable method for irrigation on uneven lands and shallow soils.\nNearly all crops are suitable for sprinkler irrigation systems except crops like paddy, jute, etc. The dry crops, vegetables, flowering crops, orchards, and plantation crops like tea, and coffee are all suitable and can be irrigated through sprinklers.\nWell and tube\nWell, and Tube Well irrigation is the most popular irrigation system in India.\nThe first tube well was dug in 1930 in Uttar Pradesh. Today more than 50 lakh tube wells are operating in different parts of India.\nIt has contributed substantially to the success of the Green Revolution in India. Uttar Pradesh has the largest area under good irrigation.\nIt is followed by Rajasthan, Madhya Pradesh, Punjab, Gujarat, Maharashtra, and Bihar.\nThere are various types of wells \u2013 shallow wells, deep wells, tube wells, artesian wells, etc. From the shallow wells water is not always available as the level of water goes down during the dry months.\nDeep wells are more suitable for irrigation as water from them is available throughout the year.\nCanal irrigation\nCanal irrigation is one of the most important sources of irrigation. It accounts for about 24% of the total irrigation in the nation.\nIt is an effective source of irrigation in low-level relief, deep fertile soil, and perennial river areas which are mostly found in the northern plains.\nThere are two types of canal systems: Inundation and Perennial canals.\nInundation canals are taken out from the rivers without any regulating system and provide irrigation mainly in the rainy season when the river is in flood and there is excess water.\nPerennial Canals\u00a0are those which are taken off from perennial rivers by constructing a barrage across the river. Most of the canals in India are perennial.\nMost of the canals provide perennial irrigation and supply water as and when required. This saves the crops from drought conditions and helps in increasing farm production.\nTank\nA tank acts as an irrigation storage system which is developed by constructing a small bund of earth or stones built across a stream.\nThe rainwater can also be collected in these tank reservoirs for irrigation usage.\nIt is an important source of irrigation in Karnataka, Madhya Pradesh, Maharashtra, Odisha, Kerala, the Bundelkhand area, Rajasthan, and Gujarat.\nDrip irrigation\nIt is a type of micro-irrigation system or localized irrigation system which is the most efficient water and nutrient delivery system for growing crops.\nIt delivers water and nutrients directly to the plant\u2019s roots zone, in the right amounts, at the right time, so each plant gets exactly what it needs, when it needs it, to grow optimally.\nWater is applied near the plant root through emitters or drippers, on or below the soil surface, at a low rate varying from 2-20 liters per hour.\nThis irrigation system lessens soil erosion and weed growth while increasing water application efficiency.\nThe initial cost and maintenance are high for this system.\nSurge irrigation\nSurge Irrigation is an alternative to furrow irrigation where the water supply is pulsed on and off in planned periods.\nThe wetting and drying cycles reduce infiltration rates resulting in faster advance rates and higher uniformities than constant flow.\nDitch irrigation\nDitch Irrigation is a type of traditional method, where ditches are dug out and seedlings are planted in rows.\nThe plantings are watered by placing canals or furrows in between the rows of plants.\nSiphon tubes are used to move the water from the main ditch to the canals.\nSub-irrigation\nAlso known as seepage irrigation is a system where water is allowed to the plant root zone from below the soil surface and absorbed upwards. The excess may be collected for reuse.\nSub-irrigation is used in growing field crops such as tomatoes, peppers, and sugar cane in areas with high water tables.\nThe major benefits of this system are water and nutrient conservation, and labor-saving.\nThe outfitting cost is comparatively high and the main problems include the possibility of the increased presence of disease-causing organisms in recycled water.\nChallenges faced by agriculture\nAgriculture is subject to variations in monsoon in the country. As per the World Bank, only 35% of India\u2019s agricultural land is irrigated. The remaining 65% of farming is rain-dependent, most of which takes place over just a few summer months.\nThe problem of land degradation in rain-fed or dry-land areas is expected to increase in the coming years.\nThe arable or cultivable land is being converted for non-agricultural purposes adding to the food crisis while the population keeps increasing.\nAnother major issue is the overexploitation of groundwater, which is a major concern in the states of Haryana, Delhi, Punjab, Tamil Nadu, Rajasthan, etc. Alarmingly, the groundwater level has been going down in almost all parts of the country.\nThe increasing desertification of India\u2019s soil is a threat to every agricultural development in the country.\nGovernment initiatives for irrigation system\n\nPradhan Mantri Krishi Sinchayee Yojana:\n\nLaunched in 2015 with the motto of \u201cHar Khet Ko Paani\u201d, the scheme aims to provide end-to-end solutions in the irrigation supply chain (water sources, distribution network, and, farm-level applications).\nThe scheme focuses on creating sources for assured irrigation and protective irrigation by harnessing rainwater at the micro-level through \u2018Jal Sanchay\u2019 and \u2018Jal Sinchan\u2019.\nOne of the most crucial components of the initiative is \u201cPer Drop More Crop\u201d. It focuses on micro-irrigation systems (sprinkler, drip, pivots, rain guns, etc.) to promote precision farming by making water available in a targeted manner to the root zone of crops.\n\nMicro Irrigation Fund:\n\nThe Government has created a dedicated Micro Irrigation Fund with NABARD.\nThis fund aims to facilitate the States to mobilize the resources for expanding coverage of Micro Irrigation in the country.\n\nRainfed\u00a0Area Development Programme (RADP):\n\nRainfed Area Development Programme (RADP) is an initiative that aims to increase the agricultural productivity of rain-fed areas sustainably by adopting appropriate farming system-based approaches.\nWay forward\n\nThe lack of irrigated land for agriculture is a major issue that needs to be addressed more aggressively. The farmers should be made aware of the numerous options available to them when it comes to irrigation and be educated about it.\n\nVarious alternative methods of irrigation and farming like vertical farming, zero budget natural farming, urban agriculture, agroforestry, etc, should be encouraged.",

Indian Agriculture is dominated by small-scale farming and is characterized by low productivity.\n\nThe Indian agriculture sector employs the largest female labor force in the country which is close to 65%.\n\nBut it suffers from the twin problems of low productivity and excess workforce employed in it resulting in a low per capita productivity of the workforce. This leads to lesser wages and a high level of poverty.\n\nThe agriculture sector in India has undergone very limited liberalization. The state still plays a predominant role in Indian agriculture. It is one of the highly subsidized sectors of the economy because concerns about food security and poverty lead the government to remain strongly involved through fixing prices for key agricultural products at the farm and consumer levels, high border protection, bans on or support for exports, and massive subsidies for key inputs such as fertilizers, water, and electricity.\n\nTable of Contents\n\nCropping seasons\nMajor Food crops in various parts of the country\nRice\nWheat\nMillets\nPulses\nMaize\nMajor cash crops in various parts of the country\nSugarcane\nTea\nCoffee\nJute\nCotton\nCropping patterns in India\nChanging cropping patterns in India\nConclusion\nCropping seasons\n\nIndia is geographically very vast, hence it has various food and non-food crops which are cultivated in three main cropping seasons which are rabi, Kharif, and Zaid.\n\n\ud83d\udc49 Which year are YOU targeting for success in the IAS/IPS/IFS Exam? \ud83d\ude80\n\n(1) \u21d2 UPSC 2025: Prelims cum Mains\n\n(2) \u21d2 UPSC 2026: Prelims cum Mains\n\n(3) \u21d2 UPSC 2027 Prelims cum Mains\n\nTip: Know more about ClearIAS Courses (Online/Offline)\n\nThe Kharif season starts with the southwest monsoon and supports the cultivation of tropical crops.\nRabi season is for winter crops as these crops require less amount of water for growth.\nWhile Zaid season comes between Rabi and Kharif.\n\nMajor crops in India can be classified into:\n\nFood crops: \u00a0Rice, Wheat, Millets, Maize, and Pulses.\n\nCash crops: Sugarcane, Oilseeds, Horticulture crops, Tea, Coffee, Rubber, Cotton, and Jute.\n\nMajor Food crops in various parts of the country\nRice\nCourtesy: mapsofindia.com\n\nIndia is an important center of rice cultivation. Rice is cultivated in the largest areas in India.\n\nHistorians believe that while the Indica variety of rice was first domesticated in the area covering the foothills of the Eastern Himalayas (i.e. north-eastern India), stretching through Burma, Thailand, Laos, Vietnam, and Southern China, the\u00a0japonica\u00a0variety was domesticated from wild rice in southern China which was introduced to India.\nPerennial wild rice is still growing in Assam and Nepal. It seems to have appeared around 1400 BC in southern India after its domestication in the northern plains.\n\nClimatic Requirements\n\nIn India rice is grown under widely varying conditions of altitude and climate.\n\nRice cultivation in India extends from 8 to35\u00baN latitudes and from sea level to as high as 3000 meters.\nThe Rice crop needs a hot and humid climate. It is best suited to regions that have high humidity, prolonged sunshine, and an assured supply of water.\nIt required around 150-300 cm of rainfall and deep clayey and loamy soil.\nThe average temperature required throughout the life period of the crop ranges from 21 to 37\u00ba C.\nThe maximum temperature which the crop can tolerate is 40\u00ba C to 42\u00ba C.\n\nNutritional value of Rice\n\nRice is a nutritional staple food that provides instant energy as its most important component is carbohydrate (starch).\nRice is poor in nitrogenous substances with an average composition of these substances being only 8 percent and fat content or lipids only negligible, i.e., 1 percent, and due to this reason, it is considered a complete food for eating.\nRice flour is rich in starch and is used for making various food materials. It is also used in some instances by brewers to make alcoholic malt.\nLikewise, rice straw mixed with other materials is used to produce porcelain, glass, and pottery.\nRice is also used in the manufacturing of paper pulp and livestock bedding.\n\nCrop Production Practices\n\nIn India Rice is mainly grown in two types of soils- uplands and low lands. The method of cultivation of rice in a particular region depends largely on factors such as the situation of the land, type of soil, irrigation facilities, availability of laborers intensity, and distribution of rainfalls. The crop of rice is grown with the following methods:\n\nDry or Semi-dry upland cultivation\nBroadcasting the seed\nSowing the seed behind the plow or drilling\nWet or lowland cultivation\nTransplanting in puddled fields.\nBroadcasting sprouted seeds in puddled fields.\n\nSelection of Seeds\n\nThe use of quality seeds in the cultivation of rice is an important factor to get a better crop yield. Seeds intended for sowing should satisfy the following requirements:\n\nThe seed should belong to the proper variety, which is proposed to be grown.\nThe seed should be clean and free from obvious mixtures of other seeds.\nThe seed should be mature, well developed, and plump in size.\nThe seed should be free from obvious signs of age or bad storage.\nThe seed should have a high germinating capacity.\n\nBefore sowing the seed should be treated with fungicides which protect the seed against soil-borne fungi and also give a boost to the seedlings.\n\nWheat\nCourtesy: farmer.gov.in\n\nWheat is the main cereal crop in India. Indian wheat is largely a soft/medium-hard, medium protein, white bread wheat, somewhat similar to U.S. hard white wheat.\n\nWheat grown in central and western India is typically hard, with high protein and high gluten content.\nIndia also produces around 1.0-1.2 million tons of durum wheat, mostly in the state of Madhya Pradesh.\nMost Indian durum is not marketed separately due to segregation problems in the market yards.\n\nThe Government of India appointed a commission in 1961 to assess the feasibility of increasing crop productivity under prevailing Indian ecological conditions. As a result of various steps taken by Govt. of India, the Wheat scenario in our country has completely changed.\n\nIn the post-Independence era, the country used to import Wheat for our needs but due to a bumper increase in the production and productivity of Wheat in the \u2018Green Revolution\u2018 period in the late sixties, our country became self-dependent on Wheat production.\n\nAt present, the country is producing much more excess Wheat than the requirement.\n\nClimate requirement\n\nThe wheat crop has wide adaptability:\n\nIt can be grown not only in the tropical and sub-tropical zones but also in the temperate zone and the cold tracts of the far north, beyond even the 60-degree north latitude.\nWheat can tolerate severe cold and snow and resume growth with the setting in of warm weather in spring.\nIt can be cultivated from sea level to as high as 3300 meters.\n\nThe best wheat is produced in areas favored with cool, moist weather during the major portion of the growing period followed by dry, warm weather to enable the grain to ripen properly.\n\nThe optimum temperature range for the ideal germination of wheat seed is 20-25\u00ba C.\nRains just after sowing hamper germination and encourage seedling blight.\nAreas with a warm and damp climate are not suited for wheat growing.\n\nDuring the heading and flowering stages, excessively high or low temperatures and drought are harmful to wheat. Cloudy weather, with high humidity and low temperatures, is conducive to rust attack. Wheat is mainly a rabi (winter) season crop in India.\n\nSoil\n\nWheat is grown in a variety of soils in India:\n\nSoils with a clay loam or loam texture, good structure, and moderate water holding capacity are ideal for wheat cultivation.\nHeavy soil with good drainage is suitable for wheat cultivation under dry conditions.\nThese soils absorb and retain rainwater well. Heavy soils with poor structure and poor drainage are not suitable as wheat is sensitive to waterlogging.\nWheat can be successfully grown on lighter soils provided their water and nutrient holding capacity are improved.\nMillets\nCourtesy: mapsofindia.com\n\nGiven the nutritional value of the millets, the Government has notified millets as Nutri-cereals in April 2018. Millets are a rich source of Protein, Fibre, Minerals, Iron, and Calcium and have a low glycemic index. The National Year of Millets was celebrated in 2018.\n\nClimate requirement\n\nMillets require a temperature between 27-32\u00b0C.\nRainfall is around 50-100 cm.\nMillets can be grown in inferior alluvial or loamy soil because they are less sensitive to soil deficiencies.\n\nJowar is a rain-fed crop grown in moist areas with less or no irrigation.\n\nBajra grows in sandy soils and shallow black soil.\n\nRagi requires red, black, sandy, loamy, and shallow black soils which are found in dry regions mostly.\n\nThese are the small-seeded hardy crops that can grow well in dry zones or rain-fed areas under marginal conditions of soil fertility and moisture.\n\nMillets are cultivated in low-fertile land, tribal and rain-fed, and mountainous areas.\nThese areas include Haryana, Uttar Pradesh, Chhattisgarh, Gujarat, Rajasthan, Madhya Pradesh, Maharashtra, Andhra Pradesh, Karnataka, Tamil Nadu, and Telangana.\n\nDue to their short growing season, millets can develop from seeds to ready-to-harvest crops in just about 65 days.\n\nThis highly beneficial characteristic of the millets is of vital importance in thickly populated regions of the world.\nIf stored properly, millets can keep well for two years or beyond.\n\nMillets can not only grow in poor climatic or soil conditions and provide nutritious grain as well as fodder, but these can also very well fit into multiple cropping systems under irrigation as well as dryland farming due to their short growing season.\n\nPulses\nCourtesy: farmer.gov.in\n\nPulses are consumed as Dal, which is a cheap source of plant protein. These are consumed because of bodybuilding properties having the presence of various amino acids.\n\nThese also have medicinal properties. By-products of pulses like leaves, pod coats, and bran are given to animals in the form of dry fodder.\nSome pulse crops like Gram, Lobia, Urdbean & Moongbean are fed to animals as green fodder. Moong plants are also used as a green manure which improves soil health and adds nutrients to the soil.\n\nSeveral pulse crops are grown in India and the world. Among the crops, major ones are Gram, Pigeonpea, Lentil, Fieldpeas, etc. According to history, the origin of Gram is in South West Asia \u2013 probably Afghanistan and Persia, Pigeonpea in Africa, Lentil in Turkey to South Iran, and Fieldpeas in Mediterranean Region of Southern Europe and Western Asia.\n\nClimatic Requirement\n\nPulse crops are cultivated in the Kharif, Rabi, and Zaid seasons of the Agricultural year.\n\nRabi crops require a mild cold climate during the sowing period, during vegetative to pod development cold climate, and during maturity/harvesting warm climate.\nKharif pulse crops require a warm climate throughout their life from sowing to harvesting. Summer pulses are habitants of a warm climate. Seed is required to pass many stages to produce seed like germination, seedling, vegetative, flowering, fruit setting, pod development, and grain maturity/harvesting.\nMaize\nCourtesy: farmer.gov.in\n\nMaize (Zea mays L) is one of the most versatile emerging crops having wider adaptability under varied agro-climatic conditions. Globally, maize is known as the queen of cereals because it has the highest genetic yield potential among the cereals.\n\nMaize in India contributes nearly 9 % to the national food basket. In addition to staple food for human being and quality feed for animals, maize serves as a basic raw material as an ingredient in thousands of industrial products that includes starch, oil, protein, alcoholic beverages, food sweeteners, pharmaceutical, cosmetic, film, textile, gum, package and paper industries, etc.\n\nClimatic conditions\n\nIn India, maize is traditionally grown in the monsoon (Kharif) season, which is accompanied by high temperature (<35\u00b0 C) and rainfall.\nMaize can be grown successfully in a variety of soils ranging from loamy sand to clay loam.\nSoils with good organic matter content having high water holding capacity with neutral pH are considered good for higher productivity.\n\nBeing a sensitive crop to moisture stress particularly excess soil moisture and salinity stresses; it is desirable to avoid low lying fields having poor drainage and also the field having higher salinity. Therefore, the fields having provision of proper drainage should be selected for the cultivation of maize.\n\nMajor cash crops in various parts of the country\nSugarcane\nCourtesy: farmer.gov.in\n\nSugarcane (Saccharum officinarum) family Gramineae (Poaceae) is a widely grown crop in India. It employs over a million people directly or indirectly besides contributing significantly to the national exchequer.\n\nSugarcane growing countries of the world lay between the latitude 36.7\u00b0 north and 31.0\u00b0 south of the equator extending from tropical to subtropical zones.\n\nSugar cane originated in New Guinea where it has been known for thousands of years.\n\nSugar cane plants spread along human migration routes to Asia and the Indian subcontinent. Here it cross-bred with some wild sugar cane relatives to produce the commercial sugar cane we know today.\n\nImportant regions/ zones for sugarcane cultivation in India\n\nBroadly there are two distinct agro-climatic regions of sugarcane cultivation in India, viz., tropical and subtropical. However, five agro-climatic zones have been identified mainly for varietal development. They are (i)North Western Zone (ii) North Central Zone (iii) North Eastern Zone (iv) Peninsular Zone (v) Coastal Zone.\n\nTropical Sugarcane region\n\nThe tropical sugarcane region consists of sugarcane agro-climatic zone 4 (peninsular zone) and 5(Coastal zone) which includes the states of Maharashtra, Andhra Pradesh, Tamil Nadu, Karnataka, Gujarat, Madhya Pradesh, Goa, Pondicherry, and Kerala.\n\nSub-tropical sugarcane region: Around 55 percent of the total cane area in the country is in the sub-tropics. U.P, Bihar, Haryana, and Punjab come under this region.\n\nCrop distribution: Sugarcane growing countries of the world are lying between the latitude 36.70 north and 31.00 south of the equator extending from tropical to sub-tropical zones. In India sugarcane is cultivated all over the country from latitude 80 N to 330 N, except in cold hilly areas like Kashmir valley, Himachal Pradesh and Arunachal Pradesh.\n\nClimatic requirement\n\nThe different critical stages are germination, tillering, early growth, active growth, and elongation.\n\nThe optimum temperature for sprouting (germination) of stem cuttings is 32\u00b0C to 38\u00b0C.\nIt slows down below 25\u00b0C and reaches a plateau between 30\u00b0-34\u00b0C.\nTemperatures above 38\u00b0C reduce the rate of photosynthesis and increase respiration.\nFor ripening, however, relatively low temperatures in the range of 12\u00b0C to 14\u00b0C are desirable.\n\nReduction in yield of sugarcane due to rise in temperature\n\nThe sugarcane productivity and juice quality are profoundly influenced by weather conditions prevailing during the various crop-growth sub-periods.\n\nSugar recovery is highest when the weather is dry with low humidity; bright sunshine hours, cooler nights with wide diurnal variations, and very little rainfall during the ripening period.\nThese conditions favor high sugar accumulation.\nThe climatic conditions like very high temperatures or very low temperatures deteriorate the juice quality and thus affecting the sugar quality.\nFavorable climates like warm and humid climates favor the insect pests and diseases, which cause much damage to the quality and yield of its juice and finally sucrose contents.\nTea\nCourtesy: mapsofindia.com\n\nIn colonial India, the British had to import tea from China, which caused huge dents in their treasury, so the East India Company started tea plantations in Assam. As the production of tea increased, India started exporting tea to the rest of the world. This contributed to the nation\u2019s economy. By the 1850s, India became one of the biggest tea producers in the world. After independence, local tea brands were introduced as beverages to the masses.\n\nIndia is the second-largest tea producer in the world, right behind China.\n\nClimatic requirements\n\nRequires temperature between 20-30\u00b0C.\nRainfall is around 150-300 cm.\nDeep and fertile well-drained soil, rich in humus and organic matter.\nCoffee\nCourtesy: Coffee Board of India\n\nCoffee was initially brought from Yemen and introduced to the Baba Budan Hills. Hills with a well-defined shade canopy, comprising evergreen leguminous trees provide the optimal condition for coffee cultivation which is why it is mainly concentrated in the hilly regions.\n\nIndian variety of coffee \u2018Arabica\u2019 is famous worldwide.\n\nIndia cultivates all of its coffee under a well-defined two-tier mixed shade canopy, comprising evergreen leguminous trees. Nearly 50 different types of shade trees are found in coffee plantations. Shade trees prevent soil erosion on a sloping terrain; they enrich the soil by recycling nutrients from deeper layers, protect the coffee plant from seasonal fluctuations in temperature, and play host to diverse flora and fauna.\n\nCoffee plantations in India are essential spice worlds too: a wide variety of spices and fruit crops like pepper, cardamom, vanilla, orange, and banana grow alongside coffee plants.\n\nIndia\u2019s coffee-growing regions have diverse climatic conditions, which are well suited for the cultivation of different varieties of coffee. Some regions with high elevations are ideally suited for growing Arabicas of mild quality while those with warm humid conditions are best suited for Robustas.\n\nJute\nCourtesy: farmer.gov.in\n\nJute is an important natural fiber crop in India next to cotton. In trade and industry, jute and Mesta crop together known as raw jute as their uses are almost the same. Raw jute plays an important role in the country\u2019s economy.\n\nRaw jute was originally considered a source of raw material for packaging industries only.\nBut it has now emerged as a versatile raw material for diverse applications, such as textile industries, paper industries, building, and automotive industries, use as soil savers, use as decorative and furnishing materials, etc.\nRaw jute being a bio-degradable and annually renewable source, it is considered an environment-friendly crop and it helps in the maintenance of the environment and ecological balance.\nA further attraction of Jute lies in its easy availability, and inexhaustible quantity at a comparatively cheaper rate.\nMoreover, it can easily be blended with other natural and manmade fibers.\n\nJute cultivation is mainly concentrated in eastern and northeastern India while mesta cultivation is spread almost throughout the country. The crop can be grown in low, medium, and high land situations, with both moisture stress and water stagnating condition.\n\nClimatic conditions:\n\nTemperature: Between 25-35\u00b0C\nRainfall: Around 150-250 cm\nSoil Type: Well-drained alluvial soil\nCotton\n\nRead: Cotton cultivation in India\n\nIndia has the distinction of having the largest area under cotton cultivation which is about 37% of the world\u2019s area under cotton cultivation. Cotton is one of the most important fibers and cash crops of India and plays a\nthe dominant role in the industrial and agricultural economy of the country.\n\nIn India, there are ten major cotton-growing states which are divided into three zones, viz. north zone, central zone, and south zone. The North zone consists of Punjab, Haryana, and Rajasthan. The central zone includes Madhya Pradesh, Maharashtra, and Gujarat. The South zone comprises Andhra Pradesh, Telangana, Karnataka, and Tamil Nadu.\n\nBesides these ten States, cotton cultivation has gained momentum in the Eastern State of Orissa. Cotton is also cultivated in small areas of non-traditional States such as Uttar Pradesh, West Bengal & Tripura.\n\nClimatic conditions:\n\nCotton is a tropical or sub-tropical crop grown in semi-arid areas of the country (mainly in the Deccan Plateau).\nA hard frost is injurious to cotton cultivation and it requires at least 210 frost-free days.\nOnly light rainfall (50 to 100 cm) is preferred. Cotton can also be cultivated under irrigated conditions.\nIt requires high temperature and bright sunshine for its growth. Cotton requires a clear sky during the flowering stage.\nCropping patterns in India\n\nThe cropping pattern in India is determined mainly by rainfall, climate, temperature, and soil type.\n\nCropping Pattern describes the proportion of area under cultivation of different crops at a point of time, changes in this distribution over time, and factors determining these changes.\n\nThe multiplicity of cropping systems has been one of the main features of Indian agriculture\u00a0and it is attributed to rain-fed agriculture and the prevailing socio-economic situations of the farming communities.\n\nTwo distinct irrigated cropping systems emerged in India:\n\nOne is the Indo-Gangetic Plain region comprising the states of Punjab, Haryana, the plains of Uttar Pradesh, Bihar, and the plains of Jammu & Kashmir.\nThe other ecosystem may be carved out of coastal areas of Andhra Pradesh and Tamil Nadu.\n\nBased on homogeneity and commonness, major crop regions in India may be divided as follows:\n\nRice Region\nWheat Region\nJowar-Bajra Region\nCotton Region\nMillet and Maize Region\nFruit and Spice Region\n\nBased on combinations of crops grown following cropping systems exist in India:\n\nMonocropping: Monocropping is when the field is used to grow only one crop season after season. This is harmful to soil health.\n\nCrop Rotation:\u00a0 Crop Rotation means changing the type of crops grown in the field each season or each year (or changing from crops to fallow). Crop rotation improves the soil structure and fertility, and because it helps control weeds, pests, and diseases.\n\nSequential Cropping:\u00a0Sequential Cropping involves growing two crops in the same field, one after the other in the same year.\n\nIntercropping:\u00a0 Intercropping means growing two or more crops in the same field at the same time.\n\nMixed Intercropping:\u00a0Planting the main crop in rows and then spreading the seeds of the intercrop (such as a cover crop) in between is called mixed intercropping.\n\nRow Intercropping:\u00a0Planting both the main crop and the intercrop in rows. The rows make weeding and harvesting easier than with mixed intercropping.\n\nStir Cropping:\u00a0Stir Cropping involves planting broad strips of several crops in the field.\n\nChanging cropping patterns in India\n\nA cropping pattern is a dynamic concept as it changes over space and time which occurs due to an increase in the prices of crops.\n\nGreen Revolution also led to changes in the cropping patterns. Rice was introduced to Punjab, Haryana, and Uttar Pradesh.\n\nNew technologies in Indian agriculture play a vital role in determining the cultivation of crops.\n\nFarmers have changed their crop patterns to reap the benefits of economic expansion due to which they are intensively moving towards the cultivation of cash crops from traditional crops.\n\nPopulation explosion and urbanization have led to land conversion, boosting intensive farming, and have brought changes in cropping patterns.\n\nCropping patterns may also be influenced by government action undertaken in the form of an administrative and legislative measures. Supply of inputs by the government, intensive schemes for various crops, various government campaigns, transportation, and marketing provisions also influence the cropping pattern in the country.\n\nConclusion\n\nIndian agriculture has been seeing a deceleration in growth compared to the growth of the larger economy which has been widening disparities between the incomes of workers in non-agricultural and agricultural sectors.\n\nIndian farmers are very much poverty-stricken and conservative still their cropping pattern can be changed through appropriate changes in economic motives.\n\nThere is a need to shift to sustainable agriculture. The policies should consider the environmental cost as well. The planning should be done with the fact that the next generation also needs to have food security.",

Agroforestry systems are multifunctional systems that can provide a wide range of economic, sociocultural, and environmental benefits.\nTypes of agroforestry\n\nThere are three main types of agroforestry systems:\n\nAgrisilviculturalsystems are a combination of crops and trees, such as alley cropping or home gardens.\nSilvopastoral systems\u00a0combine forestry and grazing of domesticated animals on pastures, rangelands, or on-farm.\nThe three elements, namely trees, animals, and crops, can be integrated into what is called agrosilvopastoral systems and are illustrated by home gardens involving animals as well as scattered trees on croplands used for grazing after harvests.\nWhy is agroforestry important?\nIssues with traditional farming practices:\nA farmer may confront a series of adversities and climatic conditions during agricultural production, such as erratic rainfall, stone hail, drought, flood, and so on.\nIn addition, challenges like post-harvest losses, storage, and unavailability of accessible proper marketing are further aggravating the problem.\nCurrently, the human-wildlife and human-crops conflict, forest fires, organic matter deficit soil, monoculture, plant disease and infestation, migration, and the reluctance of youth towards agriculture are a new array of problems.\nThe traditional approach of low input-based extensive and diversified agricultural practices termed \u2018crop diversification could be an alternate approach that might be used to save farming as a counter-strategy for farming bio-socio-psychological anomalies.\nCrop diversification is a strategy applied to grow more diverse crops from shrinking land resources with an increase in productivity in the same arable land.\nIssues with farming practices in India:\n\nFor more than five decades, Indian agriculture has been facing severe problems related to an increase in input costs to increase productivity. However, the productivity proportional to input is maintained for a certain time before stabilizing and then progressively declines in many cases.\n\nFarmers have been using the common government-promoted Green Revolution cropping pattern of\u00a0rice-wheat-rice for a longer time to enhance productivity.\n\nFollowing the same cropping pattern for a longer period has diminished the specific nutrients from the soil, resulting in soil deficiency along with a declined population of microfauna in the soil.\n\nThe microfaunal population is responsible for the mobilization and absorption of particular nutrients in the crop rhizosphere.\nReduction of the microfaunal population in the soil is a serious issue because, without microfaunal activities, the soil is lost to self-perpetuate and its ecology for crop production.\n\nThe mono-cropping pattern also reduces resource-use efficiency.\n\nTo meet the deficiency of soil nutrients, farmers apply fertilizers periodically, which further results in a change in the soil\u2019s chemical and biological properties.\nMono-cropping patterns have more chances to be attacked by the same types of insects and pests, which in turn are controlled by pumping the insecticides and pesticides. This accumulates the residue of these chemicals in soil which pollutes the soil, crop, and environment.\nWeed infestations are on the rise too, necessitating the application of weedicides or herbicides to eradicate them. Thus, persistent use of chemicals declines productivity reduces resource-use efficiency, and deteriorates soil health.\n\nBreaking the mono-cropping pattern by introducing diverse crops and cropping patterns helps in reviving the soil health and increasing the resource-use efficiency.\n\nThe traditional pattern of agriculture in India has wider crop diversity, is more stable, and is natural.\n\nIn the Garhwal Himalayan region of India,\u00a0Barahnajais has a crop diversification system for cultivating 12 crops in a year.\n\u2018Barah anaaj\u2019 literally means \u201812 foodgrains\u2019 and is the traditional heritage of the area.\n\nThe above issues faced by traditional farming practices can be solved by agroforestry to a great extent.\n\nBenefits of agroforestry\n\nEnvironmental benefits:\n\nReduction of pressure on natural forests.\nAgroforestry is known to have the potential to mitigate the climate change effects through microclimate moderation and natural resources conservation in the short run\nCarbon sequestration: Agroforestry species are known to sequester as much carbon in below-ground biomass as the primary forests, and are far greater than the crop and grass systems.\nAgroforestry enables agricultural land to withstand extreme weather events, such as floods and droughts, and climate change.\nAgroforestry increases the nutrient content of soil and prevents soil erosion as well.\n\nEconomic benefits:\n\nTree products and tree services also\u00a0contribute robustly to rural livelihoods.\nFruit, fodder, fuel, fiber, fertilizer, and timber add to food and nutritional security, income generation, and work as\u00a0insurance against crop failure.\nIt provides an alternative for landowners to manage their agricultural land in absence of family labor.\nAgroforestry has significant potential to employ the rural and urban population through production, industrial application, and value addition ventures.\n\nSocial benefits:\n\nAgroforestry provides better and stable income, improving the living standards.\nSelf-dependent villages will be a reality.\n\nGlobal climate goals:\n\nAgroforestry can help the world fulfill international obligations on the climate of creating additional carbon sink by 2030and net-zero by 2070.\nIt will help tackle desertification meeting targets of sustainable development goals (SDGs).\nAgroforestry in India\nIndia became the first country to adopt an agroforestry policy \u2013\u00a0National Agroforestry Policy (NAP) in 2014 to promote employment, productivity, and environmental conservation.\n2016 saw NAP being pushed to national effort with funds to transform agroforestry.\nIn the 2022-23 union budget, the finance minister of India highlighted the aim to promote agroforestry in India.\nBut the Ministry of Agriculture and Farmers\u2019 Welfare merged the SMAF with the Rashtriya Krishi Vikas Yojna which deprived the agroforestry sector of its flagship implementation arm\nThe National Agroforestry Policy 2014:\nPromote agroforestry to increase farm income and livelihoods of rural households, especially the small and marginal farmers.\nProtect and stabilize ecosystems, and promote resilient cropping and farming systems to minimize the risk during extreme climatic events.\nSimultaneously provide raw material to wood-based industries. Thus creating new avenues for rural employment, and reducing pressure on the forests.\nTo develop capacity and strengthen research in agroforestry and create a massive people\u2019s movement for achieving these objectives.\nChallenges for agroforestry\n\nAdverse effects on agricultural land:\n\nIn the fields along which trees have been planted, the productivity per unit area decreases, as in at least about two meters from the trees the moisture content in the soil is significantly reduced.\nUnscientific planning can also negatively impact the agricultural productivity of the land.\nWith increased diversity, the risks of pests and diseases may also increase.\n\nLack of knowledge in farmers:\n\nMany farmers are not keen to take it up because of a lack of information on tree rotation and\u00a0also the\u00a0legal aspects involved in the trade of matured trees.\nThe tendency of farmers to opt for market-oriented trees rather than the trees which are more ecologically suited or are locally needed (fuelwood/fodder).\nAgroforestry has benefitted the big farmers more than the marginal and small farmers.\n\nEffect on the food industry:\n\nThe diversion of good agricultural land from cereal and commercial crops may create a scarcity of food and industrial raw material.\nPossible negative impact on crop production because of planting trees on fertile lands.\nWay forward\n\nThe concept needs to be financially backed and promoted with more zeal. Proper training and information should be given to the farmers for them to adopt the method scientifically.\n\nFarmer collectives like cooperatives,\u00a0self-help groups,\u00a0Farmer -Producer Organisations (FPOs)\u00a0must be promoted for building capacities to foster the expansion of tree-based farming and value chain development.\n\nPolicymakers should incorporate agroforestry in all policies relating to land use and natural resource management, and encourage government investments in agroforestry-related infrastructure.",

Read here to know more.\n\nIndian agriculture is evolving every day towards sustainable farming practices. With increasing industrialization and population, the availability of arable lands for agriculture is getting lesser.\n\nIn such a situation, new and innovative farming practices are to be used such as zero budget natural farming and vertical farming which have been gaining popularity in the past decade.\n\nGilbert Ellis Bailey coined the term vertical farming\u00a0in 1915 and also wrote a book of the same name.\n\nThe modern concept was first proposed in 1999 by Professor Dickson Despommier which was centered on the idea that urban areas should grow their food which can save time and resources required for transportation.\n\nTable of Contents\n\nWhat is vertical farming?\nAdvantages and disadvantages of vertical farming\nTypes of vertical farming\nHydroponics\nAeroponics\nAquaponics\nWay forward\nWhat is vertical farming?\n\nIn vertical farming, crops are grown indoors, under artificial conditions of light and temperature.

It holds the largest share in the global vertical farming market. In Japan, vertical farming is born out of necessity whereas traditional farming is losing its face due to the aging population and rural migration.\n\nVertical farming systems come under the broad classification of protected cultivation wherein the variable physical parameters like temperature, water, soil, humidity, etc can be regulated.\n\nAdvantages and disadvantages of vertical farming\n\nVertical Farming has several advantages, which make it promising for the future of agriculture.\n\nThe land requirement is quite low, water consumption is 80 percent less, the water is recycled and saved, it is pesticide-free, and in cases of high-tech farms, there is no real dependency on the weather.\nA vertical farm can be set up within the confines of a city.\nAnd when the farms are nearby, the product is quickly delivered and always fresh; when compared to the refrigerated produce usually available at supermarkets.\nReduction in transportation reduces the fossil fuel cost & resulting emissions and thus also reduce the spoilage in transportation.\n\nHowever, vertical farming has its drawbacks.\n\nInitial capital costs for establishing the vertical farming system are the major problem.\nIn addition, there are costs of erecting the structures along with its automation like computerized and monitoring systems, remote control systems and software, automated racking and stacking systems, programmable LED lighting systems, climate control system, etc.\nTypes of vertical farming\n\nThere are three major soil-less methods of vertical farming- hydroponics, aeroponics, and aquaponics.\n\nHYDROPONICS\n\nIn the early 1930s, William Frederick Gerick pioneered hydroponics at the University of California at Berkley.\n\nIt is a method of growing food in water using mineral nutrient solutions without soil.\n\nThe basic advantage of this method is that it reduces soil-related cultivation problems like soil-borne insects, pests, and diseases.\n\nA hydroponics system eliminates the need for soil by providing a nutrient-charged aqueous solution directly to the roots that keep the plant fed and hydrated, while supplemental lighting solutions mimic sunlight.\n\nIn a hydroponics growing system, plants are either suspended directly in the aqueous solution or grown in a soil-free medium such as coconut coir, rock wool, LECA, vermiculite, or perlite. The plant\u2019s roots receive the nutrient solution in either an active system or a passive system.\n\nActive systems\u00a0use pumps to circulate and aerate nutrient solutions, delivering the nutrients to the plant\u2019s root zone for uptake.\nPassive systems\u00a0have no pumps or moving parts. The nutrient solutions are fed to the root zone through flooding, gravity, or capillary action.\n\nAdvantages:\n\nAn extended growing season\nImproved growth and yield\nHigher plant density\nPlants can grow anywhere\nLess water consumption\nFewer pest problems\nEasier to harvest mature plants\n\nDisadvantages:\n\nExpensive to set up compared to traditional gardening methods\nVulnerable to power outages due to dependence on electricity for light, water pump, aerators, etc.\nRequires constant monitoring and maintenance.\nVulnerable to waterborne diseases\nWithout soil as a buffer, plants get negatively affected by physical changes quicker.\nAEROPONICS\n\nThe invention of\u00a0aeroponics\u00a0was motivated by the initiative of\u00a0NASA\u00a0(the National Aeronautical and Space Administration, USA) to find an efficient way to grow plants in space in the 1990s.\n\nIn aeroponics, there is no growing medium and hence, no containers for growing crops. In aeroponics, mist or nutrient solutions are used instead of water. As the plants are tied to support and roots are sprayed with nutrient solution, it requires very less space, very less water, and no soil.\n\nCompared to regular hydroponic plants, the plants tend to grow faster and absorb more nutrients because the roots are exposed to more oxygen. Also, there are fewer threats of diseases around root zone disease because there\u2019s no place for debris or pathogen to reside.\n\nAdvantages:\n\nMaximum nutrient absorption for plant roots due to no growing medium\nMassive plant growth because plant roots are exposed to oxygen 24/7. This promotes healthy and fast-growing plants. The mist used on the roots can also be sterilized to prevent plant diseases.\nHigher yields in smaller spaces.\nConsiderably fewer nutrients and water are used on average compared to other systems because of the higher nutrient absorption rate.\nMobility- plants can be moved around easily.\nEasy system maintenance because there is no growing medium used and the system can be cleaned easily\n\nDisadvantages:\n\nRequires constant attention to pH and nutrient density ratio because this system is sensitive.\nThe cost for initial setup can be high.\nSusceptible to power outages.\nRequire technical knowledge as it is one of the most technical to set up.\nDependence on the system. An aeroponic system is made of mist nozzles, high-pressure pumps, and a timer.\nRequire regular disinfection of the root chamber (a common disinfectant is hydrogen peroxide) to prevent root diseases.\nMicroorganisms can be introduced to plant roots through the water.\nAQUAPONICS\n\nThe term aquaponics is coined by combining two words: aquaculture, which refers to fish farming, and hydroponics the technique of growing plants without soil, to create symbiotic relationships between the plants and the fish.\n\nThe symbiosis is achieved as nutrient-rich waste from fish tanks serves as \u201cfertigate\u201d to hydroponic production beds. In turn, the hydroponic beds also function as bio-filters that remove gases, acids, and chemicals, such as ammonia, nitrates, and phosphates, from the water.\n\nAdvantages:\n\nSustainable and intensive food production system\u00a0sustainable;\nAquaponics is an extremely water-efficient system.\nDoesn\u2019t require soil and therefore it\u2019s not susceptible to soil-borne diseases\nDoesn\u2019t require using fertilizers or chemical pesticides;\nHigher yields and qualitative production; higher level of biosecurity and lower risks from outer contaminants;\nAquaponics can be used on non-arable lands such as deserts, degraded soil, or salty, sandy islands;\nFrom a nutritional standpoint, aquaponics provides food in the form of both protein (from the fish) and vegetables\n\nDisadvantages:\n\nThe very high initial start-up costs compared with both hydroponics and soil production systems.\nAquaponics requires deep expertise in the natural world.\nIt\u2019s often hard to find a perfect match between the needs (such as pH, temperature, substrate) of fish and plants;\nAquaponics has fewer management options compared with stand-alone aquaculture or hydroponics;\nMistakes in managing the system can quickly cause its collapse;\nDaily management is needed and has energy costs;\nFish feed needs to be purchased regularly;\nThe products of aquaponics alone aren\u2019t enough to ensure a balanced diet.\nWay forward\n\nVertical farming practice is still in a nascent stage in India, but it needs to be encouraged more to ensure better food security with the increasing population. It can aid in tackling malnutrition and promises better food distribution.\n\nA variety of stakeholders from household farmers and small- to large-scale farmers can be taught the specific knowledge and skills needed for safe, successful, and sustainable implementation.\n\nWith vertical farming techniques, the discussions around farming can move away from land constraints to focus more on sustainable farming techniques.\n\nThe science of different vertical farming techniques can be taught at the school level itself, hence developing sustainable practitioners at a young age itself.",

Read here to learn more about Indian agriculture.\n\nIndia has one of the largest plain areas in the world Indo-Gangetic Plain which is immensely fertile.\n\nIndia has a variety of climatic conditions and soil types.\n\nThese physical variations along with factors like availability of irrigation, use of machinery, and modern agricultural inputs like High Yielding Varieties (HYV) of seeds, insecticides, and pesticides have played important roles in the evolution of different farming practices in the Indian agriculture sector.\n\nTable of Contents\n\nTypes of farming in India\ni) Subsistence farming:\nii) Intensive and Extensive farming\niii) Commercial farming\niv) Plantation Farming\nv) Mixed Farming\nFeatures of Indian Agriculture\nChallenges for Indian Agriculture\nIndian Agriculture: Important Facts\nTypes of farming in India\n\nSome of the major types of farming are discussed below.\n\ni) Subsistence farming:\n\nThe majority of farmers in India practice subsistence farming- farming for their consumption. The entire production is largely consumed by the farmers and their families and they do not have any surplus to sell in the market.\n\nIn this type of farming, landholdings are small and fragmented; cultivation techniques are primitive and simple. There is a total absence of modern equipment like tractors and farm inputs like chemical fertilizers, insecticides, and pesticides. In this farming, farmers mostly cultivate cereals along with oilseeds, pulses, vegetables, and sugarcane.\n\n\ud83d\udc49 Which year are YOU targeting for success in the IAS/IPS/IFS Exam? \ud83d\ude80\n\n(1) \u21d2 UPSC 2025: Prelims cum Mains\n\n(2) \u21d2 UPSC 2026: Prelims cum Mains\n\n(3) \u21d2 UPSC 2027 Prelims cum Mains\n\nTip: Know more about ClearIAS Courses (Online/Offline)\n\nSubsistence farming is further classified into:\n\nIntensive\nPrimitive\n\nPrimitive subsistence agriculture is practised on patches of land with the help of primitive tools like simple digging tools and community or family labour. This type of farming is monsoon depending on the fertility of the soil and other environmental conditions. Examples of such types are shifting agriculture and nomadic herding.\n\nShifting agriculture is practised in thickly forested regions like the Amazon basin, tropical Africa, parts of southeast Asia, and northeast India. These areas receive heavy rainfall hence the vegetation regenerates quickly.\nA patch of land is cleared by felling trees and burning them. The ashes are then mixed with the soil and crops like maize, yam, potatoes, and cassava are grown. The land is abandoned once fertility is reduced.\nNomadic herding is practised in the semi-arid and arid regions of the Sahara, Central Asia, and some parts of India like Rajasthan, Jammu and Kashmir.\nHerdsmen move from place to place with their animals for fodder and water, along defined routes and such movement arises due to seasonal changes. Animals like sheep, camel, yak, and goats are most commonly reared.\n\nIntensive subsistence agriculture is done on small lands with simple tools and more labour. The produce is enough for local consumption and to be sold outside. The sunny climate and fertile soil for most of the year permit the cultivation of more than one crop annually on the same plot. Rice, wheat, maize, pulses, and oilseeds are generally cultivated.\n\nii) Intensive and Extensive farming\n\nThe basic difference between these two types of farming is the amount of production per unit of land. In comparison temperate areas of the USA, Canada, and India do not practice extensive cultivation.\n\nWhen a large patch of land is used for cultivation then we call it extensive farming. Here, total production may be high due to the larger area but per unit production is low.\n\nIntensive Farming records high production per unit of land. An example of intensive cultivation is in Kerala where the availability of land for cultivation is very limited.\n\niii) Commercial farming\n\nIt is just the opposite of subsistence farming as most of the produce is sold in the market for earning money. In this system, farmers use inputs like irrigation, chemical fertilizers, insecticides, pesticides, High Yielding Varieties of seeds, etc.\n\nSome of the major commercial crops grown in different parts of India are cotton, jute, sugarcane, groundnut, etc.\n\nRice farming in Haryana is mainly for commercial purposes as people of this area are predominantly wheat eaters. However, in the East and North-Eastern states of India, rice cultivation would be a large subsistence type.\n\niv) Plantation Farming\n\nIn this type, a single cash crop is grown for sale in national and international markets. This type of agriculture involves the growing and processing of a single cash crop purely meant for sale.\n\nTea, coffee, rubber, bananas, and spices are all examples of plantation crops. Most of these crops were introduced in India by the Britishers in the 19th Century\n\nv) Mixed Farming\n\nWhen both raising crops and rearing animals are carried on simultaneously it is called mixed farming. Farmers engaged in mixed farming have economic advantages as well.\n\nAll classifications are based on the nature and purpose of farming hence they may overlap in some cases. For example, Banana is a plantation type of farming but can also be classified as commercial farming.\n\nFeatures of Indian Agriculture\n\nSubsistence Agriculture: Most parts of India have subsistence agriculture which has been practised in India for several hundreds of years and still prevails.\n\nThe pressure of population on Agriculture: Despite the increase in urbanization and industrialization, about 70% of the population is still directly or indirectly dependent on agriculture.\n\nMechanization in agriculture: Even after more than forty years of the Green Revolution and the revolution in agricultural machinery and equipment, complete mechanization is still not achieved.\n\nMonsoon dependency: Despite the large-scale expansion, only about one-third of the total cropped area is irrigated today. As a consequence, two-thirds of cropped areas are still dependent upon the monsoon.\n\nVariety of crops: Since India has both tropical and temperate climates, crops of both climates are found in India. There are very few countries in the world that have variety comparable to that of India. You would realize that when we would discuss the different types of crops in detail.\n\nThe predominance of food crops: The production of food crops is the priority of the farmers almost everywhere in the country.\n\nSeasonal patterns: India has three distinct agricultural/cropping seasons\u2013 Kharif, rabi, and Zaid. In India, there are specific crops grown in these three seasons. For example, rice is a Kharif crop whereas wheat is a Rabi crop.\n\nChallenges for Indian Agriculture\n\nThe challenges faced by Indian agriculture can be broadly grouped into two categories- the long-standing problems and the emerging issues from the prevailing agricultural practices, system, changing climate, and economy.\n\nStagnation in Production of Major Crops: The production of some of the major staple food crops like rice and wheat has been stagnating for quite some time. This is a situation that is worrying our agricultural scientists, planners, and policymakers as it creates a huge gap between the demand of the ever-growing population and the production.\n\nHigh cost of Farm Inputs: Farm inputs include fertilizer, insecticide, pesticides, HYV seeds, farm labour cost, etc. Such an increase puts low and medium-land-holding farmers at a disadvantage.\n\nSoil Exhaustion: The Green Revolution has played a positive role in reducing hunger in India but has negative consequences also. One of which is Soil exhaustion which means the loss of nutrients in the soil from farming the same crop over and over again.\n\nGroundwater depletion: The second negative consequence of the green revolution is the depletion of fresh groundwater. Most of the irrigation in dry areas of Punjab, Haryana, and Western Uttar Pradesh was carried out by excessive use of groundwater. Today fresh groundwater situation in these states is alarming.\n\nGlobal Climatic Change: It has been predicted that climate change\u2019s impact on Indian agriculture will be immense. It is predicted that due to climate change, the temperature will increase, leading to an increase in sea level, more intense cyclones, unpredictable rainfall, etc. These changes would adversely affect the production of rice and wheat. Specifically, a rise in temperature in winter would affect the production of wheat in north India. Production of rice would be affected in coastal areas of India due to the ingress of saline water and an increase in the frequency of cyclones.\n\nImpact of Globalisation: All developing countries have been affected by globalization. The most evident effect is the reduction in farmers\u2019 income and the threat to the viability of cultivation in India. This is due to the rising input costs and falling output prices. This reflects the combination of reduced subsidy and protection to farmers. Trade liberalization exposes these farmers to competition from highly subsidized production in the developed world.\n\nProviding Food Security: Before the introduction of the green revolution in India, we were not self-sufficient in terms of our food grain production. But last few decades agriculture has not grown with the increasing population and to ensure food security factors like accessibility, affordability as well nutritional value of the food available should be catered to.\n\nFarmers Suicides: The farmer suicides appear concentrated in regions of high commercialization of Indian agriculture and very high peasant debt. Cash crop farmers seemed far more vulnerable than those growing food crops. Commercialization of the countryside along with a massive decline in investment in agriculture was the beginning of the decline. Privatization of many resources has also compounded the problems.\n\nIndian Agriculture: Important Facts\n\nThe Economic Survey of India 2020-21 report stated that in FY20:\n\nThe total food grain production in the country was recorded at 296.65 million tonnes (up by 11.44 million tonnes compared with 285.21 million tonnes in FY19).\nThe government has set a target to buy 42.74 million tonnes from the central pool in FY21; this is 10% more than the quantity purchased in FY20.\nFor FY22, the government has set a record target for farmers to raise food grain production by 2% with 307.31 million tonnes of food grains.\nIn FY21, production was recorded at 303.34 million tonnes against a target of 301 million tonnes\nGross Value Added (GVA) by agriculture, forestry, and fishing was estimated at Rs. 19.48 lakh crore in FY20.\nThe share of agriculture and allied sectors in GVA of India at current prices stood at 17.8 % in FY20.\nConsumer spending in India will return to growth in 2021 after the pandemic-led contraction, expanding by as much as 6.6%.\n\nAlso read:\u00a0\n\nAgriculture export policy\nNew Schemes for Farmers",

Privatized seeds, inputs, and markets are inaccessible and expensive for peasants. Indian farmers increasingly find themselves in a vicious cycle of debt, because of the high production costs, high-interest rates for credit, the volatile market prices of crops, the rising costs of fossil fuel-based inputs, and private seeds. Debt is a problem for farmers in India in the end pushing them towards poverty as well.\u201d\n\nUnder such conditions, \u2018zero budget\u2019 farming promises to end a reliance on loans and drastically cut production costs, ending the debt cycle for desperate farmers.\n\nThe word \u2018budget\u2019 refers to credit and expenses, thus the phrase \u2018Zero Budget\u2019 means without using any credit, and without spending any money on purchased inputs. \u2018Natural farming\u2019 means farming with nature and without chemicals.\n\nIn other words, Zero Budget Natural Farming is a method of chemical-free agriculture drawing from traditional Indian practices. It relies on Agro-ecology.\n\n\ud83d\udc49 Which year are YOU targeting for success in the IAS/IPS/IFS Exam? \ud83d\ude80\n\n(1) \u21d2 UPSC 2025: Prelims cum Mains\n\n(2) \u21d2 UPSC 2026: Prelims cum Mains\n\n(3) \u21d2 UPSC 2027 Prelims cum Mains\n\nTip: Know more about ClearIAS Courses (Online/Offline)\n\nIt was originally promoted by Maharashtrian agriculturist and Padma Shri recipient Subhash Palekar, who developed it in the mid-1990s as an alternative to the Green Revolution\u2019s methods driven by chemical fertilizers and pesticides, and intensive irrigation.\n\nWhat is Agro-Ecology?\n\nAgroecology is sustainable farming that works with nature. While ecology is the study of relationships between plants, animals, people, and their environment and the balance between these relationships.\n\nAgroecology is the application of ecological concepts and principles in farming.\n\nAgroecology promotes farming practices that:\n\nMitigate climate change by reducing emissions, recycling resources, and prioritizing local supply chains.\nWork with wildlife by managing the impact of farming on wildlife and harnessing nature for functions like pollinating crops and controlling pests.\nHelps farmers and communities by giving power to approaches that adapt agricultural techniques to suit the local area and its specific social, environmental, and economic conditions.\n\nAgroforestry is the best example of agroecological practices. It is the practice of combining trees and farming; it demonstrates how food production and nature can co-exist.\n\nGrazing farm animals under trees gives them shelter and fodder, whilst their manure enriches the soil.\n\nPlanting trees on land normally used to grow cereal crops can provide other benefits like fruits, nuts, or timber. This provides another income stream for farmers and also prevents soil erosion, as the deep roots of trees help create a healthy soil structure.\n\nWhy do we need zero budget natural farming?\nThe need was intensified by the rising cost of these external inputs causing indebtedness and suicide among farmers, while the impact of chemicals on the environment and long-term fertility was devastating.\nWithout the need to spend money on these inputs or take loans to buy them the cost of production could be reduced and farming made into a \u201czero budget\u201d exercise, breaking the debt cycle for many small farmers.\nMethods used in ZBNF\n\nThe four pillars of ZBNF are:\n\nBijamrutha (Seed treatment)\nJeevamrutha (No fertilizers and pesticides)\nMulching (Soil, straw, and live)\nWhapasa (Soil moisture)\n\nZBNF promotes the application of\u00a0jeevamrutha, a mixture of fresh desi cow dung and aged desi cow urine, jaggery, pulse flour, water, and soil on farmland.\n\nThis is a fermented microbial culture that adds nutrients to the soil and acts as a catalytic agent to promote the activity of microorganisms and earthworms in the soil.\nAbout 200 liters of jeevamrutha should be sprayed twice a month per acre of land; after three years, the system is supposed to become self-sustaining.\n\nAnother mixture, called\u00a0bijamrita, is used to treat seeds, and concoctions using neem leaves and pulp, tobacco, and green chilies are prepared for insect and pest management.\n\nThe ZBNF method also promotes soil aeration, minimal watering, intercropping, bunds, and topsoil mulching and discourages intensive irrigation and deep ploughing. Acchadana (Mulching) protects topsoil during cultivation and does not destroy it by tilling.\n\nWhapasa is the condition where there are both air molecules and water molecules present in the soil, thereby helping in reducing irrigation requirements.\n\nSurveys supporting the ZBNF\nThe National Sample Survey Office (NSSO) data shows that almost 70% of agricultural households spend more than they earn and more than half of all farmers are in debt.\nIn States such as Andhra Pradesh and Telangana, levels of indebtedness are around 90%, where each household bears an average debt of \u20b91 lakh.\nTo achieve the Central government\u2019s promise to double farmers\u2019 income by 2022, one aspect being considered is natural farming methods such as the ZBNF which reduce farmers\u2019 dependence on loans to purchase inputs they cannot afford. Meanwhile, inter-cropping allows for increased returns.\nThe Economic Survey has also highlighted the ecological advantages.\nThe FAO (Food and Agriculture Organisation of the united nations) also supports and encourages the ZBNF methodologies.\nIn June 2018,\u00a0Andhra Pradesh rolled out an ambitious plan to become\u00a0India\u2019s first State to practice 100% natural farming by 2024.\nArguments against Zero budget natural farming\nThough limited studies in Andhra Pradesh and Maharashtra have shown a decline in the input costs and improvement in yields; the long terms returns were seen dropping in a few years.\nThe wholesale move away from conventional methods to ZBNF without widescale studies on yield may result in a negative impact on the agro sector.\nSikkim, India\u2019s first organic state also has seen a drop in output and income after a few years.\nZBNF has helped preserve soil fertility, but its role in boosting productivity and farmers\u2019 income is not satisfactory yet.\nZBNF encourages the need for an Indian breed cow, whose numbers are declining at a fast pace. According to Livestock Census, the country\u2019s total population of indigenous and nondescript cattle has dropped by 8.1%.\nThe Paramparagat Krishi Vikas Yojana, which was meant to promote organic farming and soil health has been allocated Rs 325 crore only, whereas Rashtriya Krishi Vikas Yojana, a flagship Green Revolution scheme had an allocation of Rs 3,745 crore for the financial year 2019-20.\nPresent scenario\nNITI Aayog has been promoting the idea of Zero budget natural farming and supporting multi-location studies for assessing the pros and cons of the methods.\nThe Indian Council of Agriculture Research (ICAR) is studying the ZBNF methods practised by basmati and wheat farmers in Uttar Pradesh, Punjab, Haryana, and Uttarakhand.\nThe funding shortage is also been looked into parallel with the scientific studies.\nZero-budget natural farming (ZBNF) in news\n\nPrime Minister Modi announced on 19th November 2021 that the new farm laws enacted in 2019 will be repealed in the winter session of Parliament.\n\nHe also added that the government has decided to implement zero-budget natural farming.\n\nWay forward\n\nOther aspects in structural and economic marketing also need to be addressed to complement the Zero budget natural farming method which may include:\n\nImproving agricultural market infrastructure\nExpanding the procurement mechanisms to more foodgrains and non-foodgrains\nPrice deficiency payment systems for a few crops\nMSP and cost of cultivation balance\nMinimum export price for agricultural commodities should be a rethink\nOther agricultural and farmer schemes should be linked with schemes like MGNREGS for reducing costs of cultivation.\n\nRead:\n\nShould India focus on natural farming?"
