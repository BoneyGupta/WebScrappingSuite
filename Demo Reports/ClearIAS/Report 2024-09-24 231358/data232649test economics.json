They are (1) Land (2) Labour (3) Physical Capital and (4) Human Capital.\n\nWhy is production low in many economies?\n\nGoods and services are scarce because the four factors of production (land, labour, capital, and entrepreneurship) are scarce.\n\n\ud83d\udc49 Which year are YOU targeting for success in the IAS/IPS/IFS Exam? \ud83d\ude80\n\n(1) \u21d2 UPSC 2025: Prelims cum Mains\n\n(2) \u21d2 UPSC 2026: Prelims cum Mains\n\n(3) \u21d2 UPSC 2027 Prelims cum Mains\n\nTip: Know more about ClearIAS Courses (Online/Offline)\n\nBasic Concepts of the Indian Economy\n\nThe main areas covered in this article are \u2013 national income, monetary policy, fiscal policy, and balance of payments(BoP).\n\nAlso read: Dollarization of Economy\n\nNational Income\n\nUnder the broad topic of national income, you may hear terms like GDP, GNP, NNP etc.\n\nGDP: Gross Domestic Product (GDP) is the total money value of final goods and services produced in the economic territories of a country in a given year.\n\nGDP stands for the total value of goods and services produced inside the territory of India irrespective of whom produced it \u2013 whether by Indians or foreigners.\n\nTo give an approximate idea, let\u2019s assume the total value of goods and services produced in India to be around 100 lakh crore Indian rupees or around 2 trillion US dollars.\n\nThis is the value of Indian GDP when expressed at the current market price.\n\nGNP:\u00a0Gross National Product (GNP) is the total value of goods and services produced by the people of a country in a given year.\n\nIt is not territory specific.\n\nIf we consider the GNP of India, it can be seen that GNP is lesser than GDP.\n\nAlso, see Indian Economy: Issues Related to Planning.\n\nMonetary Policy\n\nMonetary Policy refers to the policy of the central bank. India Reserve Bank of India (RBI) is responsible for monetary policy. Repo, Reverse Repo, CRR, SLR etc are part of monetary policy.\n\nREPO rate\n\nREPO\u00a0means\u00a0Re\u00a0Purchase\u00a0Option \u2013 the rate by which RBI gives loans to other banks. Bank re-purchases the securities deposited with RBI at the REPO rate.\n\nLet\u2019s assume that the current REPO rate is 4.5%. This means RBI gives loans to other banks at a 4.5% interest rate.\n\nReverse REPO rate\n\nRBI at times borrows from banks at a rate lower than the REPO rate, and that rate is known as the Reverse REPO rate.\n\nLet\u2019s assume that the current Reverse REPO rate is 4%. This means banks give loans to RBI at a 4% interest rate.\n\nREPO and Reverse Repo are two major options under LAF (Liquidity Adjustment Facility).\n\nAlso see: REPO and CRR Rate Cuts \u2013 What Should You Understand?\n\nMarginal Standing Facility (MSF)\n\nMSF is the rate at which scheduled commercial banks could borrow money overnight from RBI against approved securities.\n\nThe borrowing limit of banks under the marginal standing facility is 2 per cent of their respective Net Demand and Time Liabilities (NDTL).\n\nLet\u2019s assume the current MSF Rate is 5.5%. This means commercials banks can borrow money from RBI overnight equal to 2% of their deposits at a 5.5% interest rate. You may note that MSF rate is usually higher than the REPO rate.\n\nBank Rate\n\nThe bank rate is a higher rate, (usually 1% higher than the REPO rate) charged by RBI when it gives loans to commercial banks.\n\nTo get a figure, let\u2019s assume the present bank rate is 5.5 %. This is higher than the REPO rate of 4.5%. However, you may wonder how Bank Rate is different from MSF.\n\nThe Bank rate is different from MSF in the nature that the Bank rate is long term. It applies to all commercial banks and there is no limitation like 2 per cent of their respective Net Demand and Time Liabilities (NDTL).\n\nAlso read: Effects of Liberalization on the Indian Economy\n\nCRR\n\nCRR corresponds to Cash Reserve Ratio.\n\nIt corresponds to the percentage of liquid reserves each bank have to keep as cash reserve with RBI (in their current accounts) corresponding to the deposits they have.\n\nBanks will not get any interest for these deposits.\n\nTo get a mental picture, let\u2019s assume the present CRR is 3%.\n\nSLR\n\nSLR (Statutory Liquidity Ratio) corresponds to the percentage of liquid reserves each bank have to keep as cash reserve with themselves corresponding to the deposits they have.\n\nBanks have to mandatory keep reserves corresponding to SLR locked with themselves in the form of gold or government securities.\n\nLet\u2019s assume the present SLR is 18.5 %.\n\nThe main difference between CRR and SLR is that banks need to keep CRR with RBI, but SLR with themselves, but locked.\n\nCRAR\n\nCapital to Risk-Weighted Assets Ratio is arrived at by dividing the capital of the bank by aggregated risk-weighted assets.\n\nThe higher the CRAR of a bank the better capitalized it is.\n\nFiscal Policy\n\nFiscal policy refers to the policy actions of the Government. Budget, tax, subsidies, expenditure etc. form part of the fiscal policy. You might need to understand various deficits like Fiscal Deficit and Primary Deficit as part of Fiscal Policy.\n\nFiscal Deficit (FD): \u00a0The\u00a0fiscal deficit is the difference between the government\u2019s total expenditure and its total receipts (excluding borrowing). In layman\u2019s terms, FD corresponds to borrowings and other liabilities.\n\nBalance of Payments\n\nCurrent Account Deficit (CAD):\u00a0Current Account is the sum of the\u00a0balance of trade\u00a0(exports minus imports of goods and services),\u00a0net factor income\u00a0(such as interest and dividends) and\u00a0net transfer payments (such as foreign aid). The current account deficit in simple terms is dollars flowing in minus dollars flowing out.\n\nAlso, see Fiscal Deficit and Current Account Deficit.\n\nCapital Account Deficit:\u00a0Capital account Deficit occurs when payments made by a country for purchasing foreign assets exceed payments received by that country for selling domestic assets. (For example, if Indians are buying a lot of properties in the US, but if Americans are not buying any properties or buildings in India, India will have a Capital Account Deficit.)\n\nA deficit in the\u00a0capital account means money is flowing out of the country, but it also suggests the nation is increasing its claims on foreign assets. In other words at times of Capital Account Deficit, foreign investment in domestic assets is less and investment by the domestic economy in foreign assets is more.

Read this article to know more.\n\nThe objective of any economy is to produce goods and services.\n\nThe more goods and services a country produces, the more income the country generates.\n\nThen, why can\u2019t we produce more goods and services? What are the requirements for the production of goods and services?\n\nTable of Contents\n\nWhat are the factors of production?\n1. Land (Natural Resources)\n2. Labour (Human Resources)\n3.

They are (1) Land (2) Labour (3) Physical Capital and (4) Human Capital.\n\n\ud83d\udc49 Which year are YOU targeting for success in the IAS/IPS/IFS Exam? \ud83d\ude80\n\n(1) \u21d2 UPSC 2025: Prelims cum Mains\n\n(2) \u21d2 UPSC 2026: Prelims cum Mains\n\n(3) \u21d2 UPSC 2027 Prelims cum Mains\n\nTip: Know more about ClearIAS Courses (Online/Offline)\n\nEvery production is organised by combining land, labour, physical capital and human capital, which are known as factors of production.\n\n1. Land (Natural Resources)\n\nThe first factor of production is land.\n\nHowever, in economics, by land, we mean all that is given to us free by nature.\n\nThis includes not just land, but anything that comes from the land.\n\nMost of the natural resources like soil, water, forests, minerals, petroleum, sunlight, wind etc come under the category of land \u2013 the first factor of production.\n\nNote: The income that the owners of the land earn in return for land resources is called rent.\n\n2. Labour (Human Resources)\n\nWhile natural resources are one factor of production, human resources are another.\n\nThe second factor of production\u00a0 \u2013 Labour \u2013 includes all efforts of human beings used for the production of goods and services. Labour include physical and mental labour.\n\nNote: The income earned by labour resources is called wages.\n\n3. Physical Capital (Man-made Resources)\n\nCapital includes all the man-made resources used for producing goods and services like buildings, machines, equipment, vehicles, stock of materials etc.\n\nCapital denotes all tools humans use to produce goods and services. For example, a stethoscope is the capital of a doctor.\n\nPhysical capital can be broadly divided into two categories \u2013 Fixed Capital and Working Capital.\n\nTools, machines, buildings etc that can be used in production over many years are called fixed capital.\n\nRaw materials and money in hand are called working capital. Unlike tools, machines and buildings, these are used up in production.\n\nYou should note here that some economists do not consider money in hand as capital. This is because money merely facilitates trade, but it is not in itself a productive resource. Only if it is a productive resource, it can be considered as capital (fixed capital). It is not money but the capital goods such as machinery and tools bought by the money that are used to produce goods and services.\n\nNote: The income earned by owners of capital resources is interest.\n\n4. Human Capital (Entrepreneurship OR Entrepreneur OR Enterprise)\n\nOnly those with knowledge and entrepreneurial skills will be able to put together land, labour and physical capital and produce an output.\n\nThus the fourth factor of production is entrepreneurship. These days, entrepreneurship (the knowledge and skillset) is also known as Human Capital.\n\nUnless somebody takes an initiative, no business can be started. The one who takes this initiative is termed an entrepreneur.\n\nAn entrepreneur is a person who combines the other factors of production \u2013 land, labour, and capital \u2013 to earn a profit.\n\nThink of the entrepreneurship of Bill Gates, Elon Musk, or Jeff Bezos.\n\nNote: The income accruing to the entrepreneur is termed as profit.\n\nIncome Types: Factor Income and Non-Factor Income\n\nWhat is the meaning of income?\n\nWhat are the types of income?\n\nWe have so far seen that people receive different types of incomes \u2013 rent, wages, interest, and profit.\n\nWe also receive gifts and donations from others without giving anything in return.\n\nAll these incomes can be grouped into two types of incomes \u2013 Factor incomes and Non-factor incomes\n\nFactor Income\n\nA factor income is an income accruing to a factor of production in return for the services rendered to the production unit.\n\nFor example for the services rendered, land receives rent, labour receives wages, capital receives interest, and entrepreneur receives profit.\n\nNon- factor income\n\nThere are certain money receipts that do not involve any sacrifice on the part of their recipients. They are not earned by playing a role as a factor of production \u2013 hence this income has no connection with the production of any goods and services. Such incomes are known as non-factor income.\n\nExamples include\u00a0gifts, donation charities, taxes, fines etc.\n\nNo production activity is involved in getting these incomes.\n\nThese incomes are also called transfer incomes because such income merely represents the transfer of money without any good or service being provided in return for the receipts.\n\nThese incomes are not included in national income.\n\nWhy is it not easy to produce more goods and services?\n\nLet\u2019s try to find the answer to the question we raised at the beginning.\n\nWe have now learned that if we produce more goods and services we earn more income. It can be either as rent, wages, interest, or profit.\n\nThe more income a country generates, the richer it will become.\n\nThen, why nations are not able to increase production? Why is it not easy to increase Gross Domestic Product (GDP)?\n\nIt is not easy to produce more goods are services because factors of production are limited in nature.\n\nYes, goods and services are scarce because the four factors of production (land, labour, capital, and entrepreneurship) are scarce.\n\nOnce we realise this concept, it is easy to understand most of the economic principles.\n\nEconomics is the study of how society allocates these scarce resources (land, labour, capital, and entrepreneurship) to produce output (goods and services).\n\nThe scarce resources \u2013 four factors of production \u2013 land, labour, capital, and entrepreneurship \u2013 form the building blocks of any economy."

            "[CONTENT]": "India has shifted to a new GDP series. The organisation responsible for calculating national income \u2013 CSO (Central Statistical Organisation) \u2013 adopted a new series based on the year 2011-12 instead of the previous 2004-05.\n\nOne might need to understand a few technical terms like GVA at basic prices, production tax, product tax etc. to understand the changes brought about in the new series, which\u00a0is explained below.\n\nTable of Contents\n\nNational Income\nGDP\nFactor Cost vs Basic Price vs Market Price\nGVA\nIndian GDP series \u2013 Base Year 2004-05\nIndian GDP series \u2013 Base Year 2011-12\nResults of the change\nProduction taxes vs Product taxes\nGDP at Factor Cost vs GVA at Basic Prices\nSummary\nModel Prelims Questions about the Indian GDP series\nReference:\nNational Income\n\n\nThe total income of a nation can be expressed using many parameters like GDP, GNP, NDP, NNP etc. There are again sub-variations like GDP at factor cost, GVA at basic price, GDP at market price etc.\n\nGDP\nGross Domestic Product (GDP) is the total money value of all final goods and services produced in the economic territories of a\u00a0country in a given year.\nIn simple\u00a0terms, GDP is\u00a0the product of the quantity of goods (and services) produced with their final price (value).\nGDP can be expressed at the constant price and at the current price. Constant price calculations are inflation adjusted (real GDP), while current price calculations include the inflation component too (nominal GDP).\nGDP can also be expressed at factor cost and market prices.\nFactor Cost vs Basic Price vs Market Price\n\nGeneral Relationship between Factor Cost and Market Price:\u00a0Factor Cost + Indirect Tax \u2013 Subsidies = Market Price.\nThe relationship between Factor Cost and Basic Price:\u00a0Factor cost + production tax \u2013 production subsidies = Basic prices.\nThe relationship between Basic Price and Market Price: Basic Price + Product tax \u2013 Product Subsidy = Market Price.\nNote: Thus, it is clear that market price includes both product tax as well as production tax while excludes both product and production subsidies.\nBasic price: \u00a0Basic prices exclude any taxes on products the producer receives from the purchaser and passes on to the government (Eg: GST or Sales Tax or Services Tax) but include any subsidies the producer receives from government and uses to lower the prices charged to purchasers. In simple terms, basic price is the subsidized price without tax.\nGDP\n\t\nFactor Cost\n\t\nMarket Price\n\n\nConstant Price\u00a0\n\t\nGDP-CoP-FC\n\t\nGDP-CoP-MP\n\n\nCurrent Price\n\t\nGDP-CuP-FC\n\t\nGDP-CuP-MP\nGVA\nGVA is defined as the value of output less the value of intermediate consumption. For example, if the value of final output is Rs.25 and that of an intermediate product is Rs.17, then the value addition is Rs.8. The gross value addition \u2013 when value additions at all intermediate stages are calculated should be equal to the GDP, ie Rs.25.\nThe significance of GVA: Value added represents the contribution of labour and capital to the production process.\nThe connection between GDP and GVA: As an example consider the case of 1 bottle of orange juice you buy from a retail outlet for Rs. 30. As this is the money value of the final output, Rs.30\u00a0is value for GDP. The same GDP can be calculated by counting the value addition in intermediate stages too.\nGVA\u00a0is calculated usually without discounting for capital consumption or depreciation.\nWhen the value of taxes on products (less subsidies on products) is added, the sum of value added for all resident units gives the value of gross domestic product (GDP).\n\nNote: GDP at market price (current prices): Under the Fiscal Responsibility and Budget Management Act 2003 and Rules thereunder, Ministry of Finance uses the GDP numbers (at current prices) to peg the fiscal targets.\n\nThe relationship between Factor Cost and Basic Prices:\u00a0Factor cost + production tax \u2013 production subsidies = Basic prices.\n\nIndian GDP series \u2013 Base Year 2004-05\nHeadline GDP: Headline GDP was GDP at factor cost.\nProducer-end given preference: GDP at market prices could have been\u00a0derived from factor cost but Indian GDP was always expressed as GDP at factor cost.\nThe relation between GDP at factor cost and GDP at market price: Indirect tax was added and subsidies were subtracted from factor cost, to obtain GDP at market price.\nIndian GDP series \u2013 Base Year 2011-12\n\n\ud83d\udc49 Which year are YOU targeting for success in the IAS/IPS/IFS Exam? \ud83d\ude80\n\n(1) \u21d2 UPSC 2025: Prelims cum Mains\n\n(2) \u21d2 UPSC 2026: Prelims cum Mains\n\n(3) \u21d2 UPSC 2027 Prelims cum Mains\n\nTip: Know more about ClearIAS Courses (Online/Offline)\n\nHeadline GDP: Headline GDP is now\u00a0GDP at market prices as per the new GDP series.\nGVA at basic prices: GDP at market prices is\u00a0derived from a new quantity ie.\u00a0Gross Value Added (GVA) at basic prices.\nThe relation between GVA and GDP: GVA at basic prices + (product taxes) \u2013 (product subsidies) gives GDP at market price.\nConsumer-end given importance: Earlier, domestic GDP was calculated at factor cost, which took into account prices of products received by producers. The new formula takes into account market prices paid by consumers.\nMore data from manufacturing sector: The new GDP has incorporated more comprehensive data on corporate activity and has brought more factories under its umbrella. Now,\u00a0selling and marketing expenses are also reckoned, and not\u00a0just production costs.\nGovernment\u2019s earnings, ie tax \u2013\u00a0subsidies:\u00a0Previously, in India what government received was not included in the headline GDP. Now what it earns by the indirect taxes (such as sales tax and excise duty) after deducting subsidy is also included in headline\u00a0GDP. ie GDP at constant market price.\nCriticism: The objection to this method is that the GDP figure can be manipulated by changing subsidy disbursal or by raising taxes.\nResults of the change\nTaking the old definition and base of 2004-05, India\u2019s GDP growth stood at 4.5 percent in 2012-13 and 4.7 per cent in 2013-14. However, the new Indian GDP series put GDP growth at 5.1 percent for 2012-13 and 6.9 percent for 2013-14.\nThe move towards this method of GDP calculation has brought the method in par with those used by international agencies like IMF, World Bank etc.\nProduction taxes vs Product taxes\nProduction taxes/subsidies are independent of the\u00a0quantity (volume) of production. It is often imposed even if the products are not produced (Eg: tax \u2014land revenues, stamps fees, registration fees tax on the profession; subsidies \u2014\u00a0subsidies to Railways, input subsidies to farmers, subsidies to the village and small industries, administrative subsidies to corporations or cooperatives, etc.).\nProduct taxes/subsidies depend on quantity produced. Product taxes or subsidies are paid or received on per unit of product\u00a0(Eg: tax \u2014excise tax, sales tax, service tax and import and export duties; subsidies \u2014\u00a0food, petroleum and fertiliser subsidies, interest subsidies given to farmers, households, etc)\nGDP at Factor Cost vs GVA at Basic Prices\n\nIn place of GDP at factor cost, gross value added (GVA) at basic prices will be used now.\nFor a producer, GDP at factor cost represents what he gets from the industrial activity. This can be broken down into various components \u2014 wages, profits, rents and capital \u2014 also commonly known factors of production. Aside from these costs, producers may also incur other expenses such as property tax, stamp duties and registration fees, among others.\u00a0Similarly, producers may also receive subsidies (production related) such as input subsidies to farmers and to small industries (not food or petrol subsidies that you get on the final product). It is important to note that only taxes and subsidies on intermediate inputs are adjusted.\nFor arriving at the new gross value added (GVA) at basic prices, production taxes, such as property tax, are added and subsidies are subtracted from GDP at factor cost.\nPut simply, GVA at basic price represents what accrues to the producer, before the product is sold.\nThe price paid by the consumer is not the same as the revenue received by the producer. This is because of the taxes that are paid to the government in the form of indirect taxes. Similarly, the consumer may receive subsidies on food or petrol.\nGVA at basic prices will include production taxes and exclude production subsidies available on the commodity.\nGVA at factor cost includes no taxes and excludes no subsidies.\nGDP at market prices include both production and product taxes and excludes both production and product subsidies.\nSummary\nIn simple terms, for any commodity, the basic price is the amount receivable by the producer from the consumer\u00a0for a unit of a product minus any\u00a0tax on the product\u00a0plus any\u00a0subsidy on the product.\nGDP \u2013 can be calculated as the final value of the output. It can also be calculated as the sum of value additions done in different stages to obtain the final output.\nGDP at factor cost \u2192\u00a0GVA at basic prices \u2192 GDP at market prices.\nThe objection to this method is that the GDP figure can be manipulated by changing subsidy disbursals or raising taxes\nModel Prelims Questions about the Indian GDP series\n\nQn: Which among the following is not added\u00a0while calculating GDP at market prices?\n\nA \u2013 Product tax.\nB \u2013 Product subsidy.\nC \u2013 GDP at factor cost.\nD \u2013 GVA at basic prices.\n\nRight Answer =\u00a0B \u2013 Product subsidy.\n\nQn: Which among the following statement(s) regarding India\u2019s new GDP series is/are true?\n\nGVA at basic prices is the new headline GDP.\nProduction taxes may be imposed even when the total quantity produced is zero.\nValue added represents the contribution of labour and capital to the production process.\n\nAnswer Choices:\n\nA \u2013 1 only.\nB \u2013 2 and 3 only.\nC \u2013 All the above.\nD \u2013 None of the above.\n\nRight Answer =\u00a0B \u2013 2 and 3 only.\n\nReference:\nAll about the new formula.\nIndirect taxes raise GDP."

            "[CONTENT]": "What is inflation? What are the problems associated with it? How to measure inflation rates? What are the types? Read further to know more.\n\nInflation is defined as a situation where there is a sustained, unchecked increase in the general price level and a fall in the purchasing power of money. Hence, it\u00a0is a condition of price rise.\n\nThe reason for price rise can be classified under two main heads : (1) Increase in demand and (2) Reduced supply.\n\nTable of Contents\n\nInflation explained with an example\nInflation Rates in India\nHow to measure the Inflation rate?\nHeadline Inflation vs Core Inflation\nHeadline Inflation\nCore Inflation (Underline or Non-food Inflation)\nCauses of Inflation\nDemand-Pull Factors\nCost-Push Factors\nWhat measures can be taken?\nIs inflation always bad for the economy?\nInflation explained with an example\n\nSuppose for Rs.100, last week you bought 5 Kg. of rice. This means that the cost of 1 kg of rice was Rs. 20. This week when you approached the same shopkeeper and paid Rs.100 to get rice, he gave only 4 Kg of rice. He also explained that the price of rice has increased, and now it is Rs.25 per Kg.\n\nThis example clearly explains the fall in the purchasing power of money. For Rs. 100 you could get 5 Kg of rice before, but now only 4 Kg. So purchasing power of money was reduced. This is inflation.\n\nAnd let\u2019s calculate the rate (percentage). If the price of rice, which was Rs.20 per Kg increased to Rs.25, this corresponds to Rs.5 increase on Rs.20, ie. a 25% increase. So the inflation rate is 25%, which is a very high rate.\n\nInflation Rates in India\n\nThere are different indices in India like Wholesale Price Index(WPI), Consumer Price Index(CPI), etc. which measure inflation rates in India. But what we generally find in headlines is the rate in India is a rate based on WPI. In the last 50 years, the WPI-based rate shows an average inflation rate of around 7-8%.\n\n\ud83d\udc49 Which year are YOU targeting for success in the IAS/IPS/IFS Exam? \ud83d\ude80\n\n(1) \u21d2 UPSC 2025: Prelims cum Mains\n\n(2) \u21d2 UPSC 2026: Prelims cum Mains\n\n(3) \u21d2 UPSC 2027 Prelims cum Mains\n\nTip: Know more about ClearIAS Courses (Online/Offline)\n\nThe highest inflation rate observed in India was\u00a034.68 Percent in September of 1974. The lowest rate touched was\u00a0-11.31 Percent in May of 1976 ( a case of deflation).\n\nHow to measure the Inflation rate?\n\nUnchecked inflation can ruin the whole economy. There are many examples from African and South American economies which got shattered by the high rates. But who measures the inflation rate in India? And what are the types of Inflation indices in India? Let\u2019s study each of them.\n\nInflation can be measured at three levels \u2013 producer, wholesaler, and retailer (consumer). Prices generally rise at each level till the commodity finally reaches the hand of the consumer.\n\nInflation at the Producer Level\n\nAs of now in India, there is no index to measure inflation at the producer level. A Producer Price Index (PPI) has been proposed, but so far this type of inflation calculation has not started in India.\n\nInflation at Wholesale Level\n\nThis is the most popular rate calculation methodology in India. The index used to calculate wholesale inflation is known as Wholesale Price Index (WPI). This inflation rate is often known as headline inflation. WPI is released by the Ministry of Commerce and Industry.\n\nThough RBI used WPI for most of its policy decisions before 2014. However, the WPI-based inflation calculation was not false proof.\u00a0\u00a0WPI shows the combined price of a commodity basket comprising 676 items. But WPI does not include services, and it neither reflects the bottlenecks between producer and wholesaler nor between wholesaler and retailer (consumer).\n\nHence in 2014, as part of the reforms initiated by RBI governor Raghu Ram Rajan, RBI shifted to CPI for policy decisions.\n\nInflation at Retail Level (Consumer Level)\n\nThe consumer often directly buys from the retailer. So the inflation experienced at retail shops is the actual reflection of the price rise in the country. It also shows the cost of living better.\n\nIn India, the index that shows the rate at the retail level is known as the Consumer Price Index (CPI). CPI is based on 260 commodities but includes certain services too. There were four Consumer Price Indices covering different socio-economic groups in the economy.\n\nThese four indices were the Consumer Price Index for Industrial Workers (CPI-IW); the Consumer Price Index for Agricultural Labourers (CPI-AL); the Consumer Price Index for Rural Labourers (CPI-RL) and the Consumer Price Index for Urban Non-Manual Employees (CPI-UNME).\n\nCPI is now using a new series on the base 2010=100 for all India and States/UTs separately for rural, urban, and combined. The Central Statistics Office (CSO), Ministry of Statistics and Program Implementation releases Consumer Price Indices (CPI). CPI is based on retail prices and this index is used to calculate the Dearness Allowance (DA) for government employees.\n\nHeadline Inflation vs Core Inflation\n\nNow let\u2019s focus on two important terms Headline and Core Inflation.\n\nHeadline Inflation\n\nIt is the measure of total inflation within an economy. It includes price rises in food, fuel, and all other commodities.\n\nThe rate expressed in Wholesale Price Index (WPI) usually denotes the headline inflation. Though Consumer Price Index (CPI) values are often higher, WPI values traditionally make headlines.\n\nCore Inflation (Underline or Non-food Inflation)\n\nIt is also a term used to denote the extent of inflation in an economy. But it does not consider the inflation in food and fuel. This is a concept derived from headline inflation. There is no index for direct measurement of core inflation and now it is measured by excluding food and fuel items from Wholesale Price Index (WPI) or Consumer Price Index (CPI).\n\nAlso read: Household Consumption Expenditure Survey (HCES)\n\nCauses of Inflation\n\nThere can be two sets of factors that can cause inflation in an economy. They are Demand Pull and Cost-Push.\n\nDemand-Pull Factors\nRise in population.\nBlack money.\nRise in income.\nExcessive government expenditure.\nCost-Push Factors\nInfrastructure bottlenecks lead rise in production and distribution costs.\nRise in Minimum Support Price (MSP).\nRise in international prices.\nHoarding and black marketing.\nRise in indirect taxes.\nWhat measures can be taken?\n\nBoth the government and central bank (Reserve Bank) try to tackle inflation with their policies which are known as Fiscal and Monetary Policies respectively.\n\nFiscal policies correspond to tax-related measures taken by the government to control inflation (money supply). RBI through its various monetary policies limits the money supply by altering rates like CRR, Repo, Reverse Repo, etc.\n\nAdministrative measures taken by the government like the strengthening of the Public Distribution System also play a crucial role in curbing inflation.\n\nIs inflation always bad for the economy?\n\nThough high rates are not good for the economy, mild inflation, say under 3%, may turn, at times, useful for the economy. As we hinted in the beginning, inflation can occur because of high demand too. High demand for scarce resources will automatically increase prices.\n\nBut demand for a commodity is a good sign from the industry perspective. Industries now will try to produce more commodities to reap the benefit of high prices and demand. More production will trigger GDP growth.\n\nGlobal inflation is calculated by measuring the average price changes of a basket of goods and services across multiple countries. The process involves comparing the current prices of the selected items with their prices in a base year. The most common method used to calculate inflation is the Consumer Price Index (CPI), which tracks the changes in prices of goods and services consumed by households.\n\nAlso read\u00a0Dearness Allowance: Meaning and Types; Inflation Indexed Bonds"

(This is explained well in one of our earlier articles \u2013 basics of economy concepts).\n\nIn short,\u00a0Monetary policy refers to the use of monetary instruments under the control of the central bank to regulate magnitudes such as interest rates, money supply and availability of credit with a view to achieving the ultimate objective of economic policy.\n\n\ud83d\udc49 Which year are YOU targeting for success in the IAS/IPS/IFS Exam? \ud83d\ude80\n\n(1) \u21d2 UPSC 2025: Prelims cum Mains\n\n(2) \u21d2 UPSC 2026: Prelims cum Mains\n\n(3) \u21d2 UPSC 2027 Prelims cum Mains\n\nTip: Know more about ClearIAS Courses (Online/Offline)\n\nAlso read: Loan Loss Provisions\n\nExpansionary and Contractionary Monetary Policy\n\nWe have already seen that monetary policy refers to the actions undertaken by a nation\u2019s central bank\u00a0to control the\u00a0money supply. Control of money supply helps to\u00a0manage inflation or deflation.\n\nThe monetary policy can be expansionary or contractionary.\n\nAn expansionary monetary policy is focused on expanding (increasing) the money supply in an economy. An expansionary monetary policy is implemented by\u00a0lowering key interest rates thus increasing market liquidity.\n\nA contractionary monetary policy is focused on contracting (decreasing) the money supply in an economy. A contractionary monetary policy is implemented by\u00a0increasing key interest rates thus reducing market liquidity.\n\nHow does the Reserve Bank of India get its mandate to conduct monetary policy?\n\nThe Reserve Bank of India (RBI) is vested with the responsibility of conducting monetary policy. This responsibility is explicitly mandated under the Reserve Bank of India Act, 1934.\n\nRecently there were many changes in the way Monetary Policy of India is formed \u2013 with the introduction of Monetary Policy Framework (MPF), Monetary Policy Committee (MPC), and Monetary Policy Process (MPP). We shall see each of these terms in detail soon.\n\nWhat is the main goal of Monetary Policy of India?\n\nMaintain price stability.\n\nThe primary objective of monetary policy is to maintain price stability while keeping in mind the objective of growth. Price stability is a necessary precondition for sustainable growth.\n\nTo maintain price stability, inflation needs to be controlled. The government of India sets an inflation target for every five years. RBI has an important role in the consultation process regarding inflation targeting. The current inflation-targeting framework in India is flexible in nature.\n\nAlso read: Interest Coverage Ratio \u2013 Explained with Example\n\nFlexible Inflation Targeting Framework (FITF)\n\nFlexible Inflation Targeting Framework: Now there is a flexible inflation targeting framework in India (after the 2016 amendment to the\u00a0Reserve Bank of India (RBI) Act, 1934).\nWho sets the inflation target in India: The amended RBI Act provides for the inflation target to be set by the Government of India, in consultation with the Reserve Bank, once every five years.\nCurrent Inflation Target: The Central Government has notified 4 per cent Consumer Price Index (CPI) inflation as the target for the period from August 5, 2016, to March 31, 2021, with the upper tolerance limit of 6 per cent and the lower tolerance limit of 2 per cent.\nFactors that constitute a failure to achieve the inflation target:\u00a0(1) the average inflation is more than the upper tolerance level of the inflation target for any three consecutive quarters, OR (2) the average inflation is less than the lower tolerance level for any three consecutive quarters.\nThe Monetary Policy Framework (MPF)\n\nWhile the Government of India sets the Flexible Inflation Targeting Framework in India, it is the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) which operates the Monetary Policy Framework of the country.\n\nThe amended RBI Act explicitly provides the legislative mandate to the Reserve Bank to operate the monetary policy framework of the country.\nThe framework aims at setting the policy (repo) rate based on an assessment of the current and evolving macroeconomic situation, and modulation of liquidity conditions to anchor money market rates at or around the repo rate.\nNote: Repo rate changes transmit through the money market to the entire financial system, which, in turn, influences aggregate demand \u2013 a key determinant of inflation and growth.\nOnce the repo rate is announced, the operating framework designed by the Reserve Bank envisages liquidity management on a day-to-day basis through appropriate actions, which aim at anchoring the operating target \u2013 the weighted average call rate (WACR) \u2013 around the repo rate.\nMonetary Policy Committee (MPC)\n\nNow in India, the policy interest rate required to achieve the inflation target is decided by the Monetary Policy Committee (MPC). MPC is a six-member committee constituted by the Central Government (Section 45ZB of the amended RBI Act, 1934).\n\nThe MPC is required to meet at least four times a year. The quorum for the meeting of the MPC is four members. Each member of the MPC has one vote, and in the event of an equality of votes, the Governor has a second or casting vote.\n\nThe resolution adopted by the MPC is published after the conclusion of every meeting of the MPC. Once in every six months, the Reserve Bank is required to publish a document called the Monetary Policy Report to explain: (1) the sources of inflation and(2) the forecast of inflation for 6-18 months ahead.\n\nAlso read: LIBOR (London Interbank Offered Rate)\n\nThe present Monetary Policy Committee (MPC)\n\nThe Central Government constituted the present MPC as under:\n\nGovernor of the Reserve Bank of India \u2013 Chairperson,\u00a0ex officio;\nDeputy Governor of the Reserve Bank of India, in charge of Monetary Policy \u2013 Member,\u00a0ex officio;\nOne officer of the Reserve Bank of India to be nominated by the Central Board \u2013 Member,\u00a0ex officio;\nShashanka Bhide, Senior advisor at National Council for Applied Economic Research (NCAER) \u2013 Member;\nAshima Goyal, Professor at the Indira Gandhi Institute of Development Research in Mumbai\u00a0\u2013 Member; and\nJayanth Varma, Professor, Indian Institute of Management, Ahmedabad \u2013 Member.\n\nNote: Members referred to at 4 to 6 above, will hold office for a period of four years or until further orders, whichever is earlier.\n\nThe Monetary Policy Process (MPP)\n\nThe Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) determines the policy interest rate required to achieve the inflation target.\n\nThe Reserve Bank\u2019s Monetary Policy Department (MPD) assists the MPC in formulating the monetary policy. Views of key stakeholders in the economy and analytical work of the Reserve Bank contribute to the process of arriving at the decision on the policy repo rate.\n\nThe Financial Markets Operations Department (FMOD) operationalises the monetary policy, mainly through day-to-day liquidity management operations.\n\nThe Financial Market Committee (FMC) meets daily to review the liquidity conditions so as to ensure that the operating target of monetary policy (weighted average lending rate) is kept close to the policy repo rate. This parameter is also known as\u00a0the weighted average call money rate (WACR).\n\nMonetary Policy Instruments (MPI)\n\nThere are several direct and indirect instruments that are used for implementing monetary policy.\n\nRepo Rate: The (fixed) interest rate at which the Reserve Bank provides overnight liquidity to banks against the collateral of government and other approved securities under the liquidity adjustment facility (LAF).\nReverse Repo Rate: The (fixed) interest rate at which the Reserve Bank absorbs liquidity, on an overnight basis, from banks against the collateral of eligible government securities under the LAF.\nLiquidity Adjustment Facility (LAF): The LAF consists of overnight as well as term repo auctions. Progressively, the Reserve Bank has increased the proportion of liquidity injected under fine-tuning variable rate repo auctions of a range of tenors. The aim of term repo is to help develop the inter-bank term money market, which in turn can set market-based benchmarks for pricing of loans and deposits, and hence improve the transmission of monetary policy. The Reserve Bank also conducts variable interest rate reverse repo auctions, as necessitated under the market conditions.\nMarginal Standing Facility (MSF): A facility under which scheduled commercial banks can borrow an additional amount of overnight money from the Reserve Bank by dipping into their Statutory Liquidity Ratio (SLR) portfolio up to a limit at a penal rate of interest. This provides a safety valve against unanticipated liquidity shocks to the banking system.\nCorridor: The MSF rate and reverse repo rate determine the corridor for the daily movement in the weighted average call money rate.\nBank Rate: It is the rate at which the Reserve Bank is ready to buy or rediscount bills of exchange or other commercial papers. The Bank Rate is published under Section 49 of the Reserve Bank of India Act, 1934. This rate has been aligned to the MSF rate and, therefore, changes automatically as and when the MSF rate changes alongside policy repo rate changes.\nCash Reserve Ratio (CRR): The average daily balance that a bank is required to maintain with the Reserve Bank as a share of such percentage of its Net demand and time liabilities (NDTL) that the Reserve Bank may notify from time to time in the Gazette of India.\nStatutory Liquidity Ratio (SLR): The share of NDTL that a bank is required to maintain in safe and liquid assets, such as unencumbered government securities, cash and gold. Changes in SLR often influence the availability of resources in the banking system for lending to the private sector.\nOpen Market Operations (OMOs): These include both, outright purchase and sale of government securities, for injection and absorption of durable liquidity, respectively.\nMarket Stabilisation Scheme (MSS): This instrument for monetary management was introduced in 2004. Surplus liquidity of a more enduring nature arising from large capital inflows is absorbed through the sale of short-dated government securities and treasury bills. The cash so mobilised is held in a separate government account with the Reserve Bank.\nSummary\n\nMonetary policy refers to the use of monetary instruments under the control of the central bank to regulate magnitudes such as interest rates, money supply and availability of credit with a view to achieving the ultimate objective of economic policy."

When the rate of interest provided by banks keeps falling, bonds which provide a fixed interest rate for a longer duration will become more attractive. This may drive up the demand for bonds and thus may result in an increase in bond prices.\nIncrease in Foreign bond prices: Even though the demands for bonds as such may increase, the lower interest rates may make domestic bonds less attractive. So the demand for domestic bonds may fall and the demand for foreign bonds may rise.\nA decrease in the exchange rate: \u00a0Lower interest rates tend to be unattractive for foreign investment. This may decrease the currency\u2019s relative value. Reduction in interest rate may result in less foreign investment and thus less foreign currency. As the demand for domestic currency falls and the demand for the foreign currency rises, a decrease in the exchange rate may happen.\nIncrease in exports and BoP: A lower exchange rate may cause exports to increase, imports to decrease and the balance of trade to increase.\nHigher Capital Investment: Lower interest rates lead to higher levels of capital investment.\nWhat is a Contractionary Monetary Policy?\n\nA contractionary monetary policy is focused on contracting (decreasing) the money supply in an economy.\n\nThis is also known as Tight Monetary Policy.\n\nA contractionary monetary policy is implemented by increasing key interest rates thus reducing market liquidity (money supply). Low market liquidity usually negatively affect production and consumption. This may also have a negative effect on economic growth.\n\nWhen RBI adopt a contractionary monetary policy, the central bank\n\nincrease Policy Rates (Interest Rates) like Repo, Reverse Repo, MSF, Bank Rate etc.\nincrease Reserve Ratios like Cash Reserve Ratio (CRR) and Statutory Liquidity Ratio (SLR)\nsells government securities from the market as part of Open Market Operations (OMO) \u2013 taking out liquidity from the market\n\nNow, let\u2019s also try to understand some advance concepts associated with a contractionary monetary policy.\n\nA decrease in Bond prices: Contractionary monetary policy results in an increase in bank interest rates. When the rate of interest provided by banks keeps increasing, bonds which provide an interest rate fixed earlier may become less attractive. This may result in a fall in the demand for bonds and thus may result in a decrease in bond prices.\nA decrease in Foreign bond prices: Even though the demands for bonds as such may fall, the higher interest rates offered in India may make foreign bonds less attractive. So the demand for foreign bonds may fall and the demand for domestic bonds may rise.\nAn increase in the exchange rate:\u00a0 Higher interest rates tend to be attractive for foreign investment. This may increase the currency\u2019s relative value. Increase in interest rate may result in more foreign investment and thus more foreign currency. As the demand for domestic currency increases and the demand for foreign currency falls, an increase in the exchange rate may happen.\nA decrease in exports and BoP: A higher exchange rate may cause exports to decrease, imports to increase and the balance of trade to fall.\nLower Capital Investment: Higher interest rates may lead to lower levels of capital investment.\nUPSC Question from the topic Expansionary/Contractionary Monetary Policy\n\nUPSC CSE 2020) If the RBI decides to adopt an expansionist monetary policy, which of the following would it not do?\n\nCut and optimize the Statutory Liquidity Ratio\nIncrease the Marginal Standing Facility Rate\nCut the Bank Rate and Repo Rate\n\nSelect the correct answer using the code given below :\n\na) 1 and 2 only\nb) 2 only\nc) 1 and 3 only\nd) 1, 2 and 3\n\nCorrect Answer: b) 2 only"

In other words, it is the rate at which banks buy back the securities they keep with the RBI at a later period.\n\nThe current REPO rate is 6.25% as on December, 2022.\n\nBank gives loans to the public at a higher rate, often 1 higher than REPO rate, at a rate known as Bank Rate\u00a0(now bank rate will be 7.25%). RBI at times borrows from banks at a rate lower than REPO rate, and that rate is known as Reverse REPO rate (now 3.25%).\n\nWhat is CRR Rate?\n\nCRR corresponds to Cash Reserve Ratio. It corresponds to the percentage of cash each bank has to keep as cash reserve with RBI (in their current accounts) corresponding to the deposits they have. For example, say if State Bank of India(SBI) got a total deposit of Rs. 1 crore with them, they need to keep 3 % of that as cash reserve with RBI (around 4 lakh rupees).\n\n\ud83d\udc49 Which year are YOU targeting for success in the IAS/IPS/IFS Exam? \ud83d\ude80\n\n(1) \u21d2 UPSC 2025: Prelims cum Mains\n\n(2) \u21d2 UPSC 2026: Prelims cum Mains\n\n(3) \u21d2 UPSC 2027 Prelims cum Mains\n\nTip: Know more about ClearIAS Courses (Online/Offline)\n\nNeed to reduce the CRR?\n\nThe problem with high CRR is that commercial banks lose a significant amount to be locked up in RBI lockers without getting any interest. Banks lose profit as they cannot spend this amount as loans to the public.\n\nThere was a debate regarding CRR between the SBI chief and RBI governor before. A .25% reduction in CRR will pump around 18000 crore rupees back to the banks, which they can use to give loans.\n\nWhy is there a fuss around the REPO rate cut?\n\nThere is a cry from the industrial sector to reduce the REPO rate by RBI as high REPO makes the loans which the corporates take to run their business be costly. Considering that our industrial and service sector was going through a troubled phase, with a low growth rate, a rate cut in REPO was in great demand. Lowering the REPO rate means cheap loans for the public, but that also means high liquidity in the market \u2013 so it can lead to inflation \u2013 which will turn the whole act counterproductive.\n\nWhy did RBI lower the REPO and CRR?\n\nMore than the inflation easing factor, RBI has started to give priority to the growth of the Indian economy. India\u2019s growth rate has been decreasing (now around 5%) for a couple of years, due to external and internal factors. As India\u2019s growth is mainly driven by private players, a high-interest rate (REPO) cannot do any help. The capital-intensive industries need cheap capital and for that, they need cheap loans. Growth is coupled with development in many sectors \u2013 and growth not only provides better employment but more taxes too \u2013 which can be used for social sector initiatives by the government.\n\nAlso read: Other concerns of RBI and Government: Fiscal Deficit and Current Account Deficit"

            "[CONTENT]": "You might have seen news headlines like \u201cIndian rupee falling\u201d or \u201cRupee falls to Rs.70 against US dollar\u201d. Have you ever wondered why rupee is falling? Who fixes the value of the Indian rupee as Rs.70 per 1 US dollar?\n\nLet\u2019s us discuss in this post a few confusing concepts in economics related to the currency market. \u00a0We shall see in this article, the difference between Rupee Devaluation and Rupee Depreciation.\n\nLet\u2019s also trace the value of Indian rupee with respect to US dollar from 1947 and see how a fall in rupee value affects exports and imports.\n\nTable of Contents\n\nWho fixes the value of Indian Rupee against US dollar?\nFixed Rate System vs\u00a0Floating Rate System\nRupee Devaluation vs Rupee Depreciation\nHistory of Indian Rupee: A comparison of Indian Rupee Value vs US dollar\nThe value of the Indian Rupee: Does it matter?\nDepreciation and Appreciation of Indian Rupee: Relation with Exports and Imports\nExports vs Fall in the Indian Rupee Value: The local currency effect\nExports vs Fall in the Indian Rupee Value: The volume effect\nWho fixes the value of Indian Rupee against US dollar?\n\nInteresting question.

Now the value of Indian Rupee (or any other currency) is determined by the market.\n\nYes, Market!\n\nHere market means the currency market.\n\nThe demand and supply forces in the currency market determine the price of each currency.\n\nIf the demand for Indian currency is high, Indian rupee will appreciate (for example 1$ = Rs.40), and if demand is low, it will depreciate (for example, 1$ = Rs.70).\n\nIf market forces determine the value of a currency, that type of system is called Floating Rate System. India has adopted the partial floating rate system since 1975, and from 1993 is fully dependent on Floating Rate System.\n\nThis means that our Prime Minister, Finance Minister or RBI chairperson cannot fix the currency exchange rate at the click of a button. But they still have some control \u2013 through policy measures or by controlling foreign exchange reserves.\n\nFixed Rate System vs\u00a0Floating Rate System\n\nIf the government or RBI fix the exchange rate of a currency (and does not allow any variations according to demand and supply forces in the market), such a system is called the Fixed Rate system. It is also called the Bretton Woods system or Pegged Currency System.\n\nIndia was following this kind of system till 1975 and partial controls followed until 1993. Since this currency valuation mechanism is artificial, most of the countries including India changed to Floating Rate System where currency market determines the value of a currency.\n\nRupee Devaluation vs Rupee Depreciation\n\nThe term devaluation is used when the government reduces the value of a currency under Fixed-Rate System. When the value of the currency falls under the Floating Rate System, it is called depreciation.\n\nRevaluation is a term which is used when there is a rise in currency value in relation with a foreign currency in a\u00a0fixed exchange rate. In\u00a0the floating exchange rate regime, the\u00a0correct term would be\u00a0appreciation.\n\nNote: Altering the face value of a currency without changing its foreign exchange rate is a\u00a0redenomination, not a revaluation.\n\nHistory of Indian Rupee: A comparison of Indian Rupee Value vs US dollar\n\nRemember that we were following a fixed rate system till 1975. We had partial controls on currency market till 1993 when as per IMF standards we liberalized our entire economy.\n\n1947: 1 US$ = 1.00 INR (Sounds interesting, huh? :-))\n1948:\u00a01 US$ = 4.79 INR.\n1965:\u00a01 US$ = 4.79 INR.\n1966:\u00a01 US$ = 7.57\u00a0INR.\n1971:\u00a01 US$ = \u00a08.39\u00a0INR.\n1985:\u00a01 US$ = \u00a012.0 INR.\n1991:\u00a01 US$ = \u00a017.9 INR.\n1993:\u00a01 US$ = \u00a031.7 INR.\n2000: 1 US$ = 45.0 INR.\n2013: 1 US$ = 60.0 INR.\n2017: 1 US$ = 65.0 INR.\n2018:\u00a01 US$ = 74.0 INR.\nThe value of the Indian Rupee: Does it matter?\n\nIt should not be forgotten that the exchange rate of a currency is not really an indicator of the economic strength of a country.\n\nThere are many countries including China which favours the devaluation of the currency.\n\nAlso, the economic position of India in 2017 is far better than that of 1947, though there is a fall in Rupee value.\n\nAt present what should worry the Finance Minister and RBI governor should not the falling Indian Rupee, but the fluctuations in the currency market. What India needs is stabilization of Indian Rupee value, be in Rs. 50, Rs.60 or Rs.70 per 1 US dollar. But if rupee is Rs.60 one day and if it Rs. 65 the next day, it shows high volatility. Such a situation is not good for the economy and that will only trigger more fall in Indian rupee.\n\nDepreciation and Appreciation of Indian Rupee: Relation with Exports and Imports\n\nUPSC has often asked this question \u2013 directly and indirectly \u2013 how does a fall in rupee affects exports and imports? Wait, before analyzing this topic let\u2019s see one more question \ud83d\ude42\u00a0Why do governments devalue their currencies?\n\nAnswer: They do it mainly to improve the balance of trade (or in other words, to increase exports and decrease imports!).\n\nExports vs Fall in the Indian Rupee Value: The local currency effect\n\nA devaluation means that more local currency is needed to purchase imports and exporters get more local currency when they convert the export proceeds (the foreign exchange that they get for their exports).\n\nIn other words: imports become more expensive; importers lose money while exporters earn more money.\n\nThis is supposed to discourage imports \u2013 and to encourage exports and, in turn, to reduce trade deficits.\n\nClear, uh?\n\nWell, that was an explanation with respect to the local currency angle. Let\u2019s see the same case analyzing the volume effect angle as well.\n\nExports vs Fall in the Indian Rupee Value: The volume effect\n\nAssume that India is the exporting country and America as the importing country. India exports apples to America. Assume that India devalued India rupee from Rs. 50 =1 dollar to Rs.100 = 1 dollar. The cost of an apple in India before and after rupee devaluation is Rs.50. Now analyze what will happen.\n\nBefore rupee devaluation: Americans will get only 1 apple for 1 dollar.\nAfter rupee devaluation: Now Americans will get 2 apples for 1 dollar.\n\nThink from the American perspective. For them earlier with 1$, they used to get only 1 apple. Now after falling in Indian rupee, they get 2 apples.\n\nSo importing from India has become really cheaper for America and they will use this case to their maximum advantage.\n\nThis case will favour exporters in India in two ways:\n\n(1) They can now sell more apples (volume effect), trade volume will increase.\n(2) Indian currency they get when converted is now higher than before. (It was Rs.50 before, now it is Rs.100 \u2013 for 1 US$ received)\n\nThus, every time there is a fall in rupee against US dollar, exporters from India are benefited. (Eg: Software companies, seafood exporters etc.)\n\nThis situation badly affects importers or those who wish to visit the US for holidays as they need more local currency to get the same service or product.\n\nHope the confusing topic is clear for you.

In the most simple language, Money Supply is Currency in Circulation plus Deposits in Commercial\u00a0Banks.\n\nMoney supply consists of:\n\ntotal currency circulating in the public plus\nthe non-bank deposits with a commercial bank.\n\nMoney supply includes deposits generated in the banking system resulting from a multiplier effect of movement of currency in the banking system as well as other forms of liquid assets.\n\nWhat is meant by \u2018currency in circulation\u2019?\n\nIt is the total value of the currency (coins and paper currency) that has ever been issued by the Reserve Bank of India minus the amount that has been withdrawn by it.\n\nCurrency in circulation (currency with the public) comprises of:\n\ncurrency notes and coins with the public\ncash in hand with banks.\n\nIt is a major liability component of a central bank\u2019s balance sheet.\n\nMoney Aggregates: Standard Measures of Money Supply\n\nIn short, there are two types of money.\n\nCentral bank money\u00a0(M0) \u2013 obligations of a central bank, including currency and central bank depository accounts.\nCommercial bank money (M1 and M3)\u00a0\u2013 obligations of commercial banks, including current accounts and savings accounts.\n\nIn the money supply statistics, central bank money is M0 while the commercial bank money is divided up into the M1 and M3 components. M2 and M4 components also include Post-Office deposits as well.\n\nGenerally, the types of commercial bank money that tend to be valued at lower amounts are classified in the narrow category of M1 while the types of commercial bank money that tend to exist in larger amounts are categorized in M2 and M3. M3 is the largest of all money aggregates (M1-M3).\n\nNote: In this article, we cover the Monetary Aggregates as per the old convention (M1, M2, M3, and M4). In the new convention, aggregates are represented as NM1, NM2, and NM3. This is covered in detail in the ClearIAS article on the new monetary aggregates.\n\nReserve Money (M0):\n\nReserve money is also called central bank money, monetary base, base money, or high-powered money. It is the base level for the money supply or the high-powered component of the money supply.\n\nIn the most simple language, Reserve Money is Currency in Circulation plus Deposits of Commercial Banks with RBI.\u00a0\n\nMo\n\n= Currency in circulation + Bankers\u2019 deposits with the RBI + \u2018Other\u2019 deposits with the RBI\n= Net RBI credit to the Government + RBI credit to the commercial sector + RBI\u2019s claims on banks + RBI\u2019s net foreign assets + Government\u2019s currency liabilities to the public \u2013 RBI\u2019s net non-monetary liabilities.\nM1 (Narrow Money)\n=Currency with the public + Deposit money of the public (Demand deposits with the banking system + \u2018Other\u2019 deposits with the RBI).\nM2:\n=M1 + Savings deposits with Post office savings banks.\nM3: (Broad Money)\n= M1+ Time deposits with the banking system\n= Net bank credit to the Government + Bank credit to the commercial sector + Net foreign exchange assets of the banking sector + Government\u2019s currency liabilities to the public \u2013 Net non-monetary liabilities of the banking sector (Other than Time Deposits).\nM4:\n=M3 + All deposits with post office savings banks (excluding National Savings Certificates).\nMoney Multiplier (m)\n\nA money multiplier is an approach used to demonstrate the maximum amount of broad money that could be created by commercial banks for a given fixed amount of base money and reserve ratio.\n\nThe money multiplier, m, is the inverse of the reserve requirement, R:\nFor example, with the reserve ratio of 20 per cent, this reserve ratio, R, can also be expressed as a fraction:\nSo then the money multiplier, m, will be calculated as:\n\nThis number is multiplied by the amount of reserves to estimate the maximum potential amount of the money supply. For example, from Rs.100 can be multiplied by 5 to generate Rs.500 money supply if Reserve Ratio is 1/5 (20%) or when Money Multiplier is 5. When Reserve Ratio is 1/4 (25%) or when Money Multiplier is 4, that would generate only Rs. 400 as money supply.\n\nMoney Supply (M3) vs Monetary Base (Mo)\n\nReserve Money (Mo) is also called the monetary base. As mentioned earlier, it denotes the money of RBI. Mo includes Currency in Circulation and Bank\u2019s Reserves.\n\nEven though the money supply can be denoted either as M1 or M3, usually when we speak of money supply, we intend M3. M3 includes Currency in Circulation and Checkable Bank\u2019s Deposits.\n\nDemonetisation and its effect on Money Supply (M3) and Reserve Money (Mo)\n\nDid the government\u2019s move to demonetise Rs 500 and Rs 1,000 currency notes improve the balance sheet of Reserve Bank of India (RBI)? To understand this scenario, we must learn the interplay of currency, reserve money and money supply.\n\nWhen a currency note of a particular denomination ceases to be legal tender, the central bank\u2019s liabilities are reduced to that extent and also the amount of currency in circulation declines.\n\nOn November 8, 2016 Government of India made Rs. 500 and Rs. 1000 notes invalid. This meant that Rs. 15.41 lakh crore worth of high-value legal tender was withdrawn from circulation.\n\nSo, the entire liability of Rs. 15.41 lakh crore due to Rs.500 and Rs.1000 notes in circulation was nullified.\n\nBut the demonetisation impact is neutralised when the demonetised currency is replaced with new accepted currency notes. You may note that, even if an individual chooses to park the cash as deposits with banks, it forms a part of the overall money supply.\n\nThe RBI report after demonetisation had mentioned that 99.3% of all demonetised currency returned to the banking system. The figure was 15.31 lakh crore.\n\nAs 15.31 lakh crore again became part of the RBI, now the net-liability of RBI = Rs.15.41 lakh crore \u2013 Rs.15.31 lakh crore = Rs.0.10 lakh crore.\n\nThis figure (Rs. 10000 crore) was only a nominal reduction in liability, offset by printing and transportation cost of the new currency, which led many experts to point out that the demonetisation experiment was a failure to curb black money. Many criticised the government that it over-estimated the black money in the country.\n\nWhat if the demonetisation was a success?\n\nIf there was a lot of black money in the country, and people choose not to declare and surrender their high-denomination currency notes, then RBI would have gained to the extent that its currency liabilities are lowered.\n\nThe gains it makes in the process could have been transferred to its reserves and then appropriated in its profit and loss account. This would have given it leeway to transfer higher amounts as dividends to the government.\n\nHowever, this scenario didn\u2019t happen.\n\nWhy is the currency in circulation a liability to RBI or government?\n\nLet us examine what is the status of the currency we hold in our hands.\n\nSection 26 of\u00a0the Reserve bank of India Act 1934 (\u201cRBI Act\u201d) states as follows:\n(1) Subject to the provisions of sub-section (2), every banknote shall be legal tender at any place in India in payment or on account for the amount expressed therein and shall be guaranteed by the Central Government.\n\nThis means that the money the public hold in hand or in the bank is a debt guaranteed by the government (to us). The currency thus represents a \u2018public debt\u2019 owed by the government to the holders of the banknotes \u2013 the public."

Reddy) which submitted its report in June 1998.\n\nThe Working Group recommended compilation of four monetary aggregates on the basis of the balance sheet of the banking sector in conformity with the

In fact, and a sense, the Urban Co-Operative Banks (UCBs), the Primary Agricultural Credit Societies (PACS), the Regional Rural Banks (RRBs), and Local Area Banks (LABs) could be considered differentiated banks as they operate in localized areas.\n\nHowever, the present concept of differentiated banks can be said to have been first discussed in 2007. Thereafter, the concept was once again discussed in the Paper \u201cBanking Structure in India \u2013 The Way Forward\u201d, brought out by the Reserve Bank in August 2013. RBI granted in-principle approvals to 11 entities for setting up payments banks (PBs) in August 2015 and 10 for Small Finance Bank (SFB) in September 2015.\n\nSmall Finance Banks (SFBs)\nThey are niche banks that focus on and serve the needs of a certain demographic segment of the population.\nThe objectives of setting up small finance banks will be to further financial inclusion by (1) the provision of savings vehicles (2) supply of credit to small business units; small and marginal farmers; micro and small industries; and other unorganised sector entities, through high technology-low cost operations.\nSFBs were recommended by the NachiketMor committee on financial inclusion.\nScope of activities of SFBs\nThe small finance banks shall primarily undertake basic banking activities of acceptance of deposits and lending to unserved and underserved sections including small business units, small and marginal farmers, micro and small industries, and unorganized sector entities.\nThere will not be any restrictions in the area of operations of small finance banks.\nCriteria for setting up SFBs\nIndividuals/professionals with 10 years of experience in finance, Non-Banking Financial Companies (NBFCs), microfinance companies, and local area banks are eligible to set up SFBs.\nThe minimum paid-up equity capital for small finance banks shall be Rs. 100 crore.\nThe promoter\u2019s minimum initial contribution to the paid-up equity capital of such a small finance bank shall at least be 40 percent and gradually brought down to 26 percent within 12 years from the date of commencement of business of the bank.\nThe foreign shareholding in the small finance bank would be as per the Foreign Direct Investment (FDI) policy for private sector banks as amended from time to time.\nThe small finance banks will be required to extend 75 percent of their Adjusted Net Bank Credit (ANBC) to the sectors eligible for classification as priority sector lending (PSL) by the Reserve Bank.\nSFBs have to maintain the Cash Reserve Ratio (CRR) and Statutory Liquidity Ratio (SLR) as per RBI norms.\nAt least 50 percent of its loan portfolio should constitute loans and advances of up to Rs. 25 lakh.\nWhat can SFBs do?\nSell forex to customers.\nSell mutual funds, insurance, and pensions.\nCan convert into a full-fledged bank.\nWhat Small Finance Banks can\u2019t do?\nExtend large loans.\nCannot float subsidiaries and deal in sophisticated products.\nChallenges to Small Finance Banks\nHave to compete with existing public sector banks and RRBs.\nMicro Finance Institutions (MFI)/NBFCs specialize in micro-lending operations with limited exposure to banking operations; which means they have to hire and train talent from the banking industry.\nThe cost of deposit mobilization will be higher for these banks as they cover rural and underserved segments.\nPayment Banks\nThe objectives of setting up payment banks will be to further financial inclusion by providing (1) small savings accounts and (2) payments/remittance services to migrant labor workforce, low-income households, small businesses, other unorganized sector entities, and other users.\nThey will not lend to customers and will have to deploy their funds in government papers and bank deposits.\nScope of activities\nAcceptance of demand deposits-Payments bank will initially be restricted to holding a maximum balance of Rs. 100,000 per individual customer.\nIssuance of ATM/debit cards-Payments banks, however, cannot issue credit cards.\nPayments and remittance services through various channels.\nBusiness Correspondents (BC) of another bank, subject to the Reserve Bank guidelines on BCs.\nDistribution of non-risk sharing simple financial products like mutual fund units and insurance products, etc.\nThe payment bank cannot undertake lending activities.\nCriteria for setting up Payment banks\nExisting non-bank Pre-paid Payment Instrument (PPI) issuers; and other entities such as individuals/professionals; Non-Banking Finance Companies (NBFCs), corporate Business Correspondents (BCs), mobile telephone companies, supermarket chains, companies, real sector cooperatives; that are owned and controlled by residents; and public sector entities may apply to set up payments banks.\nPromoter/promoter groups should be \u2018fit and proper\u2019 with a sound track record of professional experience or run their businesses for at least five years to be eligible to promote payment banks.\nThe minimum paid-up equity capital for small finance banks shall be Rs. 100 crore.\nMaintains a minimum of 75% of deposits in Government bonds and a maximum of 25% deposits with other scheduled commercial banks.\nThe promoter\u2019s minimum initial contribution to the paid-up equity capital of such payments bank shall at least be 40 percent for the first five years from the commencement of its business.\nThe bank should have a high-powered Customer Grievances Cell to handle customer complaints.\nThe operations of the bank should be fully networked and technology-driven from the beginning, conforming to generally accepted standards and norms.\nWhat can Payment Banks do?\nOffer internet banking, and sell mutual funds, insurance, and pensions.\nHave business correspondents and ATMs.\nOffer bill payment service for customers\nThey can enable transfers and remittances from a mobile phone.\nThey can offer forex services at charges lower than bank\nThey can provide forex cards to travelers, usable as debit or ATM cards all over India.\nThey can also offer card acceptance mechanisms to third parties such as \u201cApple Pay\u201d.\nWhat Payment Banks can\u2019t do?\nOffer credit cards\nExtend loans\nHandle cross-border remittances\nAccept NRI deposits\nChallenges for payment banks\nLow revenue can\u2019t undertake any lending businesses and the income stream is initially restricted to charges on remittances and efficiency of operations.\nRequired to invest a minimum of 75 percent of its \u201cdemand deposit balances\u201d into government securities. This limits their ability to earn from the deposit base as well.\nBanks are already offering most services that payments banks can and hence, for payments banks to offer a new and differentiated proposition will not be easy.\nOther saving instruments like Kisan Vikas Patra, gold bonds, etc have better returns than payment banks.\nExperience from Jan Dhan Yojna has shown that many such no-frill accounts have remained dormant, thus affecting the viability of the banks.\nPayment Banks vs Small Finance Banks\n\nImage courtesy: Times of India\n\nNewly Proposed Differentiated Banks\n\nIn addition to recently licensed differentiated banks such as payments banks and small finance banks, the Reserve Bank has been exploring the possibilities of licensing other differentiated banks such as custodian banks and banks concentrating on wholesale and long-term financing.\n\nCustodian banks: Custodian Banks are specialized financial institutions mainly responsible for safeguarding a firm\u2019s or individual\u2019s financial assets and are typically not engaged in conventional retail lending.\n\nWholesale banks: Wholesale banks are lenders that cater to large corporates that require long-term finance, particularly those engaged in infrastructure development. Typically, these banks raise long-term funds which are exempted from maintaining regulatory requirements like cash reserve ratio and statutory liquidity ratio.\n\nSummary and Way Forward\n\nImage Courtesy: Business Standard\n\nBoth Payments Banks and Small Finance Banks are \u2018niche\u2019 or \u2018differentiated\u2019 banks with the common objective of furthering financial inclusion.\nIndia\u2019s domestic remittance market is estimated to be about Rs 800-900 billion and growing. With money transfers made possible through mobile phones, a big chunk of it, especially that of the migrant labor could shift to this new platform.\nPayment banks can also play a significant role in implementing the government Direct Benefit Transfer scheme, where subsidies on health care, education, and gas are paid directly to beneficiaries\u2019 accounts.\nPayment banks have proved hugely popular in other developing countries. In Kenya, the most cited success story, Vodafone M-Pesa is used by two in three adults to store money, make purchases, and transfer funds to friends, relatives, etc.\n\nRead: \u00a0Paytm Payments Bank Debacle\n\nArticle by: Arun Kumar.

These banks are owned and controlled by the members, who democratically elect a board of directors.\nProfit Allocation: A significant part of the yearly profit, benefits, or surplus is usually allocated to constitute reserves and a part of this profit can also be distributed to the cooperative members, with legal and statutory limitations.\nFinancial Inclusion: They have played a significant role in the financial inclusion of unbanked rural masses. They provide cheap credit to the masses in rural areas.\nWhat are Urban Cooperative banks (UCB)?\n\nThe term Urban Cooperative Banks (UCBs) is not formally defined but refers to primary cooperative banks located in urban and semi-urban areas.\n\nThe Urban Cooperative Banks (UCBs), the Primary Agricultural Credit Societies (PACS), the Regional Rural Banks (RRBs), and Local Area Banks (LABs) could be considered as differentiated banks as they operate in localized areas.\n\nTill 1996, these banks were allowed to lend money only for non-agricultural purposes. This distinction does not hold today.\n\nThese banks were traditionally centred on communities and local workgroups as they essentially lent to small borrowers and businesses. Today, their scope of operations has widened considerably.\n\nHistory of Urban Cooperative Banks\n\nThe inspiration for UCB was the success of the experiments related to the cooperative movement in Britain and the cooperative credit movement in Germany. The origins of the urban cooperative banking movement in India can be traced back to the 19th century when such societies were first set up in India.\n\nCooperative societies are based on the principles of cooperation, mutual help, democratic decision-making, and open membership. Cooperatives represented a new and alternative approach to organization as against proprietary firms, partnership firms, and joint-stock companies which represent the dominant form of commercial organization.\n\nThe first known mutual aid society in India was the \u2018Anyonya Sahakari Mandali\u2019 organized in the erstwhile princely State of Baroda in 1889 under the guidance of Vithal Laxman also known as Bhausaheb Kavthekar.\n\nThe enactment of the Cooperative Credit Societies Act, 1904 gave the real impetus to the movement. The first urban cooperative credit society was registered in Canjeevaram (Kanjivaram) in the erstwhile Madras province in October 1904.\n\nThe most prominent amongst the early credit societies was the Bombay Urban Co-operative Credit Society, sponsored by Vithaldas Thackersey and Lallubhai Samaldas established on January 23, 1906.\n\nThe Maclagan Committee of 1915 was appointed to review their performance and suggest measures for strengthening them. The committee observed that such institutions were suited to cater to the needs of the lower and middle-income classes of society and would encourage the principles of banking amongst the middle classes.\n\nThe Government of India Act in 1919 transferred the subject of \u201cCooperation\u201d from the Government of India to the Provincial Governments.\n\nThe Cooperative Planning Committee (1946) and The Rural Banking Enquiry Committee (1950) recommended the establishment of such banks even in places smaller than taluka towns.\n\nThe first study of Urban Cooperative Banks was taken up by RBI in 1958-59. The Report published in 1961 acknowledged the widespread and financially sound framework of urban cooperative banks and emphasized the need to establish primary urban cooperative banks in new centers and suggested that State Governments lend active support to their development.\n\nRecent developments related to UCB\n\nIn January 2020, the RBI\u00a0revised the Supervisory action Framework (SAF) for UCBs.\n\nIn June 2020, the Central government approved an Ordinance to bring all urban and multi-state cooperative banks under the direct supervision of RBI.\n\nMost recently RBI appointed a committee that suggested 4 tier structure for the UCBs.\n\nTier 1 with all unit UCBs and salary earner\u2019s UCBs (irrespective of deposit size) and all other UCBs having deposits up to Rs 100 crore,\nTier 2 with UCBs of deposits between Rs 100 crore and Rs 1,000 crore,\nTier 3 with UCBs of deposits between Rs 1,000 crore and Rs 10,000 crore and\nTier 4 with UCBs of deposits more than Rs 10,000 crore.\nChallenges faced by cooperative banks:\n1. Changing financial sector trends:\n\nChanges in the financial sector and evolving microfinance, FinTech companies, payment gateways, social platforms, e-commerce companies, and NBFCs challenge the continued presence of the UCBs, which are mostly small in size, lack professional management, and have geographically less diversified operations.\n\n2. The decline in deposits and loans:\n\nThe collapses in the management have led to people losing trust in cooperative banks slowly.\n\n3. Declining contributions:\n\nA report noted that despite a crucial role played by the sector, its share in total agricultural lending diminished considerably over the years from as high as 64% in 1992-93 to just 11.3 % in 2019-20.\n\n4. Declining numbers:\n\nAfter liberalization in licensing policy of 1993, nearly one-third of the newly licensed ones became financially unsound. In 2005, RBI merged the weaker ones together into one unit.\n\n5. Dual control:\n\nThe UCBs were under dual regulation by the state registrar of societies and the RBI. But in 2020, all UCBs and multi-state cooperatives were brought under the supervision of RBI.\n\nWay forward:\n\nThe establishment of the country\u2019s dedicated Ministry of Cooperation is a crucial moment for the history of the cooperative movement.\n\nNow, the establishment of a standard regulatory and supervisory framework, and an umbrella organization, should be given top importance in the advancement of UCBs.\n\nThe RBI is should interpret the Act\u2019s provisions so that they do not disrupt UCBs and people\u2019s faith is restored in the cooperative banking system."

So if the principle or the interest or both the components of a loan is not being serviced to the lender (bank), then it would be considered as a Non-Performing Asset (NPA).\nAny asset which stops giving returns to its investors for a specified period of time is known as Non-Performing Asset (NPA).\nGenerally, that specified period of time is 90 days in most of the countries and across the various lending institutions. However, it is not a thumb rule and it may vary with the terms and conditions agreed upon by the financial institution and the borrower.\nAn example of NPA:\n\nSuppose the State Bank of India (SBI) gives a loan of Rs. 10 crores to a company (Eg: Kingfisher Airlines). Consider that they agreed upon for an interest rate of say 10% per annum. Now suppose that initially everything was good and the market forces were working in support to the airline industry, therefore, Kingfisher was able to service the interest amount. Later, due to administrative, technical or corporate reasons suppose the company is not able to pay the interest rates for 90 days. In that case, a loan given to the Kingfisher Airlines is a good case for the consideration as NPA.\n\nAlso read: Loan Loss Provisions\n\nNPAs definition by Reserve Bank of India (RBI)\nAn asset, including a leased asset, becomes non\u00adperforming when it ceases to generate income for the bank.\nTechnical definition by RBI on NPA on different cases\n\nNPA is a loan or an advance where\u2026\n\n\ud83d\udc49 Which year are YOU targeting for success in the IAS/IPS/IFS Exam? \ud83d\ude80\n\n(1) \u21d2 UPSC 2025: Prelims cum Mains\n\n(2) \u21d2 UPSC 2026: Prelims cum Mains\n\n(3) \u21d2 UPSC 2027 Prelims cum Mains\n\nTip: Know more about ClearIAS Courses (Online/Offline)\n\nInterest and/ or instalment of principal remain overdue for a period of more than 90 days in respect of a term loan.\nThe account remains \u2018out of order\u2019 in respect of an Overdraft/Cash Credit (OD/CC).\nThe bill remains overdue for a period of more than 90 days in the case of bills purchased and discounted.\nThe instalment of principal or interest thereon remains overdue for two crop seasons for short duration crops.\nThe instalment of principal or interest thereon remains overdue for one crop season for long duration crops.\nThe amount of liquidity facility remains outstanding for more than 90 days, in respect of a securitisation transaction undertaken in terms of guidelines on securitisation dated February 1, 2006.\nIn respect of derivative transactions, the overdue receivables representing positive mark-to-market value of a derivative contract, if these remain unpaid for a period of 90 days from the specified due date for payment.\nCategories of Non-Performing Assets (NPAs)\n\nBased upon the period to which a loan has remained as NPA, it is classified into 3 types:\n\nCategories of NPAs\n\t\nCriteria\n\n\nSubstandard Assets\n\t\nAn asset which remains as NPAs for less than or equal to 12 months.\n\n\nDoubtful Assets\n\t\nAn asset which remained in the above category for 12 months.\n\n\nLoss Assets\n\t\nAsset where loss has been identified by the bank or the RBI, however, there may be some value remaining in it. Therefore loan has not been not completely written off.\nHow serious is India\u2019s NPA issue?\n\nMore than Rs. 7 lakh crore worth loans are classified as Non-Performing Loans in India. This is a huge amount.\nThe figure roughly translates to near 10% of all loans given.\nThis means that about 10% of loans are never paid back, resulting in substantial loss of money to the banks.\nWhen restructured and unrecognised assets are added the total stress would be 15-20% of total loans.\nNPA crisis in India is set to worsen.\nRestructuring norms are being misused.\nThis bad performance is not a good sign and can result in crashing of banks as happened in the sub-prime crisis of 2008 in the United States of America.\nAlso, the NPA problem in India is worst when comparing other emerging economies in BRICS.\n\nWhat can be the possible reasons for NPAs?\nDiversification of funds to unrelated business/fraud.\nLapses due to diligence.\nBusines losses due to changes in business/regulatory environment.\nLack of morale, particularly after government schemes which had written off loans.\nGlobal, regional or national financial crisis which results in erosion of margins and profits of companies, therefore, stressing their balance sheet which finally results into non-servicing of interest and loan payments. (For example, the 2008 global financial crisis).\nThe general slowdown of entire economy for example after 2011 there was a slowdown in the Indian economy which resulted in the faster growth of NPAs.\nThe slowdown in a specific industrial segment, therefore, companies in that area bear the heat and some may become NPAs.\nUnplanned expansion of corporate houses during the boom period and loan taken at low rates later being serviced at high rates, therefore, resulting in NPAs.\nDue to mal-administration by the corporates, for example, willful defaulters.\nDue to misgovernance and policy paralysis which hampers the timeline and speed of projects, therefore, loans become NPAs. For example the Infrastructure Sector.\nSevere competition in any particular market segment. For example the Telecom sector in India.\nDelay in land acquisition due to social, political, cultural and environmental reasons.\nA bad lending practice which is a non-transparent way of giving loans.\nDue to natural reasons such as floods, droughts, disease outbreak, earthquakes, tsunami etc.\nCheap import due to dumping leads to business loss of domestic companies. For example the Steel sector in India.\nWhat is the impact of NPAs?\nLenders suffer a lowering of profit margins.\nStress in banking sector causes less money available to fund other projects, therefore, negative impact on the larger national economy.\nHigher interest rates by the banks to maintain the profit margin.\nRedirecting funds from the good projects to the bad ones.\nAs investments got stuck, it may result in\u00a0it may result in unemployment.\nIn the case of public sector banks, the bad health of banks means a bad return for a shareholder which means that the government of India gets less money as a dividend. Therefore it may impact easy deployment of money for social and infrastructure development and results in social and political cost.\nInvestors do not get rightful returns.\nBalance sheet syndrome of Indian characteristics that is both the banks and the corporate sector have stressed balance sheet and causes halting of the investment-led development process.\nNPAs related cases add more pressure to already pending cases with the judiciary.\nWhat are the various steps taken to tackle NPAs?\n\nNPAs story is not new in India and there have been several steps taken by the GOI on legal, financial, policy level reforms. In the year 1991, Narsimham committee recommended many reforms to tackle NPAs. Some of them were implemented.\n\nThe Debt Recovery Tribunals (DRTs) \u2013 1993\n\nTo decrease the time required for settling cases. They are governed by the provisions of the Recovery of Debt Due to Banks and Financial Institutions Act, 1993. However, their number is not sufficient therefore they also suffer from time lag and cases are pending for more than 2-3 years in many areas.\n\nCredit Information Bureau \u2013 2000\n\nA good information system is required to prevent loan falling into bad hands and therefore prevention of NPAs. It helps banks by maintaining and sharing data of individual defaulters and willful defaulters.\n\nLok Adalats \u2013 2001\n\nThey are helpful in tackling and recovery of small loans however they are limited up to 5 lakh rupees loans only by the RBI guidelines issued in 2001. They are positive in the sense that they avoid more cases into the legal system.\n\nCompromise Settlement \u2013 2001\n\nIt provides a simple mechanism for recovery of NPA for the advances below Rs. 10 Crores. It covers lawsuits with courts and DRTs (Debt Recovery Tribunals) however willful default and fraud cases are excluded.\n\nSARFAESI Act \u2013 2002\n\nThe Securitization and Reconstruction of Financial Assets and Enforcement of Security Interest (SARFAESI) Act, 2002 \u2013 The Act permits Banks / Financial Institutions to recover their NPAs without the involvement of the Court, through acquiring and disposing of the secured assets in NPA accounts with an outstanding amount of Rs. 1 lakh and above. The banks have to first issue a notice. Then, on the borrower\u2019s failure to repay, they can:\n\nTake ownership of security and/or\nControl over the management of the borrowing concern.\nAppoint a person to manage the concern.\n\nFurther, this act has been amended last year to make its enforcement faster.\n\nARC (Asset Reconstruction Companies)\n\nThe RBI gave license to 14 new ARCs recently after the amendment of the SARFAESI Act of 2002. These companies are created to unlock value from stressed loans. Before this law came, lenders could enforce their security interests only through courts, which was a time-consuming process.\n\nCorporate Debt Restructuring \u2013 2005\n\nIt is for reducing the burden of the debts on the company by decreasing the rates paid and increasing the time the company has to pay the obligation back.\n\n5:25 rule \u2013 2014\n\nAlso known as, Flexible Structuring of Long Term Project Loans to Infrastructure and Core Industries. It was proposed to maintain the cash flow of such companies since the project timeline is long and they do not get the money back into their books for a long time, therefore, the requirement of loans at every 5-7 years and thus refinancing for long term projects.\n\nJoint Lenders Forum \u2013 2014\n\nIt was created by the inclusion of all PSBs whose loans have become stressed. It is present so as to avoid loan to the same individual or company from different banks. It is formulated to prevent the instances where one person takes a loan from one bank to give a loan of the other bank.\n\nMission Indradhanush \u2013 2015\n\nThe Indradhanush framework for transforming the PSBs represents the most comprehensive reform effort undertaken since banking nationalization in the year 1970 to revamp the Public Sector Banks (PSBs) and improve their overall performance by ABCDEFG.\n\nA-Appointments: Based upon global best practices and as per the guidelines in the companies act, separate post of Chairman and Managing Director and the CEO will get the designation of MD & CEO and there would be another person who would be appointed as non-Executive Chairman of PSBs.\n\nB-Bank Board Bureau: The BBB will be a body of eminent professionals and officials, which will replace the Appointments Board for the appointment of Whole-time Directors as well as non-Executive Chairman of PSBs\n\nC-Capitalization:\u00a0As per finance ministry, the capital requirement of extra capital for the next four years up to FY 2019 is likely to be about Rs.1,80,000 crore out of which 70000 crores will be provided by the GOI and the rest PSBs will have to raise from the market.\n\nFinancial Year\n\t\nTotal Amount\n\n\nFY15-16\n\t\n25,000 Crore\n\n\nFY16-17\n\t\n25,000 Crore\n\n\nFY17-18\n\t\n10,000 Crore\n\n\nFY18-19\n\t\n10,000 Crore\n\n\nTotal\n\t\n70,000 Crore\n\nD-DEstressing:\u00a0PSBs and strengthening risk control measures and NPAs disclosure.\n\nE-Employment:\u00a0GOI has said there will be no interference from Government and Banks are encouraged to take independent decisions keeping in mind the commercial the organizational interests.\n\nF-Framework of Accountability:\u00a0New KPI(key performance indicators) which would be linked with performance and also the consideration of ESOPs for top management PSBs.\n\nG-Governance Reforms: For Example, Gyan Sangam, a conclave of PSBs and financial institutions. Bank board Bureau for transparent and meritorious appointments in PSBs.\n\nStrategic debt restructuring (SDR) \u2013 2015\n\nUnder this scheme banks who have given loans to a corporate borrower gets the right to convert the complete or part of their loans into equity shares in the loan taken company. Its basic purpose is to ensure that more stake of promoters in reviving stressed accounts and providing banks with enhanced capabilities for initiating a change of ownership in appropriate cases.\n\nAsset Quality Review \u2013 2015\n\nClassify stressed assets and provisioning for them so as the secure the future of the banks and further early identification of the assets and prevent them from becoming stressed by appropriate action.\n\nSustainable structuring of stressed assets (S4A) \u2013 2016\n\nIt has been formulated as an optional framework for the resolution of largely stressed accounts. It involves the determination of sustainable debt level for a stressed borrower and bifurcation of the outstanding debt into sustainable debt and equity/quasi-equity instruments which are expected to provide upside to the lenders when the borrower turns around.\n\nInsolvency and Bankruptcy code Act-2016\n\nIt has been formulated to tackle the Chakravyuaha Challenge (Economic Survey) of the exit problem in India. The aim of this law is to promote entrepreneurship, availability of credit, and balance the interests of all stakeholders by consolidating and amending the laws relating to reorganization and insolvency resolution of corporate persons, partnership firms and individuals in a time-bound manner and for maximization of value of assets of such persons and matters connected therewith or incidental thereto.\n\nPubic ARC vs. Private ARC \u2013 2017\n\nThis debate is recently in the news which is about the idea of a Public Asset Reconstruction Companies (ARC) fully funded and administered by the government as mooted by this year\u2019s Economic Survey Vs. the private ARC as advocated by the deputy governor of RBI Mr. Viral Acharya. Economic survey calls it as PARA (Public Asset Rehabilitation Agency) and the recommendation is based on a similar agency being used during the East Asian crisis of 1997 which was a success.\n\nBad Banks \u2013 2017\n\nEconomic survey 16-17, also talks about the formation of a bad bank which will take all the stressed loans and it will tackle it according to flexible rules and mechanism. It will ease the balance sheet of PSBs giving them the space to fund new projects and continue the funding of development projects.\n\nSummary\n\nThe need of the hour to tackle NPAs is some urgent remedial measures. This should include:\n\nTechnology and data analytics to identify the early warning signals.\nMechanism to identify the hidden NPAs.\nDevelopment of internal skills for credit assessment.\nForensic audits to understand the intent of the borrower.\n\nArticle by: Nishant\u00a0Raj.

Good. What is the Twin Balance Sheet Problem of India?\n\nTwin Balance Sheet Problem (TBS) deals with two balance sheet problems. One with Indian companies and the other with Indian Banks.\n\nThus, TBS is two two-fold problem for Indian economy which deals with:\n\nOverleveraged companies\u00a0\u2013 Debt accumulation on companies is very high and thus they are unable to pay interest payments on loans. Note: 40% of corporate debt is owed by companies who are not earning enough to pay back their interest payments. In technical terms, this means that they have an interest coverage ratio less than 1.\n\u00a0Bad-loan-encumbered-banks \u2013\u00a0Non Performing Assets (NPA) of the banks is 9% for the total banking system of India. It is as high as 12.1% for Public Sector Banks. As companies fail to pay back principal or interest, banks are also in trouble.\nOrigin of Twin Balance Sheet Problem in India\n\nOrigin of TBS problem can be traced to the 2000s when the economy was on an upward trajectory.\nDuring that time, the investment-GDP ratio had soared by 11% reaching over 38% in 2007-08. Thus non-food bank credit doubled and capital inflows in 2007-08 reached 9% of GDP. Due to such a boom in the economy, firms started taking risks and abandoned their conservative debt/equity ratios and leveraged themselves up to take advantage of the upcoming opportunities.\nBut Global Financial Crisis (2007-08) reduced growth rates and thus revenues from the investment. Projects that had been built around the assumption that growth would continue at double digit levels were suddenly confronted with growth rates half that level.\nFirms that borrowed domestically suffered when RBI increased interest rates to avoid inflation increasing financial costs.\nEnvironment and land clearances in infrastructure sector delayed the projects.\nThus higher cost, lower revenues, greater financial costs-all squeezed corporate cash flow leading to NPAs in the banking sector.\nPeculiarities of India\u2019s Twin Balance Sheet Problem (TBS):\nIn other countries, corporates over expand during the boom and accumulate obligations which they find difficult to repay. It leads to default and the situation is reached where high NPA levels have triggered banking crises.\nIn India, there have been no bank runs, no stress in the interbank market, no need for any liquidity support and GDP growing at a good pace since the TBS problem first emerged in 2010. Yet the problem has reached to this scale where it threatens the stability of the entire banking system.\nThe reason for this is that major NPAs are concentrated in Public Sector Banks which have the full backing of the government.\nEarlier steps to address the problem of NPA or TBS\n\nIndia had taken different steps to tackle the NPA or TBS problem which already covered in a different article. Insolvency and Bankruptcy code too was in the same direction. Briefing the important schemes again.\n\n1. 5/25 Refinancing of Infrastructure Scheme\nThis scheme offered a larger window for the revival of stressed assets in the infrastructure sector and eight core industry sectors.\nUnder this scheme, lenders were allowed to extend amortisation periods to 25 years with interest rates adjusted every 5 years, so as to match the funding period with the long gestation and productive life of these projects.\nThe scheme thus aimed to improve the credit profile and liquidity position of borrowers, while allowing banks to treat these loans as standard in their balance sheets, reducing provisioning costs.\nIssues faced: However, with amortisation spread out over a longer period, this arrangement also meant that the companies faced a higher interest burden, which they found difficult to repay, forcing banks to extend additional loans (\u2018evergreening\u2019). This, in turn, has aggravated the initial problem.\n2. Private Asset Reconstruction Companies (ARCs)\nARCs acquire NPAs from banks or financial institutions and try to resolve them.\nARCs are a product of and derive their asset resolution powers from the SARFAESI Act.\nThe issue faced: ARCs have found it difficult to recover much from the debtors. Thus they have only been able to offer low prices to banks, prices which banks have found it difficult to accept.\n3. The Strategic Debt Restructuring (SDR) scheme\nThe SDR scheme was introduced in June 2015, under which banks could take over firms that were unable to pay and sell them to new owners.\nThe issue faced: By December 2016, only two sales have been materialised as many firms remained financially unviable.\n4. Asset Quality Review (AQR)\nThe RBI emphasised AQR, to verify that banks were assessing loans in line with RBI loan classification rules. Any deviations from such rules were to be rectified by March 2016.\n5. The Scheme for Sustainable Structuring of Stressed Assets (S4A)\nAn independent agency hired by the banks will decide on how much of the stressed debt of a company is sustainable. The rest (unsustainable) will be converted into equity and preference share.\nThe issue faced: Only one case has been solved under this scheme so far.\nWhy did the above measures fail to solve the TBS problem?\n\n\ud83d\udc49 Which year are YOU targeting for success in the IAS/IPS/IFS Exam? \ud83d\ude80\n\n(1) \u21d2 UPSC 2025: Prelims cum Mains\n\n(2) \u21d2 UPSC 2026: Prelims cum Mains\n\n(3) \u21d2 UPSC 2027 Prelims cum Mains\n\nTip: Know more about ClearIAS Courses (Online/Offline)\n\nLoss recognition: Banks do not recognise stressed assets and continue giving loans. They are reluctant to conduct the asset quality review for their assets.\nCoordination problems: Difficulty in deciding compensation by different banks on Joint Lenders Forums which has not achieved much success.\nCourt cases: Public Sector Banks are reluctant to write down loans as bank managers are afraid of accusation of favouritism.\nLack of Capital: Indradhanush Scheme promised to infuse Rs 70,000 crore into Public Sector Banks by 2018-19. But this amount is not enough and banks need atleastRs 1.8 lakh crore more.\nQuestions over the sustainability of Indian strategy: Phoenix Scenario vs Containment Scenario\nThe Indian strategy is based on the two scenarios:\n1. Phoenix Scenario \u2013 Growth will decrease the bad debt by raising demand and investment cycle.\n2. Containment Scenario \u2013 In this case, one needs to contain the bad loans in nominal terms and slowly their share would reduce in bank sheets.\nEarlier both scenarios seemed feasible but now they are failing as per the recent data. So some new innovative methods are needed to resolve this problem.\nWhat is the solution to the Twin Balance Sheet Problem?\n\nIndia has till now pursued a decentralised approach where individual banks have taken decisions on its own to resolve NPAs. This approach has not resolved the problem and time have now come to create a centralised agency called Public Sector Asset Rehabilitation Agency (PARA).\n\nWhy does India need a\u00a0Public Sector Asset Rehabilitation Agency (PARA)?\n\nIt will be able to resolve not only NPA problems but also bad debts of the companies, thus resolving TBS Problem.\nThe centralised agency would help in fixing the problem faster and the decision will be taken swiftly.\nIt could solve the coordination problem since debts would be centralised in one agency.\nThe stressed debt is heavily concentrated in large companies and such bigger cases can be resolved by an independent agency.\nFailure of Banks and private ARCs in resolving NPA problem till now.\nAn international experience like of East Asian countries has shown that centralised agency can resolve Twin Bet Problem.\nWorking of PARA\nPARA would purchase loans from banks and then work them by different ways like converting debt to equity and selling the stakes in the auction.\nAfter taking off the loans from Public Sector Banks, the government would recapitalize them. Similarly, once the financial viability of the over-indebted enterprises is restored, they will be able to focus on their operations, rather than their finances and will be able to consider new investments.\nFunding of PARA\nRBI may transfer some of the government securities to PARA.\nGovernment funding in the form of securities.\nRest of the money may come from capital markets.\nConclusion\n\nTwin Balance Sheet Problem (TBS) is a major problem that Indian economy is facing today. The past mechanisms of resolving this problem in the form of decentralised approach have failed. There is no point of delaying this problem because the delay is very costly for the economy as impaired banks are scaling back their credit while the stressed companies are cutting their investments. The time has come to adopt the strategy that East Asia adopted during their crises period. The centralised agency in the form of PARA would allow debt problems to be worked out quickly. The time has come for India to consider the same approach.\n\nArticle by: Rahul Sharma, UPSC Topper 2016, With All India Rank 76"

It shows the underperformance and poor financial health of the company.\n\nAlso read: LIBOR (London Interbank Offered Rate)\n\nWhat is the significance of the Interest Coverage Ratio?\n\nCompanies need to have good profits to cover interest payments.\n\nA high-Interest Coverage Ratio is advised to meet its interest obligations and in order to survive future financial hardships (that may arise).\n\nIf a company has a low-interest coverage ratio, there\u2019s a high chance that the company won\u2019t be able to service its debt. This will put the firm at risk of insolvency or bankruptcy.\n\nFirms with an interest coverage ratio lower than one are unable to meet their interest obligations from their income. Such firms are categorized as zombies.\n\nUnproductive firms popularly referred to as \u201czombies\u201d are typically identified using the interest coverage ratio.\n\nSignificance of Interest Coverage Ratio with respect to Indian Companies and Banking System\n\nThe Indian Banking system is recently criticized for the loans given to companies that repeatedly fail to pay back interest or principal.\n\nUpon studying the interest coverage ratio of various companies, it is clear that banks gave loans to zombies without much consideration leading to the Non-Performing Asset (NPA) or bad loan crisis.\n\nEconomic Survey 2020-2021 points out that the share of new loans to zombie firms increased from 5% in 2007-08 to a whopping 27% in 2014-15.\n\nThe share of new loans sanctioned to zombie firms whose interest coverage ratio lies in the bottom quartile is found to increase from 20% in 2007-08 to 43% in 2014-15.\n\nHowever, as the Twin Balance Sheet problem became a major news item, the Reserve Bank of India took strict measures to address the Non-Performing Assets issue.

The bank was founded by Rana Kapoor and Ashok Kapur.\n\nThe bank engaged in highrisk lending, providing loans to those who could not raise funds elsewhere.\n\nThe assets books of Yes bank showed promising growth until 2017 when the problem of Non-Performing Assets (NPAs) came into the highlight.\n\n\ud83d\udc49 Which year are YOU targeting for success in the IAS/IPS/IFS Exam? \ud83d\ude80\n\n(1) \u21d2 UPSC 2025: Prelims cum Mains\n\n(2) \u21d2 UPSC 2026: Prelims cum Mains\n\n(3) \u21d2 UPSC 2027 Prelims cum Mains\n\nTip: Know more about ClearIAS Courses (Online/Offline)\n\nHow big is YES Bank?\n\nYES bank is currently India\u2019s fifth-largest private sector lender.\n\nYes bank had deposits of Rs. 2 lakh crore. Its total assets including loans given are Rs.3.5 lakh crore.\n\nThe bank has 18000+ employees and has more than 1100 branches and 1300 ATMs.\n\nYES Bank Crisis\n\nLoans not repaid is a major issue of most banks in India. These bad loans are called Non-Performing Assets (NPA). The Gross Non-Performing Assets of YES Bank was 7.4% of the gross advances at the end of September 2019. It became 18.87 per cent of the bank\u2019s total loan book (or Rs 40,709.20 crore) at the end of December 2019.\n\nThe crisis at YES Bank started when the huge NPA issue at YES Bank became public.\n\nFor the quarter ended December 2019, Yes Bank reported a loss of Rs 18,564 crore compared to a profit of Rs 1001 crore in the same quarter in 2018. The bank\u2019s net loss would have been wider at Rs 24,778 crore in the third quarter if it weren\u2019t for a tax write-back of Rs 6,214 crore. In the preceding quarter, Yes Bank had reported a net loss of Rs 600 crore.\n\nBad loans\n\nThe founder Rana Kapoor had personal connections with most of the high-level industrialists who sought his help for loans, which went not repaid. Some of the big defaulters to whom the bank had advanced funds included IL&FS, Anil Ambani group, CG Power, Cox & Kings, Caf\u00e9 Coffee Day, Essel group, Essar Power, Vardaraj Cement, Radius Developers, and Mantri Group.\n\nThe Bad loans of Yes Bank are estimated to be around Rs.40000 crore (Gross NPA). While the Gross NPA was around 19% of advances, Net NPA was around 6% of loans at the end of December 2019.\n\nEroded capital base\n\nThe overall capital adequacy ratio dropped to 4.2 per cent from 16.3 per cent in the preceding quarter.\n\nThe capital base \u2013 specifically the Core Equity Tier-1 ratio \u2013 fell to 0.6 per cent at the end of the quarter compared to 8.7 per cent in the September quarter. The minimum regulatory requirement stands at 7.375 per cent.\n\nBreach of RBI mandated ratios\n\nYES bank\u2019s statutory liquidity ratio has breached the RBI\u2019s minimum requirement and so has its liquidity coverage ratio. The bank has thus provided Rs 86 crore as a penalty to the central bank.\n\nGovernance Issue: Under-reporting of NPAs\n\nIt is not just that Yes Bank had NPAs, but it under-reported NPAs which was later found out by RBI. This led to the end of the tenure of the founder Rana Kapoor as the CEO (2018).\n\nDeposits vs Loans\n\nIn the last five years, the loan book grew by over four times, but deposits failed to keep pace with loan growth. The loan book grew to \u20b92,24,505 crore as of September 2019, while deposits were at only at \u20b92,09,497 crore.\n\nUnusual increase in loans given from FY 2014 \u2013 FY 2019\n\nAs per news reports, the loan book of Yes Bank had grown from Rs. 55,000 crore in FY 2014 to Rs. 2,41,000 core in FY 2019. When overall bank credit during the above period grew only by about 10 per cent, it unusual to notice that YES Bank\u2019s loan book grow by about 35 per cent.\n\nRumours spread through social media\n\nRumours spread through social media about the possible collapse of Yes Bank when it was capable of managing its balance sheet, added fuel to the fire. Many false news and rumours resulted in shrinking of the deposit base of YES bank.\n\nAs on Dec. 31, 2019, the bank\u2019s outstanding deposit base stood reduced to 1.65 lakh crore from Rs 2.09 lakh crore on Sep. 30, 2019. The lender continues to see an outflow of deposits since Dec. 31; its total deposits stood at Rs 1.37 lakh crore, as on Mar. 5.\n\nThe bank\u2019s failure to raise fresh capital\n\nAs the bank had a lot of bad loans (in the tune of Rs.10,000+ crore), it needed fresh capital to manage its operations. The bank\u2019s failure to raise capital led to rating downgrades, which made capital-raising even more difficult.\n\nRBI moratorium\n\nAll the above factors led the RBI to conclude that there was no \u201ccredible revival plan\u201d from the end of YES bank and so \u201cin the public interest and the interest of the bank\u2019s depositors\u201d there was \u201cno alternative\u201d but to place the bank under a moratorium.\n\nRBI to took over from YES bank board for 30 days. The central bank has appointed deputy managing director and chief finance officer of State Bank of India, Prashant Kumar, as an administrator of the bank.\n\nThe Central Bank of India then imposed limits on withdrawals to protect depositors.\n\nReserve Bank of India under Sub-section (1) of Section 45 of the Banking Regulation Act, 1949, the Government of India has made an Order of Moratorium in respect of Yes Bank Ltd. under Sub-section (2) of the said Section for the period from 5th day of March 2020 and up to and inclusive of the 3rd day of April 2020.\n\nYes Bank Ltd. Reconstruction Scheme, 2020\n\nReserve Bank of India (RBI) stated that State Bank of India (SBI) has expressed its willingness to make an investment in Yes Bank Ltd. and participate in its reconstruction scheme. Therefore, as per the of the powers conferred by sub-section (4) of section 45 of the Banking Regulation Act, 1949, the Reserve Bank of India, proposed the details of the scheme for raising fresh capital for Yes Bank.\n\nThe authorised capital of the Reconstructed bank\n\nAs per the government notification, the Authorised Capital of the Reconstructed Yes Bank shall stand altered to Rs. 6200 crore from the Rs.1100 crore earlier. The number of equity shares will stand altered to 3000\u00a0crore. The capital of the reconstructed bank at Rs.2 face value per share would be Rs. 6000 crores.\n\nAuthorised preference share capital shall continue to be Rs 200 crore.\n\nHow much should the investor bank invest?\n\nThe investor bank (Eg: SBI) can purchase up to 49% in the reconstructed YES bank. The investor bank should purchase each share at price not less than Rs.10 (ie at a premium of Rs.8).\n\nSo, if SBI is purchasing 49% of 3000 crore YES Bank shares at Rs.10 per share, that would mean it will be investing Rs.14700 crores to purchase 1470 crore shares of the private bank. SBI had approved an investment of Rs 7,250 crore in Yes Bank by purchasing 725 crore equity shares.\n\nPS: The Main Investor bank (SBI) is not allowed to reduce its holding below 26% before completion of three years from the date of infusion of the capital.\n\nNew Investors in YES Bank\n\nApart from SBI, YES Bank got a lot of new investors as well.\n\nICICI Bank and Housing Development Finance Corporation Ltd announced that they will be investing Rs 1,000 crore each in Yes Bank\u2019s equity. Axis Bank and Kotak Mahindra Bank will be investing Rs 600 crore and Rs 500 crore respectively. Bandhan Bank will be investing Rs 300 crore.\n\nExisting shareholders own 255 crore shares, and they will end up with a roughly 8.5% stake in the company.\n\nThe balance 41.5% stake will presumably be held by other institutions and investors, who will need to infuse roughly \u20b9 12450 crores, assuming the acquisition price is \u20b9 10 per share.\n\nExpected total new investment in YES Bank\n\nThe total new investment expected in YES bank in the near future from SBI and other investors in the company is expected to be at least Rs.27150 crore.\n\nWriting down of AT-1 bonds\n\nIn a separate disclosure made to exchanges, Yes Bank said that the additional tier-1 bonds issued by the lender would need to be written down since the bank has reached the \u2018point of non-viability\u2019 trigger.\n\nAs per Basel rules, AT-1 bonds are loss-absorbing capital instruments and should be written down when a bank breaches certain thresholds of core equity tier-1 capital.\n\nThe bank has Rs 8,415 crore in such bonds outstanding.\n\nIs the new deal a merger of YES Bank with SBI?\n\nNo.\n\nThe current deal is not a merger with SBI rather an equity investment by SBI in YES BANK.\n\nPS: Merger with SBI is also a promising deal for YES Bank and its depositors. However, the merger of the private bank with the state bank is something which would be worked out only if the current investment deal does not bring the desired results.\n\nWill YES Bank be shut down?\n\nNo.\n\nThe government or RBI has no plans to do that. The deal is not even a merger scheme, but a plan to revive the private bank to its old glory.\n\nIs the Yes Bank Crisis over?\n\nHopefully yes, if the reconstruction scheme is properly implemented.\n\nFrom the depositors perspective, their hard-earned money may get locked up for a few more weeks. However, as assured by the Finance Minister, their deposits will be protected.\n\nOnce the reconstructed bank resumes its operations, and gets backs the loans given, gradually YES bank may be back to normal. All we can do now is to wait and watch.\n\nYES Bank-SBI Deal\n\nSBI board has given in-principle approval of exploring the possibility of picking up a stake of up to 49 per cent in Yes Bank. The draft plan is out. However, the deal is not finalised yet.\n\nThe best possible Scheme for the reconstruction of YES Bank\n\nThe SBI investment in Yes Bank is the best deal the capital-thirsty private bank can ask for. The presence of a credible name like SBI is very important for a resolution.\n\nIf the deal goes as per plan, depositors of YES Bank are in safe hands and have nothing to worry about. The survival of YES Bank is critical to preventing a contagion in the banking industry.\n\nRajnish Kumar, SBI chairman sounded confident of implementing the restructuring proposal for YES Bank before the 30-day RBI imposed moratorium period ends. Once YES Bank was out of moratorium it would be run by a professional team.\n\nMain Stake Holders\nDepositors in YES Bank\nInvestors in YES Bank (shareholders)\nInvestors in SBI (shareholders)\n\nThe primary objective of RBI or government in a crisis like that of YES Bank is to safeguard the hard-earned money of depositors. RBI assured depositors of the bank that their interests will be fully protected and there is no need to panic.\n\nThe next priority is to safeguard the interest of investors (shareholders), however, this does not seem to be easy.\n\nYes bank\u2019s shareholders would surely be the biggest losers. Going by the experience of banks placed under moratorium earlier by RBI, shareholders are unlikely to be compensated.\n\nShares of Yes Bank, which traded at 404 rupees at its peak in August 2019, fell to a record low of 5.65 rupees on March 2020, with the stock plunging nearly 85%.\n\nMost of the shareholders of YES bank will be happy to see a credible investor like SBI investing heavily in YES Bank. However, the shareholders of SBI is worried about the top public sector bank\u2019s investment in a loss-making private bank, which may not give any immediate returns.\n\nThe issue of conflict of interest in SBI Investment in Yes Bank\n\nWill there be a conflict of interest when a public sector bank invests in a private sector bank? Will the SBI pull-out customers of Yes Bank into its database? Will deposits move out from YES Bank to SBI.\n\nSBI chairman believes that there is no conflict of interest.\n\nThe plan is to keep YES Bank and SBI separate, leaving scope for the state-run lender to exit the investment when YES bank turns profitable.\n\nThough the new board of Yes Bank will be constituted with two nominees from SBI to build the trust of investors and depositors, SBI management would not be involved in the day-to-day management of the private lender.\nThe solution for YES Bank Crisis\n\nSBI should take over the loan book of YES Bank, recover the loans, and return the depositors money.\n\nThe new draft scheme proposes full repayment of all deposits, dilution of equity, and write-off of Rs 10,800 crore of additional tier one (AT-1) bonds.\n\nYES Bank and RBI\nRBI Governor Shaktikanta Das IAS\n\nThe Reserve Bank of India (RBI) already facing criticism on major supervision lapses in cases like Punjab National Bank (PNB) and Punjab and Maharashtra Cooperative Bank (PMC), couldn\u2019t have afforded Yes Bank to fail.\n\nYes Bank Crisis: Why RBI missed seeing the signs?\n\nReserve Bank of India did notice pressure points as early as 2017, which eventually led to the regulator denying extension to the then MD & CEO Rana Kapoor, despite the board\u2019s endorsement.\n\nHowever, RBI failed to come up with a concrete step like pooling SBI into the scheme of things until things became worse.\n\nIf the government and RBI acted earlier, they could have gained the confidence of depositors and retained much of the money. Also, the painful steps like moratorium and restriction on the withdrawal \u2013 which results in the loss of people\u2019s confidence in the economy \u2013 could have been avoided if they acted earlier.\n\nYes Bank Crisis: It is time to reform RBI?\n\nRBI is burdened with too many responsibilities.\n\nThe government must reduce the RBI\u2019s responsibilities so that the central bank can focus on the key areas.\n\nA few suggestions: The securities regulation should move to the Securities and Exchange Board of India (SEBI); debt management should be given to an independent debt management agency, and infrastructure systems operated by RBI should be corporatised.\n\nAs mentioned before, a specialised independent mechanism (resolution authority) should be directly monitoring the performance issues of banks like Yes Bank. Most of the G-20 countries have built specialised capabilities to resolve failed financial firms. Such a mechanism can keep a check on the regulator\u2019s tendency to delay recognition of failure, thereby ensuring quick and orderly resolution.\n\nWilful Default vs Non-Wilful Default\n\nBank robbery is an initiative of amateurs. True professionals establish a bank. \u2014 Bertolt Brecht.\n\nThe government and RBI should analyse the default in the case of loans taken by corporates is willful or not.\n\nIf it is wilful, a detailed investigation should be done regarding the background of the tie-ups between Yes Bank and its corporate clients. An enquiry should be conducted regarding indiscriminate lending and fund usage in the last 3 years \u2013 when the investment climate was utterly gloomy that only a few genuine companies were seeking loans for fresh investment.\n\nIf it is not wilful, the root cause lies in the pain points in the economy which should be identified and corrected.\n\nBank Crisis and Bailouts in India\n\nThe bailout is the act of giving financial assistance to a failing business to save it from collapse.\n\nIn India, how many banks have failed?\n\nIn India, no scheduled commercial bank has been allowed to collapse (or fail) since 1991.\n\nThe central bank and the government have always made sure that a failing bank gets acquired before it drowns.\n\nOnly cooperative banks have failed here. As per figures from the Deposit Insurance and Credit Guarantee Corporation (DICGC), authority that provides deposit insurance in the country, the cases of about 350 such banks have been settled so far for a payout of Rs 4,822 crore in claims.\n\nRBI will not allow any scheduled commercial bank to fail\n\nIn India, most of the scheduled commercial banks are considered entities which are \u2018too big to fail\u2019.\n\nA previous example is the case of Global Trust Bank. Global Trust Bank was merged with Oriental Bank of Commerce to avoid failure.\n\nDepositors will not lose money\n\nFinance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman, RBI governor Shaktikanta Das, and SBI chairman Rajnish Kumar had assured that the money of depositors will be safe.\n\nIn the recent past, there are no instances in India where depositors lost money in case of a scheduled bank collapse.\n\nMoratorium by RBI and its impact\n\nThe market was enthusiastic with the news of SBI intervention as an investor in Yes Bank. However, the moratorium (temporary prohibition of an activity) and equity dilution plan shocked investors and depositors alike.\n\nProbably the moratorium was needed to prevent further erosion of deposits because of any rumours or insider news.\n\nOnce the reconstructed YES bank starts functioning, the banking process should hopefully be back to normal. There might be a delay for depositors to get their money back, however, this should not mean losing any hard-earned money.\n\nPrivate Bank vs Public Sector Bank: Which is safe?\n\nPublic Sector Banks have 51% or more of the government equity stake in it. However, with respect to the safety net of depositors, private banks and the public sector banks are almost the same.\n\nIf a bank fails, the maximum insurance amount is limited to Rs.5 lakh per account for both private bank and public sector bank.\n\nHowever, be it a private or public sector bank, government and RBI would normally intervene much before the bank goes beyond redemption. The resolution may be in the form of additional equity or a merger with a stronger bank.\n\nRBI norms to protect depositors from a bank collapse\n\nScheduled commercial banks include private banks and public sector banks. Both are supervised and regulated by RBI. They have the same norms as well.\n\nThey cannot lend the entire money that they have received from depositors: 4 per cent of these deposits has to be kept aside as cash reserve ratio (CRR) and 18.75 per cent as the statutory liquid ratio (SLR).\n\nAlso, these banks have to maintain adequate capital when compared with risky loans given. This requirement is known as the capital adequacy ratio (capital-to-risk weighted assets ratio [CRAR]). CRAR is currently at 9 per cent.\n\nHas any bank of YES bank\u2019s size failed in India in the past?\n\nApart from co-operative banks, no scheduled commercial bank in modern India has failed to result in loss of depositor money.\n\nRBI has always stepped in to bail out ailing banks \u2013 often merging it with another stronger bank or infusing extra capital, and thus protecting the depositor money.\n\nThis is the first time the central bank has taken such drastic action like moratorium with respect to a big bank like Yes Bank.\n\nA near similar instance was in July 2004 when the RBI got state-run Oriental Bank of Commerce to take over Global Trust Bank to rescue the private sector lender.\n\nRecent Bank Bailouts\n\nRecent examples:\n\nIDBI Bank Crisis \u2013 In 2018, the government got LIC to bail out IDBI Bank with a Rs 21,624 crore capital infusion.\nPNB Bank Crisis \u2013 In 2018, the government paid the scam-hit Punjab National Bank (PNB) Rs 2,816 crore as a capital infusion from the via a preferential allotment of equity shares.\nPMC Bank Crisis \u2013 In 2019, the Punjab & Maharashtra Co-operative Bank Limited was been put under restrictions by RBI, after an alleged Rs 4,355 crore scam came to light. PMC bank may be merged with Maharashtra State Cooperative (MSC) Bank in the near future.\nWhich will be the next bank that will be in crisis?\n\nNobody can be sure of any bank.\n\nThe balance sheets of other banks too may be inflated, like what happened with YES bank. Only an independent and efficient audit check can find out the real issues.\n\nRBI needs to more cautious with the scrutiny of the balance sheet of private and public sector banks.\n\nIs it a good idea to bail out private banks using taxpayers money?\n\nIn this case of reconstruction of Yes Bank, which is a private bank, the investment from State Bank of India (a public sector bank) will be used. Public Sector Banks like SBI has 51% government\u2019s share \u2013 which is taxpayers money.\n\nThere are many who raise concerns in wasting taxpayers\u2019 money to bail out failing private entities. This quick remedy of government\u2019s indirect investment in private firms is also against the current principle of the State exiting from even public firms.\n\nHowever, considering no other alternative now, this bailout should be seen as an exception rather than the rule.\n\nShould RBI keep on bailing out ailing banks?\n\nWhen the\u00a0cost of not bailing out an ailing bank for the economy and banking system is far higher than bailing out, this looks to be the only option.\n\nIf a bank collapse ruining depositors money, the repercussions will be huge.\n\nThat will not be limited to the banking sector but will affect the economy as a whole. It will also have social and political ramifications.\n\nBanking Sector Reforms\nSBI chairman Rajnish Kumar addressing media regarding banking reforms connected with Yes Bank\n\nIndian Banking Sector is going through a tough time. It\u2019s time for immediate reforms like the merger of banks, bank resolution authority etc. Also, the root cause of the NPA issue should be identified and properly addressed.\n\nProper Solution to the Twin Balance Sheet Problem (TBS)\n\nPrevious Economic Surveys of India had already talked about the twin balance sheet problem of India.\n\nThe problem of banks is often not a balance sheet problem at the bank\u2019s end alone. It is also a problem of the corporates to which it gave loans.\n\nWhy are the corporates not repaying the loans-taken?\n\nEvery time, it may not be a wilful default.\n\nThe government policies, rules, regulations, or even Supreme Court judgments might be the bottle-necks for corporate houses to run a business smoothly, earn a profit, and repay the loan.\n\nDeposit Insurance\n\nIndia is one of the countries that offer the lowest protection to depositors in cases of a bank failure. Whatever be the deposit in the bank account, only deposits up to Rs.5 lakh is covered by deposit insurance. (Budget 2020)\n\nDeposit Insurance should be increased further to increase trust in the banking system.\n\nIn India, deposit insurance is provided by the Deposit Insurance and Credit Guarantee Corporation (DICGC), a wholly-owned subsidiary of RBI. DICGC collects a premium of 0.05% on the entire outstanding deposit from banks (and not from depositors).\n\nThe need for a resolution authority\n\nA Resolution Authority is needed to take over failing banks and either run them temporarily, sell them, infuse equity or, as a last resort, liquidate them.\n\nFRDI Bill\n\nFinancial Resolution and Deposit Insurance (FRDI) Bill was introduced in Parliament in 2017 to create a Resolution Authority. Unfortunately, it got mired in controversy. To address concerns with the Bill, the Union Budget 2020-21 raised the deposit insurance cap to Rs 5 lakh.\n\nThe Finance Minister has subsequently announced that the FRDI Bill will be brought back to Parliament. The Yes Bank moratorium should help put the bill on a fast track.\n\nMerger of Banks\n\nTo strengthen the Indian Banking sector, the Central Government of India has announced the merger of ten public sector banks into four banks.\n\nAfter the merger of banks, the country will have 12 public sector banks instead of 27.\n\nConclusion\n\nYes Bank was one of the highest-rated new generation private banks until 2017 when the bank started to face serious bad loan issue.\n\nTo stabilise the bank, Yes Bank Ltd. Reconstruction Scheme, 2020 was introduced by the Reserve Bank of India. RBI had also imposed temporary restrictions regarding the withdrawal of deposits.\n\nSBI board has given in-principle approval of exploring the possibility of picking up a stake of up to 49 per cent in Yes Bank. However, the deal is not finalised yet.\n\nTo protect the depositors, the bank must be quickly reconstructed. Also, steps should be taken to liquidate the NPAs. If Yes Bank is resolved effectively, it will protect Yes Bank\u2019s depositors, and maintain trust in the entire banking system."

            "[CONTENT]": "Operation Twist is an unconventional monetary policy of the Central Bank. Recently, the Reserve Bank of India tried \u2018Operation Twist\u2019 in India.\n\nOriginally, \u2018Operation Twist\u2019 was the name given to the US Federal Reserve monetary policy operation. This operation involved the purchase and sale of government securities to boost the economy by bringing down long-term interest rates.\n\nIn 2019 and 2020, the Reserve Bank of India conducted its version of \u2018Operation Twist\u2019 through simultaneous purchase and sale of government securities under Open Market Operations (OMOs).\n\nTable of Contents\n\nWhat is Operation Twist?\nWhat is the Yield of Government Securities?\nWhat happens when RBI goes for bulk buying of long-term government bonds?\nExplanation of the \u2018Yield of Bonds\u2019 with an example\nBenefits of bringing down the long term interest rates\nWhy Operation Twist is necessary? Why Can\u2019t RBI directly reduce the interest rates?\n7 Key Points to Understand about Operation Twist\nWhich topic do you want ClearIAS to prepare the next concept explainers?\nWhat is Operation Twist?\n\nOperation Twist is the operation by which the Reserve Bank of India twists the \u2018yield of government securities\u2019 \u2013 particularly the yield of long-term government securities with respect to short term government securities.\n\nUnder Operation Twist, the RBI will buy long term bonds of the government and at the same time sell short term securities of the government.\n\nBuying long term securities and selling short term securities will reduce the yield of long term securities compared to that of the short term ones. This yield impact is the objective of Operation Twist.\n\n\ud83d\udc49 Which year are YOU targeting for success in the IAS/IPS/IFS Exam? \ud83d\ude80\n\n(1) \u21d2 UPSC 2025: Prelims cum Mains\n\n(2) \u21d2 UPSC 2026: Prelims cum Mains\n\n(3) \u21d2 UPSC 2027 Prelims cum Mains\n\nTip: Know more about ClearIAS Courses (Online/Offline)\n\nWhat is the Yield of Government Securities?\n\nThe term yield denotes the benefit or interest-rate a Government Security (Eg: Government Bonds or Treasury Bills) provide.\n\nFor example, a Government Bond of Rs.1000 provides an interest of Rs.100 per year, it\u2019s yield percentage is 10%.\n\nWhat happens when RBI goes for bulk buying of long-term government bonds?\n\nWhen RBI goes for bulk purchase of long-term government bond, it will create a big demand in the market.\n\nAs a result, the price of long-term bonds will increase.\n\nWhen the price of bonds increases, the yield (interest rate) of the long-term bonds decrease. This is because the price of the bonds and yield of the bonds are inversely proportional.\n\nThus, with simultaneous buying of long-term bonds and selling of short-term securities, RBI can bring down the interest rates of long-term government securities.\n\nExplanation of the \u2018Yield of Bonds\u2019 with an example\n\nThe purpose of operation twist is to bring down the interest rate of long-term government securities.\n\nSuppose that, before undertaking Operation Twist, the yield of long term government securities with an original price of Rs.1000 was 10%.\n\nNow, as RBI is buying this long-term bond in bulk, there is a huge demand for it.\n\nWhen the demand increases, the price will also increase.\n\nImagine that the price of the government bond increases to Rs.1200 in the secondary market for bonds. This means that\u00a0people are ready to sell the bond only at a higher price.\n\nNow, if a person is buying this bond, he will get only a 10% interest rate on the original price (Rs.1000) \u2013 which means only Rs.100 per year as interest. The new owner of the bond spent Rs 1200, but he will get an interest of Rs 100 and not Rs.120.\n\nWhat does this mean? The effective interest rate of the bond has decreased.\n\nInstead of the original 10% rate, the yield of the bond is now only 8.3%.\n\nRs.100 gain for a Rs.1200 investment is 8.3%. Even though the original interest rate is 10%, as the price of the bond increased the yield decreased.\n\nThis is one side of the story. The reverse happens when the Government sells short-term securities.\n\nThus by simultaneous buying and selling of government securities (Operation Twist), the RBI can bring down the long-term interest rates.\n\nBenefits of bringing down the long term interest rates\nThe public can borrow at a lower interest rate so that credit, consumption, and investment will go up.\nThe government can borrow at a lower interest rate to finance the fiscal deficit.\nWhy Operation Twist is necessary? Why Can\u2019t RBI directly reduce the interest rates?\n\nThe Monetary Policy Transmission Mechanism is not fine-tuned in India.\n\nFor example, the RBI slashed key interest rate \u2014 the repo rate \u2014 by 1.35 per cent in 2019, but banks passed on only part of it.\n\nThe one-year median marginal cost of funds based lending rate (MCLR) has declined only 0.5 per cent.\n\nThus we can see that the conventional methods were not effective enough.\n\nAs interest rates remained high, most of the businesses were not taking loans. The credit growth was extremely sluggish.\n\nAs the Indian GDP growth rate fell below 5 per cent, to revive the economy (by attracting investment), reduction in the effective interest rate was necessary. This necessitated RBI to adopt the unconventional monetary policy of \u2018Operation Twist\u2019.\n\n7 Key Points to Understand about Operation Twist\nOperation Twist is a monetary policy of the Reserve Bank of India.\nThis is an unconventional monetary policy of the RBI.\nOperation Twist is part of the Open Market Operation (OMO) of RBI.\nUnder Operation Twist, RBI does the simultaneous buying and selling of government securities.\nRBI buys long-term government securities while RBI sells short-term government securities.\nThe purpose of Operation Twist is to reduce the interest rate of long-term government bonds.\nAs the rate of interest gets reduced, both the public and the government can borrow at a cheaper rate. This is supposed to revive the economy.\nWhich topic do you want ClearIAS to prepare the next concept explainers?\n\nHope you liked the video and notes.

It is a report of the government finances which includes revenues and outlays.\n\nThus, the budget\u00a0can be defined as the most comprehensive report of the government\u2019s finances in which revenues from all the sources and outlays for all activities are consolidated.\n\nIn simple terms, the budget is an annual financial statement of the revenue and expenditure of a government.\n\n\ud83d\udc49 Which year are YOU targeting for success in the IAS/IPS/IFS Exam? \ud83d\ude80\n\n(1) \u21d2 UPSC 2025: Prelims cum Mains\n\n(2) \u21d2 UPSC 2026: Prelims cum Mains\n\n(3) \u21d2 UPSC 2027 Prelims cum Mains\n\nTip: Know more about ClearIAS Courses (Online/Offline)\n\nBudget in the Indian Constitution\n\nThe term \u2018Budget\u2019 is not mentioned in the Indian Constitution; the corresponding term used is \u2018Annual Financial Statement\u2019 (article 112).\n\nWhat are the constitutional requirements which make Budget necessary?\nArticle 265: provides that \u2018no tax shall be levied or collected except by authority of law\u2019. [ie. Taxation needs the approval of Parliament.]\nArticle 266: provides that \u2018no expenditure can be incurred except with the authorisation of the Legislature\u2019 [ie. Expenditure needs the approval of Parliament.]\nArticle 112: President shall, in respect of every financial year, cause to be laid before Parliament, Annual Financial Statement.\nFRBM Act\n\nThe Fiscal Responsibility and Budget Management (FRBM) Act was passed by the Indian Parliament in 2003 for better budget management.\n\nThe FRBM act also provided for certain documents to be tabled in the Parliament of India, along with Budget, annually with regards to the country\u2019s fiscal policy.\n\nBudget Documents\n\nDo you know that the Annual Financial Statement is only one of the several budget documents presented by the Finance Minister?\n\nThe Budget documents presented to Parliament comprise, besides the Finance Minister\u2019s Budget Speech, the following:\n\nAnnual Financial Statement (AFS) \u2013 Article 112\nDemands for Grants (DG) \u2013 Article 113\nAppropriation Bill \u2013 Artice 114(3)\nFinance Bill \u2013 Article 110 (a)\nMemorandum Explaining the Provisions in the Finance Bill.\nMacro-economic framework for the relevant financial year \u2013 FRBM Act\nFiscal Policy Strategy Statement for the financial year \u2013\u00a0FRBM Act\nMedium Term Fiscal Policy Statement \u2013\u00a0FRBM Act\nMedium Term Expenditure Framework Statement \u2013\u00a0FRBM Act\nExpenditure Budget Volume-1\nExpenditure Budget Volume-2\nReceipts Budget\nBudget at a glance\nHighlights of Budget\nStatus of Implementation of Announcements made in Finance Minister\u2019s Budget Speech of the previous\u00a0financial year.\n\nThere are also other related documents like\u00a0Detailed Demands for Grants,\u00a0Outcome Budget,\u00a0Annual Reports and\u00a0Economic Survey presented along with the budget documents in Parliament.\n\nPS: The documents shown at Serial 1, 2, 3 and 4 are mandated by Art. 112,113, 114(3) and 110(a) of the\u00a0Constitution of India respectively, while the documents at Serial 6,7, 8 and 9 are presented as per the provisions\u00a0of the Fiscal Responsibility and Budget Management Act, 2003. Other documents are in the nature of explanatory\u00a0statements supporting the mandated documents with narrative or other content in a user-friendly format suited\u00a0for quick or contextual references. Hindi version of all these documents is also presented to Parliament.\n\nGovernment Budgeting: Railway Budget Presentation\n\nDo figures related to Railways find mention in Annual Financial Statement or are they part of only Railway budget?\n\nUntil 2016 (for 92 years), the budget of the Indian Railways was presented separately to Parliament and dealt with separately. Even then the receipts and expenditure of the Railways formed part of the Consolidated Fund of India and the figures relating to them are included in the \u2018Annual Financial Statement\u2019.\n\nThe last Railway Budget was presented on 25 February 2016 by Mr. Suresh Prabhu.\n\nSince 2017, Railway Budget is merged with the Union Budget.\n\nGovernment Budgeting: Union Budget Presentation\n\nIn India, the Budget is presented to Parliament on such date as is fixed by the President.\n\nBetween 1999 to 2016, the General Budget was presented at 11 A.M. on the last working day of February.\n\nHowever, since 2017, the Indian Budget is presented on 1 February. As a convention, Economic Survey is also tabled in the Parliament \u2013 one day prior to budget submission, ie on January 31.\n\nNote: In an election year, Budget may be presented twice \u2014 first to secure Vote on Account for a few months and later in full.\n\nVote on Account\n\nThe discussion on the Budget begins a few days after its presentation.\n\nIf the Parliament is not able to vote the entire budget before the commencement of the new financial year (ie. within 1 month or so), the necessity to keep enough finance at the disposal of Government in order to allow it to run the administration of the country remains. A special provision is, therefore, made for \u201cVote on Account\u201d by which Government obtains the Vote of Parliament for a sum sufficient to incur expenditure on various items for a part of the year.\n\nNormally, the Vote on Account is taken for two months only. But during the election year or when it is anticipated that the main Demands and Appropriation Bill will take a longer time than two months, the Vote on Account may be for a period exceeding two months.\n\nSo what exactly is Vote on Account?\n\nVote on Account is a special provision by which the Government obtains the\u00a0Vote of Parliament\u00a0for a sum sufficient to incur expenditure on various items for a part of the year, usually two months.\n\nVote on Account was widely used along with every budget before 2016 when the date of the budget presentation was the last day of February. Now vote on account is used only in special years like the election years (used along with interim budget).\n\nVote on Account deals only with the expenditure part. But the interim budget, as well as full budget, has both receipt and expenditure side.\n\nSo presentation and passing of vote on account is the first stage in the budget passing process. Vote on Account is necessary for the working of the government until the period the full budget is passed.\n\nBudget Speech\n\nThe Budget Speech of the Finance Minister is usually in two parts. Part A deals with the general economic survey of the country while Part B relates to taxation proposals.\n\nHe makes a speech introducing the Budget and it is only in the concluding part of his speech that the proposals for fresh taxation or for variations in the existing taxes are disclosed by him.\n\nThe \u2018Annual Financial Statement\u2019 is laid on the Table of Rajya Sabha at the conclusion of the speech of the Finance Minister in Lok Sabha.\n\nLatest Budget\n\nYou can read the highlights of Budget 2020-2021 here.\n\nLatest Economic Survey\n\nYou can read the highlights of the Economic Survey 2019-2020 here.\n\nConclusion\n\nIn conclusion, the government budget plays a critical role in the economy of any country. It serves as a blueprint for the allocation of resources and guides the government\u2019s spending decisions. A well-designed budget can have a positive impact on economic growth, employment, and social welfare.\n\nRead: Interim Budget 2024"

Generally, one Demand for Grant is presented in respect of each Ministry or Department. However, more than one Demand may be presented for a Ministry or Department depending on the nature of expenditure.\nRegarding Union Territories without Legislature, a separate Demand is presented for each of the Union Territories.\n\nEach Demand first gives the totals of \u2018voted\u2019 and \u2018charged\u2019 expenditure as also the \u2018revenue\u2019 and \u2018capital\u2019 expenditure included in the Demand separately, and also the total of the amount of expenditure for which the Demand is presented.\n\nThis is followed\u00a0by the estimates of expenditure under different major heads of account. The breakup of the expenditure\u00a0under each major head between \u2018Plan\u2019 and \u2018Non-Plan\u2019 is also given.\nThe amounts of recoveries taken in the reduction of expenditure in the accounts are also shown. A summary of Demands for Grants is given at the beginning of this document, while details of \u2018New Service\u2019 or \u2018New Instrument of Service\u2019 such as the formation of a new company, undertaking or a new scheme, etc., if any, are indicated at the end of the document.\n\nAlso read: US Debt Ceiling Crisis and US Federal Government Shut down Explained\n\nAppropriation Bill\n\nUnder Article 114(3) of the Constitution, no amount can be withdrawn from the Consolidated Fund without the enactment of such a law by Parliament.\n\nAfter the Demands for Grants are voted by the Lok Sabha, Parliament\u2019s approval of the withdrawal from the Consolidated Fund of the amounts so voted and of the amount required to meet the expenditure charged on the Consolidated Fund is sought through the Appropriation Bill.\n\nThe whole process beginning with the presentation of the Budget and ending with discussions and voting on the Demands for Grants requires a sufficiently long time.\nThe Lok Sabha is, therefore, empowered by the Constitution to make any grant in advance in respect of the estimated expenditure for a part of the financial year pending completion of the procedure for the voting of the Demands.\nThe purpose of the \u2018Vote on Account\u2019 is to keep the Government functioning, pending voting of \u2018final supply\u2019. The Vote on Account is obtained from\u00a0Parliament through an Appropriation (Vote on Account) Bill.\nFinance Bill\n\nAt the time of the presentation of the Annual Financial Statement before Parliament, a Finance Bill is also presented in fulfillment of the requirement of Article 110 (1)(a) of the Constitution, detailing the imposition, abolition, remission, alteration, or regulation of taxes proposed in the Budget.\n\nA Finance Bill is a Money Bill as\u00a0defined in Article 110 of the Constitution. It is accompanied by a Memorandum explaining the provisions\u00a0included in it.\n\nMemorandum Explaining the Provisions in the Finance Bill: To facilitate understanding of the taxation proposals contained in the Finance Bill, the provisions and their\u00a0implications are explained in the document titled Memorandum Explaining the Provisions of the Finance Bill.\n\nAlso read: Debt Sustainability\n\nBudget Documents as per the requirements of the FRBM Act\n\nThe Fiscal Responsibility and Budget Management Act (FRBM Act), 2003, establishes financial discipline to reduce the fiscal deficit.\n\nMacroeconomic Framework Statement\nThe Macroeconomic Framework Statement presented to Parliament under Section 3(5) of the Fiscal Responsibility and Budget Management Act, 2003 and the rules made thereunder contains an assessment of the growth prospects of the economy with specific underlying assumptions.\nIt contains an assessment regarding the GDP growth rate, the fiscal balance of the Central Government, and the external sector balance of the economy.\nFiscal Policy Strategy Statement\nThe Fiscal Policy Strategy Statement, presented to Parliament under Section 3(4) of the Fiscal Responsibility and Budget Management Act, 2003, outlines the strategic priorities of the Government in the fiscal area for the ensuing financial year relating to taxation, expenditure, lending, and investments, administered pricing, borrowings, and guarantees.\nThe Statement explains how the current policies are in conformity with sound fiscal management principles and give the rationale for any major deviation in key fiscal measures.\nMedium-term Fiscal Policy Statement\nThe Medium-term Fiscal Policy Statement presented to Parliament under Section 3(2) of the Fiscal Responsibility and Budget Management Act, 2003, sets out three-year rolling targets for four specific fiscal indicators about GDP at market prices namely (i) Revenue Deficit, (ii) Fiscal Deficit, (iii) Tax to GDP ratio and (iv) Total outstanding Debt at the end of the year.\nThe Statement includes the underlying assumptions, an assessment of sustainability relating to the balance between revenue receipts and revenue expenditure, and the use of capital receipts including market borrowings for the generation of productive assets.\nMedium-term Expenditure Framework Statement\nThe Medium-term Expenditure Framework Statement presented to Parliament under Section 3 of the Fiscal Responsibility and Budget Management Act, 2003 sets forth a three-year rolling target for the expenditure indicators with a specification of underlying assumptions and risks involved.\nThe objective of the MTEF is to provide closer integration between the budget and the FRBM Statements.\nThis Statement is presented separately in the session next to the session in which the Budget is presented, i.e. normally in the Monsoon Session.\nExplanatory Budget Documents\n\nThis documents include Expenditure Budget Volume-1, Expenditure Budget Volume-2,\u00a0 Receipts budget, Budget at a glance, Highlight of budget etc.\n\nExpenditure Budget Volume-1\nThis document deals with revenue and capital disbursements of various Ministries/Departments and gives the estimates in respect of each under \u2018Plan\u2019 and \u2018Non-Plan\u2019.\nIt also gives an analysis of various types of expenditure and broad reasons for the variations in estimates.\nExpenditure Budget Volume-2\nThe provisions made for a scheme or a program may spread over several Major Heads in the Revenue and Capital sections in a Demand for Grants.\nIn the Expenditure Budget Vol. 2, the estimates made for a scheme/program are brought together and shown on a net basis in one place, by Major Heads.\nTo understand the objectives underlying the expenditure proposed for various schemes and programs in the Demands for Grants, suitable explanatory notes are included in this volume in which, wherever necessary, brief reasons for variations between the Budget estimates and Revised estimates for the current year and requirements for the ensuing Budget year are also given.\nReceipts Budget\nEstimates of receipts included in the Annual Financial Statement are further analyzed in the document \u201cReceipts Budget\u201d.\nThe document provides details of tax and non-tax revenue receipts and capital receipts\u00a0and explains the estimates.\nThe document also provides the arrears of tax revenues and non-tax revenues, as\u00a0mandated under the Fiscal Responsibility and Budget Management Rules, 2004.\nThe trend of receipts and expenditures along with deficit indicators, statements about the National Small Savings Fund (NSSF), statements of revenues foregone, statements of liabilities, statements of guarantees given by the government, statements of assets, and details of external assistance are also included in Receipts Budget.\nBudget at a Glance\nThis document shows in brief, receipts, and disbursements along with broad details of tax revenues and other receipts. This document also exhibits a broad break-up of expenditure \u2013 Plan and Non-Plan, allocation of Plan outlays by sectors as well as by Ministries/Departments, and details of resources transferred by the Central Government to State and Union Territory Governments.\nThis document also shows the revenue deficit, the gross primary deficit, and the gross fiscal deficit of the Central Government. The excess of the Government\u2019s revenue expenditure over revenue receipts constitutes a revenue deficit for the Government.\nThe difference between the total expenditure of the Government by way of revenue, capital, and loans net of repayments on the one hand and revenue receipts of the Government and capital receipts which are not like borrowing but which finally accrue to the Government on the other, constitutes gross fiscal deficit.\nGross primary deficit is measured by gross fiscal deficit reduced by gross interest payments. In the Budget documents \u2018gross fiscal deficit\u2019 and \u2018gross primary deficit\u2019 have been referred to in abbreviated form \u2018fiscal deficit\u2019 and \u2018primary deficit\u2019, respectively.\nThis document also shows the liabilities of the Government on account of securities (bonds) issued instead of oil and fertilizer subsidies.\nHighlights of Budget\nThis document explains the key features of the Budget, inter alia, indicating the prominent achievements in various sectors of the economy. It also explains, in brief, the budget proposals for the allocation of funds to be made in important areas.\nThe summary of tax proposals is also reflected in the document.\n\nAlso read: Capital Market Overview\n\nOther Budget Documents Along with Budget Statements\n\nThis includes detailed demand for grants, outcome budget, annual reports, and economic survey.\n\nDetailed Demands for Grants\nThe Detailed Demands for Grants are laid on the table of the Lok Sabha sometime after the presentation of the Budget, but before the discussion on Demands for Grants commences.\nDetailed Demands for Grants further elaborate on the provisions included in the Demands for Grants as also actual expenditure during the previous year.\nA breakup of the estimates relating to each program/organization, wherever the amount involved is not less than 10 lakhs, is given under several object heads which indicate the categories and nature of expenditure incurred on that program, like salaries, wages, travel expenses, machinery and equipment, grants-in-aid, etc.\nAt the end of these Detailed Demands are shown the details of recoveries taken in reduction of expenditure in the accounts.\nOutcome Budget\nWith effect from Financial Year 2007-08, the Performance Budget and the Outcome Budget hitherto presented to Parliament separately by Ministries/Departments, are merged and presented as a single document titled \u201cOutcome Budget\u201d by each Ministry/Department in respect of all Demands/Appropriations controlled by them, except those exempted from this requirement.\nOutcome Budget broadly indicates the physical dimensions of the financial budget of a Ministry/Department, indicating actual physical performance in the preceding year, performance in the first nine months (up to December) of the current year and the targeted performance during the ensuing year.\nAnnual Reports\nA descriptive account of the activities of each Ministry/Department during the year is given in the document Annual Report which is brought out separately by each Ministry/Department and circulated to Members of Parliament at the time of discussion on the Demands for Grants.\nEconomic Survey\nThe Economic Survey brings out the economic trends in the country which facilitates a better appreciation\u00a0of the mobilisation of resources and their allocation in the Budget.\nThe Survey analyses the trends in agricultural and industrial production, infrastructure, employment, money supply, prices, imports, exports, foreign exchange reserves, and other relevant economic factors which have a bearing on the Budget and is presented to the Parliament ahead of the Budget for the ensuing year.\nConclusion\n\nThe Budget of the Central Government is not merely a statement of receipts and expenditures. Since Independence, with the launching of the Five Year Plans, it has also become a significant statement of government policy.\n\nThe Budget reflects and shapes, and is, in turn, shaped by the country\u2019s economy. For a better\u00a0appreciation of the impact of government receipts and expenditure on the other sectors of the economy, it is\u00a0necessary to group them in terms of economic magnitudes, for example, how much is set aside for capital\u00a0formation, how much is spent directly by the Government and how much is transferred by Government to\u00a0other sectors of the economy by way of grants, loans, etc.\n\nThis analysis is contained in the Economic and\u00a0Functional Classification of the Central Government Budget which is brought out by the Ministry of Finance separately."

            "[CONTENT]": "The FRBM Act was passed by the Parliament of India in 2003 to reduce Fiscal Deficit.\n\nEvery time when the Union Budget of India is presented, the term FRBM is seen in the news. You may see headlines like \u2018FRBM targets are missed\u2019 or \u2018FRBM targets are met\u2019. What exactly is FRBM? What is the significance of FRBM with respect to Indian economy?\n\nThe FRBM Act is a law enacted by the Government of India in 2003 to ensure fiscal discipline \u2013 by setting targets including reduction of fiscal deficits and elimination of revenue deficit.\n\nIt is considered as one of the major legal steps taken in the direction of fiscal consolidation in India.\n\nTable of Contents\n\nWhat is the full form of FRBM?\nWhy was the FRBM Act enacted?\nThe Fiscal Responsibility and Budget Management (FRBM) Act, 2003\nWhat is the FRBM Act all about?\nObjectives of the FRBM Act\nProvisions of the Fiscal Responsibility and Budget Management Act\nInitial FRBM Targets (to be met by 2008-09)\nDid the government meet the FRBM targets by March 2009?\nAmendments in the FRBM Act\nFRBM Targets after Amendment to FRBM Act in 2012 (to be achieved by 2015)\nFRBM Targets after Amendment to FRBM Act in 2015 (to be achieved by 2018)\nFRBM Review Committee headed by NK Singh: Recommendations\nLatest FRBM Targets\nEscape Clause in the FRBM Act\nWhat is the current status of Fiscal Deficit and Revenue Deficit?\nWhat if there is no Fiscal Discipline?\nConclusion\nWhat is the full form of FRBM?\n\nThe full form of FRBM is\u00a0Fiscal Responsibility and Budget Management.\n\nWhy was the FRBM Act enacted?\n\nIn India, the borrowing levels were very high in the 1990s and 2000s. Indian Economy was weak as it had high Fiscal Deficit, high Revenue Deficit, and high Debt-to-GDP ratio.\n\nBy 2003, the continuous government borrowing and the resultant debt had severely impacted the health of the Indian economy. Much of the borrowing was utilized for interest payments of previous borrowings, but not for productive-purposes. This resulted in interest payments becoming the largest expenditure item of the government.\n\nMany economists then warned the government that this condition is not sustainable. They advised legal steps to prevent India to fall into a debt-trap.\n\n\ud83d\udc49 Which year are YOU targeting for success in the IAS/IPS/IFS Exam? \ud83d\ude80\n\n(1) \u21d2 UPSC 2025: Prelims cum Mains\n\n(2) \u21d2 UPSC 2026: Prelims cum Mains\n\n(3) \u21d2 UPSC 2027 Prelims cum Mains\n\nTip: Know more about ClearIAS Courses (Online/Offline)\n\nParliamentarians of India too felt that there should be control on the government of India not to resort to a high level of borrowing to fund its expenditure. Hence in 2000, they introduced a bill to bring responsibility and discipline in matters of expenditure and debt. This bill was passed by the Indian Parliament in 2003 and came to be known as the Fiscal Responsibility and Budget Management Act.\u00a0\n\nThe Fiscal Responsibility and Budget Management (FRBM) Act, 2003\n\nThe Fiscal Responsibility and Budget Management Bill (FRBM Bill) was introduced in India by the then Finance Minister of India, Mr.Yashwant Sinha in December 2000. The provisions provided in the initial versions of the bill were too drastic. After much discussions, a watered-down version of the bill was passed in 2003 to become the FRBM Act. The FRBM Rules came into force from July 5, 2004.\n\nWhat is the FRBM Act all about?\n\nFRBM Act is all about maintaining a balance between Government revenue and government expenditure.\n\nThe intention of the\u00a0Fiscal Responsibility and Budget Management Act was\u00a0to bring \u2013\n\nfiscal discipline.\nefficient management of expenditure, revenue and debt.\nmacroeconomic stability.\nbetter coordination between fiscal and monetary policy.\ntransparency in the fiscal operation of the Government.\nachieving a balanced budget.\nObjectives of the FRBM Act\n\nThe main objectives of the act were:\n\nto introduce transparent fiscal management systems in the country.\nto introduce a more equitable and manageable distribution of the country\u2019s debts over the years.\nto aim for fiscal stability for India in the long run\n\nAdditionally, the act was expected to give the necessary flexibility to Reserve Bank of India (RBI) for managing inflation in India.\n\nProvisions of the Fiscal Responsibility and Budget Management Act\n\nThe FRBM rules mandate four fiscal indicators to be projected in the medium-term fiscal policy statement. These are:\n\nrevenue deficit as a percentage of GDP\nfiscal deficit as a percentage of GDP.\ntax revenue as a percentage of GDP.\ntotal outstanding liabilities as a percentage of GDP.\n\nThe FRBM Act set targets for fiscal deficit and revenue deficit.\n\nThe FRBM act also provided for certain documents to be tabled in the Parliament of India, along with Budget, annually with regards to the country\u2019s fiscal policy. This included the Medium-term Fiscal Policy Statement, Fiscal Policy Strategy Statement, Macro-economic Framework Statement, and Medium-term Expenditure Framework Statement. For details check the details of the budget documents.\n\nInitial FRBM Targets (to be met by 2008-09)\nRevenue Deficit Target \u2013 revenue deficit should be completely eliminated by March 31, 2009. The minimum annual reduction target was 0.5% of GDP.\nFiscal Deficit Target \u2013 fiscal deficit should be reduced to 3% of GDP by March 31, 2009. The minimum annual reduction target was 0.3% of GDP.\nContingent Liabilities \u2013 The Central Government shall not give incremental guarantees aggregating an amount exceeding 0.5 per cent of GDP in any financial year beginning 2004-05.\nAdditional Liabilities \u2013\u00a0 Additional liabilities (including external debt at current exchange rate) should be reduced to 9% of the GDP by 2004-05. The minimum annual reduction target in each subsequent year to be 1% of GDP.\nRBI purchase of government bonds \u2013 to cease from 1 April 2006. This indicates the government not to borrow directly from the RBI.\nDid the government meet the FRBM targets by March 2009?\n\nNo. Implementing the act, the government had managed to cut the fiscal deficit to 2.7% of GDP and revenue deficit to 1.1% of GDP in 2007\u201308. However, the targets were not met.\n\nThe global financial crisis (2007-08) led the government to infuse resources in the economy as the fiscal stimulus in 2008. Therefore, fiscal targets had to be postponed temporarily in view of the global crisis.\n\nAmendments in the FRBM Act\n\nIn 2012 and 2015, notable amendments were made, resulting in relaxation of target realisation year.\n\nA new concept called Effective Revenue Deficit (E.R.D) was also introduced.\n\nThe requirement of \u2018Medium Term Expenditure Framework Statement\u2019 was also added via amendment in FRBMA.\n\nFRBM Targets after Amendment to FRBM Act in 2012 (to be achieved by 2015)\nRevenue Deficit Target \u2013\u00a0revenue deficit should be completely eliminated by March 31, 2015. The minimum annual reduction target was 0.5% of GDP.\nFiscal Deficit Target \u2013 fiscal deficit should be reduced to 3% of GDP by March 31, 2015.\u00a0The minimum annual reduction target was 0.3% of GDP.\nFRBM Targets after Amendment to FRBM Act in 2015 (to be achieved by 2018)\nRevenue Deficit Target \u2013\u00a0revenue deficit should be completely eliminated by March 31, 2018. The minimum annual reduction target was 0.5% of GDP.\nFiscal Deficit Target \u2013 fiscal deficit should be reduced to 3% of GDP by March 31, 2018.\u00a0The minimum annual reduction target was 0.3% of GDP.\nFRBM Review Committee headed by NK Singh: Recommendations\n\nThe government believed the targets were too rigid.\n\nIn May 2016, the government set up a committee under NK Singh to review the FRBM Act. The committee recommended that the government should target a fiscal deficit of 3 per cent of the GDP in years up to March 31, 2020, cut it to 2.8 per cent in 2020-21 and to 2.5 per cent by 2023.\n\nThe Committee suggested using debt as the primary target for fiscal policy. This ratio was 70% in 2017.\n\nThese are the targets set by NK Singh:\n\nDebt to GDP ratio: The review committee advocated for a Debt to GDP ratio of 60% to be targeted with a 40% limit for the centre and 20% limit for the states.\nRevenue Deficit Target \u2013\u00a0revenue deficit should be reduced to 0.8% of GDP by March 31, 2023. The minimum annual reduction target was 0.5% of GDP.\nFiscal Deficit Target \u2013 fiscal deficit should be reduced to 2.5% of GDP by March 31, 2023.\u00a0The minimum annual reduction target was 0.3% of GDP.\nLatest FRBM Targets\n\nThe latest provisions of the FRBM act requires the government to limit the fiscal deficit to 3% of the GDP by March 31, 2021, and the debt of the central government to 40% of the GDP by 2024-25, among others.\n\nThe Act provides room for deviation from the annual fiscal deficit target under certain conditions.\n\nEscape Clause in the FRBM Act\n\nEscape clause refers to the situation under which the central government can flexibly follow fiscal deficit target during special circumstances. This terminology was innovated by the NK Singh Committee on FRBM.\n\nIn Budget 2017, Finance Minister Arun Jaitley deferred the fiscal deficit target of 3% of the GDP and chose a target of 3.2%, citing the NK Singh committee report.\n\nHowever, the Comptroller and Auditor General of India (CAG) pulled up the government for deferring the targets which it said should have been done through amending the Act.\n\nIn 2018, the FRBM Act was further amended. Specific details were updated in sub-section (2) of Section 4. The clause allows the govt to relax the fiscal deficit target for up to 50 basis points or 0.5 per cent. Under FRBM, if the escape clause is triggered to allow for a breach of fiscal deficit target, the RBI is then allowed to participate directly in the primary auction of government bonds, thus formalising deficit financing.\n\nThe Escape Clauses can be invoked:\n\nby the Government after formal consultations and advice of the Fiscal Council.\nwith a clear commitment to return to the original fiscal target in the coming fiscal year.\n\nIn 2020, Finance Minister, Nirmala Sitharaman used the escape clause provided under the FRBM Act to allow the relaxation of the target. Finance Minister revised the fiscal deficit for FY20 to 3.8 per cent and pegged the target for FY21 to 3.5 per cent.\n\nNote: The Act exempts the government from following the FRBM guidelines in case of war or calamity.\n\nWhat is the current status of Fiscal Deficit and Revenue Deficit?\n\nFiscal Deficit (FD)- The Fiscal deficit as per the Indian Budget 2020-21 was estimated 3.5 % of GDP.\nRevenue Deficit (RD)- The Revenue Deficit as per the Indian Budget 2020-21 was estimated 2.7 % of GDP.\nEffective Revenue Deficit (ERD)- The effective revenue deficit as per the Indian Budget 2020-21 was estimated 1.8 % of GDP.\nTax to GDP ratio: 10.8\nDebt to GDP ratio (Central Government): 50.1\nWhat if there is no Fiscal Discipline?\n\nIf there is no fiscal discipline, the government (executive) may spend as it wishes.\n\nA country is just like a house; if the expenditure is too much and if there is no revenue to balance the high expenditure, the country will eventually fall into a debt trap, which may finally result in its collapse.\n\nConclusion\n\nThe FRBM Act seeks to achieve long-term macroeconomic stability, while generating budget surpluses, prudential debt management, limiting borrowings to cut down deficits and debt, greater transparency, removal of fiscal impediments and providing a medium-term framework for budgetary implementation.\n\nAs seen in the above analysis, different governments have failed to achieve the FRBM targets set to be achieved in 2008 even by 2020.\n\nThough the Act aims to achieve deficit reductions prima facie, an important objective is to achieve inter-generational equity in fiscal management. This is because when there are high borrowings today, it should be repaid by the future generation. But the benefit from high expenditure and debt today goes to the present generation.\n\nAchieving FRBM targets thus ensures inter-generation equity by reducing the debt burden of the future generation."

Answer: Constitution of India.\n\nArticle 266 of the Constitution of India mandates that Parliamentary approval is required to draw money from the Consolidated Fund of India. Besides, Article 114 (3) of the Constitution stipulates that no amount can be withdrawn from the Consolidated Fund without the enactment of a law (appropriation bill).\n\n\ud83d\udc49 Which year are YOU targeting for success in the IAS/IPS/IFS Exam? \ud83d\ude80\n\n(1) \u21d2 UPSC 2025: Prelims cum Mains\n\n(2) \u21d2 UPSC 2026: Prelims cum Mains\n\n(3) \u21d2 UPSC 2027 Prelims cum Mains\n\nTip: Know more about ClearIAS Courses (Online/Offline)\n\nThe Parliamentary Approval takes its time!\n\nThe full budget is usually passed only after long discussions.\u00a0Even though the government (executive) seeks approval of expenditure for the next financial year (April 1 to March 31) in the current financial year itself, the approval from legislature takes its time.\n\nVery often, discussion and voting of demands for grants and passing of Appropriation Bill\u00a0go beyond the current financial year. This was precisely the case before 2016 when the budget was presented on the last working day of February, and it was difficult to get passed within the same financial year.\n\nBut the government needs money for its day to day functions\u2026\n\nSince Parliament is not able to vote the entire budget before the commencement of the new financial year, the necessity to keep enough finance at the disposal of Government.\n\nA special provision is, therefore, made for \u201cVote on Account\u201d by which Government obtains the Vote of Parliament for a sum sufficient to incur expenditure on various items for a part of the year.\n\nVote on Account\n\nVote on Account\u00a0is a\u00a0grant in advance to enable the government to carry on until the voting of demands for grants and the passing of the Appropriation Bill and Finance Bill.\n\n\nThis enables the government to fund its expenses for a short period of time or until a full-budget is passed.\u00a0As a convention, a vote-on-account is treated as a formal matter and passed by Lok Sabha without discussion.\n\nVote on Account was frequently used until 2016 when the Budget was presented on the last working day of February. However, since 2017, the budget presentation date was advanced to February 1. This helped the executive to use almost 2 months time to get the full-budget passed in the same financial year. So, since 2017, Vote on Account is not usually used as part of the government budgeting process, unless in special cases like an election year.\n\nNormally, the Vote on Account is taken for two months only.\u00a0The\u00a0sum of the grant would be equivalent to one-sixth of the estimated expenditure for the entire year under various demands for grants.\n\nCan Vote on Account be granted for more than 2 months?\n\nYes.\u00a0During election year or when it is anticipated that the main Demands and Appropriation Bill will take longer time than two months, the Vote on Account may be granted for a period exceeding two months.\n\nFor example, in 2019, Vote on Account is taken for 4 months.\n\nDifference between Full Budget and\u00a0Vote on Account\nFull Budget deals with both expenditure and revenue side but Vote-on-account deals only with the expenditure side of the government\u2019s budget.\nThe vote-on-account is normally valid for two months\u00a0but a full budget is valid for 12 months (a financial year).\nAs a convention, a vote-on-account is treated as a formal matter and passed by Lok Sabha without discussion. But passing for budget happens only after discussions and voting on demand for grants.\nA vote-on-account cannot alter direct taxes since they need to be passed through a finance bill. Under the regular Budget, fresh taxes may be imposed and old ones may go.\nAs a convention, a vote-on-account is treated as a formal matter and passed by the Lok Sabha without discussion. But the full budget is passed only after discussions and voting on demand for grants.\nWhat is an interim budget then?\n\nAn interim budget in all practical sense is a full budget but made by the government during the last year of its term \u2013 ie. just before the election.\u00a0An interim Budget is a complete set of accounts, including both expenditure and receipts. But it may not contain big policy proposals.\n\nIs it mandatory for the government to present vote on account instead of a full budget in an election year?\n\nIt is not mandatory for the government to present a vote on account in an election year.\n\nThough the convention is to present an interim budget and get the fund required for spending via the vote on account route, the government (if it wishes so) can even go for a Full Budget and get the appropriation bills passed to get the finances.\n\nHowever, during an election year,\u00a0the ruling government generally opts for a vote-on-account or interim budget instead of a full budget. While technically, it is not mandatory for the government to present a vote-on-account, but it would be inappropriate to impose policies that may or may not be acceptable to the incoming government taking over in the same year.\n\nRead: Interim Budget 2024"

Read further to know more.\n\nTax Expenditure corresponds to relaxations given when tax burden becomes difficult for the sustainability of a particular sector. Tax exemptions or incentives are given in the form of lower rates of tax relative to normal rates.\n\nTax expenditures are revenue losses attributable to tax provisions that often result from the use of the tax system to promote social goals without incurring direct expenditures.\n\nNormally these exemptions are generated for particular purposes as tax incentives. [Why we are talking about this now : Because,\u00a0UPSC asked a question in 2013 Mains as follows: \u201cWhat is the meaning of the term tax-expenditure? Taking housing sector as an example, discuss how it influences budgetary policies of the government.\u201d\n\nTable of Contents\n\nTax Expenditure and its importance in Indian Economy\nWhy Tax Exemptions given are called Tax Expenditure?\nTax Expenditure and Budgetary Policies in Housing Sector\nTax Expenditure Budget\nVolume of Tax Expenditure and Subsidies\nReference links for Tax Expenditure:\nTax Expenditure and its importance in Indian Economy\n\nThe term \u2018tax expenditure\u2019 is associated with budget. Though many are familiar with the concept of subsidies and its impact on Indian Economy, it seems not every one know the details of tax-expenditure. Tax-expenditure more or less has the same impact as subsidies as a necessary evil.\n\nTax expenditures can take many forms. Some result from tax provisions that reduce the present value of taxable income through deferral allowances, or special exclusions, exemptions, or deductions from gross income. Others affect a household\u2019s after-tax income more directly through tax credits or preferential rates for specific activities.\n\nWhy Tax Exemptions given are called Tax Expenditure?\n\nIf government didn\u2019t give any tax exemptions, this deducted amount would have belonged to government itself. Though Tax Expenditure are not direct spending by government, the concept of tax expenditure is that, government is giving back money to achieve certain social goals, like strengthening housing sector or industrial sector. But in actual sense, Government is not collecting money to be re-distributed later, but gives away tax exemptions.\n\n\ud83d\udc49 Which year are YOU targeting for success in the IAS/IPS/IFS Exam? \ud83d\ude80\n\n(1) \u21d2 UPSC 2025: Prelims cum Mains\n\n(2) \u21d2 UPSC 2026: Prelims cum Mains\n\n(3) \u21d2 UPSC 2027 Prelims cum Mains\n\nTip: Know more about ClearIAS Courses (Online/Offline)\n\nTax Expenditure and Budgetary Policies in Housing Sector\n\n\u00a0\n\nExemptions allowed for deduction of HRA (Income tax) and various other income tax deductions and exemptions (Eg: Medical Premium).\nExemptions allowed for interest payment and principal repayment for housing loans.\nTax Expenditure in Union Budget 2013 :\u00a0First home loan from a bank or housing finance corporation upto Rs. 25 lakh entitled to additional deduction of interest upto Rs. 1 lakh.\nNB: It should be noted that due to various policies of government, the number of persons who own houses have increased. More over, the people can afford to spend on infrastructure as they don\u2019t have to give taxes.\nTax Expenditure Budget\n\nThe tax expenditure budget comprises the estimated revenue losses attributable to various exclusions, exemptions, deductions, nonrefundable credits, deferrals, and preferential rates in the tax code. These provisions reduce the income tax liabilities of individuals or businesses that undertake certain types of activities.\n\nVolume of Tax Expenditure and Subsidies\n\nSo we hope now it is clear that tax-expenditure corresponds to the revenue a government foregoes through the provisions of tax laws that allow deductions, exclusions, or exemptions from the taxpayers\u2019 taxable expenditure.\n\nThe revenue foregone from corporate and personal income taxes, estate, and customs duties amounts to near 6.5 per cent of GDP. As a share of revenue realised, the foregone revenue accounts to near 80%. As is it is clear, this is by now means a meager amount.\n\nYou might have heard opposition parties shouting about crony capitalism and excess favors done to corporates. Yes, you can connect tax expenditure right here. And that may be one of the reasons why UPSC asked this question. But UPSC was concerned only about Housing sector; so the answer should also be written from that perspective, highlighting the positives and negatives.\n\nReference links for Tax Expenditure:\ntaxpolicycenter.org."

Fiscal deficit in layman\u2019s terms corresponds to the borrowings and liabilities of the government. As per the technical definition,\n\nFiscal Deficit = Budgetary Deficit + Borrowings and Other Liabilities of the government.\n\nNote: Deficit differs from debt, which is an accumulation of yearly deficits.\u00a0The elements of the fiscal deficit are\u00a0revenue deficit and\u00a0capital expenditure.\nNote: Revenue deficit is the difference between the government\u2019s revenue\u00a0expenditure and total revenue receipts.\n\nAlso read: Indian Budget and Fiscal Deficit.\n\n\u00a0\n\nYes, there is gap between income and expenditure \u2013 But how to fill the gap?\n\nThe fiscal deficit can be financed by borrowing from the Reserve Bank of India (which is also called deficit financing or money creation) and market borrowing (from the money market, that is mainly from banks).\n\n\ud83d\udc49 Which year are YOU targeting for success in the IAS/IPS/IFS Exam? \ud83d\ude80\n\n(1) \u21d2 UPSC 2025: Prelims cum Mains\n\n(2) \u21d2 UPSC 2026: Prelims cum Mains\n\n(3) \u21d2 UPSC 2027 Prelims cum Mains\n\nTip: Know more about ClearIAS Courses (Online/Offline)\n\nBut uncontrolled borrowing is not good for the economy, as a greater portion of the governments revenue will in future be used to pay back the interest of loans and the money available for social sector initiatives will reduce. Besides the fiscal deficits accumulate over years resulting in a big debts and debt traps.\n\nWhile steps taken by the government to bring the 2012/13 fiscal deficit within a targeted 5.3 percent of GDP have reduced near term risks, cuts in politically sensitive subsidies were needed for sustainable fiscal consolidation. RBI expects government to control its unproductive expenditure to bridge the gap.\n\nWhat is Current Account Deficit (CAD)?\n\nCurrent Account is the sum of the balance of trade (exports minus imports of goods and services), net factor income (such as interest and dividends) and net transfer payments (such as foreign aid).\n\nCurrent Account= Trade balance+Net factor income+Net transfer payments\n\nAlso read about, balance of payments\n\nHow should the gap in dollar supply be filled?\n\nThe right way to fill the gap is by increasing the exports and decreasing the imports, which is a step easier said than done. At present India is depending more on FIIs to fill the gap, but since these investments are volatile and risky, this is not healthy. We need urgent steps to boost FDI and exports.\n\nThe current account deficit (CAD) touched a record of more than 5% of GDP in 2014.\u00a0But in came down later, thanks to the measures taken by RBI and fall in global oil prices.\n\nTwin Deficit Problem\n\nCurrent Account Deficit and Fiscal Deficit, both of which occur when a country\u2019s spending exceeds its income, are referred to as twin deficit problem\u00a0because they frequently reinforce one another. For example, a high fiscal deficit causes a higher current account deficit, and vice versa.\n\nImpact of twin deficit problem\n\nThe twin deficit issue, particularly the expanding current account deficit, could amplify the impact of more expensive imports and devalue the rupee, further escalating external imbalances."

Increasingly it has also become a forum for analysis and research on the economy, and hence also a source of policy ideas.\n\nWhen was the first Economic Survey of India presented?\n\nIndias first Economic Survey was presented in the year 1950-51. Up to\u00a01964, it was presented along with the Union Budget. From 1964 0nwards, it has been delinked from the Budget.\n\nWho prepares the Economic Survey?\n\nThe Economic Survey was prepared by the Economic Division of the Department of Economic Affairs in the Finance Ministry under the overall guidance of the Cheif Economic Adviser. After receiving inputs from the senior officers in the Ministry of Finance, the final version of the Economic Survey is scrutinized by the Finance Secretary and finally approved by the Union Finance Minister.\n\nWhen is Economic Survey presented?\n\nIt is presented every year in the Parliment during the Budget Session.

Moreover, backed with a robust end-to-end IT system, it would be easier to administer.\nBetter control on leakage: Because of better tax compliance, reduction of rent-seeking, transparency in taxation due to IT use, and an inbuilt mechanism in the design of GST would incentivize tax compliance by traders.\nHigher revenue efficiency: Since the cost of the collection will decrease along with an increase in the ease of compliance, it will lead to higher tax revenue.\nFor the Consumer\nThe single and transparent tax will provide a lowering of inflation.\nRelief in overall tax burden.\nTax democracy that is luxury items will be taxed more and basic goods will be tax-free.\nFor the Business Class\nThe ease of doing business will increase due to easy tax compliance.\nUniformity of tax rate and structure, therefore, better future business decision making and investments by the corporates.\nRemoval of cascading effects of taxes.\nReduction in transactional costs will lead to improved competitiveness.\nGain to the manufacturers and exporters.\nIt is expected to raise the country\u2019s GDP by 2% points.\n\nNote: We have covered the 10 major benefits of Goods and Service Tax in a separate article.\n\nGST Council\nIt is the 1st Federal Institution of India, as per the Finance minister.\nIt will approve all decisions related to taxation in the country.\nIt consists of the Centre, 29 states, Delhi and Puducherry.\nCentre has 1/3rd of voting rights and states have 2/3rd of voting rights.\nDecisions are taken after a majority in the council.\nSupporting Laws to implement GST\n\nFor the implementation of GST, apart from the Constitution Amendment Act, some other statutes are also necessary. Recently 5 supporting laws to the GST were recommended by the council. 4 of the bills should be passed by the parliament, while the 5th one should be passed by respective state legislatures.

States argue that including them would hamper their revenue and they would suffer a huge resource. However, some experts say that the real reason is the nexus of politicians with some business class and high-profile lobbying. Further, the Finance minister of India has said in the parliament that the consensus to include alcohol and tobacco under the GST regime is possible in foreseeable future.\nDecision criteria for the tax bracket: There are apprehensions that how to decide about the items and the criteria that which item will fall into which tax bracket. It may lead to lobbying. To this, the Finance minister has said that the decision will be taken by the GST Council only after due diligence and most probably by consensus.\nMultiple tax rates and brackets: The philosophical idea that GST means \u201cOne Nation one Tax\u201d is currently diluted due to multiple tax rates and brackets. To this, the Finance minister has said that since the target consumer of goods and services have different capabilities and therefore there must be a system similar to the democratic lines where higher value consumer pays more taxes.\nPower to impose tax taken away by Central Government from the Parliament: The Central GST Bill, 2017 allows the central government to notify CGST rates, subject to a cap. This implies that the government may change rates subject to a cap of 20%, without requiring the approval of Parliament. Under the Constitution, the power to levy taxes is vested in Parliament and state legislatures. Though the proposal to set the rates through delegated legislation meets this requirement, the question is whether it is appropriate to do so without prior parliamentary scrutiny and approval.\nConfusion regarding the location of consumption: Under GST, both state and the Centre can tax the services based on their location of consumption. Now the confusion arises since the general rule to determine the location of the recipient is his location or address on record; there are specific rules for various services such as telecom, property, transportation, etc. This means that while a service may be consumed across multiple states, the tax revenue would be attributed to the state where the recipient is registered or his office is located.\u00a0 This could lead to higher taxes attributed to states that have more registered offices. For example, suppose a company is located in Bangalore and advertises its products in the Kolkata edition of a newspaper, which has its registered office in Delhi. In this case, one may argue that the service is being finally consumed in Kolkata. However, as the recipient of services is in Bangalore, the tax would accrue to Karnataka.\nAnti-Profiteering Clause: The government is planning to set up an authority to see if any reduction in tax rates after GST is passed on to the consumer by companies or not. The industry and businesses are not taking this idea kindly and they see it as a backdoor entry of inspector raj. Experts say that prices should be market determined and no government authority has the business of deciding prices for goods and services.\nConfusion regarding the control over taxation: To avoid dual control, the GST council has reached a compromised formula. 90 percent of tax assesses with an annual turnover of Rs 1.5 crore or less, will be assessed by states and the rest by the Centre. For those with a turnover of over Rs 1.5 crore, the states and the Centre will share it equally.\u00a0However, this \u2018solution\u2019 has its own set of issues. For example, if an entity with a turnover of less than Rs 1.5 crore in one year, posts a turnover of Rs 1.5 crore in the following financial year, who would be the new authority to take over the assessment? And, how will the existing investigations, if any, against the entity be addressed, and by whom? \u201cThere are a lot of procedural issues, and if these issues are not addressed properly, they would lead to litigations.\nThe issue of casual taxable person: If a person registered in one state moves to another state for a short period for some business transaction \u2013\u00a0say to participate in a fair or exhibition, then that person would have to get himself registered in that state for that period.\n\u00a0What is GSTN?\nGSTN is registered as a not-for-profit company under the Companies Act.\nIt has been formed to set up and operate the information technology backbone of the GST.\nWhile the Central (24.5%) and the state (24.5%) governments hold a combined stake of 49%, the remaining 51% stake is divided among five financial institutions\u2014LIC Housing Finance with 11% stake and ICICI Bank, HDFC, HDFC Bank and NSE Strategic Investment Corporation Ltd with 10% stake each.\nGSTN had awarded Infosys Ltd the contract to develop the hardware and software for GST.\nThe idea behind GSTN was to set up an entity that is equidistant from both the Central government and the state governments, as it will advise both the Centre and the states on the information technology network\nControversy around GSTN\n\nIt is argued by some as a private company and therefore not under government control. It may lead to a breach of tax data into private hands and manipulation of the same for the advantage of some corporates.\n\nTo this allegation, the Finance minister replied in the parliament that this arrangement was decided by the empowered committee of the previous government and the present government has endorsed it by considering the fact that private professionals are required for a such a high-octane system. Further, he said that if in future there seems to be any problem with the current structure then it can be changed through the GST Council debate and discussion.\n\nFurther, the GSTN website clarifies that the strategic control over GSTN is with the government given the sensitivity of the role of GSTN and the information that would be available to it. The strategic control of the government over GSTN is ensured through measures such as the composition of the board, mechanism of special resolution and shareholders agreement, induction of government officers on deputation and agreements between GSTN and governments.\n\nAlso Read: Types of Taxes in India\n\nArticle by: Nishant\u00a0Raj.

            "[CONTENT]": "Economic Survey for the year 2016-17 has an entire chapter dedicated to the discussion on Universal Basic Income (UBI). In this article let us try to understand the concept of Universal Basic Income, why it is needed, what are the challenges in its implementation and other related issues.\n\nTable of Contents\n\nWhat is Universal Basic Income (UBI)?\nWhy Universal Basic Income?\nHow does UBI work?\nWhat does UBI mean to the Government?\nWhat are the advantages of UBI?\nWhat are the main arguments against UBI?\nWhat are the challenges that may face in Implementation of UBI?\nWhat Economic Survey 2016-17 says about UBI?\nUBI and \u2018JAM Trinity\u2019\nThe main problems in \u2018JAM Trinity\u2019\nUBI in other parts of the world\nConclusion\nWhat is Universal Basic Income (UBI)?\n\nUniversal Basic Income is a periodic, unconditional cash transfer to every citizen in the country.\nHere, social or economic positions of the individual are not taken into consideration.\nThe concept of universal basic income has three main features. They are as following:\nUBI is universal in nature. It means UBI is not targeted.\nThe second feature of UBI is cash transfer instead of in-kind transfer.\nThe third feature is that UBI is unconditional. That means one need not prove his or her unemployment status or socio-economic identity to be eligible for UBI.\nWhy Universal Basic Income?\n\nNote: Subscribe to the ClearIAS YouTube Channel to learn more.\n\nAs a form of social security UBI will help in reducing inequality and eliminating poverty. Thus it ensures security and dignity for all individuals.\nAs human labour is being substituted by technology, there will be reduced wage income and reduced purchasing power. UBI will compensate for reduced purchasing power.\nHow does UBI work?\nUnder UBI, only those with zero income will receive the full benefits in net terms.\nFor those, who earn additional income over the basic income, the net benefits will taper off through taxation.\nSo even though the basic income is universal, only the poor will receive the full benefits.\nWhat does UBI mean to the Government?\nThere would be drastic changes in the way government spends its revenue generated from taxation and other sources.\nCurrently, the Government spends its revenue on various services as well as on subsidies.\nUBI would mean that government may move away from service delivery and empower its citizens to access services through cash transfer.\nWhat are the advantages of UBI?\n\nFirst, UBI would give individuals freedom to spend the money in a way they choose. In other words, UBI strengthens economic liberty at an individual level. This would help them to choose the kind of work they want to do, rather than forcing them to do unproductive work to meet their daily requirements.\nUniversal Basic Income would be a sort of an insurance against unemployment and hence helps in reducing poverty.\nUBI will result in equitable distribution of wealth. As explained above, only poor will receive the full net benefits.\nIncreased income will increase the bargaining power of individuals, as they will no longer be forced to accept any working conditions.\nUBI is easy to implement. Because of its universal character, there is no need to identify the beneficiaries. Thus it excludes errors in identifying the intended beneficiaries \u2013 which is a common problem in targeted welfare schemes.\nAs every individual receive basic income, it promotes efficiency by reducing wastages in government transfers. This would also help in reducing corruption.\nConsiderable gains could be achieved in terms of bureaucratic costs and time by replacing many of the social sector schemes with UBI.\nAs economic survey points out, transferring basic income directly into bank accounts will increase the demand for financial services. This would help banks to invest in the expansion of their service network, which is very important for financial inclusion.\nUnder some circumstances, UBI could promote greater productivity. For example, agriculture labourers who own small patch of land and earlier used to work in others\u2019 farm for low wages, can now undertake farming on their own land. In long term, this will reduce the percentage of unused land and helps in increasing agriculture productivity.\nWhat are the main arguments against UBI?\nA guaranteed minimum income might make people lazy and it breeds dependency. They may opt out of labour market.\nThere is no guarantee that the additional income will be spent on education, health etc. there are chances that the money will be spent on \u2018temptation goods\u2019 such as alcohol, tobacco, drugs etc.\nGiven the large population size, the fiscal burden on government would be high. Also, as Economic Survey 2016-17 noted, once implemented, it may become difficult for the government to wind up a UBI in the case of failure.\nIf the UBI is funded by higher taxes, especially by the indirect taxes, it will result in inflation. This, in turn, will reduce the purchasing power of the people and lowers the value of the amount transferred.\nA \u2018guaranteed minimum income\u2019 might reduce the availability of workers in some sectors which are necessary but unattractive and raise the wages of such works. For example, the wages of agriculture labour might increase due to non-availability of workers willing to work in others\u2019 farm.\nWhat are the challenges that may face in Implementation of UBI?\nAccording to World Bank, in India, there are only 20 ATMs for every one lakh adult population. Nearly one-third of the Indian adults remain unbanked. With such a state of financial service infrastructure and financial inclusion, it would be difficult for the people to access their benefits.\nFinancing the \u2018guaranteed minimum income\u2019 would be another challenge. There are chances that UBI would become an add-on to existing subsidies rather than replace them.\nWhat Economic Survey 2016-17 says about UBI?\n\nThe Economic survey 2016-17 assumes that in practice any program cannot strive for strict universality. So survey proposes some alternatives.\n\nFirst, survey targets bottom 75 percent of the population and this is termed as \u2018quasi-universality\u2019\u2019. The cost for this quasi-universality is estimated to be around 4.9 percent of GDP.\nSecond alternative targets women, who generally face worse prospects in employment opportunities, education, health or financial inclusion. A UBI for women can reduce the fiscal cost of providing a UBI to about half. Giving money to women also reduces the concerns of money being used on \u2018temptation goods\u2019.\nThird, to start with a UBI for certain vulnerable groups such as widows, pregnant mothers, the old and the infirm.\n\nBut, if any one of the above alternatives is adopted, it will also face the problem of \u2018exclusion error\u2019 in the identification of beneficiaries. Efficiency will be reduced. Corruption will creep in. \u00a0More importantly, UBI will not remain \u2018universal\u2019.\n\n\ud83d\udc49 Which year are YOU targeting for success in the IAS/IPS/IFS Exam? \ud83d\ude80\n\n(1) \u21d2 UPSC 2025: Prelims cum Mains\n\n(2) \u21d2 UPSC 2026: Prelims cum Mains\n\n(3) \u21d2 UPSC 2027 Prelims cum Mains\n\nTip: Know more about ClearIAS Courses (Online/Offline)\n\nUBI and \u2018JAM Trinity\u2019\n\nJAM is the short form of\u00a0Jan Dhan-Aadhaar-Mobile.\nCurrently, there are 26.5 crore Jan Dhan accounts across the country. This covers 21 percent of the population. Of these accounts, 57 percent are Aadhaar seeded.\nOver a billion Aadhaar cards have been distributed.\nWhen the trinity of Jan-Dhan, Aadhaar, and Mobile (popularly referred to as JAM) is fully adopted, a more efficient mode of delivery would be available.\nJAM system could be used to provide funds to each individual directly into his or her account.\nThe main problems in \u2018JAM Trinity\u2019\nAuthentication failures in Aadhaar are as high as 49 percent in Jharkhand. This will result in the exclusion of beneficiaries.\nA Large number of Jan Dhan accounts are not active. According to Financial Inclusion Insights (FII \u2013 2015), only 40 percent of the accounts are active.\nStill, nearly one-third of the Indian adults remained unbanked.\nThere are issues in mobile network connectivity, especially in rural India.\nUBI in other parts of the world\nFinland has started a pilot programme this year to understand the effects of a basic income. Finland government would pay \u20ac560 per month to two thousand unemployed individuals for next two years, and it would continue to provide the income even if individuals find employment during this period.\nSome regions in the Netherlands and Canada have also announced the pilot programme.\nBut, last year, Switzerland voted on UBI and rejected the proposal to transfer 2,500 Swiss francs per month to every adult citizen and long-term resident. The fiscal implication was the main reason for rejection of the proposal in Switzerland.\nConclusion\n\nDespite making remarkable progress in poverty reduction, nearly 22 percent of the population lives below poverty line (Tendulkar committee report, 2011-12). One of the major criticisms of poverty alleviation programmes is significant leakages. UBI is seen as a more efficient alternative.\n\nThough UBI has many advantages, there are many practical challenges too. A transparent and safe financial architecture that is accessible to all is important for the success of the UBI. In other words, the success of UBI depends on the success of efficient mode of delivery like JAM Trinity.\n\nAlso, a behavioral change on the part of account holders needed so that they use their accounts more often. Banks need to find it profitable to provide access to banking services.\n\nAs Economic Survey states, UBI is a powerful idea whose time even if not ripe for implementation is ripe for serious discussion.\n\nArticle by:\u00a0Divakar Shenoy H"

The production involves the \u2018provision\u2019 of services that are \u2018consumed. Exchange involves trade, transport and communication facilities that are used to overcome distance.\n\nTertiary jobs = White-collar jobs.\n\nQuaternary\u00a0activities\n\nQuaternary activities are specialized tertiary activities in the \u2018Knowledge Sector\u2019 which demands a separate classification. There has been a very high growth in demand for and consumption of information-based services from mutual fund managers to tax consultants, software developers and statisticians. Personnel working in office buildings, elementary schools and university classrooms, hospitals and doctors\u2019 offices, theatres, accounting and brokerage firms all belong to this category of services. Like some of the tertiary functions, quaternary activities can also be outsourced. They are not tied to resources, affected by the environment, or necessarily localised by market.\n\nQuinary\u00a0activities\n\nQuinary activities are services that focus on the creation, re-arrangement and interpretation of new and existing ideas; data interpretation and the use and evaluation of new technologies. Often referred to as \u2018gold collar\u2019 professions, they represent another subdivision of the tertiary sector representing special and highly paid skills of senior business executives, government officials, research scientists, financial and legal consultants, etc. Their importance in the structure of advanced economies far outweighs their numbers. The highest level of decision-makers or policymakers performs quinary activities.\n\nQuinary = Gold collar professions."

These factors include physical, economic, social, and historical considerations.\n\nPrimary Sector Industries\nNatural Resources: Industries involved in extracting raw materials, such as agriculture, mining, and forestry, tend to be located near the sources of natural resources.\nFor example, agricultural activities are usually situated in regions with fertile soil and favorable climatic conditions.\nSecondary Sector Industries\nRaw Material Availability: Industries like manufacturing and construction rely on the proximity to raw materials. Regions with easy access to raw materials, such as iron ore for steel production, tend to attract these industries.\nTransportation: Proximity to transportation networks, including roads, railways, and ports, is crucial for the movement of raw materials and finished products. Industries often locate near transportation hubs to minimize costs.\nLabor Availability: Labor-intensive industries are often located where there is a skilled or low-cost labor force. Textile and garment industries, for instance, may be located in regions with a large workforce.\nEnergy Availability: Industries requiring a significant amount of energy, like heavy manufacturing, may be located near energy sources such as coal, hydroelectric power, or oil and gas.\nMarket Proximity: Industries that produce consumer goods may locate close to major markets to reduce transportation costs and reach consumers efficiently.\nGovernment Policies: Incentives and regulations set by governments can influence industry location. Tax breaks, subsidies, and other policies can attract industries to specific regions.\nTertiary Sector Industries\nMarket Demand: Service industries, such as retail, hospitality, and healthcare, are often located in areas with high population densities and strong consumer demand.\nAccess to Customers: Proximity to potential customers is important for many service industries. Businesses like banks and restaurants are often located in commercial and urban centers.\nTransportation and Accessibility: Service industries need good transportation links to serve customers effectively. Airports, highways, and public transportation play a role in location decisions.\nInfrastructure: The availability of modern infrastructure, including communication networks, is important for service industries that rely on information and technology.\nEconomic Base: Tertiary sector industries are often concentrated in urban areas with diverse economic activities and a larger consumer base.\n\nIndustrial locations are complex. These are influenced by the availability of many factors. Some of them are raw materials, land, water, labor, capital, power, transport, and market.\n\n\ud83d\udc49 Which year are YOU targeting for success in the IAS/IPS/IFS Exam? \ud83d\ude80\n\n(1) \u21d2 UPSC 2025: Prelims cum Mains\n\n(2) \u21d2 UPSC 2026: Prelims cum Mains\n\n(3) \u21d2 UPSC 2027 Prelims cum Mains\n\nTip: Know more about ClearIAS Courses (Online/Offline)\n\nFor ease of convenience, we can classify the location factors into two: geographical factors and non-geographical factors.\n\nGeographical Factors\n\n\u00a0\n\nRaw material: Availability of natural resources that can be used as raw material.\nTechnology: To turn the resource into an asset with value.\nPower: To utilize the technology.\nLabor: Human resources in the area who can function as labor to run the processes.\nTransport: Road/rail connectivity.\nStorage and warehousing.\nMarketing feasibility.\nCharacteristics of land and soil.\nClimate.\nPrecipitation and water resources.\nVulnerability to natural resources.\n\nExplanation:\n\nRaw materials are one of the important factors in an industrial location. The mere location of industries itself may be determined by the availability or location of the raw materials.\nPower \u2013 conventional (coal, mineral oil, or hydroelectricity) or- conventional is a necessity for any industrial establishment.\nThe availability of labor or a skilled workforce is the success mantra for the growth of all industries.\nThe availability of easy transportation always influences the location of the industry. So the junction points of waterways, roadways, and railways become humming centers of industrial activity.\nThe finished goods should reach the market at the end of the process of manufacturing. Thus nearness to the market is an add-on quality in the process of selecting a location for industry.\nThe availability of water is another factor that influences the industrial location. Many industries are established near rivers, canals, and lakes, because of this reason. Iron and steel industries, textile industries, and chemical industries require large quantities of water, for their proper functioning.\nThe site that is selected for the establishment of an industry must be flat and well-served by adequate transport facilities.\nThe climate of the area selected for the industry is important, very harsh climates are not suitable for successful industrial growth.\nNon-geographical Factors\nCapital investment.\nAvailability of loans.\nInvestment climate.\nGovernment policies/regulations.\nInfluence of pressure groups.\n\nExplanation:\n\nCapital or huge investment is needed for the establishment of industries.\nGovernment policies are another factor that influences industrial location. The government sets certain restrictions in the allocation of land for industries to reduce regional disparities, control excessive pollution, and avoid the excessive clustering of industries in big cities.\nIndustrial inertia is the predisposition of industries or companies to avoid relocating facilities even in the face of changing economic circumstances that would otherwise induce them to leave. Often the costs associated with relocating fixed capital assets and labor far outweigh the costs of adapting to the changing conditions of an existing location.\nEfficient and enterprising organization and management are essential for running the modem industry successfully.\nThe location that has better banking facilities and Insurance are best suited for the establishment of industries.\n\nIt is rarely possible to find all these factors available in one place. Consequently, manufacturing activity tends to be located at the most appropriate place where all the factors of industrial location are either available or can be arranged at a lower cost.\n\nIn general, it should also be noted that both lower production cost and lower distribution cost are the two major factors when considering the location of an industry. Sometimes, the government provides incentives like subsidized power, lower transport costs, and other infrastructure so that industries may be located in backward areas.\n\nIndustrial System\n\nAn industrial system consists of inputs, processes, and outputs. The inputs are the raw materials, labor, and costs of land, transport, power, and other infrastructure.\n\nThe processes include a wide range of activities that convert the raw material into finished products. The outputs are the end product and the income earned from it. In the case of the textile industry, the inputs may be cotton, human labor, factory, and transport costs.\n\nThe processes include ginning, spinning, weaving, dyeing, and printing. The output is the shirt you wear.\n\nIndustrialization and Urbanization\n\nAfter an industrial activity starts, urbanization follows. Sometimes, industries are located in or near the cities. Thus, industrialization and urbanization go hand in hand. Cities provide markets and also provide services such as banking, insurance, transport, labor, consultants financial advice, etc. to the industry.\n\nAgglomeration Economies\n\nMany industries tend to come together to make use of the advantages offered by the urban centers known as agglomeration economies. Gradually, a large industrial agglomeration takes place.\n\nFactors Responsible for the Location of Primary Secondary and Tertiary Sector Industries in India\n\nIn the pre-independence period, most manufacturing units were located in places from the point of view of overseas trade such as Mumbai, Kolkata, Chennai, etc.\n\nConsequently, there emerged certain pockets of industrially developed urban centers surrounded by a huge agricultural rural hinterland.\n\nIndia\u2019s primary sector industries, like agriculture, are influenced by factors such as climate, soil fertility, and water availability.\nSecondary industries often located near raw material sources, such as steel plants near iron ore deposits.\nTertiary sector industries are often found in urban areas with a dense population and consumer demand, such as cities with IT hubs.\n\nA combination of factors unique to each sector and region shapes the location of industries around the world, contributing to regional economic development and specialization.\n\nRelated posts\nIndustrial Regions of India\nDistribution of Major Industries: Location Factors"

It focused on causes of farmer\u2019s distresses and the rise in farmers\u2019 suicides.\u00a0 Based on the recommendations submitted in 2006, a \u2018National Draft Policy for Farmers\u2018 was placed before the Parliament in\u00a0October 2007. (Reference \u2013 Kisanayog)\n\nThe National Commission on Farmers\u2019 findings and recommendations mainly focused on issues of access to resources and social security entitlements. It contains suggestions for inclusive growth of farmers and agriculture sector in India. It is aimed at working out a system for food and nutrition security, sustainability in the\u00a0farming system, enhancing quality and cost competitiveness of farm commodities and also to recommend measures for credit and other marketing related steps. However, most of the recommendations in the reports of\u00a0National Commission on Farmers are not yet implemented.\n\nRecommendations of the National Commission on Farmers\nAsset reforms\n1. LAND REFORM:\n\nLand reforms are necessary to address the basic issue of access to land for both crops and livestock.\u00a0 Land holdings inequality is reflected in land ownership.\u00a0 In 1991-92, the share of the bottom half of the rural households in the total land ownership was only 3% and the top 10% was as high as 54%.\n\n\ud83d\udc49 Which year are YOU targeting for success in the IAS/IPS/IFS Exam? \ud83d\ude80\n\n(1) \u21d2 UPSC 2025: Prelims cum Mains\n\n(2) \u21d2 UPSC 2026: Prelims cum Mains\n\n(3) \u21d2 UPSC 2027 Prelims cum Mains\n\nTip: Know more about ClearIAS Courses (Online/Offline)\n\nReforms in tenancy laws, land leasing, distribution of ceiling surplus land and wasteland, providing adequate access to common property and wasteland resources, and the consolidation of holdings.\nPrevent diversion of prime agricultural land and forest to the corporate sector for non-agricultural purposes.\nWherever feasible, landless labour households should be provided with at least 1 acre per household, which will give them space for home gardens and animal rearing.\nEstablish a National Land Use Advisory Service, which would have the capacity to link land use decisions with ecological meteorological and marketing factors on a location and season-specific basis.\n2. WATER:\n\nWater is a public good and social resource and not private property. Priority should be given to evolving just and equitable mechanisms to give access to water and to include local people in the management of water resources. The following steps are needed for supply augmentation and demand management of water resource:\n\nRainwater harvesting and aquifer recharge should be mandatory and farmers must be provided with financial assistance to invest in the replenishment of their renewable resource. This is the imperative need for conservation farming.\nDemand management through improved irrigation practices, including sprinkler and drip irrigation, should receive priority attention.\nA water literacy movement should be launched and regulations should be developed for the sustainable use of groundwater.\nIn water-scarce areas, the land use system should place emphasis on the cultivation of high value \u2013 low water requiring crops, such as pulses and oilseeds.\nA Pani Panchayat in every village can help in getting the available water distributed on an equitable basis.\nWater Users\u2019 Associations may be encouraged to gain expertise in maximizing the benefits of the available water. The National Rainfed Area Authority could help in promoting scientific water harvesting, sustainable and equitable use and the introduction of efficient methods of water use.\nIn drought-prone areas, a Drought Code may be introduced which details the action needed to minimize the impact of an adverse monsoon and maximize the benefits of a good season. Similarly, in areas prone to heavy rainfall, a Flood Code may be introduced.\n3. LIVESTOCK:\n\nLivestock, including poultry, is the second major land-based livelihood, contributing 26% of the agricultural GDP in 2004-05. It is clear that livestock and livelihoods are very intimately related in our country and that crop-livestock integrated farming is the pathway to farmers\u2019 well-being.\n\nAn urgent need for establishing Livestock Feed and Fodder Corporations at the State Level for ensuring availability of quality fodder and feed.\nA National Livestock Development Council may be established to give integrated attention to all aspects of this important sector, such as breeding policy, feed and fodder, healthcare through Para-veterinary professionals, marketing, value addition, biomass utilization (skin, bones and blood) and efficient use of animal energy, for example, through improved bullock carts.\nPoultry rearing should be recognized as an agricultural activity and appropriate support should be provided to backyard poultry farmers to establish Small Holders\u2019 Poultry Estates.\n4. FISHERIES:\n\nBoth coastal and inland fisheries provide employment and livelihoods to millions of families. There is considerable scope for improving the income of fisher families on an environmentally sustainable basis by introducing Integrated Coastal Zone Management and scientific fish rearing, harvesting and processing.\n\n\u201cFish for All Training and Capacity Building Centres\u201d which can impart training to fisher families in all aspects of the capture/culture\u2013consumption chain.\nQuality literacy to safeguard the harvested fish from Salmonella and other infections capable of producing mycotoxins.\nInland aquaculture, including the culture of ornamental fish and air-breathing fish, for additional income by providing necessary space in ponds and reservoirs.\nArtificial coral reefs to compensate for the loss of natural coral reefs to revive the fish catch.\nThe coastal communities can also be enabled to raise bio-shields comprising mangroves, Casuarina, salicornia, atriplex and other halophytic plants, to safeguard the lives and livelihoods of coastal fisher and farm families in the event of cyclonic storms and seawater inundation, as for example like the one caused by the tsunami of December 26, 2004.\n5. BIORESOURCES:\n\nBioresources refer to the abundant wealth of flora and fauna including soil micro-flora and micro-fauna.\n\nPreserving traditional rights of access to biodiversity, which include access to non-timber forest products including medicinal plants, gums and resins, oil-yielding plants and beneficial micro-organisms.\nConserving, enhancing and improving crops and farm animals as well as fish stocks through breeding.\nGenetic engineers working in public good institutions should perform the role of pre-breeding, i.e., development of novel genetic combinations for important economic traits, such as resistance to biotic and abiotic stresses. They should then work with farmers in participatory breeding programs so that genetic efficiency and genetic diversity can be integrated in an effective manner.\nGenome Clubs can be organized in rural schools and colleges for imparting an understanding of the importance of genetic resources conservation.\nA genetic and legal literacy movement must be launched in areas rich in agro-biodiversities such as the North East, Western and the Eastern Ghats and the Arid Zone.\nReforms in support services\n\n1. SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY:\nThe research strategy should be a pro-nature and pro-small farmer.\nA National Biotechnology Regulatory Authority should be set up for safe and responsible use of recombinant DNA technology, with farmers\u2019 representatives on it.\nIntellectual Property Rights (IPR) policies should make provision for compulsory licensing of rights in the cases of research products and processes of value to resource-poor farming families.\n2. AGRO- METROLOGY:\nThere should be a National Land Use Advisory Service that gives proactive advice to help farm families plan their sowing based on anticipated meteorological and marketing factor. An integrated internet-FM or HAM radio service would be very helpful to fishermen on the high seas.\n3. CREDIT AND INSURANCE:\nThere is a need for both credit and insurance literacy in villages. Gyan Chaupals can help in this task.\nExpand the outreach of the formal credit system to reach the really poor and needy.\nEstablish an Agriculture Risk Fund to provide relief to farmers in the aftermath of successive natural calamities.\nKisan Credit Cards should be issued to women speedily with joint pattas to house/agricultural land as collateral.\nDrought-prone areas should have a 4-5 year repayment cycle for crop loans, taking into account the management of risk.\nFarmers of the future\n\nThe following are some of the methods that small and marginal farmers could consider for gaining in efficiency and economy:\n\nCooperative Farming and Service Cooperatives: Cooperative farming will be ideal for small and marginal farmers since the cooperative can provide centralized services like tractors and other farm equipment as well as threshing and drying machines, to support small-scale decentralized production. This will bring down the cost of production and enhance the quality of products and thereby of income.\nGroup Farming by Self-help Groups: promote the SHGs at the production end of the farming enterprise by encouraging groups to lease farmland.\nSmall Holders\u2019 Estates: The formation of Small Holders\u2019 Estates, for example in cotton, horticulture, medicinal plants, poultry and aquaculture will help promote group cooperation among farmers living in a village or watershed or the command area of an irrigation project.\nContract Farming: Symbiotic contracts which confer benefits to both producers and purchasers, will be ideal for ensuring assured and remunerative marketing opportunities. A Code of Conduct for Contract Farming will have to be developed for major groups of farm commodities such as vegetables, fruits, flowers, medicinal plants, tuber crops, pulses, oilseeds, sugarcane, cereals and cotton.\nFarmers\u2019 Companies: Small farmers and SHGs should be associated with such companies as stakeholders and not just as shareholders.\nAttracting Youth\nYouth will be attracted to take to farming as a profession only if farming becomes economically rewarding and intellectually stimulating.\nEducated youth should be helped through a form of Venture Capital Fund, low-interest loans and allotment of wastelands for setting up agri-clinics and production-cum-processing centres to undertake outsourcing jobs both from within and outside the country, enabling India to emerge as a major agricultural outsourcing hub.\nPublic policies for sustainable livelihoods\n\nThe following policies recommended by the National Commission on Farmers will the ensure well-being and livelihood security of all included under the category of \u201cfarmers\u201d:\n\nA National Land Use Advisory Service should be immediately established and linked to State and Block Level Land Use Advisory Services on a hub and spokesmodel.\nThe scope of the MSP programme should be expanded to cover all crops of importance to food and income security for small farmers.\nA Market Price Stabilization Fund should be established jointly by Central and State Governments and financial institutions to protect farmers during periods of violent fluctuations in prices. This fund has been set up in 2014-15.\nAn Agriculture Risk Fund should be set up to insulate farmers from risks arising from recurrent droughts and other weather aberrations.\nA Food Guarantee Act should be formulated and enacted. Farmers, who are also the largest consumer group, will produce more if there are greater consumption and consequently greater demand for farm produce and products.\nFarm families should also be protected from becoming victims of HIV/AIDS and tuberculosis (TB). Anti-retroviral drugs should be made available in villages free of cost.\nThere is a need for a Rural Non-Farm Livelihood Initiative\u00a0(RNFLI) for rural areas. The RNFLI could have as its core the Khadi Village Industries Commission (KVIC) and the restructured and strengthened Small Farmers\u2019 Agri-business Consortium (SFAC) and bring all rural non-farm employment programmes together, in order to generate convergence and synergy\namong them.\nAn Indian Trade Organisation (ITO) should be established to help the Government to operate a Livelihood Security Box and link global policies with local action in a manner beneficial to farmers.\nArticle 243 G of the 11th Schedule of the Constitution (73rd Amendment) Act, 1992 entrusts Panchayats with responsibility for agriculture including agricultural extension. They will have to be empowered with the needed information, training and tools for discharging this responsibility.\n\u201cJai Kisan\u201d\n\nMahatma Gandhi preferred to be known as a farmer while signing the Visitor\u2019s Book of the National Dairy Research Institute at Bangalore in 1927. Let us prove worthy of his trust that India will care for its farmers.\n\nRead:\u00a0New Schemes for Farmers\n\nArticle by: Arun Kumar"

Read further to know more.\n\nIndia is an agrarian economy with 70% of its population dependent on agriculture. Over the years we have improved our agricultural production which has been a boon. However, finding a market for the marketed surplus and getting fair prices have always been a major challenge. This points out the need for agricultural marketing in the present times.\n\nThe Model Agricultural Produce Market Committee (APMC) Act and the National Agricultural Market (NAM) are two significant initiatives aimed at modernizing agricultural marketing in the country.\n\nTable of Contents\n\nWhy is agricultural marketing so important?\nHistory of Agricultural Marketing in India\nWhat is a regulated market?\nDrawbacks of regulated markets\nAmendments in APMC Acts\nModel APMC Act 2003: Salient features\nNational Agriculture Market (NAM)\nFeatures of NAM\nChallenges for Agricultural Marketing Reforms\nSummary\nWhy is agricultural marketing so important?\n\nNote: Subscribe to the ClearIAS YouTube Channel to learn more.\n\nAgricultural marketing covers all the activities in the movement of agricultural products from the farms to the consumers.\n\n\ud83d\udc49 Which year are YOU targeting for success in the IAS/IPS/IFS Exam? \ud83d\ude80\n\n(1) \u21d2 UPSC 2025: Prelims cum Mains\n\n(2) \u21d2 UPSC 2026: Prelims cum Mains\n\n(3) \u21d2 UPSC 2027 Prelims cum Mains\n\nTip: Know more about ClearIAS Courses (Online/Offline)\n\nAdvanced agricultural practices resulted in surplus production which changed the subsistence face of Indian agriculture.\nApproximately 33% of the output of food grains, pulses, and nearly all of the production of cash crops like cotton, sugarcane, oilseeds, etc. are marketed as they remain surplus after meeting the consumption needs of the farmers.\nAs the agriculture sector produces raw materials for many of the other industries, marketing of such commercial products assumes significance.\nIncreased efficiency of the marketing mechanisms would result in the distribution of products at lower prices to consumers having a direct bearing on national income.\nAn improved marketing system will stimulate the growth in the number of agro-based industries mainly in the field of processing.\nHistory of Agricultural Marketing in India\n\nFor a long time, a traditional market system has existed in India. It was characterized by the village sales of agricultural commodities, post-harvest immediate sales by farmers, etc.\n\nIn 1928, the Royal Commission pointed out the problems of traditional marketing such as high marketing costs, unauthorized deductions, and the prevalence of various malpractices. This led to the demand for regulated markets in India.\n\nAncient Period\n\nBarter System: In ancient India, agricultural trade primarily operated on a barter system, with farmers exchanging goods and produce directly.\nLocal Markets: Small local markets, known as \u201chaats\u201d or \u201cshandies,\u201d served as venues for farmers to sell and exchange their agricultural products.\n\nMedieval Period\n\nExpansion of Trade Routes: With the expansion of trade routes during the medieval period, agricultural products gained importance in regional and interregional commerce.\nRole of Middlemen: The emergence of middlemen became more prominent, connecting farmers with distant markets and facilitating trade.\n\nMughal Era\n\nEmpire-Sponsored Markets: The Mughal rulers established markets and trade centers to facilitate agricultural commerce.\nZamindari System: The zamindari system, where revenue collectors were intermediaries between the farmers and the state, influenced agricultural marketing.\n\nBritish Colonial Period\n\nLand Revenue System: The British introduced the Permanent Settlement Act (1793) and the Ryotwari Settlement System (1820s), impacting landownership and agricultural practices.\nRailway Network: The development of the railway network during the mid-19th century facilitated the transportation of agricultural produce to distant markets.\nEstablishment of APMCs: The British introduced the concept of regulated markets through the establishment of Agricultural Produce Market Committees (APMCs) to regulate and streamline agricultural trade.\n\nPost-Independence Period\n\nAgricultural Reforms: Post-independence, the Indian government initiated various agricultural reforms to address issues of land tenure, production, and marketing.\nGreen Revolution: The Green Revolution in the 1960s led to increased agricultural production, and the need for organized marketing systems became more evident.\nCreation of NAFED: The National Agricultural Cooperative Marketing Federation of India (NAFED) was established in 1958 to promote cooperative marketing.\n\nLiberalization Era (1990s Onward)\n\nMarket Liberalization: Economic liberalization in the 1990s led to changes in agricultural marketing policies, allowing for greater private sector participation.\nIntroduction of Contract Farming: Contract farming gained prominence, with agribusinesses entering into agreements with farmers for the production and marketing of specific crops.\nNational Agricultural Market (NAM): Launched in 2015, the NAM aimed to create a unified national market for agricultural commodities by integrating APMCs through an online platform.\nWhat is a regulated market?\n\nThe regulated market aims at the elimination of unhealthy and unscrupulous practices, reducing market costs and providing benefits to both producers as well as sellers in the market.\n\nPost the independence period in the sixties and seventies, most of the states enacted the Agricultural Produce Market Regulation Acts (APMR Acts). It authorized the States to set up and regulate marketing practices in wholesale markets. The objective was to ensure that farmers get a fair price for their produce.\n\nDrawbacks of regulated markets\n\nHowever, regulated markets had some drawbacks such as:\n\nUnder this regulation, no exporter or processor could buy directly from farmers. It discouraged the processing and exporting of agricultural products.\nUnder the act, the state Government could only set up markets, thus preventing private players from setting up markets and investing in marketing infrastructure.\nFormation of cartels with links to caste and political networks resulting in price variations.\nAn increased number of middlemen formed a virtual barrier between the farmer and the consumer.\nThe licensing of commission agents in the state-regulated markets has led to the monopoly of licensed traders acting as a major entry barrier for new entrepreneurs.\nThe fragmentation of markets within the State hinders the free flow of agro- commodities from one market area to another and multiple handling of agri-produce and multiple levels of mandi charges end up escalating the prices for the consumers without commensurate benefit to the farmer.\nAmendments in APMC Acts\nConsequently, the inter-ministerial task force on agricultural marketing reforms (2002) recommended the APMC Act be amended to allow for direct marketing and the establishment of agricultural markets by the private and cooperative sectors to provide more efficient marketing and create an environment conducive to private investment.\nIn response, the Union Ministry of Agriculture proposed a model act on agricultural marketing in consultation with State governments for adoption by the States. (Here, you should note that agriculture is a state subject and hence Central government can only give guidelines. It is within the powers of state government to decide whether to make amendments or not.)\nModel APMC Act 2003: Salient features\nAs per the act, the State is divided into several market areas, each of which is administered by a separate Agricultural Produce Market Committee (APMC) which imposes its marketing regulations (including fees).\nSingle Market Fee: The Act recommends a single-point levy of market fees, eliminating multiple fees imposed at different stages of the marketing process.\nDirect Marketing: It allows farmers to sell their produce directly to consumers, processors, exporters, or bulk buyers, bypassing traditional APMC markets.\nElectronic Trading: Facilitates the use of electronic trading platforms to promote transparency and efficiency in the marketing process.\nContract Farming: Encourages contract farming arrangements between farmers and agribusiness firms, providing price assurance to farmers.\nPrice Discovery: The Act facilitates transparent price discovery mechanisms, ensuring fair remuneration for farmers.\nMarket Diversification: Farmers can access a broader market, including national and international buyers, through electronic trading platforms.\nReduced Intermediaries: Direct marketing and contract farming reduce the role of intermediaries, ensuring a higher share of profits for farmers.\nNational Agriculture Market (NAM)\n\nThe motivation for a unified market platform can be traced to the Rashtriya e-Market Services (ReMS), an initiative of Karnataka State Agricultural Marketing Board with National e-Markets Limited (NeML), erstwhile National Commodity and Derivatives Exchange (NCDEX) Spot Exchange.\n\nNAM, announced in Union Budget 2014-15, is a pan-India electronic trading portal that seeks to connect existing APMCs and other market yards to create a unified national market for agricultural commodities.\n\nFeatures of NAM\nUnified Market Platform: The NAM provides a common online platform for buyers and sellers, enabling transparent and efficient price discovery.\ne-NAM: The platform operates under the e-NAM (National Agriculture Market) initiative, allowing farmers to list their produce online and receive competitive bids from buyers.\nInterconnected Markets: APMCs across different states are gradually being interconnected through the NAM to create a seamless national market.\nPrice Transparency: The NAM enhances price transparency by providing real-time information on prices and market demand.\nReduced Transaction Costs: Electronic trading reduces transaction costs, benefiting both farmers and buyers.\nMarket Access: Farmers gain access to a larger pool of buyers, potentially improving their bargaining power.\n\nHowever, for a state to be part of NAM, it needs to undertake prior reforms in respect of\n\nA single license is to be valid across the state.\nSingle point levy of market fee.\nProvision for electronic auction as a mode of price discovery.\nChallenges for Agricultural Marketing Reforms\n\nThe model APMC act that promoted the participation of the private sector has not been implemented by all the states and the monopoly of APMC continues.\n\nImplementation Issues: Some states have faced challenges in implementing the provisions of the Model APMC Act effectively.\nResistance to Change: Traditional market participants may resist changes that diminish their role in the marketing process.\nLimited Coverage: The NAM is still in the process of expanding its coverage to include more APMCs and commodities.\nInfrastructure and Connectivity: Challenges related to infrastructure and internet connectivity in rural areas can hinder the effective functioning of the platform.\nSummary\n\nIn current days of mass production and marketing which is being replaced by customer-based or market-driven strategies, an effective marketing extension service is the need of the hour.\n\nThis has added significance in light of the post-WTO scenario. If the Indian farmers have to withstand the possible onslaught of international competitors, both in domestic as well as overseas markets, agricultural marketing services have to be strengthened.\n\nThe history of agricultural marketing reforms in India reflects the country\u2019s economic and social transformations over the centuries. From ancient barter systems to the establishment of APMCs and the advent of digital platforms, the journey has been marked by evolving policies and practices.\n\nToday, as India navigates challenges and embraces technological advancements, the focus remains on creating a more efficient, transparent, and remunerative agricultural marketing system for the benefit of farmers and the economy.\n\nAlso read: Mechanization of Indian Agriculture; Transport and Marketing of agricultural produce and Issues and related constraints\n\nArticle contributed by: Sree Resmi S"

            "[CONTENT]": "India is an agrarian country with around 70% of its people depending directly or indirectly upon agriculture. But farmers\u2019 suicides in India is worrying.\n\nAs per the Central Government despite a multi-pronged approach to improving income and social security of farmers, over 12,000 suicides were reported in the agricultural sector every year since 2013. Farmer suicides account for approximately 10% of all suicides in India. (Reference: TOI)\n\nThere is no denying that the menace of farmer\u2019s suicides exists and runs counter to the aspirations of reaping benefits of our demographic dividend. In this article, we are analysing the farmers\u2019 suicides in India and its related data, the reasons and the way forward.\n\nTable of Contents\n\nFarmers\u2019 Suicides \u2013 What do the facts say?\nWhat are the reasons behind\u00a0farmers\u2019 suicides in India?\nIs Suicide a matter of economics?\nResponses to farmers\u2019 suicides\nWay Ahead\nFarmers\u2019 Suicides \u2013 What do the facts say?\nThe list includes\u00a0farmers-cultivators and agricultural labourers.\nSeven states account for 87.5% of total suicides in the farming sector in the country. The states are Maharashtra, Karnataka, Telangana,\u00a0Madhya Pradesh,\u00a0Chhattisgarh,\u00a0Andhra Pradesh and Tamil Nadu 606.\nBoth marginal farmers and small farmers are committing suicide.\nMaharashtra is the worst affected state.\nIronically, Punjab, which benefited most from the Green Revolution, also presents a depressing picture of farmer\u2019s suicides in India. Between 1995-2015, 4687 farmers\u2019 suicides have been reported from the state of Punjab of which 1334 from one Mansa district alone.\nWhat are the reasons behind\u00a0farmers\u2019 suicides in India?\n\nScholars have given various reasons such as monsoon failure, climate change, high debt burdens, government policies, mental health, personal issues and family problems among the reasons for farmers\u2019 suicides in India. Let\u2019s analyse.\n\nThe surge in input costs:\u00a0A major cause of the farmers\u2019 suicides in India has been the increasing burden on the farmers due to inflated prices of agricultural inputs.\u00a0The culmination of these factors is seen in the overall increase in the cost of cultivation, for wheat, the cost at present is three times than it was in 2005.\nCost of chemicals and seeds: Be it the fertilisers, crop protection chemicals or even the seeds for cultivation, farming has become expensive for the already indebted farmers.\nCosts of Agricultural equipment:\u00a0 The input costs, moreover, aren\u2019t limited to the basic raw materials. Using agricultural equipment and machinery like tractors, submersible pumps etc adds to the already surging costs. Besides, these secondary inputs have themselves become less affordable for the small and marginal farmers.\nLabour costs: Likewise, hiring labourers and animals is getting costlier too. While this may reflect an improvement in the socio-economic status of the labourers, driven primarily by MGNERGA and hike in minimum basic income, this has not gone too well with boosting the agriculture sector.\nDistressed due to loans:\nNCRB data points out that in 2474 suicides out of the studied 3000 farmer suicides in 2015 the victims had unpaid loans from local banks. This is clear enough an indication for drawing correlations between the two. Whether or not the banks had been harassing them, however, is a long-drawn debate and needs more specific empirical evidence.\nMoreover, a shift away from the usual trend also revealed that of the loans taken by these farmers, only 9.8% were loaned from money-lenders. Thus the pressure or muscle-power of money-lenders could be far from being a major driving force, as is otherwise perceived.\nAnother source of strong linkages between farmer suicides and indebtedness is reflected from the spread of the two. While Maharashtra had 1293 suicides for indebtedness, Karnataka had 946. Note that both these states saw one of the highest incidences of farmer suicides as well as indebtedness.\nLack of direct integration with the market:\u00a0Although initiatives like the National Agricultural Market and contract farming are helping integrate the farmers\u2019 produce directly with the market, cutting the role of intermediaries, the reality is still lagging behind.\nLack of awareness: The digital divide, as well as the literacy gap, has made the marginal and small farmers particularly vulnerable due to their inability to utilise the positives of government policies. This is reflected in the continued unsustainable cropping practices \u2013 like cultivating sugarcane in water-deficit regions.\nWater crisis: The concentration of these suicides in the water-deficit regions of states like Maharashtra, Karnataka is a manifestation of how the water crisis and thereby failure to meet production demands have intensified the menace. This is particularly true in the backdrop of continued failed monsoons.\nInterstate water disputes:\u00a0What has added to the already prevalent crisis is the unwillingness to cater to each other\u2019s water needs amongst the states. A case in point is the recently resurfaced Kaveri dispute that saw Karnataka and Tamil Nadu battle out water shortage both in and outside the tribunal even to the extent of non-compliance with the tribunal award.\nClimate change has acted as the last nail in the coffin by resulting in furthering of the uncertainties associated with the already uncertain monsoon system and hence agricultural production. While incidents like flash floods have led to crop losses, deferred monsoons have seen production shortfall year-in and year-out\nIndia\u2019s urban consumer-driven economic policies: The political economy of India is driven more by urban consumers than rural producers. This is reflected in the urgency to impose price controls in case of price rise (imposing Minimum Export Prices, bringing items under Essential Commodities etc) and a lacklustre withdrawal once the price is under control. Contrast this with how we have been imposing a minimum import price to secure our steel sector. This differential treatment to primary sector also limits profit margin and thereby hinders farmers\u2019 chances of breaking free from the cycle of indebtedness.\nLoan waivers instead of restructuring, re-investment measures: Our approach of handling farmer indebtedness and hence farmer suicides have been appeasement politics like the recent move by the UP government to waive off Rs 36000 crore worth of loans. Surprisingly this comes at a time when the agricultural yield is expected to be better in the wake of a good monsoon.\nIn essence, the factors sum up to crop failure, unsustainable production and subsequent farmer indebtedness leading to failure of strengthening the economic state of the farmer as the driving force behind these suicides.\nIs Suicide a matter of economics?\n\nThe National Mental Health Association of the USA states that \u201cNo matter the race or age of the person; how rich or poor they are, it is true that most people who commit suicide have a mental or emotional disorder\u201d. Suicide is not a matter of economics.\n\n\ud83d\udc49 Which year are YOU targeting for success in the IAS/IPS/IFS Exam? \ud83d\ude80\n\n(1) \u21d2 UPSC 2025: Prelims cum Mains\n\n(2) \u21d2 UPSC 2026: Prelims cum Mains\n\n(3) \u21d2 UPSC 2027 Prelims cum Mains\n\nTip: Know more about ClearIAS Courses (Online/Offline)\n\nThis is well supported by the data released by World Health Organisation in 2011: while the suicide rate in India, an agrarian economy, was 13 per 100,000; that of industrialised, rich countries were often higher or comparable\u2013 South Korea \u2013 28.5, Japan \u2013 20.1, Russia \u2013 18.2, USA- 12.6, Australia- 12.5, and UK-11.8. (Reference \u2013 Hindustan Times)\n\nResponses to farmers\u2019 suicides\n\nSome of the major relief packages and debt waiver schemes announced by the government are summarised below:\n\n2006 relief package \u2013 primarily aimed at 31 districts in the four states of Andhra Pradesh, Maharashtra, Karnataka, and Kerala with a high relative incidence of farmers suicides.\nAgricultural debt waiver and debt relief scheme, 2008 \u2013\u00a0Agricultural Debt Waiver and Debt Relief Scheme in 2008 benefited over 36 million farmers at a cost of 65000 crore rupees (US$10 billion). This spending was aimed at the writing of part of loan principal as well as the interest owed by the farmers.\n2013 diversify income sources package \u2013\u00a0In 2013, the Government of India launched a\u00a0Special Livestock Sector and Fisheries Package\u00a0for farmers suicide-prone regions of Andhra Pradesh, Maharashtra, Karnataka and Kerala. The package was aimed to diversify income sources of farmers.\n\nApart from these Central Government initiatives, there are many efforts from the state governments side like\u00a0Maharashtra Bill to regulate farmer loan terms, 2008 and\u00a0Kerala Farmers\u2019 Debt Relief Commission (Amendment) Bill, 2012.\n\nWay Ahead\n\nPolicies of integrated pest management\u00a0to prevent pest damage \u2013 An all-inclusive approach that integrates biological, chemical, mechanical and physical methodology should be used to prevent crop damage. In this case, seeking inspiration from Vietnam\u2019s no-spray early rule (predatory beetles are sustained for biological pest control, cutting pesticide requirement by 50%) can be a good way to start.\nLower fertilizer costs \u2013 Helping fertiliser industries cut down on costs, through internal funding rather than external borrowing should lower the input costs.\nLeveraging advancements in Science and Technology by ensuring that state seed policies focus on new genotypes, contract farming and sensitization to adverse weather conditions.\nPrecision farming techniques like SRI (Systematic Rice Intensification) must be encouraged.\nFarm equipment policy must focus on imported equipment to provide for cheaper local manufacture, some incentives like grant of duty credit scrips may be tried.\nSubsidies must be rerouted towards capital generation and entrepreneurial Custom Hiring Centers\u00a0(CHCs) and the implementation must be ensured in a timely fashion.\nCorporate Social Responsibility (CSR) must be encouraged in the agricultural sector, particularly towards capacity-building, skill development and the establishment of CHCs.\nInstitutional financing must also be ensured to be adequate and inclusive rather than catering to the elites within the farming community.\nCooperative farming must be promoted amongst small and marginal farmers to ensure that they are not left lurking while the big farmers reap the benefit at their cost.\nDoubling the farmer income by 2022 is a healthy aim, but loan waivers can\u2019t be the answer. Instead, sustainable agriculture that thrives on re-investment & restructuring is the way ahead. The role that the state has been playing is one of emancipation, but what the primary sector and the farmer needs is empowerment.\nDirect interventions:\nEarly-warning signals for unsustainable loans to launch a 2-pronged approach catering to both the burdened farmers as well as stressed banks.\nOptions for restructuring loans must be used wherever possible.\nInsurance claim settlements must be speedy and just.\nDistrict wise list of indebted farmers and efforts in de-stressing them through counselling and other alternative mechanisms should be tried.\nNABARD and local administration must take control of the situation and play a greater role in curbing farmers\u2019 suicides.\nInnovative efforts like Crowdfunding can be employed through the involvement of Civil Society Organizations (CSOs).\nEfforts like Agro-Climatic zoning, education through DD Kisan, Soil Health Card Scheme, various crop insurance and facilitative schemes like PM Krishi Sinchayi Yojana will go a long way in helping out\nCommunity-led awareness must be taken employing a role model approach highlighting progress of farmers who have benefited from sustainable & climate-tailored agricultural practices\n\nAlso read:\u00a0\n\nSuicide Prevention Policy\nNew Schemes for Farmers\n\nArticle by: S S Naik, with inputs from ClearIAS Team"

Read here to learn more.\n\nFood processing is the transformation of raw ingredients into food, or of food into other forms (i.e., food processing may denote direct manufacturing of food or value addition to existing food).\n\nFood processing typically takes harvested crops or butchered animal products and uses these to produce long-shelf-life food products.\n\nFood processing dates back to the prehistoric ages when crude processing incorporated slaughtering, fermenting, sun drying, preserving with salt, etc. Modern food processing adopts the latest technologies and practices.\n\nTable of Contents\n\nProcesses in a food processing industry\nProducts in the food processing industry\nWhy are food processing industries significant?\nScope and Significance of Food Processing Industries in India\nLocation of food industries in India\nMajor segments of food processing\nUpstream and Downstream requirements of food processing industries\nUpstream requirements\nDownstream requirements\nSupply Chain Management\nObstacles in the growth of food processing Industries\nGovernment Initiatives\nMajor Schemes by the Government\nBoards and Institutions\nThe Present Status and Future of Food Processing Industries in India\nRevolutions related to Food Production\nProcesses in a food processing industry\n\nThere are two types of processes in the food processing industry :\n\nManufacturing: Raw materials \u2192 Food.\nValue Addition: Increase shelf life and value of manufactured food.\nProducts in the food processing industry\n\nWe can divide the products in the food processing industry into two:\n\n\ud83d\udc49 Which year are YOU targeting for success in the IAS/IPS/IFS Exam? \ud83d\ude80\n\n(1) \u21d2 UPSC 2025: Prelims cum Mains\n\n(2) \u21d2 UPSC 2026: Prelims cum Mains\n\n(3) \u21d2 UPSC 2027 Prelims cum Mains\n\nTip: Know more about ClearIAS Courses (Online/Offline)\n\nPrimary (e.g.: Fruits and Vegetables).\nSecondary or Value Added (Jams and Squashes)\nWhy are food processing industries significant?\n\u00a0India is a land famous for food production. More than 50% of the Indian population work in Agriculture-related activities. If there are good food processing industries in India, raw materials like grains or meat can be converted into food for domestic and foreign consumption.\nFood processing units act as a link between agriculture and industries.\nFood processing industries can absorb a major share of workers from the agriculture sector, who face disguised unemployment. It can lead to better productivity and GDP growth.\nFood processing prevents food wastage and helps in attaining food security.\nProcessed food requires less space for storage.\nProcessed food can be exported. This may help us in getting foreign exchange reserves.\nScope and Significance of Food Processing Industries in India\n\nWhat is the scope of India in the food processing industry? (Have you ever wondered why UPSC specifically mentioned food processing as a topic in Mains syllabus? \u2013 Because it is a sector that has huge potential for growth in the future!)\n\nThe Indian food industry is heading for huge growth, increasing its contribution to the world food trade every year due to its immense potential for value addition, particularly within the food processing industry.\n\nIndian food and grocery market is the world\u2019s sixth-largest, with retail contributing 70% of the sales.\n\nThe Indian food processing industry accounts for 32% of the country\u2019s total food market. It is one of the largest industries in India and is ranked fifth in terms of production, consumption, export, and expected growth.\n\nMajor points:\n\nIndia\u2019s position as a major food producer: India ranks 1st in the production of \u2013 milk, ginger, banana, guava, papaya, mango, etc. It ranks 2nd in the production of rice, wheat, potato, sugarcane, cashew nut, tea, etc. It is among the top 5 countries in the production of coffee, tobacco, spices, seeds, etc. With such a huge raw material base, we can easily become the leading supplier of food items in the world.\nResource advantage of India: Different soil types and different climate types for the cultivation of diverse food crops, long coastal lines suitable for fishing, a huge resource of domestic animals, etc.\nIncreasing employment: Expected to create more than 10 lakh new jobs.\nCurbing Migration: Employs in rural areas, hence reducing migration from rural to urban. Resolves issues of urbanization.\nCurbing food inflation: Removes issues of wastage or middle man. Curbs food inflation. Indirect relief on non-food inflation too.\nCrop Diversification: Because of the long shelf life, farmers can diversify their products.\nThe demand potential: Expected to reach 250b$ turnout by 2015 and 350b$ by 2020. Youth population, middle class, rising income, nuclear families, media penetration, etc. cited as positive factors.\nGovernment initiatives to boost food processing: Various government initiatives like attracting FDI, reduction in excise duties, etc. have boosted food processing.\nThe future driver of Indian growth: Food processing corresponds to around 10% of GDP in the agriculture-manufacturing sector. It has the potential for more.\n\nAlso read: Blue food\n\nLocation of food industries in India\n\nIndia has more than 35000 registered units. But majorities of the food processing factories are concentrated in the coastal states ( one reason being, accessibility to marine food processing)\n\nMajor coastal states include Andhra, Maharashtra, Karnataka, Kerala, Gujarat, Punjab and WB. Non-coastal states include UP, Punjab, etc.\n\nMajor segments of food processing\nFruits and Vegetables.\nMilk and Milk Products.\nMeat and Poultry.\nMarine Products.\nGrain Processing.\nConsumer Food.\nUpstream and Downstream requirements of food processing industries\n\nUpstream stage: The upstream stage of the production process involves searching for and extracting raw materials. The upstream part of the production process does not do anything with the material itself, such as processing the material. This part of the process simply finds and extracts the raw material. Thus, any industry that relies on the extraction of raw materials commonly has an upstream stage in its production process.\n\nDownstream stage:\u00a0The downstream stage in the production process involves processing the materials collected during the upstream stage into a finished product. The downstream stage further includes the actual sale of that product to other businesses, governments, or private individuals. The downstream process has direct contact with customers through the finished product.\n\nUpstream requirements\nAccessibility to raw materials.\nModern extraction techniques.\nGood linkages with farmers.\nStorage facilities for raw materials like Grains, Meat, Fish, etc.\nQuality testing facilities.\nTransport facilities.\nWorkforce.\nDownstream requirements\nLatest processing techniques.\nLatest processing machinery.\nQuality testing facilities.\nOrganized retail stores for faster distribution.\nWorkforce.\nSupply Chain Management\n\nSupply chain management (SCM) is the management of the flow of goods. It includes the movement and storage of raw materials, inventory, and finished goods from the point of origin to the point of consumption.\n\nLet\u2019s analyze the case of Supply Chain Management for the Food Processing Industry. Raw materials like grains, raw meat, fish, etc. are collected from different sources. These sources may do preliminary processing of these to make components of a food product before passing over them to the main manufacturer through many middlemen. The manufacturer does the final processing of these components to make the food product. This completes only the first stage of supply management.\n\nNow the finished product has to be delivered to the consumer. Here also there will be several middlemen and stages. The manufacturer normally hands over the food product to a wholesale dealer. The wholesaler passes the product to a retailer from where the consumer buys the processed food item for his personal use.\n\nThus, Supply Chain Management is the management of the upstream and downstream value-added flow of materials from suppliers\u2192 company\u2192 retailer\u2192 final consumers.\n\nIf there are good Supply Chain Management practices in a country, then it will boost the economy as a whole. Good supply chain links help farmers, manufacturers, wholesalers, retailers and consumers. Everyone in the supply chain link will get inputs at a faster rate, at the right time, and at a cheaper cost.\n\nObstacles in the growth of food processing Industries\nSmall-size companies: Indian food processing companies are small and can\u2019t compete with global giants that invest heavily in R&D.\nLack of good laboratories in India: Food export to the US and EU demands high-quality standards. India lacks good laboratories to check heavy metals and other toxic contaminants in food.\nLack of skilled workforce. We have only a few graduates in Food Technology.\nLack of the right vision and support from the government at the right time.\nLack of good transportation facilities. Roads are overburdened.\nLack of storage facilities and good production techniques.\nLack of organized retail.\nLimitations in supply chains.\nLimitations in the quality.\nLack of modern regulations.\nGovernment Initiatives\n\nThe government of India is now encouraging food processing industries by providing :\n\n100% FDI in this sector.\nAgri Export Zones.\nNational Mission on Agriculture.\nMajor Schemes by the Government\nVision 2015 for food processing: The Ministry of Food Processing Industries (MoFPI) has sponsored a study to suggest a roadmap for the growth of the food processing sector. M/S Rabo Bank has conducted a study and submitted a Vision Document suggesting a strategy & action plan for the food processing sector in India namely Vision 2015. Vision Document suggested a strategy to ensure faster growth of the sector. The adopted Vision 2015 provides for enhancing the level of processing of perishables from 6% to 20%, enhancing value addition from 20% to 35%, and increasing India\u2019s share in the global food trade from 1.5% to 3% by the year 2015. To achieve these targets, an investment of Rs.100 thousand crores was estimated by the year 2015, out of which Rs.10,000 crores was to come from the Government. Accordingly, the Ministry of FPI formulated its 11th Plan schemes to attract the required investment in the sector.\nNational Mission on Food Processing: The MOFPI launched a new Centrally Sponsored Scheme(CSS) \u2013 National Mission- on Food Processing (NMFP) on 1st April 2012 for implementation through States/UTs. The NMFP envisages the establishment of a National Mission as well as corresponding Missions at the State and District level. The basic objective of NMFP is the decentralization of implementation of food processing-related schemes to ensure substantial participation of State Governments/UTs. The mission is expected to improve the Ministry\u2019s outreach significantly in terms of planning, supervision, and monitoring of various schemes apart from playing a more meaningful role in policy formation.\nMega food parks: The Scheme of Mega Food Park aims to provide a mechanism to link agricultural production to the market by bringing together farmers, processors, and retailers to ensure maximizing value addition, minimizing wastage, increasing farmers\u2019 income, and creating employment opportunities, particularly in the rural sector. The Mega Food Park Scheme is based on the \u201cCluster\u201d approach and envisages a well-defined Agri/ horticultural-processing zone containing state-of-the-art processing facilities with support infrastructure and a well-established supply chain.\nModernization of abattoirs: The scheme aims at providing facilities for scientific and less painful slaughtering, chilling, effluent treatment plants, by-product utilization, water, and power with required sanitary/phytosanitary conditions for the modernization of abattoirs. Modernization of abattoirs will also augment the essential supply base of hygienic raw materials to the meat processing industry, both for domestic consumption and exports, besides discouraging unauthorized slaughtering. The scheme of Setting up/ Modernization of Abattoirs provides for the induction of private capital, better technology, and backward and forward linkages. The scheme also provides for the implementation of projects preferably under PPP mode with the involvement of local bodies and has the flexibility for the involvement of private investors/exporters on a BOO/BOT/JV basis.\nCold Chain Infrastructure: The Scheme for Integrated Cold Chain, Value Addition, and Preservation Infrastructure aims to encourage the setting up of cold chain facilities to provide integrated cold chain and preservation infrastructure facilities without breaking from the farm gate to the consumer.\nR&D, QA, Codex, and Promotion: The scheme for Quality Assurance, Codex, R&D, and Other Promotional Activities is being implemented to create an infrastructure of food testing laboratories in the country to establish a quality monitoring system for food processing, implement HACCP/ISO22000, ISO14000/GHP/GMP, and other quality management systems and to promote research and development for innovative products and process etc.\nBoards and Institutions\n\nNIFTEM \u2013 National Institute of Food Technology and Entrepreneurial Management.\nIGPB \u2013 Indian Grape Processing Board.\nIICPT \u2013 Indian Insitute of Crop Processing Technology.\nNMPPB \u2013 National Meat and Poultry Processing Board.\n\nThe Present Status and Future of Food Processing Industries in India\n\u00a0The estimated worth of the Indian Food Processing Industry is 121 b dollars.\nIndia has already witnessed the green and white revolution ie Agriculture and Milk.\nNow the focus is on the Pink Revolution: Meat and poultry sector.\nThe packaged food sector in India is likely to double in 2015 to touch 30 b dollars.\nIndia is currently the world\u2019s second-largest producer of food (next only to China). We have the potential to become the No.1 player in this sector.\n\nImportant Websites [for further reference]\n\nMinistry of Food Processing\nFood Processing Articles in Mrunal.org\nRevolutions related to Food Production\nPink Revolution \u2013\u00a0Meat and Poultry Production.\nRed Revolution \u2013\u00a0Meat & Tomato Production.\nRound Revolution \u2013\u00a0Potato Revolution.\nSilver Fiber Revolution \u2013\u00a0Cotton Revolution.\nSilver Revolution \u2013\u00a0Egg/Poultry Production.\nWhite Revolution \u2013\u00a0Milk/Dairy production (Operation Flood).\nYellow Revolution \u2013\u00a0Oil Seeds production.\nEvergreen Revolution \u2013\u00a0Overall development of Agriculture.\nBlue Revolution \u2013\u00a0Fish Production.\nBrown Revolution \u2013\u00a0Leather /Cocoa production.\nGolden Fibre Revolution \u2013\u00a0Jute Production.\nGolden Revolution \u2013\u00a0Overall Horticulture development/Honey Production.\nGreen Revolution \u2013 Agriculture in general.\n\nAlso read: Global Value Chains (GVCs); Operation Green; Cocoa cultivation in India; Spices Sector in India"

However, the colonial rule by the British saw a dramatic shift in the land ownership pattern of India.\n\nLand of many tribal/forest communities was seized by British cultivators and Zamindars, and land tax was widely collected through systems like Zamindari, Ryotwari, or Mahalwari.\n\nA rich-minority-landowning class and a poor-landless-peasant class became symbols of Indian agrarian society. As the ownership of the land for some reason or other stayed with the rich Zamindar class, they became more powerful year after year, accumulating wealth.\n\nThe peasants, who actually cultivated the land, were often in poverty and remained landless. When India adopted socialistic principles after independence, equality in all spheres \u2013 social, economic, and political was envisioned.\n\nLand reforms are essential steps towards social and economic equality as land is a fundamental asset needed for the healthy development of an individual. As per the Indian constitution, land reform comes under the list of state subjects, and hence the responsibility for bringing up regulations for effecting land reforms lies with individual states.\n\nStates which implemented land reforms in India\n\nZamindari Abolition Act was passed by UP, Tamil Nadu, Bihar, Madhya Pradesh, etc. Surplus lands were confiscated from zamindars. As in the Golaknath case, the Supreme Court ruled that the provisions of the Zamindari Abolition Act contradicted Article 31 of the Indian Constitution, the parliament took steps to repeal Article 31. Later Land Ceilings Act was passed by different states.\n\nSuccessful legislation for redistribution of land with ceilings on private land property happened only in a few states. The most notable and successful land reforms happened in the states of Kerala and West Bengal (Operation Barga).\n\nOnly pockets of India like Jammu and Kashmir witnessed commendable steps in land reform but attempts in states like Andra Pradesh, Madya Pradesh, and Bihar led to clashes within the communities.\n\nThough the Central Land Reforms Committee has laid guidelines for land ceilings, there was a purposeful delay in the implementation of land reform policy in many states, giving a gap for transactions to escape the tooth of land reform laws.\n\nThe other sides of land reforms\n\nLand reforms have an angle other than cultivation purposes. The redistribution of land becomes a necessity often for development and manufacturing purposes too. This necessitates a proper land policy, which gives due importance to nature, development, and inclusion.\n\nDeeper structural reforms will ensure that the exercise of land redistribution actually becomes meaningful, enabling small farmers to turn their plots into productive assets. When every citizen of the country enjoys the benefits of ownership of land, it can lead to social and economic upliftment.\n\nThere are arguments in favor of and against land reforms.\n\nArguments in Favor of Land Reforms\nEquity \u2013 now the majority of land in India is enjoyed by a minority of landlords.\nThe inverse relationship between land size and efficiency \u2013 the smaller the land, the better will be the productivity and efficiency.\nOwner cultivation is more efficient than share-cropping.\nArguments Against Land Reforms\nIf centrally managed large agricultural land is divided among individual private owners, the peasants who take it up may not be efficient enough to individually carry out the cultivation.\nResults in Fragmentation of land and pockets of inefficiency. For large-scale cultivation, the fragmentation of land normally won\u2019t help (this has another side too \u2013 see the inverse relationship).\nEvidence suggests that land reforms had a negative effect on poverty.\nLand reforms have led to economic decline and food insecurity in countries like Zimbabwe.\n\nAlso read: RERA Act 2016\n\nReference:\nLand Reform in India by Kaushik Basu\nLand Reforms \u2013 Planning Commission\nLand Reforms \u2013 Issue and Challenges \u2013 Food First\nLand Policy in India \u2013 FAO\nLand Reforms in India \u2013 Hub Pages"

The source of this article is PIB, from where we are planning to write about many more topics important for the UPSC Civil Services Exam.\n\nThe National Land Records Modernization Programme (NLRMP), now known as the Digital India Land Records Modernization Programme (DILRMP), is a pivotal initiative undertaken by the Government of India aimed at overhauling and modernizing the land record system across the country.\n\nInitiated in 2008, the programme seeks to address longstanding issues associated with land records, including inaccuracies, discrepancies, and inefficiencies that have historically plagued land administration in India.\n\nTable of Contents\n\nObjectives of NLRMP\nMajor Components of the Programme\nActivities under the NLRMP Project\nBenefits of the NLRMP Project\nOther initiatives undertaken by the Department\nChallenges and Progress\nObjectives of NLRMP\n\nThe main objective of the NLRMP is to develop a modern, comprehensive, and transparent land records management system in the country to implement the conclusive land-titling system with title guarantee, which will be based on four basic principles, i.e.,\n\nTo provide a single window to access land records including the registration process in a manner that is both transparent and accountable.\nTo modernize and update management practices of land records, making them more efficient and accessible.\nTo develop a comprehensive and secure system for the storage, retrieval, and update of land records.\nTo minimize scope and disputes related to land by providing clear titles and thereby facilitating conclusive titles to immovable properties.\nTo enhance transparency in the land records maintenance system, which would significantly reduce the potential for fraud.\nMajor Components of the Programme\n\nThe NLRMP encompasses several key components to achieve its objectives:\n\nComputerization of Land Records: This involves digitizing all land records, including mutations, title deeds, and other relevant documents, making them easily accessible online.\nSurvey/Resurvey and Updating of all Survey and Settlement Records: Using modern technologies like aerial photography, satellite imagery, drone surveys, and Geographic Information Systems (GIS) for accurate land mapping.\nComputerization of Registration: Integration of the registration process with the land records maintenance system, ensuring that any changes in land ownership are automatically updated in the land records.\nDevelopment of Core Geospatial Information System (GIS): Mapping the entire cadastral data onto a GIS platform to enable easy cross-referencing and spatial data analysis.\nCapacity Building: Training and development programs for the officials and staff involved in land records management to ensure smooth implementation and sustainability of the modernized system.\nActivities under the NLRMP Project\n\nThe National Land Records Modernization Programme (NLRMP) is implemented in a phased manner across various states and union territories of India. The central government provides financial assistance to the states and UTs for implementing the programme, with the technical support and guidelines issued by the Department of Land Resources, Ministry of Rural Development.\n\n\ud83d\udc49 Which year are YOU targeting for success in the IAS/IPS/IFS Exam? \ud83d\ude80\n\n(1) \u21d2 UPSC 2025: Prelims cum Mains\n\n(2) \u21d2 UPSC 2026: Prelims cum Mains\n\n(3) \u21d2 UPSC 2027 Prelims cum Mains\n\nTip: Know more about ClearIAS Courses (Online/Offline)\n\nScanning, digitization, and updation of cadastral maps\nGeo-linking of RoR data with updated digitized maps\nScanning of old Revenue documents for virtual record room\nSurvey/Resurvey using ETS\nDGPS Survey\nSatellite data processing\nBenefits of the NLRMP Project\nA modern, comprehensive, and transparent land records management system in each state.\na single window system to handle land records, including maintenance and updating of textual records, maps, survey and settlement operation, and registration of immovable property.\nup-dated land records and push them into the public domain so that people can access the records with ease.\nintegration of the diverse processes in land administration and provide an integrated land records information system.\nland value assessment.\npreparation of field-level soil health cards.\nsmart cards for farmers to facilitate e-governance and e-banking.\nsettlement of compensation claims\nland acquisition and rehabilitation\ncrop insurance\ngrant of agricultural subsidies\ncommunity/ village resource centers\nprecision farming etc.\n\nAlso read: Land digitization in India\n\nOther initiatives undertaken by the Department\n\nI) National Generic Document Registration System (NGDRS)\n\nTo provide, one Nation one software for the registration of documents & properties to \u2019empower citizens\u2019, Department developed and field-tested a National Generic Document Registration System (NGDRS) through NIC/NICSI under the broad aegis of Digital India Land Records Modernisation Programme (DILRMP) a central sector scheme to include requirements of all the States and the same has been launched/under implementation in 10 states/Union Territories namely Andaman & Nicobar Islands, Dadra and Nagar Haveli, Goa, Himachal Pradesh, Jammu & Kashmir, Jharkhand, Maharashtra, Manipur, Mizoram, and Punjab, benefiting 10.47 crore population.\n\nThe benefits are:\n\nThe reduction of land disputes, and check on fraudulent transactions;\nReduced process, and time of document registration at Sub Registrar level as per reports from two state governments;\nprocesses and time taken in document registration have reduced from 9 to 6 processes and from 3-4 hours to 15-20 minutes respectively;\npresentation for document registration anywhere within concurrent jurisdiction is possible;\nSMS and email-enabled alerts related to transactions on a property, a dashboard for senior authorities for monitoring the outcomes and analyzing the performance or challenges faced by SROs;\ndata shared and used by important government authorities/stakeholders like the Revenue Department (Income Tax) with a data policy and standards in place; and\nexternal system integrations can be provided as required (i.e. eSign, eKYC, Payment Gateways, PAN Verification, ROR to fetch party names for data standardization)\n\nNGDRS software is expected to improve the ranking of the country in ease of doing business in a world-level forum and provide ease of living to the people.\n\nII) Unique Land Parcel Identification Number (PIN):\n\nThe Unique Land Parcel Identification Number (ULPIN) System will have 14 digits \u2013 An alpha-numeric unique ID for each land parcel. The Unique IDs based on Geo reference coordinate of vertices of the parcel would be of international standard and compliance with the Electronic Commerce Code Management Association (ECCMA) standard and Open Geospatial Consortium (OGC) standards and it will provide compatibility so that all states can adopt it easily. Proper land statistics and land accounting through ULPIN will help develop a land bank and lead toward an Integrated Land Information Management System (ILIMS).\n\nBenefits are to ensure uniqueness in all transactions and keep the land records always up-to-date; a link of all property transactions established; delivery of citizen services of land records through the single window; sharing of land records data across departments, financial institutions, and all stakeholders; and standardization at data and application-level would bring in effective integration and interoperability across departments.\nThe pilot test has been successfully carried out in 11 States namely Bihar, Haryana, Jharkhand, Odisha, Gujarat, Maharashtra, Karnataka, Madhya Pradesh, Sikkim, Andhra Pradesh and Goa.\nChallenges and Progress\n\nThe implementation of NLRMP faces several challenges, including technological barriers, resistance to change among the staff managing land records, and the need for massive public awareness campaigns to educate landowners about the benefits of the program. Despite these challenges, significant progress has been made in many states, with digital land records and services being made available online to the public.\n\nThe successful implementation of the NLRMP/DILRMP can significantly transform land governance in India, making the system more transparent, efficient, and user-friendly. This transformation not only aids in reducing disputes over land ownership but also facilitates the ease of doing business by making property verification processes quicker and more reliable.\n\nRead: Land Digitization in India"

CACP submits two separate reports for Kharif and rabi seasons and based on these, centre fixes MSPs twice a year.\n\nCACP considers the following three costs while recommending MSP-\n\nA2 which covers all the cash and kind expenses of the farmers.\nA2+FL which takes into account the estimated value of the unpaid labour of family members.\nC2 which includes A2+FL along with the interests foregone.\nCrops getting Minimum Support Price\n\nAs of now, 23 crops are being supported by the centre by fixing of MSP. They belong to the family of cereals (7), pulses (5), oilseeds (7) and commercial crops (4).\n\nThe crops are:\n\nPaddy\nJowar\nBajra\nMaize\nRagi\nTur (Arhar)\nMoong\nUrad\nCotton\nGroundnut\nSunflower seed\nSoya bean\nSesamum\nNiger seed\nWheat\nBarley\nGram\nMasur (Lentil)\nRapeseed and Mustard\nSafflower\nToria\nJute\nCoconut \u2013 Copra and De-Husked Coconut\n\nNote:\u00a0Subscribe ClearIAS YouTube Channel\u00a0to learn from more free videos.\n\nWhy MSP is needed?\nTo safeguard farmers from the market price fluctuations.\nThe prices of farm commodities are dependent on various factors such as good harvest season which leads to fall in prices.\nIn such cases, farmers might not prefer to sow the aforesaid crop next season. MSPs would encourage farmers to sow these crops and thereby maintain a healthy supply.\nFacts you should know about the Minimum Support Price\nAlthough the government announces MSP for 23 crops, only 2-3 crops are effectively procured.\nThe production of rice and wheat greatly increased at the expense of other crops like pulses.\nThe significant increase in buffer stocks adds up to huge storage and transportation costs.\nDoing away with MSP without taking the farmers into confidence is not the right step.\nAlso, other steps like improving the irrigation facilities, implementing land reforms and access to technology are necessary to make farming more remunerative to farmers.\nImplementing various suggestions given by Swaminathan commission would be a right step instead of considering MSP as the panacea.\nMarket Intervention Scheme\n\nIt is a price support mechanism for those horticultural commodities which are not supported by MSP.\n\nThe commodities covered are mostly perishable in nature. The scheme is similar to MSP but is temporary in nature.\n\nIt is implemented for a limited period on the request of the concerned state government.\n\nThe objective of this scheme is to protect the growers of horticultural crops from distress sales in the event of a fall in prices.\n\nRecommendations of the Swaminathan Commission\n\nMS Swaminathan commission was constituted by the centre in 2004 for recommending various measures to alleviate farmer\u2019s distress. NCF submitted five reports in total and recommending various measures like-\n\nInsertion of Agriculture in the concurrent list of the constitution.\nAddressing the issue of land reforms and inequalities in landholdings.\nIncreasing the investments in agriculture-related infrastructure.\nEstablishment of soil testing laboratories for detection of micronutrient deficiency.\nEnsuring the availability of formal credit to the farmers.\nSetting up of Village Knowledge Centres or Gyan Chaupals.\nEnsuring the availability of farm inputs at affordable rates.\nRestructuring the microfinance policies.\nFocused Market Intervention Scheme for live-saving crops.\nInclusion of millets and other nutritious cereals in PDS.\nInvesting in post-harvest management to reduce the losses and facilitation of direct farmer- consumer linkage.\nMSP support to be provided to crops other than for paddy and wheat.\nSteps to be taken for forming a single Indian market which promotes grading, branding and packaging.\nPreserving the right of access to non-timber forest produce.\nFarm Bills and MSP\n\nThe centre has recently passed two farm bills namely,\n\nThe Farmers\u2019 Produce Trade and Commerce (Promotion and Facilitation) Bill, 2020\nThe Farmers (Empowerment and Protection) Agreement on Price Assurance and Farm Services Bill, 2020\n\nOther than these two bills, another bill, The Essential Commodities (Amendment) Act,2020 has also been a bone of contention between the farmers and the centre.\n\nKey Features of the Farm Bill\n\nThe first bill i.e., the Farmers\u2019 produce trade and commerce bill gives more choice to the farmers regarding their produce. It allows the farmers to sell their farm produce outside the government regulated mandis or the Agricultural Produce Marketing Committee (APMC). APMC as an institution became obsolete and is fixing low prices for the produce. This is leading the farmers to resort to distress sales in the event of bumper production. Hence, this scheme allows farmers to choose the best price for their products and sell accordingly.\n\nThe second bill i.e., the Farmers\u2019 agreement on price assurance and farm services bill has provisions regarding the contract farming. It gives the farmers an opportunity to strike a deal with corporates even before the production. This shifts the risk from farmers onto the businessmen and also the farmers will be assured of a fixed price.\n\nBenefits of the Farm Bills\nHigher prices for farmers for their produce since restrictions to sell in the physical premises of mandis has been done away with.\nThey provide for a 3level dispute settlement mechanism- conciliation board, sub-divisional magistrate and appellate authority.\nA guaranteed price for the product to be mentioned in the agreement between farmers and businessmen.\nDirect selling of the products through electronic trading is also permitted.\nThe State governments are prohibited from levying market fees for trading outside the trade area.\nStrict rules and fines for violation of agreements are mentioned in the bills.\nDrawbacks of the Farm Bills\nNo clarity or mention regarding the MSP in the proposed laws.\nNo involvement of Judiciary in the dispute settlement mechanism.\nFarmers\u2019 concern that their interests would be ignored in case of disputes with large corporate houses.\nUnder contract farming, there is a fear of becoming slaves to corporate buyers on one\u2019s own land.\nPrevious Year UPSC Questions from the topic Minimum Support Price (MSP)\n\nQn 1) Consider the following:\u00a0(UPSC CSE Prelims 2018)\n\nAreca nut\nBarley\nCoffee\nFinger millet\nGroundnut\nSesamum\nTurmeric\n\nThe Cabinet Committee on Economic Affair, has announced the Minimum Support Price for which of the above?\n\n1, 2, 3 and 7 only\n2, 4, 5 and 6 only\n1, 3, 4, 5 and 6 only\n1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6 and 7\n\nCorrect Answer: (B) 2, 4, 5 and 6 only\n\nQuestion 2) What do you mean by minimum support price?

Over the years, the term PDS\u00a0 has become synonymous with the term \u2018food security\u2019 and is also an important part of the Government\u2019s policy for the management of the food economy in the country.\n\nInfo bit: PDS comes under the Ministry of Consumer Affairs, Food, and Public Distribution.\n\nTill 1992, PDS was a general entitlement scheme for all consumers without any specific target. But in 1992, PDS became RPDS (Revamped PDS) focusing the poor families, especially in the far-flung, hilly, remote, and inaccessible areas. In 1997 RPDS became TPDS (Targeted PDS) which established\u00a0 Fair Price Shops for the distribution of food grains at subsidized rates.\n\nThe objectives of the PDS are:\n\nTo provide essential food items at affordable prices to vulnerable sections of the population.\nTo stabilize prices of essential commodities in the market.\nTo prevent hoarding and black marketing of food grains.\nTo reduce hunger and malnutrition among economically disadvantaged communities.\n\nAlso read: Breakfast scheme: Feeding the future\n\nSignificance of TPDS\n\nIn the People\u2019s Union for Civil Liberties v. Union of India case, the Supreme Court contended that the \u201cright to food\u201d is essential to the right to life as provided in Article 21 of the Constitution.\n\nIn line with this Parliament passed the National Food Security Act (NFSA) in 2013. The NFSA seeks to make the right to food a legal entitlement by providing subsidized food grains to almost two-thirds of the population.\n\nIt relies on the existing Targeted Public Distribution System (TPDS) mechanism to deliver these entitlements\n\nWhy is PDS important?\nFood grains to the poor, at prices lower than the price of food grains at private shops.\nFood grains are directly purchased from farmers, assuring\u00a0farmers with a\u00a0greater price.\nThe PDS provides essential commodities such as rice, wheat, sugar, and kerosene oil. The specific commodities and their quantities may vary from state to state.\nThe PDS primarily targets below-poverty-line (BPL) families, although the identification of beneficiaries has evolved.\nSome states have expanded the PDS to include Antyodaya Anna Yojana (AAY) beneficiaries, who are considered the poorest of the poor.\nAdditionally, the National Food Security Act (NFSA) of 2013 extended PDS coverage to a broader category of beneficiaries, including priority households and eligible households.\n\nAlso read: 100+ Government Schemes and the Implementing Ministries\n\nHow does the Public Distribution System (PDS) function?\n\nThe steps involved are (1) Procurement of food grains (2) Storage of food grains (3) Allocation for families (4) Transportation of food grains.\n\nProcurement of foodgrains\nThe center is responsible for procuring food grains from farmers at a Minimum Support Price (MSP).\nThe MSP is the price at which the FCI purchases the crop directly from farmers; generally, the MSP is higher than the market price.\nThis is intended to provide price support to farmers and incentivize production.\nCommission for Agricultural Costs and Prices (CACP) sets the MSP\nProcurement: Two types of procurement, Centralised Procurement, and decentralized procurement.\nCentralized procurement is carried out by the FCI (Food Corporation of India) where FCI buys crops directly from farmers.\nDecentralized procurement is a central scheme under which 10 states/Union Territories procure food grains for the central pool at MSP on behalf of FCI.\n\u00a0Why decentralized procurement?\u00a0The purpose is to encourage local procurement of food grains and minimize expenditure incurred when transporting grains from surplus to deficit states over long distances.\n\nProcurement issues:\n\nOpen-ended Procurement: All incoming grains are accepted even if buffer stock is filled creating a shortage in the open market. The recent implementation of the Nation Food Security Act would only increase the quantum of procurement resulting in higher prices for grains.\nThe gap between required and existing storage capacity.\nStorage of food grains\n\nAccording to the storage guidelines of the FCI, food grains are normally stored in covered godowns and silos. In case FCI has insufficient storage space, it hires space from various agencies such as central and state warehousing corporations (CWC, SWC), state government agencies, and private parties.\n\nStorage issues:\n\nInadequate storage capacity with FCI.\nFood grains rotting or damaging on the CAP or Cover & Plinth storage.\nAllocation of foodgrains\nThe central government allocates food grains from the central pool to the state governments at uniform Central Issue Price\u00a0(CIP) for distribution through PDS.\nIdentification of poor people- The onus is on the state Government to identify the eligible households in each state. Apart from the allocation of food grains within the State, the issue of Ration Cards and supervision of the functioning of Fair Price Shops (FPSs), etc. rest with the State Governments.\nAllocation for BPL and AAY(Antyodaya Anna Yojana \u2013poorest among the BPL families) families is done based on the number of identified households.\n\nHowever, allocation for APL families is made based on\n\nThe availability of food grain stocks in the central pool\nThe past lifting of food grains by a state from the central pool.\n\nIssues with the allocation of food grains:\n\nInaccurate identification of beneficiaries.\nIllicit Fair Price shops: The shop owners have created a large number of bogus cards or ghost cards(cards for nonexistent people) to sell food grains in the open market.\nTransportation of food grains to FPSs\n\nThe responsibility of distributing food grains is shared between the centre and states. The centre, specifically FCI, is responsible for the interstate transport of food grains from procuring to consuming states, as well as delivering grains to the state godowns. Once FCI transports grains to the state depots, distribution of food grains to end consumers is the responsibility of state governments\n\nIssues with Transportation:\n\nLeakage and diversion of food grains during transportation.\n\nAlso read: Census\n\nPublic Distribution System (PDS) reforms\n\nThe need of the hour is PDS reforms to ensure that public distribution functions the way it is intended.\n\nEnd-to-end computerization would bring transparency to the whole process. It would help to prevent leakages and diversion of food grains to a great extent.\n\nThe different types of reforms undertaken by different states are:\n\nAdhaar Linked and digitized ration cards: This allows online entry and verification of beneficiary data. It also enables online tracking of monthly entitlements and off-take of food grains by beneficiaries.\nComputerized Fair Price Shops: FPS automated by installing \u2018Point of Sale\u2019 to swap the ration card. It authenticates the beneficiaries and records the quantity of subsidized grains given to a family.\nDBT: Under the Direct Benefit Transfer scheme, cash is transferred to the beneficiaries\u2019 account instead of the foodgrains subsidy component. They will be free to buy food grains from anywhere in the market. For taking up this model, prerequisites for the States/UTs would be to complete the digitization of beneficiary data and seed the Aadhaar and bank account details of beneficiaries. It is estimated that cash transfers alone could save the exchequer Rs.30,000 crore every year.\nUse of GPS technology: Use of Global Positioning System (GPS) technology to track the movement of trucks carrying foodgrains from state depots to FPS which can help to prevent diversion.\nSMS-based monitoring: Allows monitoring by citizens so they can register their mobile numbers and send/receive SMS alerts during dispatch and arrival of TPDS commodities\nUse of web-based citizens portal: Public Grievance Redressal Machineries, such as a toll-free number for call centres to register complaints or suggestions.\n\nThe PDS has undergone various reforms, including computerization of records, Aadhar-based authentication, and the use of technology to track beneficiaries and prevent leakage.\n\nThe \u201cOne Nation, One Ration Card\u201d initiative aims to enable beneficiaries to access their PDS entitlements from any FPS in the country, regardless of their home state.\n\nAlso read: Core of the Core Schemes, Core Schemes, and Major Central Sector Schemes in Union Budget 2018\n\nSummary\n\nThe government has achieved significant milestones in the PDS reforms. As part of the implementation of NFSA, almost all states have undertaken PDS reforms.\n\nThe PDS has faced challenges related to the identification of beneficiaries, leakage, corruption, and inefficiencies in the distribution system.\n\nInadequate storage and logistics infrastructure can lead to food grain wastage.\nMarket prices of food commodities can fluctuate, impacting the effectiveness of price stabilization efforts.\n\nThe PDS is a critical social welfare program in India, but it continues to face challenges related to implementation and coverage. Ongoing efforts to modernize and improve the system are aimed at making it more efficient, transparent, and accountable while ensuring that food reaches those in need.\n\nAlso read: Yojana and Kurukshetra \u2013 Should You Read These Magazines for UPSC CSE Preparation?\n\nArticle contributed by: Sree Resmi S"

The current base year for the IIP series in India is 2011-12. So, if the current IIP reads 180, it means that there has been 80% industrial growth compared to the base year, ie 2011-12.\nWho releases IIP?\n\nSubscribe to the ClearIAS YouTube Channel for more informative videos on UPSC preparation, tips, and strategies.

Department of Industrial Policy & Promotion (DIPP); Indian Bureau of Mines; Central Electricity Authority; Joint Plant Committee; Ministry of Petroleum & Natural Gas; Office of Textile Commissioner; Department of Chemicals & Petrochemicals; Directorate of Sugar; Department of Fertilizers; Directorate of Vanaspati, Vegetable Oils & Fats; Tea Board; Office of Jute Commissioner; Office of Coal Controller; Railway Board; Office of Salt Commissioner and Coffee Board.\n\nIIP 2004-05 covers 682 items!\n\nWe have already seen that IIP measures industrial growth. It measures the short-term changes in the volume of production of a basket of industrial products. The current IIP basket covers 682 representative items.\n\nMining (61 items) \u2013\u00a014.16% weight\nManufacturing (620 items) \u2013\u00a075.53% weight\nElectricity (1 item) \u2013 10.32% weight.\n\nNote: Even though the United Nations Statistics Division suggests to also include Gas steam, Air conditioning supply, Water supply, sewage, Waste Management and Remediation activities in the IIP, due to data constraints Indian IIP only covers three sectors \u2013 mining, manufacturing and electricity. These three are called broad sectors.\n\nIIP also gives us an idea about use-based sectors \u2013 another classification. User-based sectors include Basic Goods, Capital Goods and Intermediate Goods.\n\nThe weighted arithmetic mean of quantity relatives with weights being allotted to various items in proportion to value added by manufacture in the base year by using Laspeyres\u2019 formula.\n\nCore Industries and IIP 2004\n\nCoal, Crude Oil, Natural Gas, Refinery Products, Steel, Cement and Electricity are known as Core Industries. The eight Core Industries comprise nearly 37.9 % of the weight of items included in the Index of Industrial Production (IIP). The 8 core industries and their relative weight in IIP are as below:\n\nCoal\u00a0(weight: 4.38 %).\nCrude Oil\u00a0(weight: 5.22 %).\nNatural Gas (weight: 1.71 %).\nRefinery Products (weight: 5.94%).\nFertilizers\u00a0(weight: 1.25%).\nSteel\u00a0(weight: 6.68%).\nCement\u00a0(weight: 2.41%).\nElectricity\u00a0(weight: 10.32%)\nAnnual Survey of Industries (ASI) Vs Index of Industrial Production (IIP)\n\nThe Industrial Output data is captured and monitored, primarily, through two statistical activities \u2013 the Annual Survey of Industries (ASI) and Index of Industrial Production (IIP).\n\nASI\nASI is calculated on an annual basis\nThe ASI has been conducted under the Collection of Statistics Act, since 1959.\nThe objective is to obtain comprehensive and detailed statistics of the industrial sector to estimate the contribution of registered manufacturing industries as a whole to the national income.\nASI data is based on the actual book of accounts and other documents maintained by registered factories.\nIIP\nIIP is calculated on a monthly basis.\nData for IIP are collected by various source agencies under different Acts/statutes.\nThe IIP is compiled on the basis of data sourced from 16 ministries/ administrative departments.\nIndustry vs Manufacturing\n\nThough often interchangeably used, the terms industry and manufacturing are different.\n\nThe term industry is comprehensive and may be considered as a superset of manufacturing. Industry, in general, refers to an economic activity that is concerned with the production of goods, extraction of minerals and sometimes even the provision of services. Thus we have the iron and steel industry (production of goods), the coal mining industry (extraction of coal) and the tourism industry (service provider).\n\nSo what is manufacturing then?\n\nManufacturing: The production of goods in large quantities after processing from raw materials to more valuable products is called manufacturing.\n\nIndustry = Manufacturing + Mining + Electricity +\u00a0much more.\n\nShare of the Industrial Sector in the total GDP of India\n\nThe total Industrial sector has only around 27 per cent share of the total GDP of India. Over the last two decades, the share of the manufacturing sector has stagnated at 17 per\u00a0cent of GDP \u2013 out of a total of 27 per cent for\u00a0the industry which includes 10 per cent for\u00a0mining, quarrying, electricity and gas.\n\nThe share of Manufacturing in the GDP of India \u2013 17%.\nThe share of Mining, quarrying, electricity and gas\u00a0in the GDP of India \u2013 10%.\nTotal share of Industrial Sector = 27%\nSteps to boost manufacturing\nNational Manufacturing Competitiveness Council (NMCC):\u00a0The National Manufacturing Competitiveness Council (NMCC) has been set up by the Government to provide a continuing forum for policy dialogue to energise and sustain the growth of manufacturing industries in India.\nMake in India Initiative.\nNational Investment and Manufacturing Zones (NIMZs).\nDelhi-Mumbai Industrial Corridor (DMIC)."

Thus Indian Bureau of Mines won\u2019t cover them\nThe number of source agencies\t15\t14\tData on \u2018Iodised Salt\u2019 will be provided by DIPP. Because, the\u00a0 Salt Commissioner is not in a position to supply Salt production data after the abolition of Salt Cess Act, 1953 in Finance Bill 2016.\nUse-Based Classification changes\tThere are two new categories introduced in the new series namely \u201cPrimary goods\u201d and \u201cInfrastructure/ Construction goods\u201d replaced the category \u201cBasic goods\u201d in use-based classification.\nWorking in Progress\tMany items have production span of more than one month for which data will now be reported on \u2018work in progress\u2019 so that continuous production is accounted. It will address the fluctuations in production data.\nWhy was a revise needed in the IIP series?\nThe amendment in item list brings the production data of products that are relevant according to the changing time. For example, the production of colour TV picture tubes holds little relevance in a time of LCD, LED and OMLED technology. Yet fall in colour TV picture tube affected the IIP.\nChange in series maintains representativeness of the items and producing entities\nand also address issues relating to the continuous flow of production data.\nBy changing base year to 2011-12, now GDP, WPI and IIP, the three major indices; are in sync.\nAlso, a change in base year is done to shave off the base effect. It increases the sensitivity of the index to changes over the previous year.\nThe IIP was criticised for being unable to get the true picture. It focussed on redundant items while many vital aspects were left untouched, like the renewable energy production. Therefore a drastic change became a necessity.\nWhat are the impacts after IIP revision?\nA Technical Review Committee, chaired by Secretary, Ministry of Statistics and Program Implementation, is being set up to facilitate dynamic revision of the item list and panel of factories. It will meet once a year to amend the list. It will make the IIP dynamic, time relevant and an organic index.\nThe average industrial output growth for last five fiscal was 1.42%, as per 2004-05 series. It increased to 3.82% according to the new IIP series (2011-12).\nAlso, the old series showed 0.7% expansion in 2016-17. While the new series showed 5% rate of growth till March 2017 ( 2016-17).\nWhat are the limitations of IIP?\nQuality Vs Quantity: IIP is still reliant on quantity based growth projection. It faces problem in assessing the growth of high-value, low output products. Take the example of two cars, Maruthi Alto and Mercedes Benz. The value of one Mercedes Benz is more than 10 Maruthi Alto. Yet, a production increase of 2 units of Benz would be equal to 2 Maruthi Alto. So a little fall in the mass produced Alto will negate the increase in Benz production.\nUnorganised Sector:\u00a0The unorganised sector is still out of reach of the index. According to the employment and unemployment survey (EUS 2011-12, conducted by NSSO), employment in the informal component is to be about 75 per cent of total usual status employment (principal and subsidiary) in the rural areas and 69 per cent in urban areas. So IIP leaves about 70% of employment providing sector (i.e., unorganised sector) out of its reach.\nManufacturing Sector and PMI:\u00a0While assessing manufacturing sector, IIP still lacks the sensitivity that PMI (Purchasing Managers\u2019 Index- by Nikkei) is supposed to have. PMI also covers service sector.\nWhat is the future?\n\nWe are moving through an era of disruptive technology, where the boundaries between service and manufacturing are becoming hazy with each moment. With the fourth industrial revolution approaching, there is a need to change the way of assessing parameters of production and its direction. The formation of Technical Review committee is a good step but merely changing the items won\u2019t be enough in this fast changing world. The need is to redefine IIP where it covers not just production flow, but also its quality, impact and sustainability. It\u2019s sometimes joked that only if we have a Richter scale to judge economic quakes. Well, IIP\u2019s future lies in becoming that scale.\n\nArticle by: Alok Singh"

The faster people are pulled out of poverty and brought into the middle class, the more opportunity will there be for global business. Therefore, investors from abroad need to create jobs. Cost effective manufacturing and a handsome buyer \u2013 one who has purchasing power \u2013 are both required. More employment means more purchasing power.\n\nVision: Zero Defect and Zero Effect\n\nIf each one of our millions of youngsters resolves to manufacture at least one such item, India can become a net exporter of goods. I, therefore, urge upon the youth, in particular our small entrepreneurs that they would never compromise, at least on two counts. First, zero defect and, second again zero effect. We should manufacture goods in such a way that they carry zero defect, that our exported goods are never returned to us. We should manufacture goods with zero effect that they should not have a negative impact on the environment.\n\nAggressive branding and marketing\n\nMany previous governments had taken different steps to attract foreign investment (FDI) to boost manufacturing. \u2018Make in India initiative\u2019 talks about nothing different, but this initiative involves better branding and marketing to gain investor confidence. The need to give stress on manufacturing and industries is made clear. An entrepreneurial culture is encouraged, with relaxation in policies. Make in India is surely a visionary move considering the low performance of our industries in the last 3-4 years.\n\nHow to use the Make In India Portal for UPSC Exam preparation?\n\nYes, UPSC aspirants and the general public interested to know the details of the Indian economy (particularly the manufacturing sector) got a really good website to do research upon.

The MSMED Act, 2006 defines the Micro, Small and Medium Enterprises based on\n\nthe investment in plant and machinery for those engaged in manufacturing or production, processing or preservation of goods and\nthe investment in equipment for enterprises engaged in providing or rendering of services.\nOriginal Defenition of MSMEs (as per MSMED Act 2006)\n\nThe guidelines with regard to investment in plant and machinery or equipment as defined in the MSMED Act, 2006 are:\n\nNature of activity of the Enterprise\n\t\nInvestment in plant and machinery excluding land and building for enterprises engaged in manufacturing or production, processing or preservation of goods\n\t\nInvestment in equipment excluding land and building for enterprises engaged in providing or rendering of services (loans up to Rs 1 crore)\n\n\nMicro\n\t\nNot exceeding Rs.25.00 Lakhs\n\t\nNot exceeding Rs.10.00 Lakhs\n\n\nSmall\n\t\nMore than Rs.25.00 lakhs but does not exceed Rs.500.00 lakhs\n\t\nMore than Rs.10.00 lakhs but does not exceed Rs.200.00 lakhs\n\n\nMedium\n\t\nMore than Rs.500.00 lakhs but does not exceed Rs.1000.00 lakhs\n\t\nMore than Rs.200.00 lakhs but does not exceed Rs.500.00 lakhs\n\nNote: The investment in plant and machinery is the original cost excluding land and building and other items specified by the Ministry of Small Scale Industries vide its notification no.

To be effective, the proposal will need amendment in the MSMED Act and passed through the Parliament.\n\nBenefits provided to MSMEs\nLoans under the priority sector lending scheme.\n25% share in procurement by government and government-owned companies.\nPromoters are allowed to bid for stressed assets under the insolvency law (unlike big companies).\nVarious government schemes and funds.\nList of enterprises that are engaged in providing or rendering services\n\nThe illustrative lists of enterprises that are engaged in providing or rendering services are:\n\nSmall road and water transport operators (original investment in vehicles up to Rs.200.00 lacs under Priority sector)\nRetail trade (with credit limits not exceeding Rs.20.00 lakhs)\nSmall business (whose original cost price of the equipment used for the purpose of business does not exceed Rs.20.00 lakhs\nProfessional and self-employed persons (whose borrowing limits do not exceed Rs.10.00 lakhs of which not more than Rs.2.00 lakhs should be for working capital requirements except in case of professionally qualified medical practitioners setting up of practice in semi-urban and rural areas, the borrowing limits should not exceed Rs.15.00 lakhs with a sub-ceiling of Rs.3 lakhs for working capital requirements)\nSignificance of MSMED Act 2006\n\nWith the enactment of MSMED Act 2006, the paradigm shift that has taken place is the inclusion of services sector in the definition of Micro, Small and Medium Enterprises, apart from extending the scope to Medium Enterprises.\n\nShare of MSMEs in India\n\nThe Micro, Small and Medium Enterprises occupies strategic importance in terms of output (about 45% of manufacturing output), exports (about 40% of the total exports) and employment (about 69 million persons in over 29 million units throughout the country)\u00a0based on the Planning Commission, 2012. It is observed worldwide that as income increases the share of the informal sector decreases and that of the formal SME sector increases.\n\nWorldwide Trends in the SME Sector\nJapan \u2013 SMEs employ 70% of the wage earners and contribute 55% of the value-added.\nThailand \u2013 SMEs employ 60.7% of the population while contributing 38% to the GDP.\nChina \u2013 SMEs contribute to over 68% of the exports \u2013 in the last 20 years created more SMEs than the total number of SMEs in Europe and the US combined.\n\nNote: In China, an industrial SME is defined as having up to 2,000 employees, while a small business has less than 300 employees and medium-sized business has employees between 301 and 2,000.\n\nWhat is the Importance and role of MSMEs in the Indian Economy?\n\nTo generate large scale employment\n\nIn India, capital is scarce and labour abundant. MSMEs are thought to have lower capital-output and capital-labour ratios than large-scale industries, and therefore, better serve growth and employment objectives. The MSME sector in India has grown significantly since 1960 \u2013 with an average annual growth rate of 4.4% in the number of units and 4.62% in employment (currently employing 30 million). Not only do MSMEs generate the highest employment per capita investment, but they also go a long way in checking rural-urban migration by providing people living in isolated areas with a sustainable source of employment.\n\nTo sustain economic growth and increase exports\n\nNon-traditional products account for more than 95% of the MSME exports (dominating in the export of sports goods, readymade garments, plastic products etc.). Since these products are mostly handcrafted and hence eco-friendly, there exists a tremendous potential to expand the quantum of MSME led exports. Also, MSMEs act as ancillary industries for Large Scale Industries providing them with raw materials, vital components and backward linkages e.g. large scale cycle manufacturers of Ludhiana rely heavily on the MSMEs of Malerkotla which produce cycle parts.\n\nMaking Growth Inclusive\n\nMSMEs are instruments of inclusive growth which touch upon the lives of the most vulnerable and marginalized. For many families, it is the only source of livelihood. Thus, instead of taking a welfare approach, this sector seeks to empower people to break the cycle of poverty and deprivation. It focuses on people\u2019s skills and agency. However, different segments of the MSME sector are dominated by different social groups.\n\nThe Twelfth Plan has listed the following as the objectives for the MSME sector\nPromoting competitiveness and productivity in the MSME space.\nMaking the MSME sector innovative, improving technology and depth.\nEnabling environment for the promotion and development of MSMEs.\nStrong presence in exports.\nImproved managerial processes in MSMEs.\nEvolution and Performance of the MSME Sector in India\nPre-Liberalization\nDuring the post-Independence period, small firms were expected to play an important role in the development process, especially in absorbing surplus labour and achieving an equitable income distribution. This is the traditional stylized role assigned to small industries.\nAt the beginning of the industrialization process, flexibility in production and the ability to offer differentiated products allow smaller firms to grow rapidly.\nLater, large-scale firms come to dominate the size distribution, making up a greater share of output, employment, and value-added because of scale economies, managerial efficiency, better access to finance and infrastructure, and a favourable tariff structure.\nPost-Liberalization\nThe growth rate of MSME, on an average, has declined considerably in terms of units and even employment but has improved marginally in terms of output and exports, in the post-liberalization period compared to the pre-liberalization period.\nThis could be probably due to \u2013 (a) With the threat of competition, new MSME units would not have come up as significant in the liberalization period as compared to the pre-liberalization period (b) The new MSME units that came up after liberalization may have been much more capital intensive than those that have come up in the past \u2013 with some proportions of the existing MSME units having modernized themselves to rely less on labour and also to take advantage of developments in the global market (c) Unable to face the competition some MSMEs exited the market, thereby affecting MSME employment and output initially.\nHowever, though it appears that the MSME growth performance (in terms of employment, output, and exports) might have suffered initially it has been able to recover impressively subsequently in the decade of 2000s.\nThe share of the registered MSMEs in India\u2019s GDP more than doubled during this period and its share in total organized sector employment increased to 34% during the same period. Although the share of registered MSME exports declined sharply initially, it bounced back to 12% in 2006-07.\nThe improved economic health of registered MSME sector is reflected in another parameter i.e. industrial sickness. Sickness in the registered MSME sector has declined both absolutely and relatively. This may be the outcome of improvements in management deficiencies, insufficient financial control, research and development, obsolete technology, inadequate demand, shortage of raw materials, infrastructure bottlenecks, etc.\nThere are two more issues concerning MSME performance:\nAncillarisation \u2013 the promotion of inter-firm linkages between large firms and MSME through subcontracting and ancillarisation in both public and private sectors has been an important dimension of India\u2019s MSME policy. Any growth of ancillarisation and sub-contracting would be advantageous to the MSME sector by way of assured marketing, covered technical assistance, finance, and supply of raw materials and training. During this period the percentage of ancillary units increased from 5 per cent. Note that however a significant proportion of MSME subcontracting and ancillarisation are informal in nature. The growing inter-firm linkages, formal as well as informal, would have benefited the economic performance of the MSME sector.\nThe degree of internationalization \u2013 the world over, an export strategy has been the primary foreign market entry mode adopted by MSMEs in their internationalization efforts \u2013 this has been observed in the Indian context as well. At the national level, several factors contributed to the increasing trend of MSME internationalization like \u2013 structural shift in the composition of MSME exports from traditional to non-traditional items, modes of entry such as MNCs and e-Commerce etc.\nPolicy Towards Small-Scale Industries\n\nThough MSMEs were recognised as important for employment generation and equitable distribution of income from the earliest days of Indian Independence, it appears that the objectives of policies stressing the role of MSMEs are not being realised.\nSince independence in 1947, especially since the late 1950s, development has been wide-ranging, both in terms of programs and regions. Policy measures included inter-alia fiscal concessions, subsidized and directed bank credit, and technical and marketing support, along with reservations of products for exclusive production by the MSME sector.\nThese policy measures were in tune with the other policies such as the domestic investment and foreign trade policies that became more restrictive over the years.\nSince the mid-1980s there has been a gradual turnaround in policy, including reforms in the tax system and liberalization of import policy.\nThe shift in MSME policy emphasis from protection to the promotion of competitiveness began with the introduction of an exclusive policy for MSME in 1991. Since then, the policy support in the 1990s and early 2000s has been large to enable the MSMEs to overcome key challenges to their performance and growth, namely, finance, technology, and marketing, among others.\nTo operate these programs and to monitor their progress, new agencies and institutions have been set up, and the existing ones strengthened at the national, regional, state, and lower levels. There is also a special bank for MSMEs \u2013 SIDBI. The SSIs have their own associations and are also represented in the national and state-level associations of large-scale industries.\nEvaluation of the Reservation Policy\nThe policy of reserving products for exclusive manufacture in the small-scale sector was started in 1967 with forty-seven items; the list of reserved items rose to 873 in 1984.\nThe number of items on the reserved list for the SSI sector was brought down to 836 by 1989.\nThe pace of reforms accelerated after 1991: average tariff rates have been steadily lowered, quantitative restrictions have been removed, and domestic investment policies have been liberalized.\nOver time, the number of items on the reserved list has also been reduced and stands at 605 in 2005.\nWith liberalization, since all the items on the reserved list can now be imported, MSMEs face competition from foreign enterprises even though large scale industries in India cannot produce these products.\nThe Censuses of the SSIs also suggest that the policy of reserving goods for production by SSIs has not been very effective. The number of units making reserved products was small compared to the overall size of the MSME sector, and the reserved products account for a small share of the total value of output in the MSME sector.\nAlso, it appears that the export performance of India may have suffered because of the reservation policy. Most growing economies witness a changing structure of exports, with high growth of exports of labour-intensive and resource-based industries. The export structure of India has not changed much in the last two decades, and this may be because many commodities in the potential high-growth category come under the reserved list.\nWhat are the challenges of MSME?\nMost of the unregistered MSMEs would predominantly comprise micro-enterprises, particularly confined to rural India, operating with obsolete technology, limited access to institutional finance etc. And there is a need to transform the huge unregistered MSME into registered MSME.\nNeed to improve the competitiveness of the overall MSME sector.\nAccess to technology.\nIPR related issues.\nDesign as a market driver.\nWasteful usage of resources/manpower.\nEnergy inefficiency and associated high cost.\nLow ICT usage.\nLow market penetration.\nQuality assurance/certification.\nStandardization of products and proper marketing channels to penetrate new markets.\nThe definition for MSMEs must be updated \u2013 considering inflation and availability of better technologies since the last change in 2006.\nRecent Initiatives\nAs part of the National Manufacturing Competitiveness Programme (NMCP) \u2013 10 specific initiatives were taken to enhance the competitiveness of the entire value chain of the MSME sector.\nLimited Liability Partnership (LLP) Act, 2008 was introduced to enable early corporatization of MSMEs and tap the capital market for fundraising. Accordingly, MSME platforms are created in BSE and NSE in 2012.\nTo develop a roadmap for the development and promotion of MSMEs, a task force was created by the Prime Minister of India in 2009. The Task Force, which comprised, among others, six specific theme-based sub-groups (on credit, marketing, infrastructure, technology, skill development, exit policy, labour, and taxation) submitted its report in 2010 suggesting: (1) Immediate policy measures (2) Medium-term institutional measures (3) Legal and regulatory structures to create a conducive environment for entrepreneurship and growth of MSMEs.\nThe Inter-Ministerial Committee for Accelerating Manufacturing in Micro, Small and Medium Enterprises made recommendations on \u2013 (a) the promotion of start-ups (b) facilitating operation and growth (covering credit, technology, and marketing) (c) closure and exit (d) labour laws and regulations.\nThese policy initiatives are clear and consistent, aimed at transforming the ecosystem for the MSMEs sector by influencing: (1) Birth (encouraging Start-Ups) \u00a0(2) Operations and growth (by simplifying laws and regulations, and facilitating their access to credit. Better technology and dynamic markets, apart from skilled labour and reliable infrastructure) \u00a0(3) Orderly and easy exit\nThus, the emerging focus of India\u2019s MSME policy aims at covering the entire lifecycle of MSMEs to ensure a healthy, vibrant and competitive MSME sector.\nKey announcements of\u00a0Atma-nirbhar Bharat Abhiyaan\nRs 3 lakh crore collateral-free automatic loans for MSMEs\nRs 50,000 crore equity infusion through MSME Fund of Funds\nRs 20 crore subordinate debt for MSMEs\nSummary\n\nMSME sector is the second largest employer after agriculture in India. It provides employment to almost 111 million people.\n\nThere are around 6.3 crore MSME units in the country, with over 99% categorised as small units (as per original definition).\n\nThe sector contributes over 28% of the GDP and almost 45% to the manufacturing output.\n\nThe sector acts as the instrument of inclusive growth empowering the most vulnerable and marginalized groups.\n\nAlso read: Global Value Chains (GVCs)\n\nArticle by: Tom Jose"

            "[CONTENT]": "India did not have a single bankruptcy code. What we had\u00a0were age-old laws which are in conflict with each other. Lack of an insolvency and bankruptcy code had proved costly for the creditors (mainly banks) in many cases like the recent Kingfisher Airlines case. The Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code seeks to create a unified framework to resolve insolvency and bankruptcy in India.\n\nThe Code covers insolvency, liquidation, voluntary liquidation and bankruptcy.\u00a0The bill makes it easier for weak companies to exit or restructure their businesses. The code seeks to amend 11 laws, including the Companies Act, 2013 and the Sick Industrial Companies (Special Provisions) Repeal Act, 2003.\n\nLatest status:\u00a0The Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code 2016\u00a0was introduced in the Lok Sabha by Finance Minister Arun Jaitley in December 2015 and the JPC\u2019s report is expected next week.\u00a0The new Code is based on the report of the committee which studied the matter (Bankruptcy Law Reform Committee).\n\nTable of Contents\n\nWhat are Insolvency and Bankruptcy?\nWhy do we need such a code?\nCurrent insolvency mechanisms or laws (which obviously didn\u2019t work well!)\nInsolvency Proceedings: Companies vs Individuals\nCompanies and Limited Liability Partnerships (LLP):\nIndividuals and Partnerships:\nDifferent parties associated with insolvency\nAdvantages of the New Code\nConcerns regarding the Bill:\nConclusion\nWhat are Insolvency and Bankruptcy?\n\nInsolvency is the situation where the debtor is not in a position to pay back the creditor. For a corporate firm, the signs of this could be a slow-down in sales, missing of payment deadlines etc. Bankruptcy is the legal declaration of Insolvency. So the former is a financial condition and latter is a legal position. All insolvencies need not lead to bankruptcy. The new code has a sequential procedure of Insolvency resolution, failing which, it leads to Bankruptcy (following liquidation of assets).\n\nWhy do we need such a code?\n\nSuch a unified code is essential because currently the issue is handled under at least 13 different laws. This code seeks to replace the Presidency Towns Insolvency Act, 1909 and Provincial Insolvency Act, 1920. In addition, it seeks to amend 11 laws, including the Companies Act, 2013, Recovery of Debts Due to Banks and Financial Institutions Act, 1993 and Sick Industrial Companies (Special Provisions) Repeal Act, 2003, among others.\nEarlier, if a company defaults, there were at least four different legal routes available to the debtors and creditors. This could lead to multiple negotiations, multiple penalties etc. for the debtor, compounding his plight.\nSuch parallel proceedings had also given rise to numerous instances of conflict between the laws. Four different agencies, the high courts, the Company Law Board, the Board for Industrial and Financial Reconstruction (BIFR), and the Debt Recovery Tribunals (DRTs) have overlapping jurisdiction, giving rise to the potential of systemic delays and complexities in the process. This new bill addresses these issues, by bringing in a new uniform Code.\nCurrent insolvency proceedings take months, if not years (average time: 4 years). This delay can acutely devalue the assets involved, thus making the insolvency negotiations redundant.\nThe current disposition involves the institution of official liquidator, which is prone to red-tapeism, chronic corruption, and nepotism. The new code seeks to keep the role of the adjudicator to the minimum.\nCurrently, only 25% of the asset value is recovered by the creditors even after the liquidation process.\nAll these compounded to the pitiable position our Public Sector Banks find themselves in. Rising NPAs and mounting Stressed Assets have also eroded their profits, as the recent SBI reports point out. The easing of liquidation process can help the banks recover a lot of bad debts.\nIndia fares poorly in the Ease of Doing Business index of World Bank. Easiness of Exit is an important parameter in this index. The present morass of laws doesn\u2019t help in easing the exit of trouble-prone entities.\nAccording to World Bank data, it takes more than four years to wind up an ailing company in India, almost twice as long as it does in China.\nJust like the US Bankruptcy Code that provides for fairly quick liquidation or reorganisation of business, India too need a new code which will prevent the economy from tumbling southwards.\nCurrent insolvency mechanisms or laws (which obviously didn\u2019t work well!)\nSecuritization and Enforcement of Security.\nCorporate Debt Restructuring or CDR.\nSick Industrial Companies Act or SICA\nInsolvency Proceedings: Companies vs Individuals\n\nThe code will apply to all sort of business entities including corporate companies, partnerships, limited liability partnerships, individuals etc. Broadly the insolvency proceedings or the Insolvency Resolution Process (IRP) can be classified into two streams:\n\nCompanies and Limited Liability Partnerships (LLP):\n\nThe process can be initiated either by the debtor or the creditor(s). In this case, of companies and LLPs, the resolution process has to be completed in 180 days from the date of registration of the intent. That means once an application for insolvency resolution is accepted, an 180-day moratorium comes into place, during which no claims can be pursued against the debtor or its assets. This period of 180 days, can be extended by another 90 days if 75% of the financial creditors agree. The process enables the debtor and creditor to hold negotiations and finalise a draft resolution plan. The draft plan is to be agreed up on by a majority of the creditors. If they do agree, the plan is finalised and submitted to the adjudicating authority, which in this case is the National Company Law Tribunal. If the plan is not agreed up on by the majority of creditors, the company goes into liquidation.\n\n\ud83d\udc49 Which year are YOU targeting for success in the IAS/IPS/IFS Exam? \ud83d\ude80\n\n(1) \u21d2 UPSC 2025: Prelims cum Mains\n\n(2) \u21d2 UPSC 2026: Prelims cum Mains\n\n(3) \u21d2 UPSC 2027 Prelims cum Mains\n\nTip: Know more about ClearIAS Courses (Online/Offline)\n\nThere will be a provision for hastening up the IRP, as far as companies with smaller operations are concerned. Here the process will have to be completed within 90 days, which may be extended only if 75% of the financial creditors agree to it.\n\nIndividuals and Partnerships:\n\nHere, there are steps to be followed even before the Insolvency Resolution Process, IRP starts. Before going for IRP, the debtor may apply for forgiveness of specified amount of debt, provided his total assets are below a limit set by the Central Govt. This initial pardoning has to be done within 6 months. After that, the formal IRP starts, just like the first stream of companies, mentioned above. The negotiations between the debtor and creditor will be supervised by an insolvency professional. If they negotiations succeed, the repayment plan is drafted. If the plan is agreed upon by the majority of the creditors, the plan is submitted to the adjudicator, which in this case is Debt Recovery Tribunal. If they fail, the matter will proceed to the bankruptcy resolution.\n\nDifferent parties associated with insolvency\n\nNow that we have dealt with the insolvency process, we shall move on to the different parties involved.\n\nInsolvency professionals and agencies: as said earlier, the IRP will be managed and supervised by a licensed professional. The Insolvency Code also proposes to set up insolvency professional agencies, which can recruit the professionals and regulate them. The professionals will also have the power and duty to control the assets of the debtor during the process.\nInformation Utilities: The code also proposes to establish information utilities which will maintain a range of financial information about firms. Their duty is to collect and disseminate the information to facilitate the insolvency resolution process.\nInsolvency Regulator: The Code establishes the insolvency regulator, the Insolvency and Bankruptcy Board of India, IBBI, which will have the mandate to oversee the insolvency resolution in the country. The Board will have a membership of 10 members, including those representing the Central Government & Reserve Bank of India. The board will also act as the apex regulator, registering and regulating the information utilities, insolvency professional agencies, insolvency professionals etc.\nInsolvency and Bankruptcy Fund, IBF: deposits of the fund will include grants made by the central government, the amount deposited by the persons, interest earned on investments made from the fund etc. any person, who has contributed to the fund, may apply for withdrawal, in a case of proceedings against him.\nBankruptcy and Insolvency Adjudicators: as noted earlier, there are two different adjudicators, proposed by the code, one each for the two streams for individuals and companies. The National Company Law Tribunal will have the jurisdiction over companies and Limited Liability Partnerships, whereas the Debt Recovery Tribunal will have the jurisdiction over the individuals and partnership firms. Appeals against the orders of these tribunals may be challenged before their respective Appellate Tribunals, and further before the Supreme Court.\nCredit Committee: it is to be composed of financial creditors. The primary aim of the committee is to ensure payments to operating creditors on a pre-scheduled priority order (the priority proposed is listed later in the article).\nOffences and Penalties: the offences committed by the debtor under the corporate insolvency (first stream) like concealing the property, defrauding creditors etc. will be punished with imprisonment up to 5 years, with a fine of up to one crore rupees. Whereas, the offences committed by an individual (second stream), like providing false information, the imprisonment will vary based on the evidence. For most of these offences, the fine will not exceed five lakh rupees.\nAdvantages of the New Code\n\nThe bill seeks to shift from revival/recovery to resolution. This will ensure maximum assets recovered from the debtor, thus helping the balance sheets of the creditor. This would go a long way in helping the NPA-situation of the banks.\nThe new bill proposes to speed up both recoveries and restructuring procedures. There is significant a curb on the time involved, a maximum of 270 days. This will expedite the insolvency process. Time is important as the value of the assets corrodes very rapidly, when the firm is precariously placed.\nThe bill aims at promoting investments, freeing up banks\u2019 resources for other productive uses, boosting credit markets and improving ease of doing business in India, thus making a cumulative positive impact on the economy\nThe fixed time-period and predictable procedural methods will encourage creditors to join the collective insolvency resolution, rather than initiate individual actions.\nBy keeping the role of the adjudicator to a minimum, the bill ensures that delays arising from the bottlenecks in court proceedings are also reduced to the minimum. The principal business decisions such as the economic viability of the debtor, will be determined through negotiations between the debtor and creditors \u2013 an exercise that will be facilitated by insolvency professionals. The role of the NCLT is primarily to ensure that the procedures are complied with and no illegality or fraud has taken place.\nThe draft Bill also abolishes the institution of the official liquidator, which by all accounts has been a failure in non-viable businesses. Instead, the functions of the official liquidator are to be performed by insolvency professionals.\nIndustry anticipates that the change will provide an easy exit option for insolvent and sick firms.\nThe new code will matter to private sector employees too. The Bill, by forcing failed firms to shut shop, can lead to a survival of the fittest in the job market too.\nMake it easy for the budding entrepreneurs to start or exit from the start-up business. Commerce and Industry minister says it is going to make it easy to start up as much as to get out of the start-ups because if they are not doing well, there shouldn\u2019t be a taboo. They would be able to get out faster, thus helping the Start-up India Stand-up India campaign.\nConcerns regarding the Bill:\nThe draft Bill needs careful review, particularly on how the new law would interact with existing laws in this space, including the Sarfaesi Act and other debt recovery laws. Since it appears that the new Code doesn\u2019t replace the existing laws (and only amends 11 laws), there must at least be a clear demarcation of when these laws would apply and of overriding provisions in cases of conflict with the code, if we are to avoid reverting to the old regime of chaos and uncertainty.\nThe bill also provides for priority with regard to the distribution of proceeds following liquidation of the company (who gets the bounty first!). In the order of priority, the first charge will be insolvency resolution process cost and liquidation costs to be paid in full. Liquidation proceeds will then be used to clear debts owed to secured creditors, and then to pay workmen\u2019s dues for 12 months, unpaid dues to employees other than workmen, and financial dues owed to unsecured creditors, in that order. Government taxes for two years, other debts, preference shareholders and equity shareholders will receive last priority for payment (waterfall provision). Since equity shareholders could include the employees\u2019 PF, pensioners\u2019 fund etc., giving the public money the least importance has raised some eye brows.\nThe credit committee is to compose only of financial creditors. However, operation creditors is to be paid out first. This could lead to a conflict of interest.\nOnly two year history is to be checked for diversion, to check for ascertaining malfeasance. There is a suggestion that earlier history also should be taken into account.\nThe proposed Bill is also quite ambitious in the creation of a new institutional architecture to deal with insolvency. Among other things, it proposes the establishment of a new regulator, the creation of a new profession of insolvency professionals and the establishment of institutions known as information utilities that are designed to provide accurate information on defaults. These institutions and practices will take time to establish and there need to be well thought out transitional arrangements in the interim. Equally essential is significant training for insolvency professionals and judges if insolvency resolution and liquidation are to be the efficient and time-bound processes that the draft Bill envisages.\nPromoters will have the option to buy-back the company at a certain price, with certain debt restructuring. This has to be contemplated further to avoid bankruptcy tool from becoming an instrument to be exploited to reduce debt and increase equity value.\nThere is also apprehension that the ease of exit, could lead to hire and fire, especially in the private firms and start-up companies.\nConclusion\n\nThe proposed Insolvency and Bankruptcy Bill is only a starting point for easing exits for debtors in distress, preserving value and providing creditors with greater certainty in outcomes. Yet, by providing for a linear, time-bound and collective process for insolvency resolution and liquidation, it is a step in the right direction.\n\nArticle by: Jishnu J Raju"

Government of India had announced setting up of National Investment and Infrastructure Fund (NIIF) in 2015 budget.\u00a0The fund was eventually set up in December 2015.\u00a0The Fund aims to attract investment from both domestic and international sources.\n\nTable of Contents\n\nIssues with infrastructure sector\nNational Investment and Infrastructure Fund (NIIF)\nNIIF as fund of funds\nHow does this work?\nNational Investment and Infrastructure Fund (NIIF): What will it do?\nNIIF working in a nutshell:\nNIIF: Objectives\nFunctions of NIIF\nNIIF: Operational Aspects\nNIIF: Governance\nConclusion:\nIssues with infrastructure sector\n\nThe sector needs long term finance; but banks are helpless: One of the fundamental reason why Indian infrastructure is still not up to desired level is the lack of long term finance. This is despite the fact that 10.4% of bank lending was channelled to Infrastructure in 2015.\nBut of late, the banks in India especially the public sector banks are reeling under the pressure of Non-Performing Assets and Stressed assets, combing around 4.5% and 11% respectively.\nThis has forced the banks to confine themselves to a shell and not commit themselves to long term financing portfolios and projects with long gestation periods.\nIt is in light of this fund crunch situation that the Government of India announced setting up of National Investment and Infrastructure Fund in 2015 budget.\nThe NIIF through its pass-throughs, such as the National Housing Bank and the IRFC, will fund for a longer window of 20 years or more.\nNational Investment and Infrastructure Fund (NIIF)\nTo make it simple, National Investment and Infrastructure Fund (NIIF) is a fund created by the Government of India for enhancing infrastructure financing in the country.\nSecurities and Exchange Board of India (SEBI) has already approved NIIF as an alternate investment fund.\nThe National Investment and Infrastructure Fund (NIIF) Limited has been incorporated as a company under the Companies Act, 2013, duly authorized to act as investment manager of National Investment and Infrastructure Fund.\nThe government will invest Rs 20,000 crore into the NIIF from the Budget, with another Rs 20,000 crore expected to come from private investors.\nThe government\u2019s share of the NIIF\u2019s corpus is envisaged to be under 50%.\nWill NIIF invest in stalled projects? Answer: Yes\nWill NIIF invest in brownfield projects? Answer: Yes, both greenfield and brownfield, if it\u2019s commercially viable.\n\nNote:\u00a0You should not confuse National Investment Fund (NIF) and\u00a0National Innovation Foundation (NIF) with\u00a0National Investment and Infrastructure Fund (NIIF). All three are different concepts.\n\nNIIF as fund of funds\nNIIF is a fund of funds.\u00a0So there will be multiple alternate investment funds underneath.\nThere could be a stressed-assets fund, renewable energy fund, brownfield projects fund \u2013 sponsored by the NIIF.\nHow does this work?\nWith the corpus of Rs 40K crore the Trust would be able to raise debt.\nNIIF would raise funds upto 10 times the corpus\u00a0or up to Rs 2 lakh crore on a long-term basis.\nIt can invest in equity through infrastructure finance companies such as IRFC(Indian Railway Finance Corporation) and NHB(National Housing Bank).\nThe infrastructure finance companies can then leverage this extra equity, manifold.\nNational Investment and Infrastructure Fund (NIIF): What will it do?\nEquity (capital) to Non-Banking Financial Companies (NBFCs)/Financial Institutions (FIs) that are engaged mainly in infrastructure financing. These institutions will be able to leverage this equity support and provide debt to the projects selected.\nInvest in funds engaged mainly in infrastructure sectors and managed by Asset Management Companies (AMCs) for equity / quasi-equity funding of listed / unlisted companies.\nProvides fund directly to commercially projects, both Greenfield and brownfield, including stalled projects. A government official said some key transportation projects could be taken up initially by the NIIF for funding.\nGreenfield: a Greenfield project is one that lacks constraints imposed by prior work. Simply means: a new project.\nBrownfield: it is a term used to describe a land previously used for industrial purposes or some other uses. Brownfield project simply means: an already existing/ stalled project.\nNIIF working in a nutshell:\n\nThe fund is to be set up as a Trust. It is registered with SEBI as Category II Alternative Investment Fund (AIF) on December 28, 2015. (Read ahead on different categories of AIF)\nNIIF would raise funds by issuing offshore credit enhanced bonds and also tap into anchor investors.\nAnchor investors or cornerstone investors are marque institutional investors like sovereign wealth fund, mutual fund etc.\nSovereign wealth fund: a state owned fund.\nThe fund thus developed will be used to finance Indian infrastructure financing companies like the IRFC (Indian Rail Finance Corporation), NHB (National Housing Board) etc.\nThe fund thus received by these companies is then channelled to their respective niche areas (railways and Housing respectively in this case), thus increasing the investment into these sectors manifold.\nThus fundamentally NIIF is a Banker (NIIF) of the Banker (e.g.: NHB) of the Banker (e.g.: Housing loans).\nNIIF: Objectives\nMaximize economic impact of each Rupee spent.\nMainly through infrastructure development in commercially viable projects, both Greenfield and brownfield, including stalled projects.\nIt could also consider other nationally important projects, for example, in manufacturing, if commercially viable.\nFunctions of NIIF\nFund raising through suitable instruments including off-shore credit enhanced bonds, and attracting anchor investors to participate as partners in NIIF;\nServicing of the investors of NIIF.\nConsidering and approving candidate companies/institutions/ projects (including state entities) for investments and periodic monitoring of investments.\nInvesting in the corpus created by Asset Management Companies (AMCs) for investing in private equity.\nPreparing a shelf of infrastructure projects and providing advisory services.\nNIIF: Operational Aspects\nNIIF is not a single entity. There can be more than one fund. There could be a stressed-assets fund, renewable energy fund, brownfield projects fund, all sponsored by the NIIF.\nThus NIIF will be established as one or more Alternative Investment funds (AIF)\u00a0under the SEBI Regulations.\nAlternative Investment funds (AIF): AIF as an investment vehicle was established to pool in funds for investing in real estate, private equity and hedge funds. Till now, in India, pooling of capital was allowed only for Indian investors, and investment was done according to a pre-determined policy. However, selectively approval route for investment was used by overseas investors and non-resident Indians (NRIs). AIFs are primarily aimed at high net worth individuals, and according to the Securities and Exchange Board of India (Alternative Investment Funds) Regulations, 2012, the minimum investment from an individual is\u00a0Rs.1 crore. The overall corpus of the AIF should be at least\u00a0Rs.20 crore and there should not be more than 1,000 investors at any point in time. Also, the fund manager or promoter should have contributed at least 2.5% or\u00a0Rs.5 crore, whichever is less, to the initial capital.\nThere are three categories of AIFs depending upon on their effect on the economy.\nCategory-I AIFs have a positive spillover on the economy and may get concessions from the regulator or the government. These include venture funds, social venture funds and infrastructure funds, among others.\nCategory-II includes private equity funds and debt funds and do not get any concessions. These cannot raise debt for investment purposes, but can do so to meet their day-to-day operational requirements.\nCategory-III includes hedge funds, and are usually traded to make short-term returns.\nIf set up as Category I and II AIFs, then NIIF will be eligible for a pass through status under the Income Tax Act.\nA \u2018pass-through\u2019 status means that the income generated by the fund would be taxed in the hands of the ultimate investor, and the fund itself would not have to pay tax on the same.\nIn the case of category III AIF, where pass through status is not available, all income received by NIIF will be taxable at its level and any distribution made to the unit holders (investors) would be tax exempt.\nNIIF was formed as a category II AIF as a Trust under Indian Trust Act on 28 December 2015 along with the formation of\nNational Investment and Infrastructure Fund Trustee Ltd. (IDBI Capital Market Services Ltd as Advisor to NIIF Trustee Ltd for one year initially)and\nNational Investment and Infrastructure Fund Ltd. India (Infrastructure Finance Company Ltd (IIFCL) was appointed as Investment Advisor to NIIF Ltd for 6 months initially.)\nThe government will invest Rs 20,000 crore into the NIIF from the Budget, with another Rs 20,000 crore expected to come from private investors.\nGovernment\u2019s contribution/share in the corpus will be 49% in each entity set up as an alternate Investment Fund (AIF) and will neither be increased beyond, nor allowed to fall below, 49%. The whole of 49% would be contributed by Government directly. Rest is open for contribution from others.\nThe contribution of Government of India to NIIF would enable it to be seen virtually as a sovereign fund and is expected to attract overseas sovereign/ quasi-sovereign/multilateral/bilateral investors to co-invest in it.\nCash-rich Central Public Sector Enterprises (PSUs) could contribute to the Fund, which would be over and above the Government\u2019s 49%.\nSimilarly, domestic pension and provident funds and National Small Savings Fund may also provide funds to the NIIF.\nNIIF may also utilize the proceeds of monetized land and other assets of PSUs for infrastructure development.\nThe NIIF will work out these details in consultation with the Ministry of Finance, to match different investors\u2019 preferences.\nExample of non-governmental funding:\nNational Investment and Infrastructure Fund (NIIF) Ltd. signed a Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) with RUSNANO of Russia on 2 February 2016 to set up the Russia-India High Technology Private Equity Fund for joint implementation of investments into projects in India. RUSNANO is a Russian development institute with interest to invest in projects in the field of high technologies and defence including the projects aimed at establishment of manufacturing industrial enterprises in India.\nInternational pension funds and sovereign wealth funds from countries such as Russia, Singapore have evinced interest in participating in India\u2019s Rs 40,000-crore National Investment and Infrastructure Fund (NIIF)\nThe Union Cabinet gave its ex-post facto approval for a Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) between India and the United Arab Emirates (UAE) to mobilise up to $75 billion long-term investment in the National Investment and Infrastructure Fund (NIIF).\nNIIF: Governance\nThere will be a Governing Council of the NIIF which will have Government representatives and experts in international finance, eminent economists and infrastructure professionals. It could include representatives from other non-Government shareholders.\nThe terms and period of appointment of the Governing Council of the NIIF will be as decided by the Government.\nThe Governing Council will oversee the activities of the Trust and will be constituted as a separate legal entity, if necessary.\nGoverning council headed is currently by Finance Minister, Arun Jaitley and its other members include the secretaries of economic affairs and financial services, SBI Chairperson Arundhati Bhattacharya, former Infosys executive TV Mohandas Pai and Hemendra Kothari.\nNIIF would be supported by one or more Chief Executive Officers (depending upon the number of funds created) and a small investment team consisting of limited number of expert staff, at arm\u2019s length from the Government.\nTheir salaries would be market-linked.\nIt would be possible for the NIIF Governing Council to appoint one or several Fund Managers.\nNIIF would have full autonomy for project selection.\nNIIF would formulate guidelines and would follow due processes for selection criteria for AMCs and Non-Banking Financial Companies (NBFCs) / Financial Institutions (FIs).\nConclusion:\n\nNow that government has revitalized the financing arm of the infrastructure sector, it must now train its eyes on other obstacles which include an outdated labour law regime, massive dearth of skilled labour, problems in land acquisition, environment and other clearances etc. to achieve the cherished dream of transforming India as the manufacturing hub of the world through the Make in India Project.\n\nArticle by: Jishnu J Raju\n\n\ud83d\udc49 Which year are YOU targeting for success in the IAS/IPS/IFS Exam? \ud83d\ude80\n\n(1) \u21d2 UPSC 2025: Prelims cum Mains\n\n(2) \u21d2 UPSC 2026: Prelims cum Mains\n\n(3) \u21d2 UPSC 2027 Prelims cum Mains\n\nTip: Know more about ClearIAS Courses (Online/Offline)"

Every Department will now have visibility of each other\u2019s activities providing critical data while planning & comprehensively executing projects.\nPrioritization: Through this, different Departments will be able to prioritize their projects through cross-sectoral interactions.\nOptimization: The National Master Plan will assist different ministries in planning for projects after the identification of critical gaps. For the transportation of the goods from one place to another, the plan will help in selecting the most optimum route in terms of time and cost.\nSynchronization: Individual Ministries and Departments often work in silos. There is a lack of coordination in the planning and implementation of the project resulting in delays. It will help in synchronizing the activities of each department, as well as of different layers of governance, holistically by ensuring coordination of work between them.\nAnalytical: The plan will provide the entire data at one place with GIS-based spatial planning and analytical tools having 200+ layers, enabling better visibility to the executing agency.\nDynamic: All Ministries and Departments will now be able to visualize, review and monitor the progress of cross-sectoral projects, through the GIS platform, as the satellite imagery will give on-ground progress periodically and the progress of the projects will be updated regularly on the portal. It will help in identifying the vital interventions for enhancing and updating the master plan.\nWhat is the need for the scheme?\nTo address the wide gap between macro planning and micro implementation due to the lack of coordination and advanced information sharing as departments think and work in silos.\nAs per reports, studies estimate the logistics costs in India at about 13-14% of GDP as against about 7-8% in developed economies. With this high logistical cost, the competitiveness of India\u2019s exports is greatly reduced.\nIt will increase economic activities and create employment on a large scale due to the creation of quality infrastructure for sustainable development.\nThe scheme is in synergy with the National Monetisation Pipeline (NMP) which was announced to provide a clear framework for monetization and give potential investors a ready list of assets to generate investor interest.\nA holistic and integrated transport connectivity strategy will greatly support\u00a0\u2018Make in India\u2019 and integrate different modes of transport.\nAnother push for such a scheme was the lack of demand in the post-Covid-19 scenario, which in turn led to a lack of private demand and investment demand.\nDue to land acquisition delays and litigation issues, the rate of implementation of projects is very slow on global standards- issues that the scheme will address.\nWay forward\n\nPM Gati Shakti scheme is a move in the right direction, but it needs to address structural and macroeconomic stability concerns arising from high public expenditure.\n\nThus, this initiative must be supported by a stable and predictable regulatory and institutional framework."

In pursuance of this, an annual infrastructure pipeline would be developed.\n\nTo achieve this task, a Task Force under the chairmanship of Secretary, Department of Economic Affairs has been constituted by Union Finance Minister to draw up a National Infrastructure Pipeline for each of the years from FY 2019-20 to FY 2024-25.\n\nThe Task Force is chaired by\u00a0Secretary, DEA with CEO (NITI Aayog), Secretary (Expenditure), Secretary of the Administrative Ministries, and Additional Secretary (Investments), DEA as members and Joint Secretary (IPF), DEA as Member Secretary.\n\nThe first meeting of the Task Force was held in September 2019. This exercise is expected to be followed up by a periodical review process.\n\nNIP will enable a forward outlook on infrastructure projects which will create jobs, improve ease of living, and provide equitable access to infrastructure for all, thereby making growth more inclusive.\n\nNational Infrastructure Pipeline: Major Expenditure to be on Energy and Roads\n\nDuring the fiscals 2020 to 2025, sectors such as Energy (24%), Roads (19%), Urban (16%), and Railways (13%) amount to around 70% of the projected capital expenditure in infrastructure in India.\n\nMinistry/ Department\tFY 20-25\nEnergy\nPower\t1175995\nRenewable Energy\t929500\nAtomic Energy\t154088\nPetroleum and Natural Gas\t194666\nTotal Energy\t24,54,249\nRoads\nRoads\t19,63,943\nTotal Roads\t19,63,943\nRailways\nRailways\t13,68,523\nTotal Railways\t13,68,523\nPorts\nPorts\t1,00,923\nTotal Ports\t1,00,923\nAirports\nAirports\t1,43,398\nTotal Airports\t1,43,398\nUrban\nAMRUT, SMART Cities, MRTS, Affordable Housing, Jal Jeevan Mission\t16,29,012\nTotal Urban\t16,29,012\nTelecommunication\nTelecommunication\t3,20,498\nTotal Telecommunications\t3,20,498\nIrrigation\nIrrigation\t7,72,678\nTotal Irrigation\t7,72,678\nRural Infrastructure\nRural Infrastructure\t4,10,955\nWater and Sanitation\t3,61,810\nTotal Rural Infrastructure\t7,72,765\nAgriculture and Food Processing Infrastructure\nAgriculture Infrastructure\t54,298\nFood Processing Industries\t1,255\nFood and Public Distribution\t5,000\nTotal Agriculture and Food Processing Infrastructure\t60,553\nSocial Infrastructure\nHigher Education\t1,18,348\nSchool Education\t37,791\nHealth and Family Welfare\t1,68,622\nSports\t7,618\nTourism\t24,321\nTotal Social Infrastructure\t3,56,701\nIndustrial Infrastructure\nIndustries and Internal Trade\t2,99,237\nSteel\t8,225\nTotal Industrial Infrastructure\t3,07,462\nTOTAL (Rs.

This would, he said, be \u201cchallenging, but achievable.\u201d\n\nIn the 2019 Independence Day speech made by Prime Minister Narendra Modi, a key announcement was the investment of Rs. 100 lakh crore in infrastructure over the next five years.\n\nHowever, to reach the $5 trillion mark by 2024, Indian Economy should grow over 12% a year from 2019 (nominal growth in dollar terms). As of 2019-20, the nominal growth of India (which includes the inflation factor), is estimated at only around 9%. The real growth as of 2019-20, is only around 5%.\n\nIf the real GDP growth of India rises to 8% and the average inflation rate stabilizes around 4%, a nominal growth of 12 per cent may be the end result. This makes the dream of a 5 trillion dollar economy by 2024 possible.\n\nHowever, as the target is in terms of the dollar, there are two major variables which can impact India\u2019s growth towards achieving this target:\n\nInflation rate\nRupee-dollar exchange rate\n\nAs the 5 trillion dollar target of GDP is calculated at current prices (which includes inflation), one may feel that India may achieve the target GDP, not because of increase in production (output) but due to the higher inflation rate. However, this may not be the case. With an increase in inflation, there will be a decline in the purchasing power of money. This may reduce consumption and thus may negatively impact GDP growth.\n\nOn the exchange-rate aspect, if the rupee depreciates further, it will adversely affect India\u2019s GDP growth in dollar terms. If rupee starts appreciating against the dollar, it makes it easier to reach the target.\n\nConclusion\n\nIn conclusion, the National Infrastructure Pipeline (NIP) is a crucial initiative by the Indian government to boost the country\u2019s infrastructure development. With an estimated investment of Rs. 111 lakh crore, the NIP covers a wide range of sectors including energy, transportation, water and sanitation, social infrastructure, and others.\n\nThe pipeline aims to provide a major impetus to the country\u2019s economic growth, create job opportunities, and improve the quality of life of the citizens."

The term is used for purchasing or leasing existing production facilities to launch a new production activity.\n\nChallenges for implementing National Monetisation Pipeline\nDeficiency of identified revenue-generating ways in various assets, hence investment in them may end up in losses.\nThe slow pace of privatization in government companies including Air India and BPCL.\nThe recently launched PPP initiative in railways indicates a lack of private investors\u2019 interest.\nCapacity utilization in gas and petroleum pipeline networks is not up to the mark and has a lot of untapped potentials.\nPower sector assets come with regulated tariffs making them less viable for private players.\nNational highways below four lanes do not attract investors.\nMany assets like railways have multiple stakeholders, including state governments, which own a stake in the entity.\nWay Forward\n\nThe National Monetisation Pipeline framework on paper looks very promising, but the government should ensure proper execution to derive desired outcomes.\n\nThere is a need for an efficient dispute resolution mechanism, which is one of the key aspects of such a wide-ranged plan.\n\nThe success of the infrastructure expansion plan would depend on other stakeholders playing their due role; hence all the strata should be duly considered and be given opportunities.\n\nThe State governments and their public sector enterprises and the private sectors should be able to work together through healthy competition.\n\nA high-Powered Intergovernmental Group can be set up as recommended in the 15th finance commission to re-examine the fiscal responsibility legislation of the Centre and States."

Nearly a third of passenger revenue comes from AC class passengers (who constitute just 1.3 per cent of the total number of passengers travelling in a year).\nThe share of roads in freight transport is more than half in India; while in China, it is only 30%. As more highways are getting built rapidly, the share of roads in freight transport is increasing at accelerating rate.\nFreight contributes nearly two-thirds of Indian Railway\u2019s revenue and coal transport alone contributes to half of that.

The Japanese Yen is projected to appreciate against the Indian Rupee over the period questioning the viability of the loan and the project on the whole.\nWhat are the Pros of the project?\nConvenience:\nHaving an alternative mode of transport will decongest the roads.\nAlso, the speed of bullet trains will save the time and boost the businesses in large cities where time is money.\nThe interconnectedness between the towns and cities would reduce the hassle of commuting thereby helping in reducing the migration.\nSafety:\nSafety has been one of the major concerns of Indian Railways.\nThe record of bullet trains in the field of safety has been impeccable.\nThe Shinkansen trains of Japan started in 1964 report no fatalities till date.\n\u00a0Environment-friendly:\nIn today\u2019s global environmental scenario, any step which checks the pollution is welcome.\nThe emissions of CO2 per passenger km from speed rails is way less compared to that of automobiles and aeroplanes. It emits an eighth and a fifth of emissions respectively.\nEconomic growth:\nIt will help in the infrastructure development thereby spurring the economic growth and creating huge employment opportunities.\nWhat are the Cons of the project?\nCosts:\nThe Mumbai- Ahmedabad high-speed rail costs around one lakh crore Indian Rupee.\nConsidering the cost overruns due to delays and future fluctuations of inflation, it may further get increased.\nHigh fares:\nIt is estimated that the fares may range in between Rs. 4000 to Rs 5000\u00a0to make the running of trains economically viable.\nSuch fares would be affordable only by the rich who might prefer air travel considering the lesser margin of fares between them.\nHowever, most of the travel by trains in India is done by the poorer sections.\nLand acquisition:\nIt might act as another obstacle delaying the project and also causing large-scale displacement of people.\nWhat are the arguments against Bullet Trains in India?\nThe Indian Railways is in a worrying state.There is a need to strengthen the present infrastructure of the railways.\nThe recent number of increasing rail accidents and the Elphinstone road station stampede further strengthens this case.\nThe recent report by the Standing committee on Railways headed by Sudip Bandopadhyay said that in 2014-15, about 40% of the accidents occurred at Unmanned Level Crossings and in 2015-16, about 28%.\nThe committee also recommended a complete shift to LHB coaches to minimize the loss of lives in case of derailments.\n\nThus, the argument is, instead of strengthening and upgrading the current infrastructure keeping in mind the safety of millions of passengers, why invest in a project catered to the well-off sections.\n\nIs this argument valid?\n\nThere is no denying the fact that safety considerations are to be kept in mind and accorded high priority.\n\nHowever, comparing these two investments in not right.\n\nThese should not be considered as alternative choices. Investments should be made for renovation and up gradation as well as in the bullet trains project.\n\nConclusion\n\nIndia aspires to become the third largest economy in the next 25 years. It has already proven its prowess in the field of space and now is the time for furthering its international stature by joining the exclusive club of nations having a high-speed rail network.\n\nEverything will have its array of pros and cons. It lies in ones\u2019 wisdom to weigh them equally and choose the path. The technological development comes at a cost but the safety of our citizens should not be a value added.\n\nArticle by: Pullela Ujwala"

It was renamed Air India, primarily operating on international routes in 1946.\nIndian Airlines: Indian Airlines was a major Indian airline based in Delhi and focused primarily on domestic routes, along with several international services to neighboring countries in Asia. It was administered by the Ministry of Civil Aviation.\nAir India merged with the erstwhile Indian Airlines in 2007 based on the recommendations of Justice Dharmadhikari\u2019s committee report.\nAs part of the merger process, a new company called the National Aviation Company of India Limited (now called Air India Limited) was established, into which both Air India and Indian Airlines would be merged.\nAir India-Indian Airlines Merger: A failed one?\n\nAI and Indian Airlines had been running profitably till 2005\u201306. However, their future had already been compromised by then. It is commented that the merger of Air India with Indian Airlines has created woes due to a lack of effective leadership and erroneous government policies.\n\nAlso read: Disinvestment in India\n\nWhy were Indian Airlines merged with Air India (2007)?\nThe merger was initiated with the aim of making profits and gaining a high market share for the airline. The major objective behind the committee formation was a rationalization of operations and restructuring of debt.\nEscalating costs of Aviation Turbine Fuel (ATF).\nImmense competition from private and low-cost airlines.\nIncreased cost pressures due to the acquisition of additional aircraft Leadership crisis due to frequent changes of the chairman- cum-managing director.\nAir India could not fully use the bilateral rights, unlike foreign airlines which took maximum advantage.

The instability at the top has led to poor profits due to a lack of decision-making.\nThe merger brought together two disparate entities and created\u00a0a behemoth with 30,517 employees \u2013 221 employees per aircraft, which is much higher than Singapore Airlines which has 161, and British Airways which has 178. The increase in the number of employees led to pressure in the form of salaries and this further led to more losses. (Reference: Business Today)\nNo attempts were made to standardize hiring policies for the rank and file. Both the partners had different rules and policies which were not harmonized for a smoother run.\nDuring the period 1998\u20132004, no new planes were ordered for AI or Indian Airlines.\nBecause of post-merger HR issues like compensation, career progression, salary payment, promotion issues, and employee strikes, the merger did not yield the intended objectives.\nThe poor management practices and improper planning have pushed the merged entity into trouble.\nThe Parliamentary Standing Committee on Transport, tourism, and Culture, in 2010 summarized the problems of the Air India merger process. It said that the first reason for the fall in the morale of the employees was changing the name of IA (Indian Airlines) which had had a good reputation in the market. The reason was not revealed either to customers or to employees by the management.\n10-year Restructuring Plan for Air India (2012-2022)\nIn April 2012, the government signed a 10-year restructuring plan with the AI.\nBy April 2012, when the government finally signed a turnaround plan for AI, the annual operational loss of the airline had increased to around \u20b95,000 crore and its accumulated debt had reached nearly \u20b943,500 crore. It was then operating on a capital base of \u20b93,345 crore (AI 2012).\nRepeated statements by the MCA in Parliament over the years have testified that the government is largely satisfied that the AI is progressing as per the turnaround plan (MCA 2017a).\nIs Air India a loss-making company?\n\nThe national carrier is one among other airlines that were struggling and is still undergoing a 10-year rehabilitation package that started in 2012.\n\nIt posted faster-than-anticipated operating profits and lower net losses in 2015\u201316, much before its recovery package was to begin bearing fruit, while its low-cost subsidiary Air India Express posted profits.\n\nBoth have reportedly done even better in 2016\u201317.\n\nAir India\u2019s passenger load factor (or its ability to fill seat capacity), a key indicator of airline performance, has improved steadily over the last five years.\n\nThe Indian civil aviation sector at large also reported positive results the same year, after a decade of difficulty.\n\nWith steady passenger growth, it is expected to be the third-largest civil aviation market by the end of the decade. (Reference: EPW)\n\nAlso read: Make In India Initiative\n\nHow correct is it to point fingers at the management of Air India for losses?\n\nAir India is not the only airline that was doing badly earlier.\n\nPrivate airlines too have had difficulty navigating India\u2019s civil aviation sector.\n\nAround 23 airlines closed or merged with others but the latter eventually shut down or ceased operations.\n\nMany of the airlines that continued to operate have reported losses over the past decade.\n\nUntil the drop in global crude oil prices, the sector faced difficulties due to relatively higher aviation turbine fuel costs in India, excess capacity, and a limited number of high-traffic routes to vie for.\n\nCriticisms of Privatising Air India\nThe civil aviation market in India, like in many parts of the world, is oligopolistic, with a few firms controlling large market shares.\nForcing the exit or merger of an established state-run airline \u2013 with the third largest market share which has 31% of the planes in the sector and prime slots at airports worldwide \u2013 will only aid in the undesirable concentration of market power with a few already large private airlines, and will prove anti-competitive.\nIf anything, a public sector enterprise of this size in an oligopolistic sector is not only desirable but essential.\nWay ahead\n\nInstead of indulging in virulent criticism of the Maharaja, the government must allow the recovery package to bear fruit, and must not privatize in haste. All signals \u2013 fuel prices and market conditions -suggest that Air India will prove to be a profitable venture for the government like it used to be earlier.\n\nAir India will have to cut layers of management, align staff by role, bring in lateral hires, overhaul customer-facing functions, and implement a massive training exercise. And, rein in pilots and engineers, even if it means a partial lockout. Though the process is on track to some extent, still a lot needs to be done in this regard.\n\nArticle contributed by Pooja Chaudhary and edited by ClearIAS Team"

Energy Conservation Building Codes (ECBC) by the Ministry of Power\n\nThe Energy Conservation Building Code (ECBC) was launched by the Ministry of Power for new commercial buildings in 2007. It sets minimum energy standards for new commercial buildings.\n\n\ud83d\udc49 Which year are YOU targeting for success in the IAS/IPS/IFS Exam? \ud83d\ude80\n\n(1) \u21d2 UPSC 2025: Prelims cum Mains\n\n(2) \u21d2 UPSC 2026: Prelims cum Mains\n\n(3) \u21d2 UPSC 2027 Prelims cum Mains\n\nTip: Know more about ClearIAS Courses (Online/Offline)\n\nTo promote a market pull for energy-efficient buildings, the Bureau of Energy Efficiency developed a voluntary Star Rating Programme for buildings which is based on the actual performance of a building.\n\nThe updated version of ECBC came in 2017 which sets parameters for builders, designers, and architects to integrate renewable energy sources in building design with the inclusion of passive design strategies. The code aims to optimize energy savings with the comfort levels for occupants and prefers life-cycle cost-effectiveness to achieve energy neutrality in commercial buildings.\n\n3. National Mission for Enhanced Energy Efficiency (NMEEE) under NAPCC\n\nThe National Mission for Enhanced Energy Efficiency (NMEEE) is one of the eight missions under the National Action Plan on Climate Change (NAPCC). NMEEE aims to strengthen the market for energy efficiency by creating conducive regulatory and policy regimes and has envisaged fostering innovative and sustainable business models in the energy efficiency sector.\n\nThe NMEEE has four initiatives to enhance energy efficiency in energy-intensive industries which are as follows:\n\nPerform, Achieve, and Trade Scheme (PAT):\n\nA market-based mechanism to enhance the cost-effectiveness in improving Energy Efficiency in Energy Intensive industries through certification of energy saving which can be traded.\n\nUnits that can achieve a specific energy consumption (SEC) level that is lower than their targets can receive energy savings certificates (ESCerts) for their excess savings.\n\nThe ESCerts could be traded on the Power Exchanges and bought by other units under PAT who can use them to meet their compliance requirements.\n\nMarket Transformation for Energy Efficiency (MTEE):\n\nUnder MTEE, two programs have been developed i.e. Bachat Lamp Yojana(BLY) and Super-Efficient Equipment Programme (SEEP).\n\nBEE promotes the use of LED lights using the institutional structure of the BLY Programme. SEEP is a program designed to bring accelerated market transformation for super-efficient appliances by providing financial stimulus innovatively at critical point/s of intervention.\n\nEnergy Efficiency Financing Platform (EEFP):\n\nThis is a platform for the creation of mechanisms that would help finance demand-side management programs in all sectors by capturing future energy savings. Under this, MoUs have been signed with financial institutions to work together for the development of the energy efficiency market and the identification of issues related to this market development.\n\nFramework for Energy Efficient Economic Development (FEEED):\n\nThis is for the development of fiscal instruments to promote energy efficiency. Under this two initiatives are taken:\n\nPartial Risk Guarantee Fund for Energy Efficiency (PRGFEE) is risk risk-sharing mechanism to provide commercial banks with a partial coverage of risk involved in extending loans for energy efficiency projects.\n\nThe Venture Capital Fund for Energy Efficiency (VCFEE) is a fund to provide equity capital for energy efficiency projects. The support under VCFEE is limited to Government buildings and municipalities.\n\n4. School Education Program by\u00a0Bureau of Energy Efficiency and NCERT\n\nThere is a need to make the next generation more aware of the efficient use of energy resources. In this regard, promotion of energy efficiency in schools is being promoted through the establishment of Energy Clubs.\n\nThe Bureau of Energy Efficiency intends to prepare the text/material on Energy Efficiency and Conservation for its proposed incorporation in the existing science syllabi and science textbooks of NCERT for classes 6th to 10th.\n\n5. Human Resource Development (HRD)\n\nThe potential for improvement of energy efficiency of processes and equipment through awareness creation is vast. A sound policy for the creation, retention, and gradation of skills in Human Resources is crucial for the penetration of energy-efficient technologies and practices in various sectors.\n\nThe component under HRD comprises of theory cum practice-oriented training program and provides Energy Audit Instrument Support to the citizens.\n\n6. Promotion of Energy-Efficient LED Bulbs \u2013 UJALA scheme\n\nHon\u2019ble Prime Minister Sh. Narendra Modi described the LED bulb as the \u201cPrakash Path\u201d \u2013 the \u201cway to light\u201d. The initiative is part of the Government of India\u2019s efforts to spread the message of energy efficiency in the country.\n\nUJALA scheme aims to promote efficient use of energy at the residential level, enhance the awareness of consumers about the efficacy of using energy-efficient appliances, and aggregate demand to reduce the high initial costs thus facilitating higher uptake of LED lights by residential users. It may be noted that the scheme was initially labeled DELP (Domestic Efficient Lighting Program) and was relaunched as UJALA.\n\n7. Promotion of Electric vehicles: \u2013 National Electric Mobility Mission Plan (NEMMP)\n\nThe government of India launched the National Electric Mobility Mission Plan (NEMMP) 2020 in 2013. It aims to achieve national fuel security by promoting hybrid and electric vehicles in the country. There is an ambitious target to achieve 6-7 million sales of hybrid and electric vehicles year on year from 2020 onwards.\n\nThe government aims to provide fiscal and monetary incentives to kick-start this nascent technology; e.g. Demand-side incentives to facilitate the acquisition of hybrid/electric vehicles, Promoting R&D in technology including battery technology, power electronics, motors, systems integration, etc.\n\nThe government has launched the scheme namely Faster Adoption and Manufacturing of Hybrid & Electric Vehicles (FAME India) under NEMMP 2020 in the Union Budget for 2015-16. The scheme will provide a major push for early adoption and market creation of both hybrid and electric technologies vehicles in the country. The scheme has 4 focus areas i.e. Technology development, Demand Creation, Pilot Projects, and Charging Infrastructure.\n\nConclusion\n\n\u201cWe all have our personal doomsday scenarios with respect to an extremely \u201cEnergy Hungry \u201d world\u201d.\n\nThe Perform, Achieve, and Trade Scheme (PAT) scheme is a unique and innovative initiative, perhaps with no precedence anywhere else in the world. PAT would become a valuable model for\u00a0other countries to adopt for their energy efficiency programs from a business perspective. Standards and Labelling of equipment and appliance programs have created a market transformation.\n\nPS: If you come across any other initiatives or schemes by the Government or private sector for energy efficiency and energy conservation, feel free to mention the same in the comments.\n\nArticle by: Arun Kumar"

            "[CONTENT]": "A village named Neduvasal in the Pudukkottai district in Tamil Nadu has recently been in the news headlines. The reason is the launch of a hydrocarbon project. In this post, we cover everything you need to know about the Neduvasal Hydrocarbon Project controversy and policies like the Discovered Small Field Policy, NELP, and HELP.\n\nThe Neduvasal Hydrocarbon Project is a controversial hydrocarbon extraction initiative located in the Neduvasal village in the Nagapattinam district of Tamil Nadu, India.\n\nThis project is part of a broader plan by the Government of India to increase domestic hydrocarbon production under the \u201cDiscovered Small Fields\u201d policy.\n\nThe policy aims to extract hydrocarbons from small, previously discovered fields that were not developed by major exploration companies, often due to economic or technological constraints.\n\nTable of Contents\n\nWhat is a Hydrocarbon Project?\nWhat is the Neduvasal Hydrocarbon Project Controversy?\nNeduvasal Hydrocarbon Project: The Background\nWhat is Discovered Small Field Policy?\nNeduvasal Hydrocarbon Project: Who are the protestors?\nNeduvasal Hydrocarbon Project: What is the mode of protest?\nNeduvasal Hydrocarbon Project: What are the reasons put forward by the protestors?\nWhat are the possible advantages of the Neduvasal Hydrocarbon Project?\nWhat are the assurances given by the authorities about the extraction process?\nSummary\nWhat is a Hydrocarbon Project?\n\nIn organic chemistry, a hydrocarbon is an organic compound consisting entirely of hydrogen and carbon.\nHydrocarbon exploration (or oil and gas exploration) is the search for hydrocarbon deposits beneath the Earth\u2019s surface, such as oil and natural gas.\n\nAlso read:\u00a0Hydrocarbons: How are they extracted?\n\nWhat is the Neduvasal Hydrocarbon Project Controversy?\nThe central government is planning to extract the hydrocarbon (oil and natural gas) in Neduvasal village in Pudukkottai district, Tamil Nadu.\nMany villagers are protesting against the proposed Hydrocarbon project.\nTheir fear is due to the possible impact the project can have on village life and agriculture.\nSimilar to the Jallikattu Ban, this protest is also gaining momentum.\nNeduvasal Hydrocarbon Project: The Background\n\nThe Cabinet Committee on Economic Affairs chaired by the Prime Minister on February 15, 2015, gave its approval for all the hydrocarbon projects including the Neduvasal Hydrocarbon Project as a part of the Centre\u2019s 2015 \u2018Discovered Small Fields policy\u2019.\n\n\ud83d\udc49 Which year are YOU targeting for success in the IAS/IPS/IFS Exam? \ud83d\ude80\n\n(1) \u21d2 UPSC 2025: Prelims cum Mains\n\n(2) \u21d2 UPSC 2026: Prelims cum Mains\n\n(3) \u21d2 UPSC 2027 Prelims cum Mains\n\nTip: Know more about ClearIAS Courses (Online/Offline)\n\nThe two contract areas, Karaikal (10.4 sq km) located in Puducherry and Neduvasal (10.0 sq km) located in Tamil Nadu were awarded under Discovered Small Field (DSF) bidding round.\n\nThey have an in-place volume of 4,30,000 metric tons of oil and oil equivalent gas.\n\nThe proposed Hydrocarbon Project at Neduvasal village in Pudukkottai district was recommended for award to GEM Laboratories Private Limited, a company based out of Davangere in Karnataka for extracting both oil and natural gas from hydrocarbon sediments in an area of about 10.0 sq km.\n\nWhat is Discovered Small Field Policy?\nThe Cabinet Committee on Economic Affairs chaired by Prime Minister Shri Narendra Modi (CCEA) has approved the award of 31 contract areas as part of the Discovered Small Field (DSF) Bid Round 2016.\nThe contract was for 44 oilfields (in 31 contract areas), including 28 on-land and 16 offshore fields discovered by Oil and Natural Gas Corp. (ONGC) and Oil India Ltd (OIL)\nThese fields were offered under the new policy for small fields known as the Discovered Small Field (DSF) policy, 2015, which offers improved fiscal terms to enhance Oil and gas production and reduce import dependency of the country.\nThese fields were offered through a transparent international competitive bidding process. The bidding was open to all, including National Oil Companies (i.e. ONGC and OIL) and other central and state PSUs.\nThe\u00a0Hydrocarbon Exploration and Licensing Policy (HELP) replaced the previous licensing format (NELP) which was already in place for 18 years.\nThe New Exploration Licensing Policy (NELP) had issued separate licenses to different types of hydrocarbons, whereas HELP covered all hydrocarbons such as oil, gas, coal bed methane, etc.\nCurrently, there are three Operational Exploration Blocks (Approximately 1461 sq km), under the Production Sharing Contract System in Tamil Nadu where hydrocarbon exploration is going on.\nUnder the Nomination regime, 31 Mining leases (approximately 3500 sq km) have been granted in the State from where 600 tonnes of Oil and 30 lakhs cubic meters of Natural Gas are produced per day.\nTo date, more than 700 wells have been drilled for the extraction of Oil and Gas in Tamil Nadu.\nNeduvasal Hydrocarbon Project: Who are the protestors?\n\nThe villagers along with students, environmental activists, and farmers of Neduvasal, resorted to fasting at four centres across the district as a protest against the upcoming Hydrocarbon project.\nThe movement gained momentum when it attracted several people from the nearby villages to voice their support for the cause of the farmers.\nThe protest got support from social media.\nResidents of Vadakadu, where ONGC had sunk an exploratory well but abandoned the project, joined the protests.\nPolitical leaders and film personalities like Samathuva Makkal Katchi leader Sarath Kumar, film directors Pandiraj and Thangar Bachan, DMK MLAs C. Ve. Meyyanathan, S. Ragupathy, and Durai Chandrasekaran expressed their wholesome support to the protest.\nThe state had witnessed similar protests in Thanjavur and Tiruvarur districts in the Cauvery Delta region from 2011 against the coal bed methane and shale gas extraction project\u2014 for extracting methane gas using hydraulic fracturing\u2014 leading the Centre to scrap the project in November 2016.\nNeduvasal Hydrocarbon Project: What is the mode of protest?\nA large contingent of students from Chennai, Erode, Namakkal and Pudukkottai districts took part in a fast at Neduvasal village.\nSimilar fasting protests were held in Thilagar Thidal, Nallandarkollai and Kottaikadu villages.\nA group of activists from \u2018Thaneer\u2019 (an organization based in Tiruchi) took out a bike rally to Neduvasal to express their opposition to the project. But they were arrested by the police before reaching the destination place.\nNeduvasal Hydrocarbon Project: What are the reasons put forward by the protestors?\nThis hydrocarbon project would pose severe environmental problems and adversely affect the livelihood of farmers in and around Neduvasal.\nThe farmers also claimed that the fertility of the land would be affected.\nThere is also apprehension regarding the lowering of groundwater levels.\nThe displacement of the habitation of the people in the village.\nThe villagers also fear that this project may disturb the interface of the seawater and groundwater which may later result in the intrusion of saline water into the freshwater sources.\nThere may be no agricultural activity while the hydrocarbon exploration is on. The villagers in and around Neduvasal are completely dependent on agriculture for their livelihood and this may seriously affect their life pattern.\nThe government didn\u2019t have any information related to the exact location of hydrocarbon exploration and there is no clarity in how the crude oil will be extracted.\nWhat are the possible advantages of the Neduvasal Hydrocarbon Project?\nThis is a major step towards self-sufficiency in crude oil production.\nThe Government of India aims to use the Hydrocarbon Exploration and Licensing Policy (HELP) to reduce India\u2019s crude imports by 10% by 2022.\nIt aims to net revenue of Rs 9,300 crore from this project out of which the state is expected to get Rs 5,000 crore.\nThis project is believed to pass economic benefits to the State and its people in the form of royalty, VAT, additional employment generation and economic development as per the petroleum ministry.\nWhat are the assurances given by the authorities about the extraction process?\nThe extraction of Oil and Gas from sub-surface is a well-established practice and the Exploration and Production industry uses state-of-the-art technology for operations and takes maximum care for environmental effects.\nThe operators also get an Environment Impact Assessment done before carrying out any drilling activities and other activities.\nThe process of drilling and production requires a very limited surface land area (120X120 square meters) which will not affect agriculture or the soil of the entire lease area.\nAdditionally, operators are required to follow strict environmental norms for the use of operational land.\nThe oil and gas extraction is being carried out from deeper earth areas (more than 1000m) and thus doesn\u2019t affect groundwater aquifers which are located at much shallower levels.\nHydrocarbon extraction method is being used worldwide which has not seen any direct impact on water resources of the mining area.\nWhile drilling for oil and gas, cement casing is used; hence, there is no impact on groundwater as such.\nSummary\nNeduvasal, a fertile village of the Cauvery delta bordering Pudukottai and Thanjavur districts, is one of the 31 contract areas of small fields where exploration of hydrocarbons is to be taken up as per a recent decision of the Cabinet Committee on Economic Affairs.\nVillagers claim that no information has been given to them on the project so far. They are apprehensive that the project would lead to a depletion of the water table and deprive them of their livelihood.\nChief Minister Edappadi K Palaniswami gave assurances that any project which negatively affects farmers would not be allowed in the State.\n\nThe Neduvasal Hydrocarbon Project highlights the broader national and global debate on fossil fuel dependency, energy policy, and sustainable development. It underscores the challenges of balancing energy security with environmental sustainability and local community welfare, a dynamic seen in many parts of the world where local resources are tapped to meet national or global energy demands.\n\nArticle by: Priyanka Sunil"

India is used to trade with foreign nations even in BC.\n\nThe Periplus of the Erythraean Sea is a document (written by an anonymous sailor from Alexandria about AD 100) describing trade between countries, including India.\n\nSince 1498, Europeans have traded with the rulers of India using the sea route. The main export items then were spices like pepper, ginger, cinnamon, cardamom, nutmeg, mace, and cloves.\n\nFrom 1947-1991, the Indian economy remained largely as a closed economy. High taxes were levied on the import of items. Foreign investments like FDI were restricted.\n\nHowever, after the liberalization in 1991, foreign trade improved significantly.\n\nAlso read: India\u2019s Free Trade Agreements \u2013 The \u2018present\u2019 and the \u2018future\u2019\n\nExports and Imports\n\nNow, India exports around 7500 commodities to about 190 countries, and imports around 6000 commodities from 140 countries. Exports and Imports are not only restricted to commodities (merchandise). Service is also a major export/import item.\n\nTo make it simple, let\u2019s summarise foreign trade of India as below:\n\nExport of goods (merchandise/commodities)\nExport of services\nImport of goods (merchandise/commodities)\nImport of services\nBalance of Trade (BoT)\n\nBalance of Trade (BoT) is also known as Trade Balance.\n\nBalance of Trade (Merchandise) = Export of goods \u2013 Import of goods\n\nBalance of Trade (Services) = Export of services \u2013 Import of services\n\nNote: In general, if someone mentions Balance of Trade, he/she is intending only the Balance of Trade (Merchandise)\n\nExports of India: Facts You Need to Know\nTop Export Items: Petroleum products, precious stones, drug formulations & biologicals, gold, and other precious metals are the top exported commodities.\nIndia\u2019s merchandise exports are less than its merchandise imports.\nStill, India\u2019s merchandise trade balance has improved from 2009-14 to 2014-19 although most of the improvement in the latter period was on account of a more than fifty percent decline in crude prices in 2016-17.\nImports of India: Facts you need to know\nTop Import Items: Crude petroleum, gold, petroleum products, coal, coke & briquettes constitute top import items.\nIndia\u2019s service exports are more than its service imports. This means that India has a net service surplus.\nHowever, India\u2019s net services surplus has been steadily declining in relation to GDP.\nNow, India\u2019s service surplus finances about 50 percent of the merchandise deficit (the trade balance).\nTop Trading Partners of India\n\nIndia\u2019s top five trading partners continue to be the USA, China, UAE, Saudi Arabia, and Hong Kong.\n\nTop 10 Export Commodities\nPetroleum Products\nPearl, Precious, Semiprecious Stones\nDrug Formulations, Biologicals\nGold and Other Precious Metal Jewellery\nIron and Steel\nElectric Machinery and equipment\nOrganic Chemicals\nRMG Cotton including Accessories\nMotor Vehicles/ Cars\nMarine Products\nTop 10 Countries to which India exports the most\nU S A\nUAE\nChina PRP\nHong Kong\nSingapore\nUnited Kingdom\nNetherland\nGermany\nBangladesh PR\nNepal\nService Exports: Top Services\n\nThe composition of service exports has remained largely unchanged over the years.\n\nSoftware services constitute the bulk of it at around 40-45 percent, followed by business services at about 18-20 percent, travel at 11-14 percent, and transportation at 9-11 percent.\n\nAlso read: Export Preparedness Index\n\nTop 10 Import Commodities\nPetroleum: Crude\nGold\nPetroleum Products\nCoal, Coke Briquettes, etc.\nPearl, Precious, Semiprecious Stones\nElectronic Components\nTelecom Instruments\nOrganic Chemicals\nIndustrial Machinery for Dairy etc.\nIron and Steel\nTop 10 Countries from which India imports the most\nChina PRP\nUSA\nUAE\nSaudi Arabia\nIraq\nSwitzerland\nHong Kong\nKorea RP\nSingapore\nIndonesia\nService Imports: Top Services\n\nOver the years, service imports in relation to GDP have been steadily rising putting pressure on BoP to worsen.\n\nHowever, the increase in service imports to GDP ratio is inevitable given a rising level of FDI and a gradual upscaling of the Make in India program.\n\nBusiness Services, Travel, and Transportation are the three top service imports.\n\nBalance of Payments (BoP)\n\nBalance of Payments (BoP) statistics systematically summarise, for a specific period, the economic transactions of an economy with the rest of the world.\n\nThe compilation and dissemination of BoP data is the prime responsibility of RBI.\n\nBoP = net credit in ( Current Account + Capital Account and Financial Account).\n\nIndia\u2019s Balance of Payments (BoP) position witnessed great improvement since liberalization in 1991.\n\nIndia\u2019s foreign reserves stood at US$ 572 billion as on November 2020.\n\nForeign Exchange (Forex) Reserves include Foreign Currency Assets, Gold,\u00a0 Special Drawing Rights (SDRs), and Reserve Position in the IMF (Gold Tranche or Reserve Tranche).\n\nGlobal Trade\n\nGlobal Trade was growing at 5.7 percent in 2017. However, in 2019-20, it is estimated to grow only at 1.0 percent.\n\nEase of Doing Business: Performance of India\n\nIndia now ranks 68 out of the 190 countries under the indicator \u201cTrading across Borders\u201d in the Ease of Doing Business Report published by the World Bank. (2019)\n\nLogistics Industry in India\n\nThe logistics industry of India is currently estimated to be around US$ 160 billion and is expected to reach US$ 215 billion by 2020.\n\nNet Remittances from Indians employed overseas\n\nNet Remittances are part of the Current Account in the Balance of Payments statement published by RBI.\n\nNet remittances from Indians employed overseas have been constantly increasing year after year.\n\nFDI Inflows and FPI Inflows\n\nFDI and FPI are showing a positive trend in recent years.\n\nExternal Debt\n\nAfter witnessing a significant decline from 2014-15, India\u2019s external liabilities (debt and equity) to GDP increased at the end of June 2019 primarily driven by an increase in FDI, portfolio flows, and external commercial borrowings (ECBs).\n\nExternal debt as of the end of September 2019 remains low at 20.1 percent of GDP.\n\nForeign Trade Policy of India\n\nThe Foreign Trade Policy, 2015-20,\u00a0 notified by the Central Government, is an exercise of powers conferred under Section 5 of the Foreign Trade (Development & Regulation) Act, 1992 OR FT (D&R) Act.\n\nWho regulates Export Trade in India?\n\nExport trade is regulated by the Directorate General of Foreign Trade (DGFT) and its regional offices, functioning under the Ministry of Commerce and Industry, Department of Commerce, Government of India.\n\nPolicies and procedures required to be followed for exports from India are announced by the DGFT, from time to time.\n\nAlso read: Non-Tariff Barriers to Trade;\u00a0India\u2019s trade deficit\n\nUPSC Question based on International Trade of India\n\n[Question UPSC CSE 2020]\u00a0 With reference to the international trade of India at present, which of the following statements is/are correct?\n1) India\u2019s merchandise exports are less than its merchandise imports.\n2) India\u2019s imports of iron and steel, chemicals, fertilizers, and machinery have decreased in recent years,\n3) India\u2019s exports of services are more than its imports of services.\n4) India suffers from an overall trade/current account deficit.\n\nSelect the correct answer using the code given below:\n\n(a) 1 and 2 only\n(b) 2 and 4 only\n(c) 3 only\n(d) 1, 3 and 4 only\n\nAnswer: (d) 1, 3 and 4 only\n\nLearning Zone: The merchandise trade deficit is the largest component of India\u2019s Current Account Deficit (CAD). As per RBI\u2019s data, India\u2019s merchandise exports are higher than that of imports. Hence statement 1 is correct\n\nCommodity-wise composition of imports shows that imports of iron and steel, organic chemicals, and industrial machinery have registered positive growth rates as % of share imports. Hence statement 2 is incorrect.\n\nAs you learned in this article, India\u2019s net services (service exports \u2013 service imports) have been in surplus. Hence statement 3 is correct.\n\nTrade Deficit is usually taken as the difference between the exports of goods minus the import of goods. Current Account Deficit (CAD) denotes the net export of goods, services, and transfer payments. India has both a Balance of Trade Deficit as well as a Current Account Deficit (CAD). Hence statement 4 is correct. Therefore, the correct answer is (d) 1, 3, and 4 only."

But,\u00a0official reserve transactions are more relevant under a regime of pegged exchange rates than when exchange rates are floating.\n\nA country is said to be in balance of payments equilibrium when the sum of its current account and its non-reserve capital account equals zero so that the current account balance is financed entirely by international lending without reserve movements.\n\nNote:\u00a0A BOP surplus is accompanied by an accumulation of\u00a0foreign exchange reserves by the central bank.\n\nAlso read: Internationalisation of Rupee\n\nIdeally, BoP should be Zero! How?\n\nFrom a balance of international payments point of view, a surplus on the current account would allow a deficit to be run on the capital account. For example, surplus foreign currency can be used to fund investment in assets located overseas. Also, if a country has a current account deficit (trade deficit), it will borrow from abroad.\n\nIn reality, the accounts do not exactly offset each other, because of statistical discrepancies, accounting conventions and exchange rate movements that change the recorded value of transactions.\n\nHow is the Balance of Payments Calculated?\n\nThe sum of the current account and capital account indicates the overall balance, which could either be in surplus or in deficit.\n\nBalance of Payments is the net credit in Current Account and Capital Account.\n\nBoP = net credit in ( Current Account + Capital Account and Financial Account).\n\nBoP Deficit or Surplus\nThe decrease (increase) in official reserves is called the overall balance of payments deficit (surplus).\nThe balance of payments deficit or surplus is obtained after adding the current and capital account balances.\nThe balance of payments surplus will be considered as an addition to official reserves (reserve use).\nBoP Crisis\nCountries with current account deficits can run into difficulties. If the deficit is large and the economy is not able to attract enough inflows of foreign investment, then their currency reserves will dwindle.\nThere may come a point when the country needs to seek emergency borrowing from institutions such as the International Monetary Fund, that may lead to external debt.\nCountries with deficits in their current accounts will build up increasing debt and/or see increased foreign ownership of their assets.\nBoP crisis is also known as the currency crisis.\nAutonomous Transactions vs\u00a0\u00a0Accommodating Transactions\nInternational economic transactions are called autonomous when transactions are made independently of the state of the BoP (for instance due to profit motive).\nThese items are called \u2018above the line\u2019 items in the BoP.\nThe balance of payments is said to be in surplus (deficit) if autonomous receipts are greater (less) than autonomous payments.\nAccommodating transactions (termed \u2018below the line\u2019 items), on the other hand, are determined by the net consequences of the autonomous items, that is, whether the BoP is in surplus or deficit.\nThe official reserve transactions are seen as the accommodating item in the BoP (all others being autonomous).\nErrors and Omissions\n\nErrors and Omissions constitute the third element in the BoP (apart from the current and capital accounts) which is the \u2018balancing item\u2019 reflecting our inability to record all international transactions accurately.\n\nBoT\u00a0vs BoP\n\nThe balance of Trade (BoT) or Trade Balance is a part of the Balance of Payments (BoP). BoT just includes the balance between export and import of goods.\nBoP not only adds the service-trade but also many other components in the current account (Eg: Transfer payments) and capital account (FDI, loans etc).\n\nRead: India\u2019s trade deficit\n\nRupee Convertibility\n\nThe Indian rupee is fully convertible only in the current account and not in the capital account.\n\nBoP: Latest Convention (BPM6 format)\n\nThe BoP can be broadly divided into two accounts namely, (a) current account, and (b) capital and financial account.\n\nThe current account measures the transfer of real resources (goods, services, income and transfers) between an economy and the rest of the world.\n\nThe capital and financial account reflect the net changes in financial claims on the rest of the world.\n\nThe current account is further subdivided into a merchandise account and an Invisibles account. The merchandise account consists of transactions relating to exports and imports of goods. In the invisible account, there are three broad categories namely, (a) non-factor services such as travel, transportation, insurance and miscellaneous services; (b) transfers which do not involve any value in exchange, and (c) income which includes compensation of employees and investment income.\n\nThe capital account can be broadly broken up into two categories namely, (a) non-debt flows such as direct and portfolio investments, and (b) debt flows such as external assistance, commercial borrowings, non-resident deposits, etc.\n\nThe sum of the current account and capital account indicates the overall balance, which could either be in surplus or in deficit.\n\nThe movement in overall balance is reflected in changes in the international reserves of the country.\n\nThings to note:\nBalance of Payments (BoP) statistics systematically summarise, for a specific period, the economic transactions of an economy with the rest of the world.\nThe compilation and dissemination of BoP data is the prime responsibility of RBI.\nIf an Indian investor earns interest or dividend in his investment abroad, that will be included in the current account of India.\nIf FDI is made by an American company in India, that investment will be accounted in the capital account of India.\nNRI deposits are calculated under Capital Accounts while Private Remittances are calculated under Current Account.\nIn general, National Income (Y) = Private Consumption Expenditure (C) + Investment (I) + Government Expenditure (G) + Net Exports (E).\nIn a closed economy, Savings (S) = Investment (I).\nIn an open economy, Savings (S) = Investment (I) + Net Exports (E)\nOR, Net Exports = Savings \u2013 Investment. This is actually the Balance of Trade (Trade Balance)."

Trade without barriers \u2013 free trade \u2013 is promoted by institutions like the World Trade Organisation (WTO). In this background, \u00a0as an emerging superpower, India\u2019s Free Trade Agreements deserve special attention.\n\nIn this article, let us analyze some of the Free Trade Agreements (FTAs) signed by India and some of the new/proposed FTAs.\n\nTable of Contents\n\nWhat are Free Trade Agreements (FTA)?\nIndia- ASEAN Free Trade Agreement\nEconomic Perspective\nChallenges in India-ASEAN Free Trade Agreement\nIndia and RCEP\nAdvantages for India\nChallenges for India\nSouth Asia Free Trade Agreement (SAFTA)\nIndia-European Union Free Trade Agreement (Proposed)\nFuture of the Free Trade Agreements and India\u2019s stand on them\nWhat are Free Trade Agreements (FTA)?\n\nA Free Trade Agreement is an agreement between countries to reduce or eliminate trade barriers. Trade barriers include tariff barriers like taxes and nontariff barriers like regulatory laws.\n\nTrade barriers\u00a0include tariff barriers like taxes and nontariff barriers like regulatory laws.\n\nA Free Trade Agreement or FTA is an agreement between two or more countries where the countries agree on certain obligations that affect trade in goods and services, and protections for investors and intellectual property rights, among other topics.\n\nIndia- ASEAN Free Trade Agreement\nRecently, India and The Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) completed 25 years of cooperation and partnership.\nWith the initiation of economic reforms in India from 1991 onwards, the then government initiated the \u2018Look East Policy\u2019 which was particularly focused on Southeast Asia and East Asia.\nThe successive governments rigorously implemented the policy. With the regime change in 2014, there was an upgrade of the \u2018Look East Policy\u2019 to the \u2018Act East Policy\u2019.\nThe India-ASEAN relationship and ties go way back in history. Culturally, Southeast Asia has borrowed heavily from India and there were even Indian kings who went to Southeast Asian lands and established new dynasties there.\nWith the end of the colonization era, slowly the ties between India and ASEAN started to develop yet again.\nThere was increasing contact between people and this led to a rise in exchanges and even economically.\nLook East Policy was a game-changer and after that, there has been no looking back and only growth of relations between the two regions.\nEconomic Perspective\nThe Economic relation is a pillar on which the two region\u2019s partnership rests. In this context, with the enforcement of the \u2018Look East Policy\u2019 there were growing trade relations in goods and investments. After the India-ASEAN free trade agreement was created in 2003, trade relations boomed even further.\nIn 2009, the Free Trade Agreement in Goods was signed and enacted in 2010. The ASEAN-India Free Trade Area (AIFTA) has been completed with the entry into force of the ASEAN-India Agreements on Trade in Service and Investments on 1 July 2015. With this, India will stand to gain as it has always asked for an FTA that will be more comprehensive and include services which has been India\u2019s stronger sector.\nThe ASEAN nations and India together consist of one of the largest economic regions with a total population of about 1.8 billion. ASEAN is currently India\u2019s fourth largest trading partner, accounting for 10.2 per cent of India\u2019s total trade. India, on the other hand, is ASEAN\u2019s 7th\u00a0largest trading partner.\nIndia\u2019s service-oriented economy perfectly complements the manufacturing-based economies of the ASEAN countries. The annual trade between India and ASEAN stood at approximately US$ 76.53 billion in 2014-15. However, it dropped to US$ 65.04 billion in 2015-16 due to declining commodity prices against the backdrop of a sluggish global economy.\nInvestment flows are quite remarkable both ways, with ASEAN accounting for approximately 12.5 per cent of investment flows into India since 2000. Singapore is the primary hub for both inward and outward investments.\u00a0Foreign direct investment (FDI) inflows into India from ASEAN between April 2000 and May 2016 were about US$49.40 billion. FDI outflows from India to ASEAN countries, from April 2007 to March 2015, according to data from the Department of Economic Affairs (DEA), was about US$38.672 billion.\nTo enhance economic and strategic relations with the Southeast Asian countries, the Indian government has put in place a Project Development Fund to set up manufacturing hubs in Cambodia, Myanmar, Laos, and Vietnam(CMLV) countries through separate Special Purpose Vehicles (SPVs).\nChallenges in India-ASEAN Free Trade Agreement\n\nEven though the Trade Agreement with ASEAN has helped trade grow immensely with India, still, the issue remains that the agreement has benefitted the ASEAN region more than India.\n\n\ud83d\udc49 Which year are YOU targeting for success in the IAS/IPS/IFS Exam? \ud83d\ude80\n\n(1) \u21d2 UPSC 2025: Prelims cum Mains\n\n(2) \u21d2 UPSC 2026: Prelims cum Mains\n\n(3) \u21d2 UPSC 2027 Prelims cum Mains\n\nTip: Know more about ClearIAS Courses (Online/Offline)\n\nWith the agreement on goods signed, the domestic markets have faced stiff competition because they have to compete with the cheaper goods of the ASEAN region.\nFor example, the rubber imports from Malaysia, and palm oil imports from Indonesia have made it a tough ordeal for the local manufacturers of palm oil and rubber, especially the rubber plantations of Kerala who have complained about the cheaper imports ever since the agreement was about to be signed.\nThe other drawback of the agreement is that the agreement in services hasn\u2019t reaped many benefits for India. According to ASEAN rules, until all the nations have ratified the FTAs in their Legislatures, the FTA will not be enforced.\nThis has caused much trouble for India as the Philippines hasn\u2019t ratified the FTA in services there will be direct competition between India and the Philippines in direct competition in services which would be a disadvantage for the latter.\nOver the years, with the statistics and trade figures, it can be easily deciphered that the trade imbalance in favour of ASEAN and India has an expanding trade deficit with the region which dearly hurts its Current Account Deficit and thus, hurts India\u2019s overall financial.\nIndia and RCEP\n\nRegional Comprehensive Economic Partnership, also known as RCEP is a mega trade block that is being negotiated between the ten members of the ASEAN group and six other members namely South Korea, Australia, China, Japan, New Zealand, and India.\n\nIt is a Free Trade Agreement (FTA) that is being proposed amongst these nations which will include goods and services, investments, intellectual property rights, economic and technical cooperation, and dispute settlement.\nIf negotiated and enforced, it will be one of the largest trading blocs in the world. With a combined Gross Domestic Product of almost $17 trillion and covering more than 40 per cent of the world\u2019s trade. It also covers more than 3 billion people.\nThe bloc aims at tariff liberalization amongst the nations and so, there will be easier market access amongst all the nations amongst themselves.\n\nAlso read: Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership (RCEP) \u2013 Will it counter TPP?\n\nAdvantages for India\nFor India, which is not a part of the other major trade blocs of the world, such as Asia Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC), and the Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP), this free trade agreement would prove to be of advantage as earlier it was feared that with the presence of these trade blocs and the negotiation of their FTAs, India might lose out its market share, especially in case of textiles, pharmaceuticals and medicines etc. to other Southeast Asian nations like Vietnam.\nAlso, with India already having an FTA with ASEAN Japan, and South Korea, with the negotiation of the RCEP, it will complement India\u2019s pre-existing FTAs and will allow better access to consumer markets in other nations.\nWith the FTA being negotiated even in services, it will add to the advantage for India where they have a comparative advantage over other nations, especially in the context of Information Technology related services, healthcare services, and educational services.\nChallenges for India\nThe agricultural sector of India, which faces issues like lack of investment, low productivity, obsolete technology, and fragmented landholdings will suffer even more as with the negotiation of the RCEP agreement, now, the Indian market will be flooded with products from other nations which are comparatively cheaper and have a more efficient agricultural sector.\nThe already negotiated FTA with ASEAN has hurt the interests of some particular communities such as rubber plantations and palm oil production. Also, the allied sectors, such as the dairy sector in India, which still is not at a mature stage, will face stiff competition from countries like New Zealand which has a very strong dairy sector and their economy thrives on the same.\nAlso, the industrial sector of India is still in a nascent stage. In the context of goods, India has already given up on a three-tier tariff reduction proposal that would offer different coverage for ASEAN, Japan, and South Korea and a much lower level of tariff reduction coverage for Australia, China, and New Zealand.\nWith the agreement on the intellectual property rights to be negotiated, which is being pressurized by Japan, this will lead to the issue that India may lose its status as the pharmaceutical hub of the world. Agreeing to data exclusivity, extending patenting terms and unduly strong enforcement measures will weaken the generic pharmaceutical sector and will come in direct conflict with section 3(d) of the Indian Patents Act.\nThis will make medicines expensive and inaccessible not just for Indians but for the entire developing world. India has already resisted pressure not succumbing to dilute the provisions of the European Union and the FTA to be proposed with the same. Thus, diluting the measures in this context might again open a Pandora\u2019s box for India.\nAlso, in the case of the services sector, where India is assuming and pitching for gains, it remains to be seen whether it will duly gain or not. India is pitching for Mode 3 and Mode 4 type gains. With Mode 4 types of gains highly unlikely to be awarded, in the context of Mode 3, except in the case of Information Technology and Information Technology Enabled Services, it remains to be seen whether it will benefit India much or not.\nFinally, to conclude, the FTA will pose a big challenge to the \u2018Make in India\u2019 program which the current government is aggressively promoting. For example, the granting of tariff-free access to Chinese goods, which have already flooded the Indian markets and have decimated the Indian goods and markets will further aggravate the situation and add to increase the budget deficit with China.\nSouth Asia Free Trade Agreement (SAFTA)\n\nSouth Asian Association for Regional Cooperation or SAARC, as it is known, is a region comprising of all the South-Asian nations or the subcontinent i.e. India, Pakistan, Sri Lanka, Bangladesh, Nepal, Bhutan, and the other two countries namely Afghanistan and Maldives. It was conceived to improve the interrelationships between the nations and improve people-to-people contact as all the people are united culturally but divided by the borders.\nIn this context, the concept of the South-Asia Free Trade Agreement or SAFTA was conceived for the first time in 1993 as a Preferential Trade Agreement ( an agreement amongst the nations to trade selected goods without tariffs or with very low tariffs) and later, it was upgraded to a Free Trade Agreement in 2004 and came into force in 2006. This was done to improve trade and economic relations amongst the member nations of SAARC.\nWith the classification of nations as Least Developing Countries and Non-Least Developing Countries, there was a creation of an equal platform for all the players in the region so that the Free Trade Agreement would not lead to issues for the domestic markets.\nHowever, despite more than ten years after the enactment of the FTA, the trade growth amongst the member nations is meagre. This puts a question mark on the concept of the creation of an FTA in the region. Because of the geopolitical scenario of the subcontinent, there have always been contentious issues among the neighbours. For example, India and Pakistan have always had their differences and their relationship becomes the elephant in the room in case of any summit and negotiations to be done. Also, the proximity of Pakistan to China has added to the troubles.\nOther smaller nations have also played the China card again and again against India which has led to a void in the confidence among the nations. The trade amongst the nations is so poor that it comprises only five per cent of the total trade of the nations.\nThe clause of \u2018sensitive list\u2019 has also hurt trade prospects which each nation apprehensive of losing out on its domestic industry as compared to the other nations and thus, has included quite a many of the list of goods and services to be traded in the sensitive list. When included in the list, the products become immune from tariff concession.\nIndia-European Union Free Trade Agreement (Proposed)\nIndia-European Union (EU) FTA, officially known as the Broad-Based Trade and Investment Agreement has been negotiated for quite a while. However, in 2013, there was a breakdown in talks between the two sides and the talks have been stalled ever since. The European Union wants India to reduce the import duties on alcohol and automobiles and India wants the EU to declare India as a \u2018data secure\u2019 country.\nAlso, in 2016, India unilaterally terminated Bilateral Investment Treaties with many countries across the world, with many of them being European nations. This has added to the increased scepticism of the nations who have question marks over the future investments to be made in India.\nThe reason why the Bilateral treaties have been terminated is that India has put forward its condition of exhausting all the judicial and litigation measures available in the country first and then only going for international litigation or arbitration. The 2016 Model Indian Bilateral Investment Treaty requires the foreign investor to litigate for at least five years in the national courts before approaching the international tribunal.\nIn contrast, the EU and Canada had put forward the idea of an Investor-State Dispute Mechanism at the global level in which the foreign investors in a country can drag the government to the international arbitration centres without exhausting the local litigation means and claim huge losses citing losses they suffered due to various reasons, including policy changes. This has been summarily rejected by India, Argentina as well and Japan. Japan has been opposing it because international arbitration will involve huge costs whereas India wants the foreign investors to exhaust the national judicial remedies and then only go for international arbitration.\nFuture of the Free Trade Agreements and India\u2019s stand on them\n\nThe unilateral termination of the BITs with so many nations should be reviewed, especially when India is being projected as a bright spot in the global economy.\n\nThe move comes as a regressive step as it increases the confusion of the foreign investors who wish to invest in India. Also, the clause which says at least five years of national litigation is necessary after which the international tribunals can be approached looks like a step in the wrong direction.\n\nThis goes against the government\u2019s slogan of \u2018More Governance, Less Government\u2019 and against the concept of \u2018Ease of Doing Business\u2019 in the nation.\n\nRegarding the FTAs, India should be very careful in the clauses of negotiation. Despite having a strong services sector in a select few categories, ( IT, ITES, Healthcare and Education, etc.) the agricultural sector as well as the industrial sector, especially the Micro, Small, and Medium Scale Enterprises are still not as mature and strong as compared to the other countries with which India is negotiating FTAs.\n\nFor the sake of gaining an advantage in the services sector and access to foreign markets in services, which are also not completely accessible because of the nation\u2019s reservations, India ends up compromising on the primary and secondary sectors which affects too many livelihoods and the economy overall.\n\nThus, the negotiations at an international level should be done only after proper deliberation and understanding of the situation.\n\nAlso read: Foreign Trade of India: Concepts of International Trade\n\nArticle by: Aadarsh Clerk"

Hence it benefits Indian companies to raise funds via issuing Masala Bonds.\nIt helps to internationalize the Indian rupee as international investors become more familiar with the Indian rupee, the Indian economy, and its growth prospects.\nThere will be a fall in foreign currency-denominated external commercial borrowings (ECB) with an increase in the popularity of masala bonds. This will create a favorable position in the debt market concerning exchange risks.\nIt\u2019ll help in the development of domestic bond markets due to competition from overseas investors. This, in turn, will create a new venue for retail investors.\nIssues\nAccording to Moody, the sustainability of financing via Masala Bonds is a challenge as investors are expected to be cautious in taking on currency risks from emerging markets.\nFurther, periodical rate cuts by RBI have made Masala Bonds less appealing to investors.\nThe possibility of higher\u00a0taxes\u00a0also has undermined the utility of the instrument.\nExchange rate risks are still borne by the issuing economy if foreign investors redeem their holdings of Indian masala bonds in bulk due to reasons such as changing international interest rates or deteriorating macroeconomic fundamentals in India.

An increase in secondary trading will happen when the number of issuances increases. This will help in setting a benchmark for future deals.\n\nHowever, experts warn that too much reliance on external debt even in rupees can impact our rating by global agencies.

Planning involves the creation and maintenance of a\u00a0plan. In the Indian economy context, the \u00a0major plan we talk about is the Five Year Plan (FYP). The agency which formulates the FYP is Planning Commission which is chaired by Prime Minister of India.\n\nFYP are visionary plans for a 5 year period.

Growth in economic terms corresponds to the increase in GDP (national income). [GDP is the money value of goods and services produced in an economy. So, in layman\u2019s terms, growth means more money. Wow! that\u2019s simple, right?] So how can a country grow, or increase its national income?\n\nThe above question cannot be solved with a one-word answer. Had that been the case, our Honorable finance ministers would have been always enjoying a pleasure tenure. A country cannot increase its national income by printing currencies or borrowing money from abroad.\n\nFormer Prime Minister Manmohan Singh once said, \u201cMoney does not grow on trees\u201d. For a country to grow, it has to produce more goods and services. For that purpose, the optimum utilization of resources within the boundaries of the nation is essential. Of course, the funds can come from abroad (foreign investment), but without proper utilization of resources in a country, there cannot be sustainable growth.\n\nGrowth and Development\n\nWhen the national income increases (growth), ideally it should result in development (qualitative aspect \u2013 like health, education, employment etc.). There can also be cases when growth does not percolate to the bottom of the pyramid \u2013 non inclusive growth \u2013 that will not result in the development of weaker sections of the society. For sustainable development, inclusive growth is a must.\n\n\ud83d\udc49 Which year are YOU targeting for success in the IAS/IPS/IFS Exam? \ud83d\ude80\n\n(1) \u21d2 UPSC 2025: Prelims cum Mains\n\n(2) \u21d2 UPSC 2026: Prelims cum Mains\n\n(3) \u21d2 UPSC 2027 Prelims cum Mains\n\nTip: Know more about ClearIAS Courses (Online/Offline)\n\nGrowth and Employment\n\nGrowth generates employment and employment generates further growth. In general, employment corresponds to the qualitative aspect of growth. If a country is on the growth trajectory, it will generate more employment opportunities and while the growth declines ( periods of recession), people start losing jobs.\n\nBack to the growth topic again\u2026\n\nHow to generate growth? What are the issues in growth, development and employment?\u00a0Is India growing? Are there issues with India\u2019s growth or development? \u2013 There should not be any doubt about the fact that India is growing. India is now growing at 5% per year. But the problem with India is that it was growing at near 9% three years back! So the growth has declined \u2013 That is the first issue with our growth.\n\nIssues in India\u2019s growth, development and employment:\nIndia\u2019s growth is declining. (currently at 5%).\nIndia\u2019s growth is largely contributed to by the service sector. There is stagnation in the manufacturing sector.\nIndian agriculture is still heavily dependent on monsoon. Nearly 50 % of the population dependent on agriculture which contributes only 14% of GDP.\nFor a country to grow, there should be investment in productive areas. There should also be supporting infrastructure. Currently India has issues in both.\nDue to external and internal factors, there is decline in foreign investment. This is widening our Current Account Deficit.\nFor providing welfare schemes, subsidies and defense expenditure, India is borrowing. The Fiscal Deficit of India is enlarging.\nIndia\u2019s export sector is not growing in accordance with the demands of import goods.\nGrowth is not entirely inclusive. There are still a significant portion of people below poverty line.\nThere are issues with employment too. Though the unemployment rate is in single digit now, most of the employment in India is disguised unemployment. (In agricultural sector). The average salary and per-capita income of Indians are very low.\n\n[Growth, Development and Employment: Specifically mentioned in\u00a0Civil Service Mains GS Paper 3.

Investment has slightly different meanings in economics and finance, but a combined definition can be as \u201cInvestment is the process of putting money in assets for increasing production or financial gains\u201c.\n\nYes,\u00a0investment is all about putting money in assets. And, the investment models speak about how to put the money in assets.\n\nTable of Contents\n\nUnderstanding Investment in Detail\nRelation between Investment and GDP:\nFactors affecting Investment\nInvestment Models for UPSC Mains Exam :\nProject Finance Schemes and Finance Models : Understanding Models\nInvestment Models in Relation With India\nDifferent Models of Investment and Planning related to India includes:\nFactors affecting Investment Sentiments\nMock questions on Investment Models for UPSC Mains\nUnderstanding Investment in Detail\n\n[Investment Models: Specifically mentioned in\u00a0Civil Service Mains GS Paper 3. It can also be asked for\u00a0Prelims\u00a0and\u00a0Interview]\n\nFor a first hand understanding on investment, consider it as putting money in banks deposits, shares of companies, real estate, gold, business or industry. For a country to grow (and generate employment opportunities to all), it should produce more goods and services, and hence investments in business, agriculture or industry or supporting infrastructure is highly appreciated.\n\nIf government has sufficient funds to invest in these areas, then it seems well and fine, but a nation like India with a Fiscal Deficit of 5.1% of GDP cannot ask Government to take care of all investment needs. The investment should come from private players too and that\u2019s a win-win situation for all!\n\nRelation between Investment and GDP:\n\nGDP, the measure of national income is given by the formula : GDP = C + I + G + NX, where C is the consumption expenditure, G is government spending, and NX is net exports, given by the difference between the exports and imports, X \u2212 M.\u00a0Thus investment, \u2018I\u2019 is everything that remains of total expenditure after consumption, government spending, and net exports are subtracted (i.e. I = GDP \u2212 C \u2212 G \u2212 NX). [I corresponds to gross investment.]\n\nFactors affecting Investment\n\nInvestment is a function of Income and Rate of Interest [I=f(Y,r)]. Higher the income, the more will be the investment; higher the rate of interest the lesser will be the investment.\n\n\ud83d\udc49 Which year are YOU targeting for success in the IAS/IPS/IFS Exam? \ud83d\ude80\n\n(1) \u21d2 UPSC 2025: Prelims cum Mains\n\n(2) \u21d2 UPSC 2026: Prelims cum Mains\n\n(3) \u21d2 UPSC 2027 Prelims cum Mains\n\nTip: Know more about ClearIAS Courses (Online/Offline)\n\nMore Income->More Savings->More Investment->More Income.\n\nAlso : No investment->No Growth->Poverty, Malnutrition, Unemployment etc.\n\nInvestment Models for UPSC Mains Exam :\n\nSo for more income, we need more investment. Which are the modes by which Investments can be attracted? Money for investing in productive assets can be from Public Sources (Government), Private Sources (Corporate) or Combined Sources (Public Private Partnership or PPP).\n\nThus one the basis of who invests in assets for increasing production, there are three major investment models.\n\nPublic Investment Model: For a government to invest, it needs revenue (mainly tax revenue), but the present tax revenues of India are not sufficient enough to meet the budgetary expenditure of India. So India cannot move ahead in the path of growth without private individuals; even for government to have a share in the investment, they need tax revenue from the private investors.\nPrivate Investment Model:\u00a0The private investment can come from India or abroad. If it\u2019s from abroad \u2013 they can be as FDI or FPI. (Details will be discussed later.) As India\u2019s Current Account Deficit is widening due to increased Oil Import, in this age of globalization, we cannot say NO to FDI or FPI.\u00a0Why private investment in India: For a country to grow and increase its income, the production has to be increased.\u00a0More goods and services has to be produced. Infrastructure to support production \u2013 transport, energy and communication \u2013 should also be developed.\u00a0But how can a nation with near 30% of population below poverty line, invest in production or infrastructure? Who has money to invest? Government?\nPublic Private Partnership Model: PPP means combining the best benefit from both public and private investments. Some of the Project Finance Schemes are as below:\n1. BOT (build\u2013operate\u2013transfer).\n2. BOOT (build\u2013own\u2013operate\u2013transfer).\n3. BOO (build\u2013own\u2013operate).\n4. BLT (build\u2013lease\u2013transfer).\n5. DBFO (design\u2013build\u2013finance\u2013operate).\n6. DBOT (design\u2013build\u2013operate\u2013transfer).\n7. DCMF (design\u2013construct\u2013manage\u2013finance).\n\nAgain, depending from where investment comes, there are two other investment models.\n\nDomestic Investment Model \u2013 It can be from Public, Private or PPP.\nForeign Investment Model \u2013 It can be 100% FDI or Foreign-Domestic Mix.\n\nAnd, depending on where the investment goes (or how investments are planned), there are various investment models. A few include:\n\nSector Specific Investment Models (In SEZ or MIZ etc).\nCluster Investment Model (Eg: Food Processing Industries)\nProject Finance Schemes and Finance Models : Understanding Models\n\nA road can be constructed by adopted different models. Let\u2019s analyze a few cases to understand the concept.\n\nCase 1: Government machinery and funds are directly used to construct a road. No\u00a0intermediaries\u00a0or third parties are involved. \u2014>Disadvantage: Government needs money to start the project.\nCase 2: A bid is placed for the road work contract. Usually a contractor or company with lowest bid gets the project. Government sanctions funds in part or full, depending upon the completion of stages.\nCase 3: Government spends no money from its pocket, but asks a company to construct the road. (No private firm will engage in constructing roads in a country unless they get returns for it \u2013 You know that!) Government offers to collect toll fees from the road for a fixed period of 10 or 15 years until they recover their cost and decent profit. \u2014> The benefit \u00a0of this approach is that without spending any amount from Government\u2019s pocket, the nation will get \u00a0a road. Toll charges in addition to tax paid is a matter of concern, but it\u2019s better than the case with no road or poor road with traffic congestion.\nInvestment Models in Relation With India\n\nHope it\u2019s clear by now that capital formation is necessary for any country to grow. But the process is not easy. The savings rate in India is now near 30%. Percapita Income of Indians is very low and hence the capital available for investing too is low. Investments should be studied from three angles \u2013 Households, Corporates and Government. Investments expect a return \u2013 be it from Government side or Private side. Though the return on investment in terms of profit or margin is the main motive behind investments, its effect on the welfare side and development should not be neglected. To add in the favorite terms of UPSC \u2013 investments should help in inclusive, sustainable development.\n\nDifferent Models of Investment and Planning related to India includes:\nHarrod Domar Model :\u00a0The model implies that economic growth depends on policies to increase investment, by increasing saving, and using that investment more efficiently through technological advances. It suggests that there is no natural reason for an economy to have balanced growth. It was more or less a One Sector Model. \u2014>Failed to attract investment on consumer goods in India as we lacked good capital goods industries.\nSolow Swan Model :\u00a0The neo-classical model was an extension to the 1946 Harrod\u2013Domar model that included a new term: productivity growth.\nFeldman\u2013Mahalanobis model :\u00a0\u00a0A high enough capacity in the capital goods sector in the long-run expands the capacity in the production of consumer goods.\u00a0Thus the essence of the model is a shift in the pattern of industrial investment towards building up a domestic consumption goods sector. It was a Two Sector Model which was later developed into Four Sector Model. Also known as Nehru-Mahalanobis model.\nRao ManMohan Model : Policy of Econmic Liberilization and FDI initiated in 1991 by Narasimha Rao and Dr.Manmohan Singh.\nLewis model of economic development by unlimited labour supply.\nInduced Investment Model.\nLeverage Investment Model.\nSaving led growth model. \u2014 Significance to India.\nDemand led growth model.\nConsumption led growth model.\nFactors affecting Investment Sentiments\nSavings Rate.\nTax Rate in the country. (Net income available after tax).\nInflation.\nRate of Interest in Banks.\nPossible Rate of Return on Capital.\nAvailability of other factors of production \u2013 cheap land, labour etc and supporting infrastructure \u2013 transport, energy and communication.\nMarket size and stability.\nInvestment friendly environment in the country (policies of the government).\nMock questions on Investment Models for UPSC Mains\nIndia\u2019s private-led overseas investment model has lessons for China. Discuss.\nCompare Gujarat model of development with Kerala model of development.\nWhat are Special Purpose Vehicles (SPVs)? Explain the significance in Indian context.\nAnalyze the scope of philanthropic investment models in Indian perspective.\n\nIf you have any comments, additions or relevant points regarding this article, please share them using the comment space below.

            "[CONTENT]": "At the time of independence\u00a0of India, there was a large proportion of impoverished people in the country. Poverty alleviation and improvement of life standards of people were the major considerations of the government.\n\nIndian economy needed a direction, which was crippled by foreign subjugation. India was still a geographic expression and a nation in making. Other than the spirit of the freedom struggle, factors required for binding the people were few.\n\nSo the then politicians and think tanks opted for a planned economy and a centralized planning body to formulate a plan for socio-economic development. Thus, planning commission came into existence in March 1950 through a cabinet resolution which became a permanent body of experts.\n\nTable of Contents\n\nAbout Planning Commission\nPlanning Commission of India (PC)\nFunctions and Responsibilities of the Planning Commission\nEvolution of Indian Planning\nPlanning Commission: Positives and Achievements\nPlanning Commission: Negatives and Problems\nWhy does India need a change from PC?\nAbout Planning Commission\n\nThe Planning Commission of India was set up by a Resolution of the Government of India in March 1950. Objectives of the government while starting PC were the following:\n\nPromote a rapid rise in the standard of living of the people by efficient exploitation of the resources of the country.\nIncrease production.\nOffer opportunities to all for employment in the service of the community.\nPlanning Commission of India (PC)\nPrime minister was the ex officio chairman of the planning commission assisted by a deputy chairman. It included 6 union cabinet ministers as its ex officio members. There was also a member secretary.\nThe planning commission was an autonomous body, which worked closely with union and state cabinets and had full knowledge of their policies. Institutionally it was a part of the cabinet organization and the \u2018demands for grants\u2019 for the PC was included in the budget for the cabinet secretariat.\nFunctions and Responsibilities of the Planning Commission\nMake\u00a0assessment of all resources of the country\nAugment\u00a0deficient resources\nFormulate\u00a0plans [Five Year Plans (FYP)] for the most effective and balanced utilization of resources and determining priorities.\nDetermine the stages of plan implementation\nDetermine the nature of machinery required.\nIndicate the factors which tend to retard economic developments.\nMonitor and evaluate.\nEvolution of Indian Planning\n\nThe first Five-year Plan was launched in 1951 and two subsequent five-year plans were formulated till 1965, when there was a break because of the Indo-Pakistan Conflict. Two successive years of drought, devaluation of the currency, a general rise in prices and erosion of resources disrupted the planning process and after three Annual Plans between 1966 and 1969, the fourth Five-year plan was started in 1969.\n\nThe Eighth Plan could not take off in 1990 due to the fast changing political situation at the Centre and the years 1990-91 and 1991-92 were treated as Annual Plans. The Eighth Plan was finally launched in 1992 after the initiation of structural adjustment policies.\n\nFor the first eight Plans the emphasis was on a growing public sector with massive investments in basic and heavy industries, but since the launch of the Ninth Plan in 1997, the emphasis on the public sector has become less pronounced and the current thinking on planning in the country, in general, is that it should increasingly be of an indicative nature.\n\n\ud83d\udc49 Which year are YOU targeting for success in the IAS/IPS/IFS Exam? \ud83d\ude80\n\n(1) \u21d2 UPSC 2025: Prelims cum Mains\n\n(2) \u21d2 UPSC 2026: Prelims cum Mains\n\n(3) \u21d2 UPSC 2027 Prelims cum Mains\n\nTip: Know more about ClearIAS Courses (Online/Offline)\n\nPlanning Commission: Positives and Achievements\nPC laid emphasis on infrastructure developments and capacity building. As a result, huge investments were made in education, energy, industry, railways and irrigation.\nIndia became self-sufficient in agriculture and made great progress in capital sector goods and consumer sector goods.\nPC introduced many remarkable concepts like nationalisation, green revolution etc and transformed itself to align with new concepts like liberalisation, privatisation and inclusion.\nPlanning commission made great emphasis on social justice, governance, employment generation, poverty alleviation, health and skill development.\nThe transformation of India from a poor to an emerging economic power is credited to the orderly and phased manner in which planning was implemented.\nPlanning Commission: Negatives and Problems\n\nThere were many issues with planning methods followed in India. The drawbacks of the planning adopted via PC includes:\n\nNo structural mechanism for regular engagement with states.\nIneffective forum for the resolution of centre-state and inter-ministerial issues.\nInadequate capacity expertise and domain knowledge; weak networks with think tanks and lack of access to expertise outside government.\nFailed to implement land reforms.\nIt was a toothless body, was not able to make union/states/UTs answerable for not achieving the targets.\nDesigned plans with \u2018one size fit for all\u2019 approach. Hence, many plans failed to show tangible results.\nWeak implementation, monitoring and evaluation.\nWhy does India need a change from PC?\nThe contemporary world is governed by constitutional ethos like federalism rather than centralisation.\nIndias population has almost tripled to 121 Cr, and many of the Indian states are as big as European nations.\nIndian economy has expanded from a GDP of 10,000 crore to 100 lakh crore (at current prices) \u2013 ie. from a poor nation to one of the largest economies. India ranks 3rd in GDP at purchasing power parity, has surpassed Japan and is now standing just below the US and China. The new economy needs institutions which can take India forward in a global competitive environment.\nCo-operative federalism and fiscal federalism will help to meet the diverse needs of different states/UTs in which planning commission had failed drastically. Plans have to be formulated by fulfilling the aspirations of states by tailoring the plans to suit their needs and requirements.\nThe share of agriculture in GDP has been drastically decreasing\u00a0while the share of the service sector to GDP is increasing in India. From 1991, as our economy is liberalised, private firms have been playing a major role in the economy. Today we are living in a globalised world connected by modern transport, media, communications and networked international institutions and markets. With the increasing levels of development, the aspirations of people have soared from survival to safety and surplus. So governance systems need\u00a0to be transformed to keep up with the same.\nChange in the economic scenario where the government is supposed to be an enabler rather than a player or provider of first and last. PS: In the next article, let\u2019s see how the new institution, NITI Aayog\u00a0can change the face of Indian Planning.\n\nArticle contributed by Jeesh Varghese\u00a0and\u00a0Mathew Thomas Thayil.

The total central plan outlay was decreased in the 2014-15 budget to cut the fiscal deficit, but Central assistance to states and UTs is on an increase.\n\nGovernment restructured the Centrally Sponsored Schemes (CSS) from BE 2014-15 (Plan). Accordingly,\n126 CSS have been restructured in 66 schemes which include 17 flagship programmes. In BE 2014-15, funds\u00a0have been provided under these schemes as Additional Central Assistance to State Plan. A much higher\u00a0allocation of \u00a0Rs. 3,38,408 crore in State Plan 2014-15 against BE 2013-14 of \u00a0Rs.1,36,254 crore reflects this change.\n\nCentral Plan\n\nThe central plan outlay goes to different sectors like:\n\n\ud83d\udc49 Which year are YOU targeting for success in the IAS/IPS/IFS Exam? \ud83d\ude80\n\n(1) \u21d2 UPSC 2025: Prelims cum Mains\n\n(2) \u21d2 UPSC 2026: Prelims cum Mains\n\n(3) \u21d2 UPSC 2027 Prelims cum Mains\n\nTip: Know more about ClearIAS Courses (Online/Offline)\n\nEnergy.\nTransport.\nSocial Services.\nIndustry and minerals.\nGeneral economics services.\nCommunications.\nScience and Tech.\nAgriculture.\nGeneral Services.\nRural Development.\nIrrigation and flood control.\n\nMinistries which get major shares of Central plan are the following :\n\nMinistry of Petroleum and Natural gas.\nMinistry of Railways.\nMinistry of Power.\nMinistry of Road transport and highways.\n\nRemember that these are different from CSS which are connected with the central assistance given to states.\u00a0The states and UTs would now get 59 per cent of plan budget allocation, more than twice their share in FY14, whereas the share of Central Plan in plan account disbursement would drop from 75 per cent to 41 per cent.\n\nAdditional Central Assistance To State and UT Plans\n\nThe government restructured the Centrally Sponsored Schemes (CSS) from BE 2014-15 (Plan). Accordingly,\u00a0126 CSS have been restructured in 66 schemes which include 17 flagship programmes. In BE 2014-15, funds\u00a0have been provided under these schemes as Additional Central Assistance to State Plan. From 2014-15 Budget, fund allocation for almost all Centrally Sponsored Schemes like MGNEGA comes under the head Additional Central Assistance To States and UT Plans.\n\nNote: Planning Commission is governed by Gadgil-Mukherjee formula for normal central assistance.\u00a0The Gadgil-Mukherjee formula envisages that special category states get 30% of all central assistance. Of that, 90% is provided in grants and 10% in loans. For general category states, the ratio of grants to loans is 70:30.\n\nDifference between Central Sector Schemes and Centrally Sponsored Schemes\n\nBefore re-branding schemes into Central Plan and Additional Central Assistance to State Plans, there were mainly three classes of\u00a0schemes:\n\nCentral sector Scheme\nCentrally Sponsored Scheme (CSS)\nCentral Assistance Schemes \u2013 with many sub-categories like Normal Central Assistance(NCA), Special Central Assistance(SCA), Additional Central Assistance(ACA) etc.\nCentral Sector Schemes\n\nCentral sector schemes are 100% funded by the Union government and implemented by the Central Government machinery. Central sector schemes are mainly formulated on subjects from the Union List. Central Ministries may also implement some schemes directly in States/UTs, but resources under these Schemes are not generally transferred to States. (Fund from Union, implementation by union, list \u2013 union).\n\nEg: Rajiv Gandhi Grameen Vyadyteekaran Yojana,\nRestructured-Accelerated Power\u00a0Development and Reform Programme\u00a0(R-APDRP).\n\nNB: For these Central Sector schemes, the funds are provided to the Implementing Agencies routed through REC and PFC to the State on a project level basis. Hence, these two schemes are classified under additional central assistance schemes too.\n\nCentrally Sponsored Scheme (CSS)\n\nUnder Centrally Sponsored Scheme (CSS) a certain percentage of the funding is borne by the States in the ratio of 50:50, 70:30, 75:25 or 90:10 and the implementation is done by the State Governments. Centrally Sponsored Schemes are formulated in subjects from the State List. In case of CSS, the budgets are allocated under ministries concerned themselves and the entire process of release is also done by them. Funds are routed either through the consolidated fund of States and or are transferred directly to State/ District Level Autonomous Bodies/Implementing Agencies. (Fund from union and states, implementation by states, list \u2013 states).\n\nAdditional Central Assistance Schemes\n\nFund from union and states, implementation by states, list \u2013 union list or states. Examples of ACAs include:\n\nJawaharlal Nehru National Urban Renewal Mission (JNNURM)\nAccelerated Irrigation Benefit Programme (AIBP)\nNational Social Assistance Programme (NSAP)\nRashtriya Krishi Vikas Yojana (RKVY)\nRajiv Gandhi Grameen Vidyutikaran Yojana (RGGVY)\nRestructured-Accelerated Power Development and Reform Programme (R-APDRP)\nBackward Regions Grant Fund (BRGF), of which there are (a) State Component (b) District Component\n\nNB:\u00a0For each new CSS/ACA/Flagship scheme, at least 25 percent of funds may be contributed by the General Category States and 10 percent of funds by the Special Category States including J&K, Himachal Pradesh and Uttarakhand.\n\nUpdate (2015 Feb):\u00a0Centrally Sponsored Schemes (CSSs) now form a major part of the Central Assistance(CA) given by the center to states to implement the state plans. For ease of understanding CSS may now be treated synonymous to CA. There were other types of Central Assistance before 2015-16, but almost all of them are discontinued after the 14th Finance Commission recommendations for higher devolution taxes to states. As\u00a0states now get more revenue via higher devolution of central taxes, the Central Assistance to state plans has decreased. Refer Union Budget 2015-16 for latest figures."

The Commission may also examine whether revenue deficit grants be provided at all.\n\nWhile making the recommendations, the XV-FC may consider\n\nResources of Central and State governments and their potential and fiscal capacity.\nDemand on the resources of respective governments.\nImpact of the enhanced devolution following 14th FC on the fiscal situation.\nImpact of GST and compensation for the losses in revenues for 5 years.\n\nThe Commission may consider proposing performance-based incentives to the States based on\n\nEfforts made in expansion and deepening of tax net under GST.\nEfforts and progress made in moving towards the replacement rate of population growth.\nAchievements in the implementation of flagship schemes of Government of India, disaster-resilient infrastructure, and sustainable development goals.\nProgress made in increasing capital expenditure, eliminating losses of the power sector, and improving the quality of such expenditure in generating future income streams.\nProgress made in increasing tax/non-tax revenues.\nPromoting savings by the adoption of Direct Benefit Transfers and Public Finance Management System.\nPromoting digital economy and removing layers between the government and the beneficiaries.\nProgress made in promoting ease of doing business and promoting labour-intensive growth.\nProvision of grants in aid to local bodies for basic services and implementation of a performance grant system in improving the delivery of services.\nControl or lack of it in incurring expenditure on populist measures.\nProgress made in sanitation, solid waste management and bringing in a behavioural change to end open defecation.\n\nThe Commission shall use the population data of 2011 while making its recommendations.\n\nThe Commission may review the present arrangements on financing Disaster Management initiatives regarding the funds constituted under the Disaster Management Act, 2005.\n\nControversies associated with the 15th Finance Commission\n\nThe Terms of Reference (ToR) of the 15th Finance Commission were opposed by some States. The main apprehensions were:\n\nProgressive states would lose heavily if the population-based on the 2011 census was considered for the devolution of central funds.\nStates that have performed well on population control would be penalized.\nPrevious FCs used 1971 Census numbers while the 14th commission had given weight to both the 1971 (17.5%) and 2011 (10%) censuses.\nSome states have a higher potential in expanding the GST tax base while others do not. Hence the performance on this parameter cannot be a basis for fund devolution.\nMany states run social sector schemes which are welfare-oriented. If these schemes are considered populist, these States will be penalized.\nStates are already under the burden of GST and devolution based on the 2011 Census will further constrain the fund position of the States.\nStates resent a devolution criterion that considers the implementation of Central schemes, as tax devolution is their constitutional right and not a largesse of the Central government.\nSince revenue deficit grants are proposed to be re-looked, there may be a reduction in the fiscal autonomy of the States and conditions for borrowing from external sources will also be reviewed.\n\nThese apprehensions were addressed by the Centre which said that there is no regional bias and that poorer States rely more on Centre\u2019s revenue than developed ones. Regarding the shift to Census 2011 numbers, it was mentioned that efforts made towards reducing population growth rate towards replacement rate were also included which balances the equation.\n\nRecommendations of the 15th Finance Commission\n\nThe 15th Finance Commission proposed recommendations for both vertical and horizontal devolution.\n\nVertical Devolution\n\n41% of the divisible pool to be devolved to the States in the year 2020-21.\n\nFC-XIV which had recommended 42%, had a view that tax devolution should be the primary route of transfer of resources to States as they are a more objective form of transfer of resources as compared to other forms. The XV-FC also agrees with this view but reduced the States\u2019 share to 41% because of the re-organization of the State of Jammu & Kashmir into UTs of Ladakh and Jammu & Kashmir through the Jammu & Kashmir Re-organization Act, 2019.\n\nUTs are the responsibilities of the Union and their demands have to be met from the Union Government\u2019s resources.\n\nHorizontal Devolution\n\nHorizontal devolution is done primarily to enable the States to provide basic public goods and services with equivalent tax effort. The various criteria to be considered for horizontal devolution are classified into three broad groups as follows.\n\nNeed-based criteria: Population, area and forest & ecology form the need-based criteria. This is needed to address the fiscal gap of States existing due to the structural mismatch between the States\u2019 resources and their expenditure liabilities.\nEquity-based criterion: Income distance forms the equity-based criterion to ensure fiscal equalization given the large differences in the resource base available and status of development within the country.\nPerformance-based criteria: Demographic performance and tax effort are part of the performance-based criteria that is framed to reward and incentivize States to perform better, in terms of utilization of resources available to them.\n\nTable 1 Horizontal Devolution Criteria\n\nCriteria\n\t\n14th\u00a0FC\n\t\n15th\u00a0FC\n\n\nIncome Distance\n\t\n50.0\n\t\n45.0\n\n\nPopulation of 1971\n\t\n17.5\n\t\n\u2013\n\n\nPopulation of 2011\n\t\n10.0\n\t\n15.0\n\n\nArea\n\t\n15.0\n\t\n15.0\n\n\nForest Cover\n\t\n7.5\n\t\n\u2013\n\n\nForest & Ecology\n\t\n\u2013\n\t\n10.0\n\n\nDemographic Performance\n\t\n\u2013\n\t\n12.5\n\n\nTax Effort\n\t\n\u2013\n\t\n2.5\n\n\nTotal\n\t\n100\n\t\n100\nPopulation: Only 2011 Census numbers are used as per the ToR. Population criterion is assigned a weight of only 15 per cent as some of the other criteria will also be scaled by it.\nArea: A moderate weight of 15 per cent for the area criterion is assigned larger area incurs some additional administrative costs but it may not lead to a proportional increase in the cost of providing services.\nForest and Ecology: This criterion is for the ecological services being provided by a State\u2019s forest cover to the country as a whole and is arrived at by calculating the share of the dense forest of each State in the aggregate dense forest of all the States. A weight of 10 per cent is assigned for the forest and ecology criterion.\nIncome Distance: Distance of per capita income is the criteria used to make the devolution formula more equalizing and progressive, and provides higher devolution to States with lower per capita income and lower own tax capacity. The XV-FC retained the income distance criterion with a weight of 45 per cent.\nDemographic Performance: An abrupt change from 1971 Census data to 2011 Census data should not unfairly penalize some States which have performed well on population control. Hence, the commission recommended introducing a new performance-based criterion to reward States who have performed well on the demography front. This criterion of demographic performance is computed by using the reciprocal of TFR of each State, scaled by the population data of Census 1971. States which have achieved lower TFR will be scored higher and vice versa. This criterion is assigned a weight of 12.5 per cent.\nTax Effort: The inclusion of tax effort as a performance-based criterion will reward the States with higher tax collection efficiency and encourage all States to be more tax efficient. It is computed by taking the ratio of the average of per capita own tax revenue of a State over three years and its per capita GSDP and scaling this ratio by the population of the State. Total weight of 2.5 per cent has been assigned to this criterion.\n\nUttar Pradesh and Bihar have received the largest devolutions for 2020-21 while Karnataka and Kerala saw the largest decreases in the share of the divisible pool.\n\nGrants in Aid\n\nRevenue Deficit Grants: 14 states are estimated to face a revenue deficit post-devolution. \u00a0The Commission has recommended revenue deficit grants worth Rs 74,341 crore to these 14 states. \u00a0Furthermore, the three states of Karnataka, Mizoram, and Telangana received special grants to make up the shortfall between untied transfers received by these States in the form of tax devolution plus revenue deficit grant in 2020-21 vis-a-vis the corresponding amount in 2019-20.\n\nSectoral Grants: The XV-FC is considering recommending sectoral grants for nutrition, health, pre-primary education, judiciary, rural connectivity, railways, statistics and police training, and housing during its tenure. Of these, grants for nutrition, to augment the efforts of the States towards reducing and ultimately eliminating malnutrition, is specifically recommended even in 2020-21.\n\nPerformance-based Incentives: Six broad areas are identified to provide performance-based incentives to States.\n\nImplementation of Agriculture Reforms\nDevelopment of Aspirational Districts and Aspirational Blocks\nPower Sector Reforms\nEnhancing Trade including Exports\nIncentives for Education\nPromotion of Domestic and International Tourism\nEmpowering Local Bodies\n\nSome significant changes made by XV-FC compared to previous Finance Commissions:\n\nTo recommend grants to all tiers of the Panchayati Raj to enable pooling of resources to create durable community assets and improve their functional viability.\nTo give grants to the Fifth and Sixth Schedule areas and Cantonment Boards.\nTo provide for tied grants in the critical sectors of sanitation and drinking water to ensure additional funds to the local bodies over and above the funds allocated for these purposes under the centrally sponsored schemes (CSS), Swachh Bharat and Jal Jeevan Missions.\nTo account for increasing urbanization the share of urban local bodies in Finance Commission grants to local bodies should be gradually increased to 40 per cent over the medium term.\nSince larger cities will tend to grow faster with the agglomeration effect, the fifty Million-Plus cities in the country need differentiated treatment, with special emphasis on meeting the challenges of bad ambient air quality, groundwater depletion and sanitation.\n\nGrants to Local Bodies:\n\nThe Commission has recommended a total of Rs 90,000 crore for grants to the local bodies in 2020-21.\nThis amounts to 4.31% of the divisible pool.\nThese grants will be made available to all three tiers of Panchayat- village, block, and district.\nThe inter-se distribution of grants for local bodies among the States may be based on population and area in the ratio of 90:10.\nFor 2020-21, the proportion of grants between rural and urban local bodies recommended by the XV-FC is in the ratio of 67.5:32.5.\nFor all urban bodies, the distribution of grants for 2020-21 is based on population.\nDisaster Risk Management\nTo promote local-level mitigation activities, mitigation funds shall be set up at both national and state levels in the form of NDMF and State Disaster Mitigation Funds (SDMF), following the Disaster Management Act.\nThe Commission recommended the creation of funds for disaster mitigation along with disaster response, which will now together be called as National Disaster Risk Management Fund (NDRMF) and State Disaster Risk Management Funds (SDRMF).\nRecommended grants for the State Disaster Risk Management Fund is Rs 28,983 crore. Out of this, the share of SDRF shall be 80 per cent and the share of SDMF 20 per cent. The allocation for the National Disaster Risk Management Fund is Rs 12,390 crore.\nAllocations for NDRF / SDRF will be further sub-divided into\nResponse and Relief \u2013 40 per cent\nRecovery and Reconstruction \u2013 30 per cent\nCapacity Building \u2013 10 per cent\nConclusion\n\nSeveral challenges have emerged since these recommendations were made by the XV-FC in the form of the global economic slowdown, lower tax revenue realization and above all, the enormous disruption to the economy created by the Coronavirus pandemic.\n\nThese will necessitate several additional demands for allocations to be made in the coming years.\n\nFurther, several policy issues like streamlining GST, Direct Tax Code, improving expenditure outcomes, etc. will need special focus from the government to achieve the noble objectives set before the Finance Commission."

            "[CONTENT]": "The total plan outlay in the Union Budget is the sum of Central Plan and Central Assistance for State and UT plans. We have already\u00a0covered the major programs under Central Plan in a separate article.\n\nUpdate:\u00a0To learn the Centrally Sponsored Schemes and Central Sector Schemes as mentioned in the Union Budget 2018, refer this post.\n\nThis post is dedicated entirely to list the major programs under the Central Assistance for States and UT plans. It should be noted that Centrally Sponsored Schemes(CSS) forms a major chunk of the Central Assistance for State and UT plans. In that sense this article is also about the latest Centrally Sponsored Schemes.\n\nTable of Contents\n\nWhat are Centrally Sponsored Schemes(CSS)?\nBudget allocation to CSS\nList of the Centrally Sponsored Schemes\nSchemes to be fully supported by Union Government\nSchemes to be run with the Changed Sharing Pattern\nSchemes delinked from support of the Centre\nWhy are some CSS de-linked from Center\u2019s support?\nWhy there are still CSS?\nFinance Commission and Recommendations\nReference:\nWhat are Centrally Sponsored Schemes(CSS)?\n\nUsually, Center can run schemes only on subjects mentioned in Union list (Central Plan/Central Sector Schemes). It\u2019s the duty of the states to implement programmes on items mentioned in the State list. But to encourage states to take up projects and programmes in the national interest, Center sponsors fully or partially many programmes on items mentioned in State list. These programs are called Centrally Sponsored Schemes.\n\nTo be precise,\u00a0CSS is the biggest component of Central Assistance to state plans(CA), where states don\u2019t have much flexibility. The other component \u2013 block grants to states \u2013 is a grant and states have full flexibility in utilizing. But in the Budget 2015, many of the plan grants(block grants) like\u00a0Normal Central Assistance, Special Plan Assistance, Special Central Assistance and Additional Central Assistance for other purposes are subsumed in the award of FC itself (greater share of taxes and non-plan grants). Thus, though considered as two separate entities before, Centrally Sponsored Schemes(CSS)\u00a0now being the major part of Central Assistance (CA) to states, the terms CSS and CA are often used interchangeably.\n\nBudget allocation to CSS\nNITI Aayog\u2019s Arvind Panagariya recommends reducing CSS\n\nAs per the\u00a0Union Budet 2015-16, the total Plan Outlay for 2015-16 is Rs. 4,65,277 crore.\u00a0The Budgetary support for Central Plan in 2014-15 is Rs.2,60,493 crore\u00a0while the total central assistance for\u00a0State and Union Territory Plans is Rs.2,04,784 crore. It should be noted that while the budgetary support for Central Plan has increased, the central assistance to state plans has decreased this year.\n\nList of the Centrally Sponsored Schemes\n\nAt present, there are 72 CSS, including six new\u00a0schemes introduced by the NDA government. Budget 2015-16 mentions about bringing down the number of Centrally Sponsored Schemes (CSS) in tune with the higher allocation for states as per 14th Finance Commission recommendations. Now there are only 31 schemes fully supported by Union Government and 24 schemes under partial support. 8 schemes are de-linked from center\u2019s support.\n\n\ud83d\udc49 Which year are YOU targeting for success in the IAS/IPS/IFS Exam? \ud83d\ude80\n\n(1) \u21d2 UPSC 2025: Prelims cum Mains\n\n(2) \u21d2 UPSC 2026: Prelims cum Mains\n\n(3) \u21d2 UPSC 2027 Prelims cum Mains\n\nTip: Know more about ClearIAS Courses (Online/Offline)\n\nSchemes to be fully supported by Union Government\n\n1.

Impact Assessment Studies of AIBFMP\n\nNote: The Centre-State funding pattern is being modified in view of the larger devolution of tax resources to States as per the recommendations of 14th Finance Commission whereby in this scheme, the revenue expenditure is to be borne by the States. Subsequent to changed funding pattern, overall expenditure on the schemes will not decrease.\n\nSchemes delinked from support of the Centre\n\n1. National e-Governance Plan\n2. Backward Regions Grant Funds\n3. Modernisation of Police Forces\n4. Rajiv Gandhi Panchayat Sashaktikaran Abhiyaan (RGPSA)\n5. Scheme for Central Assistance to the States for developing export infrastructure\n6. Scheme for setting up of 6000 Model Schools\n7. National Mission on Food Processing\n8. Tourist Infrastructure\n\nWhy are some CSS de-linked from Center\u2019s support?\n\nAs states are now given more direct funds which offer greater flexibility (extra to regular CSS), there is no need for additional spending through the CSS route by the Center.\n\nWhy there are still CSS?\n\nIdeally, all CSS should go. Funds should flow to states without pre-conditions to ensure greater flexibility. The center will save on inter-mediation costs and in the long term, there would also be higher implementation efficiency in terms of outcome yields on every rupee spent. But there are still Centrally Sponsored Schemes running on state subjects. The reasons are the following:\n\nKeeping in mind that some of these schemes represent national priorities especially those targeted at poverty alleviation, Centre has decided that it will continue to contribute to such schemes.\nThe schemes mandated by legal obligations and those backed by Cess collection have been fully provided for.\nFinance Commission and Recommendations\n\nFinance commission(FC) recommended 42 percent of Union Tax as share to states (vertical devolution). But will FC deal with the\u00a0split the 42 percent tax share among different states (horizonatal distribution)? Shouldn\u2019t the BIMARU states get more money than the prosperous states? Who takes care of this? If you are not sure, please see our next article which discuss the Center-State financial relations.\n\nThe objective of 14th FC has been to fill the resource gaps of each State to the extent possible through tax devolution.\nFC believe that while there are certain common factors that impact cost disability and fiscal capacity of States, there exist circumstances that are unique to individual States.\nFFC did not make a distinction between special and general category states in determining their norms and recommendations.\nHowever, FC have provided post-devolution revenue deficit grants for States where devolution alone could not cover the assessed gap.\nHence, Normal Central Assistance, Special Plan Assistance, Special Central Assistance and Additional Central Assistance for other purposes are subsumed in the award itself.\nREFERENCE:\nIndiabuget.nic.in \u2013 Budget at a glance 5\nIndiabuget.nic.in \u2013 Budget at a glance\u00a07\nIndiabuget.nic.in \u2013 Budget at a glance\u00a08\nIndiabuget.nic.in \u2013 Budget at a glance\u00a010"

The mainly cover items listed in states list.\n\nCentrally Sponsored Schemes vs Central Assistance\n\nCentrally Sponsored Schemes (CSSs) now form a major part of the Central Assistance(CA) given by the centre to states to implement the state plans. For ease of understanding, CSS may now be treated synonymously to CA.\n\nThere were other types of Central Assistance before 2015-16, but almost all of them are discontinued as states got higher revenue after the 14th Finance Commission recommendations (higher devolution of taxes to states).\n\n\ud83d\udc49 Which year are YOU targeting for success in the IAS/IPS/IFS Exam? \ud83d\ude80\n\n(1) \u21d2 UPSC 2025: Prelims cum Mains\n\n(2) \u21d2 UPSC 2026: Prelims cum Mains\n\n(3) \u21d2 UPSC 2027 Prelims cum Mains\n\nTip: Know more about ClearIAS Courses (Online/Offline)\n\nRestructuring of Centrally Sponsored Schemes \u2013 Chaturvedi Committee Recommendations (2014)\n\nIn 2014, the UPA-2 government approved Planning Commission\u2019s proposal to merge the 147 Centrally Sponsored Schemes (CSS) and bring it down to 66 across various sectors for effective implementation and monitoring of the 12th Five Year Plan.\u00a0The merger proposal was in line with the recommendations of the Chaturvedi committee, which had suggested bringing down CSS to avoid overlap.\n\nCSS, Flagship Schemes and ACA: CSSs are\u00a0backed by Central government grant money. They\u00a0have been implemented by State governments over at least ten Five Year Plans. Out of the Centrally sponsored schemes, Government gives priority to certain special schemes to achieve social objectives. These schemes are called Flagship schemes. Schemes covered under additional central assistance are known as ACA.\n\nConceptually both CSS and Additional Central Assistance (ACA) Schemes have been passed by the Central Government to the State governments. The difference between the two has arisen because of the historical evolution and the way these are being budgeted and controlled and release of funds takes place. In case of CSS, the budgets are allocated under ministries concerned themselves and the entire process of release is also done by them.\n\nCentrally Sponsored Schemes and Flagship Schemes during UPA-2 regime\n\nTowards the end of the UPA-2 rule (after restructuring), there were 66 Centrally Sponsored Schemes. 17 schemes out of the 66 schemes were called Flagship schemes. Flagship schemes correspond to a few major schemes, with higher fund allocation and rigorously pursued by the Government to achieve its national objectives.\n\nPlease see below the list of 66 Centrally Sponsored Schemes (CSS) including the 17 flagship schemes.\n\n66 Centrally Sponsored Schemes (CSS) including the 17 flagship schemes: UPA-2 regime\nJawaharlal Nehru National Urban Renewal Mission (JNNURM) *.\nAccelerated Irrigation Benefit Programme (AIBP) *.\nNational Social Assistance Programme (NSAP) *.\nRashtriya Krishi Vikas Yojana (RKVY) *.\nRajiv Gandhi Grameen Vidyutikaran Yojana (RGGVY) *.

ClearIAS.com will provide detailed overview and analysis of the important individual schemes in the coming articles.\n\nWhat is the significance of Article 282?\n\nArticle 282. Expenditure defrayable by the Union or a State out of its revenues:\u00a0The Union or a State may make any grants for any public purpose, notwithstanding that the purpose is not one with respect to which Parliament or the Legislature of the State, as the case may be, may make laws.\n\nCriticism of Centrally Sponsored Schemes\nCSS dictate Centers\u2019 agenda and priorities which may not be relevant for states.\nCSS offers little flexibility for the states.\nNeeds of states differ among themselves and a universal CSS package may not be practical in all cases.\nMany CSS which offers only partial support from Center may impose a burden on states.\nHow important is CSS for UPSC Exams?\n\nCSS are an important area for Prelims and Mains. UPSC aspirants should keep in mind that there are still many schemes outside the scope of CSS like Central Sector Schemes. The government in coming months may announce new schemes as they did with\u00a0RKSK. Aspirants are also advised to keep track of merging or renaming of schemes.\n\nFor example, National Rural livelihood Mission was renamed as Aajivika. Also, National Rural Health Mission and National Urban Health Mission were merged together and renamed as National Health Mission. Any scheme can be handpicked to frame a question. See related questions the\u00a02013 Mains question paper\u00a0for reference:\n\nThe concept of Mid-Day Meal (MDM) scheme is almost a century old in India with early beginnings in Madras Presidency in pre-independent India. The scheme has again been given impetus in most states in the last two decades. Critically examine its twin objectives, latest mandates and success.\nThe Central Government frequently complains on the poor performance of the State Governments in eradicating suffering of the vulnerable sections of the society. Restructuring of Centrally sponsored schemes across the sectors for ameliorating the cause of vulnerable sections of population aims at providing flexibility to the States in better implementation. Critically evaluate.\nThe basis of providing urban amenities in rural areas (PURA) is rooted in establishing connectivity.

RKSK\u00a0will include a sharp focus on adolescents\u2019 sexual health.\n\nTable of Contents\n\nWho is an adolescent?\nWhat\u2019s new about the Rashtriya Kishor Swasthya Karyakram (RKSK)?\nWho is an adolescent?\n\nThe RKSK programme defines an adolescent as a person within 10-19 years of age, in urban and rural areas, includes both girls and boys, married and unmarried, poor and affluent, whether they are in school or out of school.\n\nWhat\u2019s new about the Rashtriya Kishor Swasthya Karyakram (RKSK)?\n\nThere were 147 Centrally Sponsored Schemes (CSS) till 2013 budget. (Yes, much to the dismay of UPSC aspirants; they had to by-heart so many Yojanas and Karykrams!) But Planning Commission has recently announced merging of many CSS to a manageable number (ie. 66), for ease of government officials like District Collectors (and for UPSC aspirants too :-)). But then, why another Karyakram now? Let\u2019s see what is new about RKSK?\n\nThe Rashtriya Kishor Swasthya Karyakram (RKSK) will bring in several new dimensions, such as \u2013 mental health, nutrition, substance misuse, gender based violence and non-communicable diseases.\nThe programme introduces community based interventions through peer educators, and is underpinned by collaborations with other Ministries and State governments, knowledge partners and more research.\nNew focus on adolescents is in recognition of the fact that without adolescent health, maternal and child health outcomes may continue to elude us.\nAt present the Government\u2019s strategic approach in health sector is RMNCH+A\u00a0(Reproductive, Maternal, New born, Child Health + Adolescent) in which \u2018A\u2019 denotes adolescents.\n5 by 5 RMNCH+A matrix has been developed which lists out the 5 high impact interventions under each of the 5 pillars, all of which need to be implemented together, at the same time, with high coverage and quality.\nThe programme is an effort to move away from a \u2018doctor-driven\u2019 effort towards a holistic and participative programme.\nThe RKSK recognizes that all adolescents need attention even before the occurrence of any disease or problem, and in order to make informed decisions and choices.\nAdolescents present a unique opportunity to reap the country\u2019s demographic dividends.\nLifestyle and behavior related diseases such as substance abuse, inflicting self harm, tendency towards gender-based violence, low nutrition and physical inactivity, which begin and occur more during this phase, are fast becoming the causes for the highest mortality in this age group.\nThe programme emphasis seven \u2018Cs\u201d- coverage, content, communication, counselling, clinics and convergence.\nActive use of new technologies and social media platforms will form an integral part of the programme to reach the adolescents in their own spaces, with strategic partnerships with communities and peers."

Financial\u00a0market may be defined as \u2018a transmission mechanism between investors (or lenders) and\u00a0the borrowers (or users) through which transfer of funds is facilitated\u2019.\nIt consists of individual\u00a0investors, financial institutions and other intermediaries who are linked by a formal trading\u00a0rules and communication network for trading the various financial assets and credit\u00a0instruments. It deals in financial instruments (like bills of exchange, shares, debentures, bonds, etc).\nFund Raising By Business Units\n\nBusiness units have to raise short-term as well as long-term funds\u00a0to meet their working and fixed capital requirements from time to time. From where would they get funds from? Ans : From investors or lenders.\n\n\ud83d\udc49 Which year are YOU targeting for success in the IAS/IPS/IFS Exam? \ud83d\ude80\n\n(1) \u21d2 UPSC 2025: Prelims cum Mains\n\n(2) \u21d2 UPSC 2026: Prelims cum Mains\n\n(3) \u21d2 UPSC 2027 Prelims cum Mains\n\nTip: Know more about ClearIAS Courses (Online/Offline)\n\nSurplus money flows from the investors or lenders to the\u00a0businessmen for the purpose of production or sale of goods and services. So, we find two\u00a0different groups, one who invest money or lend money and the others, who borrow or use\u00a0the money.\n\nMain functions of financial market\n\nLet us now see the main functions of financial market.\n(a) It provides facilities for interaction between the investors and the borrowers.\n(b) It provides pricing information resulting from the interaction between buyers and sellers\u00a0in the market when they trade the financial assets.\n(c) It provides security to dealings in financial assets.\n(d) It ensures liquidity by providing a mechanism for an investor to sell the financial assets.\n(e) It ensures low cost of transactions and information.\n\nClassification of Financial Market\n\nA financial market consists of two major segments: (a) Money Market; and (b) Capital\u00a0Market. While the money market deals in short-term credit, the capital market handles\u00a0the medium term and long-term credit.\n\nFinancial Market Classification\nMONEY MARKET.\nCall Money.\nTreasury Bill.\nCommercial Paper.\nCertificate of Deposit.\nTrade bill.\nCAPITAL MARKET.\nSecurities Market\nPrimary Market : IPOs, Book Building, Private Placements.\nSecondary Market : Equity Market, Debt Market, Commodity Market, Futures and Options Market. (Secondary Market can be basically divided into two \u2013 spot market and forward market. Forward market has two divisions \u2013 futures and options/derivatives. Again, there are two types of options \u2013 put option and call option.)\nNon-Securities Market\nMutual Funds.\nFixed Deposits, Savings Deposits, Post Office savings.\nInsurance.\nMoney Market\n\nThe money market is a market for short-term funds, which deals in financial assets whose\u00a0period of maturity is upto one year. It should be noted that money market does not deal in\u00a0cash or money as such but simply provides a market for credit instruments such as bills of\u00a0exchange, promissory notes, commercial paper, treasury bills, etc. These financial\u00a0instruments are close substitute of money. These instruments help the business units, other\u00a0organisations and the Government to borrow the funds to meet their short-term requirement.\n\nThe Indian money market consists\u00a0of Reserve Bank of India, Commercial banks, Co-operative banks, and other specialised\u00a0financial institutions. The Reserve Bank of India is the leader of the money market in India.\u00a0Some Non-Banking Financial Companies (NBFCs) and financial institutions like LIC,\u00a0GIC, UTI, etc. also operate in the Indian money market.\n\nTo read more click here.\n\nCapital Market\nCapital Market is an institutional arrangement for borrowing medium and long-term funds and which provides facilities for marketing and trading of securities. So it constitutes all long-term borrowings from banks and financial institutions, borrowings from foreign markets and raising of capital by issue various securities such as shares, debentures, bonds, etc. The securities market has two different segments namely primary and secondary market.\nTo read more click here.\nPrimary Market vs Secondary Market : The primary market consists of arrangements for procurement of long-term funds by companies by fresh issue of shares and debentures. The secondary market or stock exchange provides a ready market for existing long term securities. Stock exchange is the secondary market, which provides a place for regular sale and purchase of different types of securities like shares, debentures, bonds & government securities. It is an organised market where all transactions are regulated by the rules and laws of the concerned stock exchanges.\nSecondary Markets or Stock Exchanges : The functions of a stock exchanges are to provide ready and continuous market for securities, information about prices and sales, safety to dealings and investment, helps mobilisation of savings and capital formation. It acts as a barometer of economic and business conditions and helps in better allocation of funds. Stock exchanges provide many benefits to companies, investors and the society as a whole.\nBut they also suffer from limitations like exclusive speculation and fluctuation in prices due to rumours and unpredictable events. There are 21 stock exchanges in India presently, including BSE, NSE and OTCEI. Stock Exchanges are regulated by the Securities Contracts (Regulation) Act and by SEBI. SEBI has initiated a number of reforms in the primary and secondary market to regulate the stock market. Documentary and procedural requirements for listing and trading have been made stricter and foolproof to protect investors\u2019 interest.\nThe secondary market has further two components.\u00a0First, the spot market where securities are traded for immediate delivery and payment.\u00a0The other is forward market where the securities are traded for future delivery and\u00a0payment. This forward market is further divided into Futures and Options Market (Derivatives\u00a0Markets).\nIn futures Market the securities are traded for conditional future delivery whereas in\u00a0option market, two types of options are traded. A put option gives right but not an\u00a0obligation to the owner to sell a security to the writer of the option at a predetermined\u00a0price before a certain date, while a call option gives right but not an obligation to\u00a0the buyer to purchase a security from the writer of the option at a particular price\u00a0before a certain date.\nMoney Market and Capital Market : A comparison\nPoint of Distinction\n\t\nMoney Market\n\t\nCapital Market\n\n\n1.

            "[CONTENT]": "In the last article on Financial Market overview, we have seen that the money market is a market for short-term funds, which deals in financial assets whose\u00a0period of maturity is up to one year.\n\nWe are also familiar with the names of the\u00a0Money Market instruments or securities. They are Call Money, Treasury Bill, Commercial Paper, Certificate of Deposit and Trade bill.\n\nBefore understanding the various instruments of Money Market in detail, it would be better if we start with the differences between Bill of exchange and Promissory Note.\n\nThese are two basic concepts, related with the instruments in money market.\n\nTable of Contents\n\nDifference Between Bill of exchange and Promissory note\nBill of exchange\nPromissory Note\nImportant Money Market Instruments or Securities\nCall Money\nTreasury Bill\nCommercial Paper\nCertificate of Deposit\nTrade Bill\nDifference Between Bill of exchange and Promissory note\n\nBills of exchange and promissory notes are written commitments between two parties that confirm a financial transaction has been agreed upon. Below is the detailed concept of both terms.\n\nBill of exchange\n\nA bill of exchange is an instrument in writing containing an unconditional order,\u00a0signed by the maker, directing a certain person to pay a certain sum of money only\u00a0to or to the order of a certain person, or to the bearer of the instrument.\u00a0In a bill of exchange there are three parties the drawer, the drawee and the payee.\n\nPromissory Note\n\nA promissory note is an instrument in writing (not being a bank note or a currency\u00a0note) containing an unconditional undertaking, signed by the maker, to pay a certain\u00a0sum of money only to or to the order of a certain person or to the bearer of the\u00a0instrument.\u00a0In a promissory note there are two parties the maker of the note and the payee.\n\n\ud83d\udc49 Which year are YOU targeting for success in the IAS/IPS/IFS Exam? \ud83d\ude80\n\n(1) \u21d2 UPSC 2025: Prelims cum Mains\n\n(2) \u21d2 UPSC 2026: Prelims cum Mains\n\n(3) \u21d2 UPSC 2027 Prelims cum Mains\n\nTip: Know more about ClearIAS Courses (Online/Offline)\n\nNB :\u00a0In a promissory note there is a promise to make the payment whereas in a bill of exchange there is an order for making the payment. Also, a\u00a0promissory note requires no acceptance as it is signed by the person who is liable to pay. The drawer of a bill of exchange is generally the creditor of the drawee and therefore it must be accepted by the drawee before it can be presented for payment.\n\nImportant Money Market Instruments or Securities\n\nThere are various securities in Money Market as well as in Capital Market. Following are some of the important money market instruments or securities :\n\nCall Money\n\nCall money is mainly used by the banks to meet their temporary\u00a0requirement of cash. They borrow and lend money from each other normally on a\u00a0daily basis. It is repayable on demand and its maturity period varies in between one\u00a0day to a fortnight. The rate of interest paid on call money loan is known as call rate.\n\nTreasury Bill\n\nA treasury bill is a promissory note issued by the RBI to meet the\u00a0short-term requirement of funds. Treasury bills are highly liquid instruments, that means,\u00a0at any time the holder of treasury bills can transfer of or get it discounted from RBI.\u00a0These bills are normally issued at a price less than their face value; and redeemed at\u00a0face value. So the difference between the issue price and the face value of the treasury\u00a0bill represents the interest on the investment. These bills are secured instruments and\u00a0are issued for a period of not exceeding 364 days. Banks, Financial institutions and\u00a0corporations normally play major role in the Treasury bill market.\n\nCommercial Paper\n\nCommercial paper (CP) is a popular instrument for financing\u00a0working capital requirements of companies. The CP is an unsecured instrument issued\u00a0in the form of promissory note. This instrument was introduced in 1990 to enable the\u00a0corporate borrowers to raise short-term funds. It can be issued for period ranging\u00a0from 15 days to one year. Commercial papers are transferable by endorsement and\u00a0delivery. The highly reputed companies (Blue Chip companies) are the major player\u00a0of commercial paper market.\n\nCertificate of Deposit\n\nCertificate of Deposit (CDs) are short-term instruments\u00a0issued by Commercial Banks and Special Financial Institutions (SFIs), which are\u00a0freely transferable from one party to another. The maturity period of CDs ranges\u00a0from 91 days to one year. These can be issued to individuals, co-operatives and\u00a0companies.\n\nTrade Bill\n\nNormally the traders buy goods from the wholesalers or manufactures on\u00a0credit. The sellers get payment after the end of the credit period. But if any seller\u00a0does not want to wait or in immediate need of money he/she can draw a bill of\u00a0exchange in favour of the buyer. When buyer accepts the bill it becomes a negotiable\u00a0instrument and is termed as bill of exchange or trade bill. This trade bill can now be\u00a0discounted with a bank before its maturity. On maturity the bank gets the payment\u00a0from the drawee i.e., the buyer of goods. When trade bills are accepted by Commercial\u00a0Banks it is known as Commercial Bills. So trade bill is an instrument, which enables\u00a0the drawer of the bill to get funds for short period to meet the working capital needs.\n\nAlso read about Capital market.\n\nReferences : NOS and CBSE."

We will see what money markets and capital markets are.\n\nCapital Market may be defined as a market dealing in medium and long-term funds.\n\nAlso read: Public Debt: Overview\n\nTable of Contents\n\nCapital Market\nDebt Market vs Derivative Market vs Commodity Market vs Equity Market\n1.

Equity Market\nNon-Securities Market\nWhat is a Mutual Fund?\nCapital Market\n\nThe Capital market is a market for financial investments that are direct or indirect claims to capital. Capital market embraces all forms of lending and borrowing, whether or not evidenced by the creation of a negotiable financial instrument. It has two components, the securities market and non-securities market.\n\nWe have seen that there are lot many securities exist in money market. Similarly, securities exist in Capital Market too. The market where securities are traded known as Securities market. The Securities Market refers to the markets for those financial instruments/ claims/obligations that are commonly and readily transferable by sale. The Securities Market has two interdependent and inseparable segments, the new issues (primary) market and the stock (secondary) market.\n\nAlso read: US Debt Ceiling Crisis and US Federal Government Shut down Explained\n\n\ud83d\udc49 Which year are YOU targeting for success in the IAS/IPS/IFS Exam? \ud83d\ude80\n\n(1) \u21d2 UPSC 2025: Prelims cum Mains\n\n(2) \u21d2 UPSC 2026: Prelims cum Mains\n\n(3) \u21d2 UPSC 2027 Prelims cum Mains\n\nTip: Know more about ClearIAS Courses (Online/Offline)\n\nDebt Market vs Derivative Market vs Commodity Market vs Equity Market\n\nNow let\u2019s have a quick look at the various markets and the instruments/securities associated with each.\n\n1. Debt Market\n\nThe Wholesale Debt Market (WDM) segment of the National Stock Exchange provides a trading platform for a wide range of fixed income securities that includes central government securities, treasury bills (T-bills), state development loans (SDLs), bonds issued by public sector undertakings (PSUs), floating-rate bonds (FRBs), zero-coupon bonds (ZCBs), index bonds, commercial papers (CPs), certificates of deposit (CDs), corporate debentures, SLR and non-SLR bonds issued by financial institutions (FIs), bonds issued by foreign institutions and units of mutual funds (MFs). (This means that debt market deals not only with capital market securities but also with money market securities).\n\nDebt Instruments: Debt instrument represents a contract whereby one party lends\u00a0money to another on pre-determined terms with regards to rate and\u00a0periodicity of interest, repayment of principal amount by the borrower\u00a0to the lender. Bonds and debentures are the major debt instruments.\n\nBonds and Debentures as debt instruments:\u00a0A Bond is a loan given by the buyer to the issuer of the instrument. Companies, financial institutions, or even the government can issue bonds. Over and above the scheduled interest payments as and when applicable, the holder of a bond is entitled to receive the par value of the instrument at the specified maturity date. Bonds can be broadly classified into Tax-Saving Bonds Regular Income Bonds. Also, note the below points which explain the difference between bonds and debentures.\n\nDebentures are bonds which have no collateral.\nBonds are more secure than debentures, but the rate of interest is lower.\nDebentures are unsecured loans but carry a higher rate of interest.\nIn bankruptcy, bondholders are paid first, but liability towards debenture holders is less.\nDebenture holders get periodical interest.\nBond holders receive accrued payment upon completion of the term.\nIn the Indian securities markets, the term \u2018bond\u2019 is used\u00a0for debt instruments issued by the Central and State governments\u00a0and public sector organizations and the term \u2018debenture\u2019 is used for\u00a0instruments issued by private corporate sector.\n2. Derivative Market [Financial Derivatives + Commodity Derivatives]\n\nDerivative is a product whose value is derived from the value of one or more basic\u00a0variables, called bases (underlying asset, index, or reference rate), in a contractual manner.\u00a0The underlying asset can be equity, forex, commodity or any other asset. For example,\u00a0wheat farmers may wish to sell their harvest at a future date to eliminate the risk of\u00a0a change in prices by that date. Such a transaction is an example of a derivative. The\u00a0price of this derivative is driven by the spot price of wheat which is the \u201cunderlying\u201d. Derivatives are securities under the SC(R)A and hence the trading of derivatives is governed\u00a0by the regulatory framework under the SC(R)A. In the Indian context the Securities Contracts (Regulation) Act, 1956 (SC(R)A) defines\u00a0\u201cderivative\u201d to include \u2013\n\nA security derived from a debt instrument, share, loan whether secured or unsecured,\u00a0risk instrument or contract for differences or any other form of security.\nA contract, which derives its value from the prices, or index of prices, of underlying\u00a0securities.\nDerivative products initially emerged as hedging devices against\u00a0fluctuations in commodity prices and commodity-linked derivatives\u00a0remained the sole form of such products for almost three hundred\u00a0years. The financial derivatives came into spotlight in post-1970\u00a0period due to growing instability in the financial markets. However,\u00a0since their emergence, these products have become very popular and\u00a0by 1990s, they accounted for about two thirds of total transactions in\u00a0derivative products.\nThe following three broad categories of participants \u2013 hedgers,\u00a0speculators, and arbitrageurs trade in the derivatives market.\nDerivative contracts have several variants. The most common variants are forwards, futures,\u00a0options and swaps.\nDERIVATIVE CONTRACT INSTRUMENTS\nForwards: A forward contract is a customized contract between two entities, where settlement takes place on a specific date in the future at today\u2019s pre-agreed price.\nFutures: A futures contract is an agreement between two parties to buy or sell an asset at a certain time in the future at a certain price. Futures contracts are special types of forward contracts in the sense that the former are standardized exchange traded contracts.\nOptions: Options are of two types \u2013 calls and puts. Calls give the buyer the right\u00a0but not the obligation to buy a given quantity of the underlying asset, at a given price on or before a given future date. Puts give the buyer the right, but not the obligation to sell a given quantity of the underlying asset at a given price on or before a given date.\nWarrants: Options generally have lives of up to one year, the majority of options traded on options exchanges having a maximum maturity of nine months. Longer dated options are called warrants and are generally traded over-the-counter.\nLEAPS: The acronym LEAPS means Long-Term Equity Anticipation Securities. These are options having a maturity of up to three years.\nBaskets: Basket options are options on portfolios of underlying assets. The underlying asset is usually a moving average or a basket of assets. Equity index options are a form of basket options.\nSwaps: Swaps are private agreements between two parties to exchange cash flows in the future according to a prearranged formula. They can be regarded as portfolios of forward contracts. The two commonly used swaps are: Interest rate swaps: These entail swapping only the interest related cash flows between the parties in the same currency and Currency swaps: These entail swapping both principal and interest between the parties, with the cash flows in one direction being in a different currency than those in the opposite direction.\nSwaptions: Swaptions are options to buy or sell a swap that will become operative at the expiry of the options. Thus a swaption is an option on a forward swap. Rather than have calls and puts, the swaptions market has receiver swaptions and payer swaptions. A receiver swaption is an option to receive fixed and pay floating. A payer swaption is an option to pay fixed and receive floating.\n3. Commodity Market [Commodity Derivatives]\n\nCommodity derivatives work almost the same way as financial derivatives, however with some differences.\u00a0In the case of financial derivatives,\u00a0most of these contracts are cash settled. Even in the case of physical settlement, financial\u00a0assets are not bulky and do not need special facility for storage. Due to the bulky nature\u00a0of the underlying assets, physical settlement in commodity derivatives creates the need\u00a0for warehousing. Similarly, the concept of varying quality of asset does not really exist\u00a0as far as financial underlying is concerned.\n\n4. Equity Market\n\nEquity, also called shares or scripts, is the basic building blocks of a company. A company\u2019s\u00a0ownership is determined on the basis of its shareholding. The BSE Sensex is the most popular index that tracks the movements of shares of 30\u00a0blue-chip companies on a weighted average basis. The rise and fall in the value of the\u00a0Sensex, measured in points, broadly indicates the price-movement of the value of shares. SEBI is the regulator of equity market in India.\n\nAlso read: Debt Sustainability\n\nNon-Securities Market\n\nMutual funds, Bank Deposits, Provident Fund, Post \u2013 office savings, Insurance etc. forms part of non-securities market.\n\nAlso read: Budget Documents Made Simple\n\nWhat is a Mutual Fund?\n\nA Mutual Fund is a body corporate registered with SEBI (Securities\u00a0Exchange Board of India) that pools money from individuals/corporate investors and invests the same in a variety of different\u00a0financial instruments or securities such as equity shares, Government\u00a0securities, Bonds, debentures, commercial paper\u00a0etc. Mutual funds can thus be considered\u00a0as financial intermediaries in the investment business that collect\u00a0funds from the public and invest on behalf of the investors. Mutual\u00a0funds issue units to the investors. The appreciation of the portfolio\u00a0or securities in which the mutual fund has invested the money leads\u00a0to an appreciation in the value of the units held by investors."

For most of us, these are terms not very easy to understand or explain.\n\nIn this post we attempt explain the concept behind speculation and investment in layman\u2019s terms. We have used online sources like encyclopedia.com, investopedia.com etc. along with NOS and CBSE texts for reference.\n\nThe knowledge on these areas might turn quite handy for those with economics optional. Since UPSC Civil Services Interview also revolve around conceptual knowledge, understanding the fundamentals of economics always helps.\n\nTable of Contents\n\nOverview\nSpeculation Transaction vs Investment Transactions\nSpeculation : As a matter of basic intention\nParticipants in the the derivative Market : Hedgers, Speculators and Arbitrageurs\nArbitrageurs\nHedgers\nSpeculators\nThe concept of Short Selling\nOverview\n\nLet\u2019s discuss the overview this topic.\n\nSpeculation Transaction vs Investment Transactions\n\nThe buyers and sellers at the stock exchange undertake mainly two types of operations, one for\u00a0speculation and the other for investment.\n\nInvestors: Those who buy securities primarily to earn a\u00a0regular income from such investment and possibly make some long-term gain on account\u00a0of price rise in future are called investors. They take delivery of the securities and make full\u00a0payment of the price. Such transactions are called investment transactions.\n\nSpeculators:\u00a0When the securities are bought with the sole object of selling them in future at higher\u00a0prices or these are sold now with the intention of buying at a lower price in future, are\u00a0called speculation transactions. The main objective of such transactions is to take advantage\u00a0of price differential at different times. The stock exchange also provides for settlement of\u00a0such transactions even by receiving or paying, as the case may be, just the difference in\u00a0prices.\n\n\ud83d\udc49 Which year are YOU targeting for success in the IAS/IPS/IFS Exam? \ud83d\ude80\n\n(1) \u21d2 UPSC 2025: Prelims cum Mains\n\n(2) \u21d2 UPSC 2026: Prelims cum Mains\n\n(3) \u21d2 UPSC 2027 Prelims cum Mains\n\nTip: Know more about ClearIAS Courses (Online/Offline)\n\nFor example, Ramu bought 200 shares of Tata Steel Ltd. at Rs. 210 per share\u00a0and sold them at Rs. 235 per share. He does not take and give delivery of the shares but\u00a0settles the transactions by receiving the difference in prices amounting to Rs. 5,000 minus\u00a0brokerage. In another case, Manu bought 200 shares of ONGC Ltd. at Rs.\u00a087 per share and sold them at Rs. 69 per share. He settles these transactions by simply\u00a0paying the difference amounting to Rs. 3600 plus brokerage. However, now-a days stock\u00a0exchanges have a system of rolling settlement. Such facility is limited only to transactions\u00a0of purchase and sale made on the same day, as no carry forward is allowed.\n\nSpeculation : As a matter of basic intention\n\nThough speculation and investment are different in some respects, in practice it is difficult\u00a0to say who is a genuine investor and who is a pure speculator. Sometimes even a person\u00a0who has purchased the shares as a long-term investment may suddenly decide to sell to\u00a0reap the benefit if the price of the share goes up too high or do it to avoid heavy loss if the\u00a0prices starts declining steeply.\n\nBut he cannot be called a speculator because his basic\u00a0intention has been to invest. It is only when a person\u2019s basic intention is to take advantage\u00a0of a change in prices, and not to invest, then the transaction may be termed as speculation.\n\nSpeculation = Settlement by paying difference in price without delivery of securities\n\nIn strict technical terms, however, the transaction is regarded as speculative only if it is\u00a0settled by receiving or paying the difference in prices without involving the delivery of\u00a0securities. It is so because, in practice, it is quite difficult to ascertain the intention.\u00a0Some people regard speculation as nothing but gambling and consider it as an evil.\n\nBut it\u00a0is not true because while speculation is based on foresight and hard calculation, gambling\u00a0is a kind of blind and reckless activity involving high degree of chance element.\n\nNo only that, speculation is a legal activity duly recognized as a prerequisite for the success of stock exchange operations while gambling is regarded as an evil and a punishable activity. However, reckless speculation may take the form of gambling and should be avoided.\n\nParticipants in the the derivative Market : Hedgers, Speculators and Arbitrageurs\n\nThe following three broad categories of participants \u2013 hedgers,\u00a0speculators, and arbitrageurs trade in the derivatives market.\n\nArbitrageurs\n\nArbitrage is the simultaneous purchase and sale of equivalent assets at prices which guarantee a fixed profit at the time of the transactions, although the life of the assets and, hence, the consummation of the profit may be delayed until some future date.\n\nThe key element in the definition is that the amount of profit be determined with certainty. It specifically excludes transactions which guarantee a minimum rate of return but which also offer an option for increased profits.\u00a0Arbitrageurs are in\u00a0business to take advantage of a discrepancy between prices in two different markets (Eg : NSE and BSE) .\n\nIf, for example, they see the futures price of an asset getting out of line with the cash\u00a0price, they will take offsetting positions in the two markets to lock in a profit.\n\nHedgers\n\nHedging is the simultaneous purchase and sale of two assets in the expectation of a gain from different subsequent movements in the price of those assets. Usually the two assets are equivalent in all respects except maturity.\u00a0Hedgers face risk associated\u00a0with the price of an asset. They use futures or options markets to reduce or eliminate\u00a0this risk.\n\nSpeculators\n\nSpeculation is the purchase or sale of an asset in the expectation of a gain from changes in the price of that asset.\u00a0Speculators wish to bet on future movements in the price of an asset. Futures\u00a0and options contracts can give them an extra leverage; that is, they can increase both\u00a0the potential gains and potential losses in a speculative venture. Day traders are speculators.\n\nNB : While Hedgers look to protect against a price change, speculators look to make profit from a price change. Also,\u00a0the hedger gives up some opportunity in exchange for reduced risk. The speculator on the other hand acquires opportunity in exchange for taking on risk.\n\nPS : Speculation involves high risk. Arbitrage involves limited risk. Hedging is done to avoid risk.\nThe concept of Short Selling\n\nShort selling is the sale of a security that is not owned by the seller, or that the seller has borrowed. Short selling is motivated by the belief that a security\u2019s price\u00a0will decline, enabling it to be bought back at a lower price to make a profit.\n\nShort selling may be prompted by speculation, or by the desire to hedge the downside risk of a long position in the same security or a related one. The risk of loss on a short sale is theoretically infinite."

The SEBI Chairman would have the authority to order \u201csearch and seizure operations\u201d. The amended law would also allow Securities and Exchange Board of India to seek information, such as telephone call data records, from any persons or entities in respect to any securities transaction being investigated by it.

(Equity capital is the invested money that, in contrast to debt capital, is not repaid to the investors in the normal course of business.) For example, in a company, the total equity capital of Rs 5,00,00,000 is divided into 50,00,000 units of Rs 10 each. Each such unit of Rs 10 is called a Share. Thus, the company then is said to have 50,00,000 equity shares of Rs 10 each.\n\nNB: The holders of such shares are members of the company and\u00a0have voting rights.\n\nAlso read: Stock Market Regulations in India\n\nWhat is meant by a Stock Exchange?\n\nThe Securities Contract (Regulation) Act, 1956 [SCRA] defines\u00a0\u2018Stock Exchange\u2019 as any body of individuals, whether incorporated\u00a0or not, constituted for the purpose of assisting, regulating or\u00a0controlling the business of buying, selling or dealing in securities.\u00a0Stock exchange could be a regional stock exchange or\nnational exchanges.\n\nWhat is a Depository?\n\nA depository is like a bank wherein the deposits are securities (viz.\u00a0shares, debentures, bonds, government securities, units etc.) in\u00a0electronic form.\u00a0At present there are two depositories in India, National Securities Depository Limited (NSDL) and Central Depository Services (CDS).\u00a0The minimum networth stipulated by SEBI for a depository is Rs 100 crore. A depository provides the following services:\n\nDematerialisation (demat), ie. is converting physical certificates to electronic form.\nRematerialisation (remat), i.e. getting physical certificates from the electronic securities.\nTransfer of securities or change of beneficial ownership.\nSettlement of trades done on exchange connected to the Depository.\nWhat is a Depository Participant (DP)?\n\nA Depository Participant (DP) is an agent of the depository through which it interfaces with the investor and provides depository services. Public financial institutions, scheduled commercial banks, foreign banks operating in India with the approval of the Reserve Bank of India, state financial corporations, custodians, stock-brokers, clearing corporations /clearing houses, NBFCs and Registrar to an Issue or Share Transfer Agent complying with the requirements prescribed by SEBI can be registered as DP.\n\n\ud83d\udc49 Which year are YOU targeting for success in the IAS/IPS/IFS Exam? \ud83d\ude80\n\n(1) \u21d2 UPSC 2025: Prelims cum Mains\n\n(2) \u21d2 UPSC 2026: Prelims cum Mains\n\n(3) \u21d2 UPSC 2027 Prelims cum Mains\n\nTip: Know more about ClearIAS Courses (Online/Offline)\n\nIn India, there are around 288 Depository Participants of NSDL which are registered with SEBI.

Transfer of resources from\u00a0those having idle resources (investors) to others who have a need for\u00a0them (corporates) is most efficiently achieved through the securities\u00a0market. Stated formally, securities markets provide channels for\u00a0reallocation of savings to investments and entrepreneurship. Savings\u00a0are linked to investments by a variety of intermediaries, through a\u00a0range of financial products, called \u2018Securities\u2019.\n\nAlso read: SEBI (Securities and Exchange Board of India)\n\nWhat is the role of the \u2018Primary Market\u2019?\n\nThe primary market provides the channel for sale of new securities.\u00a0Primary market provides opportunity to issuers of securities;\u00a0Government as well as corporates, to raise resources to meet their\u00a0requirements of investment and/or discharge some obligation. They\u00a0may issue the securities at face value, or at a discount/premium and\u00a0these securities may take a variety of forms such as equity, debt etc.\u00a0They may issue the securities in domestic market and/or international\u00a0market.\n\nWhy do companies need to issue shares to the public?\n\nMost companies are usually started privately by their promoter(s).\u00a0However, the promoters\u2019 capital and the borrowings from banks and\u00a0financial institutions may not be sufficient for setting up or running the\u00a0business over a long term. So companies invite the public to contribute\u00a0towards the equity and issue shares to individual investors. The way\u00a0to invite share capital from the public is through a \u2018Public Issue\u2019.\u00a0Simply stated, a public issue is an offer to the public to subscribe to\u00a0the share capital of a company. Once this is done, the company allots\u00a0shares to the applicants as per the prescribed rules and regulations\u00a0laid down by SEBI.\n\nWhat is an Initial Public Offer (IPO)?\n\nAn Initial Public Offer (IPO) is the selling of securities to the public\u00a0in the primary market. It is when an unlisted company makes either\u00a0a fresh issue of securities or an offer for sale of its existing securities\u00a0or both for the first time to the public. This paves way for listing and\u00a0trading of the issuer\u2019s securities. The sale of securities can be either\u00a0through book building or through normal public issue.\n\nWhat is a Prospectus ?\n\nA large number of new companies float public issues. While a large\u00a0number of these companies are genuine, quite a few may want to\u00a0exploit the investors. Therefore, it is very important that an investor\u00a0before applying for any issue identifies future potential of a company.\u00a0A part of the guidelines issued by SEBI (Securities and Exchange\u00a0Board of India) is the disclosure of 23 information to the public.\u00a0This disclosure includes information like the reason for raising the\u00a0money, the way money is proposed to be spent, the return expected\u00a0on the money etc. This information is in the form of \u2018Prospectus\u2019\u00a0which also includes information regarding the size of the issue, the\u00a0current status of the company, its equity capital, its current and past\u00a0performance, the promoters, the project, cost of the project, means of\u00a0financing, product and capacity etc. It also contains lot of mandatory\u00a0information regarding underwriting and statutory compliances. This\u00a0helps investors to\u00a0evaluate short term and long term prospects of the\u00a0company.\n\nWhat is meant by Market Capitalisation?\n\nThe market value of a quoted company, which is calculated by\u00a0multiplying its current share price (market price) by the number of\u00a0shares in issue is called as market capitalization. E.g. Company A has\u00a0120 crore shares in issue. The current market price is Rs. 100. The\u00a0market capitalisation of company A is Rs. 12000 crore.\n\nWhat is meant by Secondary market?\n\nSecondary market refers to a market where securities are traded after\u00a0being initially offered to the public in the primary market and/or\u00a0listed on the Stock Exchange. Majority of the trading is done in the\u00a0secondary market. Secondary market comprises of equity markets\u00a0and the debt markets.\n\nWhat is a Contract Note?\n\nContract Note is a confirmation of trades done on a particular day\u00a0on behalf of the client by a trading member (stock broker). It imposes a legally\u00a0enforceable relationship between the client and the trading member\u00a0with respect to purchase/sale and settlement of trades. It also helps to\u00a0settle disputes/claims between the investor and the trading member. It\u00a0is a prerequisite for filing a complaint or arbitration proceeding against\u00a0the trading member in case of a dispute. A valid contract note should\u00a0be in the prescribed form, contain the details of trades, stamped with\u00a0requisite value and duly signed by the authorized signatory. Contract\u00a0notes are kept in duplicate, the trading member and the client should\u00a0keep one copy each. After verifying the details contained therein,\u00a0the client keeps one copy and returns the second copy to the trading\u00a0member duly acknowledged by him.\n\nWhat is Insider Trading?\n\nInsider trading is defined as a malpractice wherein trade of a company\u2019s securities is undertaken by people who by virtue of their work have access to the otherwise non public information, which can be crucial for making investment decisions. When insiders (e.g. key employees or executives who have access to the strategic information about the company) use their strategic information for trading in the company\u2019s stocks or securities, it is called insider trading and is highly discouraged by the Securities and Exchange Board of India to promote fair trading in the market for the benefit of the common investor.\n\nBull Market vs Bear Market\n\nA bull market is a \u00a0financial market of a group of securities in which prices are rising or are expected to rise.\u00a0Bull markets are characterized by optimism, investor confidence and expectations that strong results will continue.\n\nBear market refers to a market condition in which the prices of securities are falling, and widespread pessimism causes the negative sentiment to be self-sustaining. As investors anticipate losses in a bear market and selling continues, pessimism only grows.\u00a0A bear market should not be confused with a correction, which is a short-term trend that has a duration of less than two months.\n\n[References : NSE, SEBI and Investopedia.]"

But modern economists extend the term to include access to health care, education, and even transportation.\n\nPoverty is often further divided into absolute poverty and relative poverty.\n\nTable of Contents\n\nPoverty Definition by the United Nations (UN)\nPoverty Definition by the World Bank\nPoverty Estimation by Dr Amartya Sen\nPoverty Line\nThe Global Multidimensional Poverty Index (MPI)\nGlobal MPI 2020\n3 Dimensions and 10 Indicators in MPI\nThe need for understanding multiple connotations\nPoverty Estimation in India\nPoverty alleviation programs in India\nEmployment programmes and skill-building\nFood and shelter\nAccess to credit\nChallenges\nWay Forward\nAccelerating rural poverty reduction:\nCreating more and better jobs\nFocusing on women and Scheduled Tribes\nImproving human development outcomes for the poor\nPoverty Definition by the United Nations (UN)\n\nFundamentally, poverty is a denial of choices and opportunities, a violation of human dignity.\n\nIt means a lack of basic capacity to participate effectively in society.\nIt means not having enough to feed and cloth[e] a family, not having a school or clinic to go to, not having the land on which to grow one\u2019s food or a job to earn one\u2019s living, not having access to credit.\nIt means insecurity, powerlessness, and exclusion of individuals, households, and communities.\nIt means susceptibility to violence, and it often implies living in marginal or fragile environments, without access to clean water or sanitation.\n\nAs per the United Nations Organisation (UN), poverty entails more than the lack of income and productive resources to ensure sustainable livelihoods. Its manifestations include hunger and malnutrition, limited access to education and other basic services, social discrimination and exclusion, as well as the lack of participation in decision-making.\n\nPoverty Definition by the World Bank\n\nIn 1990, the World Bank introduced the concept of \u2018poverty line\u2019 to capture absolute poverty. Then, it was set at $1 per day.\n\n\ud83d\udc49 Which year are YOU targeting for success in the IAS/IPS/IFS Exam? \ud83d\ude80\n\n(1) \u21d2 UPSC 2025: Prelims cum Mains\n\n(2) \u21d2 UPSC 2026: Prelims cum Mains\n\n(3) \u21d2 UPSC 2027 Prelims cum Mains\n\nTip: Know more about ClearIAS Courses (Online/Offline)\n\nAs per the revised measures (2017), the World Bank defines extreme poverty as someone living on less than US$1.90 per day. This figure is known as the International Poverty Line (IPL).\n\nIn an attempt to be more precise with its classifications, the organization recently added new standards of poverty for people living in middle and high-income countries. Now, poverty lines are set at $3.20 a day for people in \u201clower-middle-income\u201d countries, such as Egypt or India, and $5.50 a day for \u201cupper-middle-income\u201d countries, such as Jamaica or South Africa. The World Bank also released a third standard for high-income countries, like the US, at $21.70 a day.\n\nIn 2018, the World Bank introduced a Societal Poverty Line (SPL), to capture the relative aspect of poverty. The SPL is a hybrid line, combining the US$1.90-a-day absolute poverty line with a relative component that increases as median consumption or income in an economy rises.\n\nHowever, no single indicator can capture the multiple dimensions of poverty.\n\nPoverty Estimation by Dr Amartya Sen\n\nDr Amartya Sen provided a useful alternative to understanding poverty.\n\nHis capability approach to understanding poverty goes beyond income and stresses the whole range of means, available to achieve human capabilities such as literacy, longevity, and access to income.\n\nPoverty Line\n\nThe conventional approach to measuring poverty is to specify a minimum expenditure (or income) required to purchase a basket of goods and services necessary to satisfy basic human needs. This minimum expenditure is called the poverty line.\n\nThe basket of goods and services necessary to satisfy basic human needs is the Poverty Line Basket (PLB).\n\nThe proportion of the population below the poverty line is called the poverty ratio or headcount ratio (HCR).\n\nMost countries and international institutions (World Bank, United Nations, etc.) follow a similar approach to counting the poor.\n\nAlso read: Economic and Social Development \u2013 Sustainable Development, Poverty, Inclusion, Demographics, Social Sector Initiatives, etc.\n\nThe Global Multidimensional Poverty Index (MPI)\n\nThe Global Multidimensional Poverty Index (MPI) is an international measure of multidimensional poverty covering 107 developing countries.\n\nGlobal MPI was first developed in 2010 by the Oxford Poverty and Human Development Initiative (OPHI) and the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) for UNDP\u2019s Human Development Reports.\n\nThe Global MPI is released at the High-Level Political Forum (HLPF) on Sustainable Development of the United Nations in July, every year.\n\nGlobal MPI 2020\n\nThe Global Multidimensional Poverty Index (MPI) compares acute multidimensional poverty for 107 countries in developing regions. These countries are home to 5.9 billion people, three-quarters of the world\u2019s population.\n\nOf these people, 1.3 billion people (22%) are identified by the global MPI as multidimensionally poor as per the Global Multidimensional Poverty Index 2020.\n\nAccording to Global MPI 2020, India is 62nd among 107 countries with an MPI score of 0.123 and a\u00a027.91% headcount ratio, based on the NFHS 4 (2015/16) data.\n\n3 Dimensions and 10 Indicators in MPI\n\nThe MPI assesses poverty at the individual level.\n\nIf a person is deprived in a third or more of ten (weighted) indicators, the global MPI identifies them as \u2018MPI poor\u2019.\n\nThe extent \u2013 or intensity \u2013 of their poverty is also measured through the percentage of deprivations they are experiencing.\n\nHealth\tNutrition\tAny adult under 70 years of age or any child for whom there is nutritional information is undernourished.\nChild mortality\tAny child under the age of 18 years has died in the family in the five-year period preceding the survey.\nEducation\tYears of schooling\tNo household member aged \u2018school entrance age + six years or older have completed six years of schooling.\nSchool attendance\tAny school-aged child is not attending school up to the age at which he/she would complete class eight.\nStandard of living\tCooking Fuel\tThe household cooks with dung, wood, charcoal or coal.\nSanitation\tThe household\u2019s sanitation facility is not improved (according to SDG guidelines) or it is improved but shared with other households.\nDrinking-Water\tThe household does not have access to improved drinking water (according to SDG guidelines) or improved drinking water is at least a 30-minute walk from home, round trip.\nElectricity\tThe household has no electricity.\nHousing\tAt least one of the three housing materials for roof, walls and floor are inadequate: the floor is of natural materials and/or the roof and/or walls are of natural or rudimentary materials.\nAssets\tThe household does not own more than one of these assets: radio, television, telephone, computer, animal cart, bicycle, motorbike or refrigerator, and does not own a car or truck.\n\nOther parameters include:\n\ndisempowerment\npoor quality of work\nsocial exclusion\nrural-urban disparity\nthe threat of violence,\nliving in environmentally hazardous areas\nThe need for understanding multiple connotations\nMonetary-based poverty measures are inadequate: In most cases, not all individuals who are income-poor are multidimensionally poor, and not all multidimensionally poor individuals are income-poor.\nEconomic growth does not always reduce poverty or deprivation.\u00a0Several studies have found that economic growth is not strongly associated with a reduction in other deprivations, such as child malnutrition or child mortality.\nPoverty as multidimensional: Poor people describe ill-being to include poor health, nutrition, lack of adequate sanitation and clean water, social exclusion, low education, bad housing conditions, violence, shame, disempowerment, and much more.\nNeed for more policy-relevant information on poverty, so that policymakers are better equipped to deal with it: For example, an area in which most people are deprived of education requires a different poverty reduction strategy from an area in which most people are deprived of housing conditions.\nPoverty Estimation in India\n\nIn India, the first official rural and urban poverty lines at the national level were introduced in 1979 by Y. K. Alagh Committee and official poverty counts began for the first time.\n\nLater, in 1993, the D. T. Lakdawala Committee extended these poverty lines to states and over time allowing official poverty counts over time and in the states.\n\nIn 2005, recognizing that the rural poverty line was too low, the government appointed the Tendulkar committee to take a fresh look at the poverty lines. Reporting in 2009, the Tendulkar Committee revised upward the rural poverty line. Continued media criticisms led the government to appoint the Rangarajan Committee in 2012.\n\nReporting in June 2014, the Rangarajan Committee recommended raising further both the rural and urban poverty lines. The decision is yet to be taken on the Rangarajan Committee recommendations.\n\nTherefore, the Tendulkar poverty line remains the official poverty line and is the basis of the current official poverty estimates in 1993-94, 2004-05, and 2011-12.\n\nNote: As per the Tendulkar estimation, the percentage of people living below the poverty line in India is 21.9%. However, as per Rangarajan\u2019s estimation, the percentage of people living below the poverty line in India is 29.5%.\n\nAlso read: Urban Poverty\n\nPoverty alleviation programs in India\n\nIndia has been conducting various poverty alleviation programs.\n\nEmployment programmes and skill-building\nJawahar Gram Samriddhi Yojana:\u00a0The JRY was meant to generate meaningful employment opportunities for the unemployed and underemployed in rural areas through the creation of economic infrastructure and community and social assets.\nMahatma Gandhi National Rural Employment Guarantee Act (MGNREGA) 2005: The Act provides 100 days of assured employment every year to every rural household. One-third of the proposed jobs would be reserved for women. Under the programme, if an applicant is not employed within 15 days s/he will be entitled to a daily unemployment allowance.\nNational Rural Livelihood Mission: Ajeevika (2011): It evolves out the need to diversify the needs of the rural poor and provide them jobs with regular income every month. Self Help Groups are formed at the village level to help the needy.\nNational Urban Livelihood Mission: The NULM focuses on organizing urban poor in Self Help Groups, creating opportunities for skill development leading to market-based employment and helping them to set up self-employment ventures by ensuring easy access to credit.\nPradhan Mantri Kaushal Vikas Yojana: It will focus on the fresh entrants to the labor market, especially the labor market and class X and XII dropouts.\nFood and shelter\nFood for Work Programme:\u00a0It aims at enhancing food security through wage employment. Food grains are supplied to states free of cost, however, the supply of food grains from the Food Corporation of India (FCI) godowns has been slow.\nAnnapurna: This scheme was started by the government in 1999\u20132000 to provide food to senior citizens who cannot take care of themselves and are not under the National Old Age Pension Scheme (NOAPS). This scheme would provide 10 kg of free food grains a month for eligible senior citizens. They mostly target groups of \u2018poorest of the poor\u2019 and \u2018indigent senior citizens\u2019.\nPradhan Mantri Awaas Yojana: It has two components: Pradhan Mantri Awaas Yojana (Grameen) and Pradhan Mantri Awaas Yojana (Urban). It was launched in 2015. It unites schemes like Ujjwala Yojana (provides LPG to BPL), access to toilets, water, and drinking water facilities, and Saubhagya Yojana (electricity).\nOther schemes like the Integrated Child Development Program, Midday Meal scheme, etc are also providing food to the needy sections like children and women.\nAccess to credit\nPradhan Mantri Kisan Samman Nidhi: This scheme aims to provide financial assistance to provide working capital support to all the landholding farmers. This brings in the idea of universal basic income for the farmers in India.\nPradhan Mantri Jan Dhan Yojana: It aimed at direct benefit transfer of subsidy, pension, insurance, etc., and attained the target of opening 1.5 crore bank accounts. The scheme particularly targets the unbanked poor.\nIntegrated Rural Development Programme (IRDP): It was introduced in 1978-79 and aimed at assisting the rural poor in the form of subsidy and bank credit for productive employment opportunities through successive plan periods.\nChallenges\nThe incidence of extreme poverty continues to be much higher in rural areas than in urban areas.\nDespite rapid growth and development,\u00a0an unacceptably high proportion of our population continues to suffer from severe and multidimensional deprivation.\u00a0\nWhile a large number of poverty alleviation programmes have been initiated, they function in silos. There is\u00a0no systematic attempt to identify people who are in poverty, determine their needs, address them, and enable them to move above the poverty line.\nThe\u00a0resources allocated to anti-poverty programmes are inadequate and there is a tacit understanding that targets will be curtailed according to fund availability. For instance, the Mahatma Gandhi National Rural Employment Guarantee Act does not provide the guaranteed 100 days of work in many states.\nThere is\u00a0no method to ensure that programmes reach everybody they are meant for.\nLack of proper implementation and right targeting\nThere has been a\u00a0lot of overlapping of schemes.\nEvery year a huge number is added to the population pool of the country.\u00a0This renders the scheme ineffective.\nWay Forward\n\nThe World Health Organization has described poverty as the greatest cause of suffering on earth. Poverty eradication should not be the goal of the government but the goal of the government policies should be to create prosperity. Both monetary and non-monetary measures of poverty are needed to better inform the policies intended to address the needs and deprivations faced by poor populations.\n\nAccelerating rural poverty reduction:\nIt\u2019s\u00a0not just about agricultural growth, which has long been considered the key driver of poverty reduction. Rural India is not predominantly agricultural and shares many of the economic conditions of smaller urban areas.\nCapitalizing on the growing connectivity between rural and urban areas, and between the agriculture, industry, and services sectors, has been effective in the past.\nCreating more and better jobs\nFuture efforts will need to address job creation in more productive sectors, which has until now been lukewarm and has yielded few salaried jobs that offer stability and security.\nFocusing on women and Scheduled Tribes\nThe most worrying trends are the\u00a0low participation of women in the labour market and the\u00a0slow progress among scheduled tribes.\nIndia\u2019s women\u00a0have been\u00a0withdrawing from the labour force since 2005and less than one-third of working-age women are now in the labour force. As a result, India today ranks last among BRICS countries, and close to the bottom in South Asia in female labour force participation.\nScheduled Tribes\u00a0started with the highest poverty rates of all of India\u2019s social groups, and have progressed more slowly than the rest.\nWomen and Scheduled Tribes\u00a0are at risk of being locked out of India\u2019s growth and prosperity.\nImproving human development outcomes for the poor\nThe recent past shows that some problems, such as\u00a0undernutrition and open defecation, are endemic and not only confined to the poor but others too, and have not improved with economic growth.\nBetter health, sanitation, and education will not only help raise the productivity of millions, they will also empower the people to meet their aspirations and provide the country with new drivers of economic growth.\n\nTogether with mooting the discussion on the need to provide a universal basic income, infrastructural and skill development combined with effective implementation of welfare policies will go a long way in eradicating poverty in the country.\n\nRead:\u00a0Household Consumption Expenditure Survey (HCES)"

Read further to know more.\n\nHuman capital, unlike physical capital, is intangible.\n\nYou all may have heard of the term \u2018capital\u2019 in economics. Adam Smith defines capital as \u201cThat part of man\u2019s stock which he expects to afford him revenue\u201d. Capital is one of the four factors of production \u2013 land, labour, and entrepreneurship being the other three.\n\nThere are many types of capital. However, for time being, we shall focus our discussion on two types of capital \u2013 physical capital and human capital.\n\nTable of Contents\n\nPhysical Capital vs Human Capital\nWhat is Human Capital?\nHuman Capital vs Human Resource\nHuman capital definition\nTo Increase Human Capital, Where should you invest?\nHuman Capital vs Human Development\nFocus on Human Development\nWhere does India stand in terms of Human Capital or Human Development?\nHuman Development Agenda of the Government\nDemographic Dividend: Advantage of India\nHuman Development Report\nHuman Development Index 2018\nSustainable Development Goals (SDG)\nGovernment\u2019s role in building human capital\nHuman Capital as per the Economic Survey of India\nGovernment Expenditure on Human Development\nConclusion\nPhysical Capital vs Human Capital\n\nPhysical Capital:\u00a0Physical capital is related to the non-human assets which help in the production process. \u00a0It includes machinery, buildings, computers, etc \u2013 which is tangible in nature. Physical capital is divided into 2 categories \u2013 working capital and fixed capital.\n\nHuman Capital: Human capital is connected with human assets \u2013 education, health, or skills. It cannot be touched, however, it can be measured and analysed.\n\n\ud83d\udc49 Which year are YOU targeting for success in the IAS/IPS/IFS Exam? \ud83d\ude80\n\n(1) \u21d2 UPSC 2025: Prelims cum Mains\n\n(2) \u21d2 UPSC 2026: Prelims cum Mains\n\n(3) \u21d2 UPSC 2027 Prelims cum Mains\n\nTip: Know more about ClearIAS Courses (Online/Offline)\n\nWhat is Human Capital?\n\nHuman capital is a term that denotes the monetary value of the knowledge, skills, and competencies of a person.\n\nTo calculate the human capital of an individual, you need to take his earnings today and add with it what he is likely to earn in future.\n\nHuman Capital vs Human Resource\n\nIn the manufacturing economy, humans are counted as \u2018labour\u2019 \u2013 one of the four factors of production. In that sense, an individual is a resource \u2013 ie. labour/worker.\n\nHowever, as we moved from a manufacturing economy to an informational economy, there is a paradigm shift in the way humans are seen. A human being is now not seen as a resource/labour, but rather is seen as an asset or capital. Hence the term \u2018Human Capital\u2019. Remember what we mentioned in the beginning \u2013 capital is also one of the four factors of production.\n\nHuman capital definition\n\nAccording to the OECD, human capital is defined as:\n\n\u201cthe knowledge, skills, competencies and other attributes embodied in individuals or groups of individuals acquired during their life and used to produce goods, services or ideas in market circumstances\u201d.\n\nHuman capital is viewed in terms of its value with respect to an organization or country.\n\nTo Increase Human Capital, Where should you invest?\n\nGenerally, human capital formation is considered as the outcome of investments in\n\neducation\nhealth\nskill/on-the-job training\nmigration\ninformation/digital literacy\n\nClearly, three of the most important pillars of human capital are Education, Health and Skills/Employment.\n\nThese are precisely the three vehicles through which various governments are focusing to build the human capital of next-generation citizens.\n\nIn this article we will focus on human capital in general, emphasizing on Human Development Report. We have already written on Education, Health, and Skill/Employment, however, you can expect more elaborate articles on the same from us in future, covering the entire gamut of human capital.\n\nHuman Capital vs Human Development\n\nThough both terms are used interchangeably, there is a difference between the two concepts:\n\nHuman capital considers education, health and other investments as a means to increase labour productivity. The concept considers human beings as a means to an end; the end being the increase in productivity.\nWhereas human development considers\u00a0human beings as ends in themselves and thus\u00a0education, health etc. as their rights.\nFocus on Human Development\n\nIt is from the 7th Five Year Plan onward that we began to focus on Human Development. To quote the Plan document, \u201cHuman resources development has necessarily to be assigned a key role in any development strategy, particularly in a country with a large population.\u00a0Trained and educated on sound lines, a large population can itself become an asset in accelerating\u00a0economic growth\u00a0and\u00a0ensuring a social change in desired directions\u201c.\n\nWhere does India stand in terms of Human Capital or Human Development?\n\nIndia\u2019s achievements in this field are not that envious.\n\nIndia stands at 102/130 \u2014 Global Human Capital Index, 2017.\n\nIndia\u2019s rank in Human Development Index (HDI) 2018 is 130.\n\nAmartya Sen, in his book, \u2018An Uncertain Glory: India and Its Contradictions \u2018 opined that: India should invest in its public services. Leaving aside her per capita income, which has grown impressively, India is falling behind its neighbours in South Asia in the social indicators.\n\nHuman Development Agenda of the Government\n\nBe that as it may, human development is an important agenda in government policies. Economic Survey 2018-19 has opined that:\n\n\u2018Inclusiveness has been the cornerstone of India\u2019s development agenda. Over the last few years, efforts in this direction have been accelerated by the Government through the mantra of inclusiveness \u2018Sabka Sath, Sabka Vikas\u2019, further elaborated by ensuring \u2018Sabka Vishwas\u2019.\n\nAs India is a developing economy with resource constraints, we have to prioritize and optimize the expenditure on social infrastructure to promote sustainable and inclusive growth.\n\nIt is critical at this juncture to focus on public investments in human capital and strengthen the delivery mechanisms of government interventions to ensure transparency and accountability.\n\nWith India having the demographic advantage, improving educational standards, skilling the youth, enhancing job opportunities, reducing disease burden and empowering women will help in realizing the potential of a buoyant economy in the future.\n\nRead:\u00a0Human Development in India\n\nDemographic Dividend: Advantage of India\n\nIndia is home to the world\u2019s youngest population as half of its population is below the age of 25.\n\nThis demographic advantage in India is available for five decades from 2005-06 to 2055-56, longer than any other country in the world.\n\nThis demographic advantage can be reaped only if education, skilling, and employment opportunities are provided to the young population.\n\nRead:\u00a0Demographic Dividend\n\nHuman Development Report\n\nHuman Development Report (HDR) is published by UNDP. HDI takes into account three indicators vis, long healthy life, access to knowledge, access to a decent standard of living.\n\nHDR 2016 has opined that India\u2019s economic progress since 1991 has not been translated to human investment, resulting in a\u00a0lost decade\u00a0for India. Universalizing health and education could have pulled the population out of the poverty trap. There is a need to ask the question: who had benefited from the development and why only them?\n\nHuman Development Index 2018\n\nIndia climbed one spot to 130 out of 189 countries. India\u2019s HDI value for 2017 is 0.640, and thus India is in the medium human development category.\n\nBetween 1990 and 2017, India\u2019s HDI value increased from 0.427 to 0.640, an increase of nearly 50 percent.\u00a0Within South Asia, India\u2019s HDI value is above the average of 0.638 for the region, with Bangladesh and Pakistan, countries with similar population size, being ranked 136 and 150 respectively.\n\nBetween 1990 and 2017, India\u2019s life expectancy at birth increased by nearly 11 years, with more significant gains in expected years of schooling.\n\nToday\u2019s Indian school-age children can expect to stay in school for 4.7 years longer than in 1990.\n\nIndia\u2019s GNI per capita increased by 266.6% between 1990 and 2017.\n\nNorway, Switzerland, Australia, Ireland, and Germany lead the ranking, while Niger, the Central African Republic, South Sudan, Chad and Burundi have the lowest scores.\n\nDisparities between and within countries continue to stifle progress. Scrutiny of HDI\u2019s components reveals the unequal distribution of outcomes in education, life expectancy and income within countries. The Inequality-Adjusted Human Development Index (IHDI) compares levels of inequality within countries.\n\n26.8% of India\u2019s HDI value is lost on account of inequalities, which is more than its South Asian neighbours. This confirms that inequality remains a challenge for India as it progresses economically. State-level HDIs reveal the inter-state disparities in India.\n\nSubnational Human Development\u00a0Index (SHDI) for different States for the period 1990 and 2017, released by UNDP shows that all states have shown significant improvement in levels of human development. Most Southern and Northern States have performed much better as compared to their Eastern counterparts who have registered poor performance in SHDIs. Goa, Kerala, Himachal Pradesh, and Punjab occupy the top four positions while Bihar, UP, and MP are at the bottom.\n\nFrancine Pickup, Country Director, UNDP India said, \u201cThe Government of India is committed to improving the quality of life for all its people. The success of India\u2019s national development schemes like Beti Bachao Beti Padhao, Swachh Bharat, Make in India, and initiatives aimed at universalizing school education and health care, will be crucial in ensuring that the upward trend on human development accelerates and also achieve the Prime Minister\u2019s vision of development for all and the key principle of the Sustainable Development Goals \u2014 to leave no one behind.\u201d\n\nGender gaps in the early years are closing, but inequalities persist in adulthood. Despite considerable progress at the policy and legislative levels, women remain significantly less politically, economically and socially empowered than men. Only 39 percent of adult women have reached at least a secondary level of education as compared to 64 percent of males. Female participation in the labor market is 27.2 percent compared to 78.8 for men. India ranks 127 out of 160 countries on the Gender Inequality Index.\n\nQuality of Development should also be kept in focus apart from HDI numbers.\n\nSustainable Development Goals (SDG)\n\nThe 17 SDGs and 169 targets envisaged in the Agenda 2030 are closely interrelated with social infrastructure.\n\nWith the underlying dimensions of education and health embedded in SDGs, the improvement in the Human Development Index is also interlinked to SDGs.\n\nNITI Aayog has developed SDG India Index to measure India\u2019s performance in SDGs.\n\nSDG India Index 2018 indicates Kerala, Tamil Nadu, and Himachal Pradesh as top-performing states while Bihar, UP, Assam as the lowest performers.\n\nWe will look into specific goals of SDG which are related to Human Development in later sections.\n\nGovernment\u2019s role in building human capital\n\nSince it is hard to establish a co-relation of visible cause and effect from the growth of human capital (education, health etc.) to economic growth, there is low political will and investment in this sector. But investments in human capital can\u2019t be outsourced to private players completely. Government intervention is essential in this field because:\n\nSince education and health create both private and social benefits, both private and public institutions are needed in these fields.\nExpenditures on education and health make a substantial long-term impact and\u00a0they cannot be easily reversed, so government intervention is necessary.\nIndividual consumers of these services do not have complete information about the quality of services and their costs.\u00a0This may create monopoly\u00a0power and\u00a0exploitation by private players if adequate government regulation is not present.\nThe main role of the government is to ensure private providers of these services adhere to the standards stipulated by the government and charge the correct price.\nIn modern human rights vocabulary, these are considered vital rights of citizens.\nGovernment intervention in this area is required for improving accessibility and providing cost-effective services to the poor.\nMoreover, as per World Economic Forum, strengthening the policy and institutional ecosystem supporting inclusive growth and human capital development deserves to be a top policy priority for countries, whether they are experiencing slow growth, elevated inequality, or both. This is imperative for countries seeking to thrive in the Fourth Industrial Revolution.\n\nThus because of both the intrinsic value and instrumental value of human capital, the government should actively involve itself in this arena.\n\nWith a slew of measures and policies like New Education Policy, New Health Policy and legislation like the National Medical Commission etc., the government is focusing on milking the demographic dividend. Concurrently, as per the Economic Survey, the government\u2019s expenditure on social sector has also increased.\n\nHuman Capital as per the Economic Survey of India\n\nTo engineer an inclusive and sustainable growth for India, the social infrastructure like education, health and social protection are being given utmost priority by the Government. The Government has been enhancing the expenditure on human capital along with adopting measures to improve the efficiency of expenditure by a convergence of schemes. Several labour reform measures including legislative ones are being implemented for the creation of employment opportunities and for providing sustainable livelihoods for the population who are largely engaged in the informal economy. Bridging the gender gaps in education, skill development, employment, earnings and reducing social inequalities prevalent in the society have been the underlying goals of the development strategy to enhance human capabilities.\n\n\u2013 Economic Survey 2016-17.\n\nGovernment Expenditure on Human Development\n\nGovernment expenditure on social infrastructures like health and education reflects the government\u2019s commitment to these sectors.\n\nIt is also necessary for improving accessibility for marginal and vulnerable sections of society.\n\nThe expenditure on social services by the Centre and States as a proportion of GDP has increased by more than 1% points during the period 2014-15 to 2018-19.\n\nThe increase was spread across all social sectors.\n\nThe share of expenditure on social services out of total budgetary expenditure increased from 24.9% in 2013-14 to 26% in 2018-19.\n\nConclusion\n\nHuman capital is a term that denotes the economic value of the knowledge, skills, and competencies of a person.\n\nFor a country like India, with a one-time huge opportunity of demographic dividend, it\u2019s high time to focus on human capital.\n\nUnless, we give adequate stress to education, health and skills \u2013 we will lose this golden opportunity.\n\nAs of now, our rank in various indices \u2013 human capital and human resource \u2013 is not encouraging. Both government and private entities should give better focus on the same.\n\nArticle written by : Sethu Krishnan M, curated by ClearIAS Team"

Nalanda has the oldest university system of education in the world. Students from across the world were attracted to Indian knowledge systems.\n\nMany branches of the knowledge system had their origin in India. Education was considered a higher virtue in ancient India.\n\nHowever, the renaissance and scientific thinking as happened in Europe didn\u2019t happen in India at that time.\n\nThe British who took control of the Indian affairs by that time had different priorities. Education in British India initially lagged a lot.\n\nHowever, later, the British established the modern education system still followed in India. They replaced age-old systems of education in the country with English ways.\u00a0\n\nStill, the education system in India needs a lot of reforms.\n\nAlso read: Examination System in India\n\nCurrent Status of Education in India: Data from Census 2011\n\nLiteracy rate in India as per\u00a0Census 2011:\u00a074%.\nLiteracy rate: Male: 82.1%; Female: 65.5%\nKerala tops the rankings, followed by Delhi, Maharashtra, and Tamil Nadu.\nBihar is the lowest among states, followed by Arunachal Pradesh, Rajasthan, Jharkhand, etc., however, they are improving their position.\nBihar has a literacy rate of 63.8%, and that of women is 53.3%.\nLiteracy rates for both adults as well as youths have increased, still, the absolute number of illiterates in India is as much as India\u2019s population was at the time of independence.\nThe gender gap in terms of literacy began to narrow first in 1991 and the pace has accelerated, however still lags far behind the global female literacy rate of 7% (UNESCO 2015).\nThere are large state variations in the gender gap.\nHowever, during 2001 \u2013 2011, the male literacy rate increased by 6 percentage points but female literacy increased by nearly 12 percentage points. Achievement in female literacy in Bihar is noteworthy: from 33% in 2001 to 53% in 2011.\nBe that as it may, India is still lagging behind the world\u00a0literacy rate of 86.3%(UNESCO 2015).\u00a0A major group of states lies in the average rank i.e. just above the national level of 64.8 percent.\u00a0\nIndian Education System: The Present Pyramidal Structure\n\nThe Indian education system can broadly be considered as a pyramidal structure:\n\nPre-primary level: 5-6 years of age.\nPrimary (elementary) level: 6-14 years of age. Elementary-level education is guaranteed by our constitution under Article 21 A. For this level, the government has introduced Sarva Shiksha Abhiyan (SSA) under the Right To Education(RTE) Act.\nSecondary level: Age group between 14-18. For this level, the government has extended SSA to secondary education in the form of the Rashtriya Madhyamik Shiksha Abhiyan.\nHigher education: generally of three levels: UG\u2192 PG\u2192 MPhil/PhD. To cater to the requirements of higher education,\u00a0the government has introduced Rashtriya Uchhattar Shiksha Abhiyan(RUSA).\n\nRead: Examination System in India\n\nSustainable Development Goals (SDG) related to Education\n\nGoal 4 of SDG: Education for all \u2013 ensures equitable, inclusive, and quality education along with the promotion of lifelong learning opportunities for all by 2030.\n\nProvisions in the Indian Constitution related to Education\nUnder\u00a0Article 45 in DPSP, it was mentioned that the government should provide free and compulsory education for all children up to the age of 14 years within 10 years from the commencement of the Constitution. As this was not achieved, Article 21A was introduced by\u00a0the 86th Constitutional Amendment Act of 2002, making elementary education a fundamental right rather than a directive principle. Article 45 was amended to provide for early childhood care and education to children below the age of six years.\nTo implement Article 21A, the government legislated the RTE Act. Under this act, SSA \u2013 Sarva Shiksha Abhiyan \u2013 got a further impetus. SSA aims to provide Universalization of Elementary Education (UEE) in a time-bound manner.\nSSA has been operational since 2000-2001. Its roots go back to 1993-1994 when the District Primary Education Programme (DPEP) was launched. However, under the RTE Act, it got legal backing.\nRTE Act 2009\n86th Amendment Act 2002 introduced Article 21-A, which provides for free and compulsory education of all children in the age group of six to fourteen years as a Fundamental Right.\nThe Right of Children to Free and Compulsory Education (RTE) Act was enacted to implement this fundamental right.\nProvisions of the RTE Act\nRight of children to free and compulsory education till completion of elementary education in a neighborhood school.\n\u2018Compulsory education\u2019 means an obligation of the government to provide free elementary education and ensure compulsory admission, attendance, and completion of\u00a0elementary education.\nProvision for a non-admitted child to be admitted to an age-appropriate class.\nNorms and standards like Pupil pupil-teacher ratios (PTRs), buildings and infrastructure, school-working days, teacher-working hours, and appropriately trained and qualified teachers are\u00a0enumerated.\nRational deployment of teachers, ensuring that there is no urban-rural imbalance in their postings.\nProhibition of deployment of teachers for non-educational work, other than services like decennial census, elections, etc.\nIt prohibits (a) physical punishment and mental harassment (b) screening procedures for admission of children (c) capitation fees (d) private tuition by teachers (e) running of schools without recognition.\nDevelopment of curriculum in consonance with the values enshrined in the constitution, ensuring all-around development of the child, building a system of child-friendly and child-centered learning.\nTo further inclusiveness, 25%\u00a0reservation is provided for disadvantaged students in private schools.\nCriticisms of the RTE Act\nEven though the RTE + SSA have increased access to schools, resulting in a high enrollment rate, dropout rates increased in tandem. However, there is inadequate attention given to this scenario.\nThere is inadequate attention to the PTR:\nThere is a fear of financial burden on the government for teacher recruitment and training.\nThe grey area of teacher transfer is also not helping the cause.\nThere is a provision for the academic calendar to be decided by the local authority, but it has not been implemented.\nSince all state holidays are not relevant for all localities, such a calendar preparation by local authorities can increase attendance and can also encourage local panchayats to take ownership of schools.\nThere is a divergence between urban-rural and rich-poor education.\nRTE students in private schools are paying extra fees as the schools claim that the government fund provided for the same is not adequate.\nMost private schools treat RTE as charity and demand that the onus of universalizing education should be on the government\u2019s head rather than putting pressure on them.\n70% of students are in government schools. So it must be fixed in priority, by providing infrastructure, teacher quality, and targeted\u00a0learning\u00a0for children from\u00a0disadvantaged\u00a0groups to provide an equitable education system.\nRajya Sabha amends the RTE bill, scrapping the no-detention policy and thus\u00a0reinstating detention for students of Class V and Class VIII if they fail to pass examinations.\nUnder the RTE Act, till class 8, students should not be failed in exams. This is called the No detention policy. It had reduced dropout rates.\nThere is growing criticism of the policy resulting in reducing the quality of elementary education. Hence the RTE Act was amended to scrap the policy.\nRTE Act prioritized schooling of children only from the age of 6, thus ignoring pre-school education. Kothari Commission had recommended the establishment of a center for the development of pre-primary education in each district.\nRTE Act recommends a PTR of 30:1 for primary classes and 35:1 for upper primary classes\nDistrict Information System for Education (DISE) report states that 30% of primary and 15% of upper primary schools have higher PTRs.\nAccording to the Economic Survey 2018-19, the PTR at the national level for primary schools is 23 and 27 for secondary schools. Thus PTR appears to be satisfactory, as there are sufficient teachers. However, the main issue is a balanced deployment of teachers based on student strength.\nEven though the Student-Classroom ratio (SCR) improved in almost all of the States, there is disparity across the country.\nModern Education in India: The Evolution of the System through various policies\n\nThe British government had introduced modern education in India. From Macaulay\u2019s minutes to Wood\u2019s dispatch to several commissions like the Sadler Commission, 1904 Indian education policy, etc. built the foundation of the Indian education system during the colonial period.\n\nRadhakrishnan committee\n\nIn 1948-49, the University Education Commission was constituted under Radhakrishnan. It molded the education system based on the needs of an independent India. The pre-Independent Indian education value system was catering to colonial masters. There was a need to replace Macaulayism\u00a0with the Indian value system.\u00a0(Macaulayism\u00a0is the policy of eliminating indigenous culture through the planned substitution of the alien culture of a colonizing power via the education system). Some of the values mentioned in the commission were:\n\nWisdom and Knowledge\u00a0\nAims of the Social Order: the desired social order for which youths are being educated.\nLove for higher values in life\nTraining for Leadership\n\nThe Independent Indian education system developed along the lines of this value framework. In the present times, where there are imminent threats of political ideologies hijacking the pedagogy of education and commercialization of education eroding value systems, it is appreciable to dust off the values promulgated by the commission. A recent controversial circular by the Central University of Kerala (CUK), directing that research topics for Ph.D. students must be by \u2018national priorities\u2019, and research in \u2018irrelevant topics\u2019 and \u2018privilege areas\u2019 must be discouraged, is a case in point.\n\nKothari commission\n\nIf the Radhakrishnan committee charted out the value system of the Indian education system, it was the Kothari Commission that provided the basic framework of the same. The commission provided for:\n\nStandardization of educational system on 10+2+3 pattern.\nEmphasized the need to make work experience and social/national service an integral part of education.\nLinking of colleges to several schools in the neighborhood.\nEqualization of opportunities to all and to achieve\u00a0social and national integration.\nNeighborhood school system without social or religious segregation and a school complex system integrating\u00a0primary and secondary levels of education.\nEstablishment of Indian Education Service.\nOn-the-job training of the teaching staff and efforts to raise the status of the teachers to attract talents into the profession.\nTo raise expenditure on education from 2.9% of the GDP to 6% by 1985.\n\nThis committee report paved the way for the National Educational Policy 1968 which provided the base and roadmap for further development of the education system in India.\n\nNational Educational Policy\u00a01968\nThe policy provided for \u201cradical restructuring\u201d and\u00a0equalization of educational opportunities to achieve national integration and greater cultural and economic development.\nIncrease public expenditure on education to 6% of GDP.\nProvide for better training and qualification of teachers.\nThree-language formula: state governments should implement the study of a modern Indian language, preferably one of the southern languages, apart from Hindi and English in the Hindi-speaking states, and of Hindi along with the regional language and English in the non-Hindi-speaking states. Hindi was encouraged uniformly to promote a common language for all Indians.\nNational Educational Policy\u00a01985\nThe policy aimed at the removal of disparities and to equalize educational opportunities, especially for women, SC and ST.\nLaunching of \u201cOperation Blackboard\u201d\u00a0to improve primary schools nationwide.\nIGNOU, the Open University, was formed.\nAdoption of the \u201crural university\u201d model, based on the philosophy of Mahatma Gandhi, to promote economic and social development at the grassroots level in rural India.\nT.S.R.Subramanium committee report\nEarly Childhood Care and Education (ECCE) \u2013\u00a0children from four to five years of age \u2013 to be declared as a fundamental right.\nECCE is inconsistent across states. So all government schools should have facilities for pre-primary education, which would facilitate pre-school education by the government instead of the private sector.\nExam reform:\nThe policy of no detention should be upheld only till class five and not till class eight.\nTeacher Management:\nThere is a steep rise in teacher shortage, absenteeism, and grievances.\nNeed to constitute an Autonomous Teacher Recruitment Board.\nFour years integrated B.Ed. the course should be introduced.\nICT in Education:\nThere is an inadequate integration of information technology (IT) and the education sector.\nVocational education and training:\nThe National Skills Qualification Framework should be scaled up.\nThe choice of vocational courses should be in line with local opportunities and resources.\u00a0\nBringing formal certification for vocational education at par with conventional education certificates.\nAll India Education Service.\nNational Higher Education Promotion and Management Act (NHEPMA):\nExisting separate laws governing individual regulators in higher education\u00a0should be replaced by the said act.\nThe role of existing regulatory bodies like UGC and AICTE should be revised.\nNational Accreditation Board (NAB) subsuming the existing accreditation bodies.\nKasturirangan Report On School Education (Draft National Education Policy)\n\nFor restructuring the education system in India, the government is preparing to roll out a New Education Policy that will cater to Indian needs in the 4th Industrial Revolution by making use of its demographic dividend. Committee for Draft National Education Policy (chaired by Dr. K. Kasturirangan) submitted its report on May 31, 2019.\n\nYou can read about the National Education Policy 2020 in detail here.\n\nSchool Education:\u00a0\nProblems\nLow accessibility.\nThe curriculum doesn\u2019t meet the developmental needs of children.\nLack of qualified and trained teachers.\nSubstandard pedagogy.\nCurrently, most early childhood education is delivered through anganwadis and private preschools. However, there has been less focus on the educational aspects of early childhood.\nThe policy recommends developing a two-part curriculum for early childhood care and education.\nGuidelines for up to three-year-old children.\nEducational framework for three to eight-year-old children.\nThis would be implemented by improving and expanding the Anganwadi system and co-locating anganwadis with primary schools.\nThe Right to Education Act, 2009 (RTE Act):\nExpanding the ambit of the Act to all children between the ages of three to 18 years, thus\u00a0including early childhood education and secondary school education.\nReview recent amendments to the RTE Act on continuous and comprehensive evaluation and the no-detention policy.\nThere should be no detention of children till class eight. Instead, schools must ensure that children are achieving age-appropriate learning levels.\nCurriculum framework:\nThe current structure of school education is to be restructured based on the development needs of students.\n10+2+3 structure to be replaced by 5-3-3-4 design comprising: (i) five years of foundational stage (three years of pre-primary school and classes one and two), (ii) three years of preparatory stage (classes three to five), (iii) three years of middle stage (classes six to eight), and (iv) four years of secondary stage (classes nine to 12).\nThe current education system solely focuses on rote learning. The curriculum load should be reduced to its essential core content.\nSchool exam reforms:\nCurrent board examinations:\nForce students to concentrate only on a few subjects.\nDo not test learning in a formative manner.\nCause stress among students.\nTo track students\u2019 progress throughout their school experience, State Census Examinations in classes three, five, and eight should be established.\nRestructure the board examinations to test only the core concept. These board examinations will be on a range of subjects. The students can choose their subjects and the semester when they want to take these board exams. The in-school final examinations may be replaced by these board examinations.\nSchool infrastructure:\nAlthough establishing primary schools in every habitation has increased access to education, it has led to the development of very small schools making it operationally complex. Hence the multiple public schools should be brought together to form a school complex.\nA complex will consist of one secondary school (classes nine to twelve) and all the public schools in its neighborhood that offer education from pre-primary to class eight.\nThese will also include anganwadis, vocational education facilities, and an adult education center.\nEach school complex will be a semi-autonomous unit providing integrated education across all stages from early childhood to secondary education.\nThis will ensure that resources such as infrastructure and trained teachers can be efficiently shared across a school complex.\nTeacher management:\nA steep rise in a teacher shortage, lack of professionally qualified teachers, and deployment of teachers for non-educational purposes have plagued the system.\nTeachers should be deployed with a particular school complex for at least five to seven years.\nThey will not be allowed to participate in any non-teaching activities during school hours.\nExisting B.Ed. the program will be replaced by a four-year integrated B.Ed. program that combines high-quality content, pedagogy, and practical training. An integrated continuous professional development will also be developed for all subjects.\nRegulation of schools:\nSeparating the regulation of schools from aspects such as policymaking, school operations, and academic development.\nIndependent State School Regulatory Authority for each state will prescribe basic uniform standards for public and private schools.\nThe Department of Education of the State will formulate policy and conduct monitoring and supervision.\nHigher Education\nAccording to the All India Survey on Higher Education, the Gross Enrolment Ratio (GER) in higher education in India has increased from 20.8% in 2011-12 to 25.8% in 2017-18. Lack of access is a major reason behind the low intake of higher education. The policy aims to increase GER to 50% by 2035.\nRegulatory structure and accreditation:\nMultiple regulators with overlapping mandates reduce the autonomy of higher educational institutions and create an environment of dependency and centralized decision-making.\nThe National Higher Education Regulatory Authority (NHERA) should\u00a0replace the existing individual regulators in higher education. Thus the role of all professional councils such as AICTE would be limited to setting standards for professional practice. The role of the UGC will be limited to providing grants.\nSeparate the National Assessment and Accreditation Council (NAAC) from the UGC into an independent and autonomous body. It will function as the top-level accreditor and will issue licenses to different accreditation institutions. All existing higher education institutions should be accredited by 2030.\nEstablishment of new higher educational institutions:\nReplacing the current system of establishing higher educational institutions by Parliament or state legislatures. Instead, institutions can be set up through a Higher Education Institution Charter from NHERA.\nRestructuring of higher education institutions:\nPhasing out the current complex system of naming Higher education institutions(HEI) as \u2018deemed to be university\u2019, \u2018affiliating university\u2019, \u2018unitary university\u2019 etc. HEI will be restructured into three types:\nResearch universities focus equally on research and teaching.\nUniversities focus primarily on teaching.\nColleges focus only on teaching at undergraduate levels.\nAll such institutions will gradually move towards full autonomy.\nEstablishing a National Research Foundation (NRF):\nTotal investment in research and innovation in India has declined from 0.84% of GDP in 2008 to 0.69% in 2014. India also lags behind many nations in the number of researchers, patents, and publications.\nNRF will act as an autonomous body for funding, mentoring, and building the capacity for quality research.\nMoving towards a liberal approach:\nUndergraduate programs should be made interdisciplinary by redesigning their curriculum to include: a common core curriculum; and one/two area(s) of specialization.\nIntroduce four-year undergraduate programs in Liberal Arts.\nBy the next five years, five Indian Institutes of Liberal Arts must be set up as model multidisciplinary liberal arts institutions.\nProfessional development of faculty:\nPoor service conditions and heavy teaching loads, augmented by a lack of autonomy and no clear career progression system, have resulted in low faculty motivation.\nIntroduction of a Continuous Professional Development program and permanent employment track system for faculty in all higher education institutions by 2030.\nThe student-teacher ratio of not more than 30:1 must be ensured.\nOptimal learning environment:\nAll higher education institutions must have complete autonomy on curricular, pedagogical, and resource-related matters.\n\nRead: Institutions of Eminence Scheme\n\nAdditional Key Focus Areas:\n\nAdditional key focus areas are (1) Technology in Education (2) Vocational Education (3) Adult Education and (4) the Promotion of Indian Languages.\n\nTECHNOLOGY IN EDUCATION\nTechnology plays an important role in:\nImproving the classroom process of teaching, learning, and evaluation\nAiding teacher training.\nImproving access to education.\nImproving the overall planning, administration, and management of the entire education system.\nElectrification of all educational institutions paves the way for technology induction.\nNational Mission on Education through ICT:\nAn autonomous body, the National Education Technology Forum, set up under the Mission, will facilitate decision-making on the use of technology.\nNational Repository on Educational Data: maintain all records related to institutions, teachers, and students in digital form.\nSingle online digital repository to make available copyright-free educational resources in multiple languages.\nVOCATIONAL EDUCATION\nLess than 5% of the workforce in the age group of 19-24 receives vocational education in India, in contrast to 52% in the USA, 75% in Germany and 96% in South Korea.\nNational Policy on Skills Development and Entrepreneurship (2015) aimed at offering vocational education in 25% of educational institutions. The policy expands this to include all educational institutions in a phased manner over 10 years.\nVocational courses: All school students must receive vocational education in at least one vocation in grades 9 to 12.\nHigher Education Institutions must offer vocational courses that are integrated into undergraduate education programs.\nThe draft Policy targets to offer vocational education to up to 50% of the total enrolment in higher education institutions by 2025, up from the present level of enrolment of below 10%.\nNational Committee for the Integration of Vocational Education for charting out plans for the above objectives.\nADULT EDUCATION\n\nAs per Census 2011, India had a total of 26.5 crore adult non-literate (15 years and above).\n\nEstablishing an autonomous\u00a0Central Institute of Adult Education as a constituent unit of NCERT. It will develop a National Curriculum Framework for adult education.\nAdult Education Centers will be included within the school complexes.\nRelevant courses are made available at the National Institute of Open Schooling.\nNational Adult Tutors Programme to build a cadre of adult education instructors and managers.\n\nRead:\u00a0 New India Literacy Programme (NILP)\n\nEDUCATION AND INDIAN LANGUAGES\nThe medium of instruction must be the mother tongue until grade 5, and preferably until grade 8.\n3 language formula be continued and flexibility in the implementation of the formula should be provided. Implementation of the formula needs to be strengthened, particularly in Hindi-speaking states. Schools in Hindi-speaking areas should also teach Indian languages from other parts of India for national integration.\nTo promote Indian languages, a National Institute for Pali, Persian, and Prakrit will be set up.\nThe mandate of the Commission for Scientific and Technical Terminology will be expanded to include all fields and disciplines to strengthen vocabulary in Indian languages.\nTransforming Education\n\nThe policy talked about the synergistic functioning of India\u2019s education system, to deliver equity and excellence at all levels, from vision to implementation, led by a new Rashtriya Shiksha Aayog.\n\nEDUCATION GOVERNANCE\n\nRevitalize education governance by bringing in synergy and coordination among the different ministries, departments, and agencies.\n\nConstitute the National Education Commission or Rashtriya Shiksha Aayog, as an apex body for education headed by the Prime Minister. It would be responsible for developing, implementing, evaluating, and revising the vision of education and overseeing the implementation and functioning of bodies including the National Council of Educational Research and Training (NCERT), National Higher Education Regulatory Authority, and National Research Foundation.\nThe Ministry of Human Resources and Development must be renamed the Ministry of Education to bring the focus back on education.\nFINANCING EDUCATION\nThe Draft Policy reaffirmed the commitment to spending 6% of GDP as a public investment in education.\nThe draft Policy seeks to double the public investment in education from the current 10% of total public expenditure to 20% in the next 10 years. 5% will be utilized for higher education, 2% in school education, and 1.4% for early childhood care and education.\nThere should be optimal and timely utilization of funds through the institutional development plans and by plugging loopholes in the disbursement of funds.\nCriticism of the New Education Policy of India\nThe New Education Policy lacks operational details.\nIt is not clear from where the funding will be sourced.\nEnough importance is not given to innovation, startup culture or economic principles to be added to the curriculum.\nOne-size-fits for all states can\u2019t be a solution as each state in India is diverse in its educational needs. Controversy on NEET has shown this.\nWith technological advancement and the democratization of knowledge, the policy should have focused more on how to teach rather than what to teach.\nEconomic Survey 2017-18 mentioned the perils of the distinction between research institutions and universities in higher education. The policy recommendation of three distinct higher education institutions of research universities, teaching universities, and teaching colleges will further augment the gap between research and universities.\nThe draft policy is silent on the Institutions of Eminence and agencies like the Higher Education Funding Agency.\nThe role of Rashtriya Shiksha Aayog should be defined clearly. What would be its role vis-a-vis existing regulators? Also, there are criticisms from some quarters that RSA will open the door to the politicization of education.\nEarlier the 3-language formula proposed by the draft policy made Hindi compulsory in non-Hindi speaking states. However, after the furor, the proposal was removed.\nEven though the policy talks about bringing \u201cunrepresented groups\u201d into school and focusing on educationally lagging \u201cspecial education zones\u201d, it doesn\u2019t comprehensively address the inequalities prevalent in the system. It misses methods to bridge the gaps between rich and poor children.\nThe policy proposes to remove the provision mandating that primary schools be within stipulated distance from students\u2019 homes and common minimum infrastructure and facility standards that should be met by all schools. If a common minimum standard is not specified, it will create an environment where quality in some schools will fall further thus augmenting the inequalities between schools across the country.\n\nIndia\u2019s education history is rich with ambitious policies failing at the altar of inadequate implementation of the same. In the absence of a handholding mechanism for states to embark on the path-breaking reforms mentioned in the policy and that too in a short time, will be too much to ask.\n\nFunding requirements and governance architecture pose major challenges in the implementation of the policy. Political commitment is required to increase funding. RTE Act expansion to include preschool should keep in mind the present infrastructure inadequacies and teacher vacancies.\n\nRashtriya Shiksha Aayog may face administrative problems and turf battles. Also, it will raise questions on the role of new bodies like the National Medical Council.\n\nThe recent controversy on 3 language formula shows the sensitivity of language education in India and care should be taken to appreciate the emotional overtures while implementing the same.\n\nPolitically acceptability, social desirability, technological feasibility, financial viability, administratively doability, and judicially tenability are 6 pillars that will impact the implementation of the policy.\n\nBe that as it may, the new education policy aims to address the challenges of (i) access, (ii) equity, (iii) quality, (iv) affordability, and (v) accountability faced by the current education system. It aims to revitalize and equip the education system to meet the challenges of the 21st century and 4th industrial revolution rather than catering to 19th and 20th century needs of industrialization. Also, India is on the cusp of a demographic dividend, rather than entered into this phase. So the education system catering to these needs is not a luxury that we hope for but rather a dire need at this moment in Indian history.\n\nThe Problems associated with the Education System in India\n\nHRD ministry: Over 1.4 million schools and 50,000 higher educational institutions are operating in India. Out of 907 universities, there are 399 state universities, 126 deemed-to-be universities, 48 central and 334 private universities.\n\nEven after more than a hundred years of \u201cGokhale\u2019s Bill\u201d1911, where universal primary education was originally mooted, India is yet to achieve this goal.\nChina had achieved it in the 1970s. As per Census 2011, over 26% of India\u2019s population is still illiterate, compared to 4% in China. About 50% of India\u2019s population has only primary education or less, compared to 38% in China. The 13% of the population with tertiary education at the upper end in India is comparable with China.\nHowever, according to Educational Statistics at a Glance (ESAG) 2018, the thrust on providing primary education has yielded results across social and gender categories in the Gross Enrolment Rate (GER).\nProgress has been made in respect of female participation up to secondary level and GER for girls has exceeded that of boys.\nBut the girl\u2019s enrollment rate is lower than that of boys at the higher education level.\nA gap is visible across social categories in terms of enrollment rate at the higher education level.\nAccording to NSSO\u2019s 71st round (2014), drop-out rates are very high for boys at the secondary school level. Reasons for the same are economic activities, lack of interest in education, and financial constraints.\nThe transition rate from secondary school to senior secondary and further to higher education is very low.\n\nDespite these highly ambitious education policies and elaborate deliberations on the same, the outcomes are rather shaky. Major criticisms and shortcomings of these policies and their implementations are:\n\nElitist bias in the implementation of education policies is reflected in the top-heavy structure of India\u2019s education profile, neglecting basic education and prioritizing higher education.\u00a0The ratio of per-student public expenditure at the tertiary level is high relative to the primary level in India.\nHalf the population is crowded at the bottom, either illiterate or with only primary education. Meanwhile, a disproportionately large segment is at the upper end with tertiary education.\nPoor\u00a0quality of education.\nThe 2015 Annual Status of Education Report (ASER)reflects this deteriorating quality. The report opines that deficits in foundational reading and arithmetic skills are\u00a0cumulative, which leaves students grossly\u00a0handicapped for further education.\nIndia had fared poorly in the Programme for International Student Assessment\u00a0(PISA) test in 2008, and 09.\nEducation policies in India are focused on inputs rather than on learning outcomes.\nIssues with teachers\nTeacher\u00a0shortages.\nLocal politics.\nCorruption in teacher appointment.\nDefects in teacher training.\nSocio-cultural factors like caste division, and cynical attitude towards the teaching profession.\nThe incentive structure for government school teachers is highly skewed, guaranteeing poor performance.\nThere is no accountability, as there is a guaranteed lifetime job independent of performance.\nInadequate public spending.\nFrom 1952-2012, education expenditure as a percentage of total government expenditure increased from 7.92 to 11.7, and as a percentage of GDP increased from 0.64 to 3.31. But it has still not reached 6% of GDP, as was recommended by the Kothari Commission way back in 1964.\nExpenditure by the government on elementary education is more than tertiary level, but expenditure per student is more in tertiary. So there is a need to increase expenditure in all segments.\nNon-inclusive and in-equitable education system.\nAll India survey on higher education has shown that in West Bengal Muslim students in universities are very low. Lack of education at the primary and secondary levels is said to be the main reason.\nEven though Article 15(4),(5) provides reservations for SC, ST, and OBC in higher education institutions, the Economic Survey 2018-19 points out their inadequate representation in these institutions.\nThe suicide of Rohit Vemula, a Ph.D. scholar at the University of Hyderabad, in 2016 had brought forward the discrimination still existing in these institutions.\nAlso, the representation of teachers at these levels is skewed against the backward class in spite of reservations. Article 16(4) provides for reservations of backward class in jobs.\nThe rich-poor divide is also visible at all levels of the education system.\nAt the school level, poor children are primarily concentrated in government schools. The poor quality of government schools thus disproportionately affects these children and creates a vicious cycle of illiteracy.\nAt the higher education level, the situation is more critical. One reason for the introduction of the National Medical Commission Bill is to curb the exorbitant fees charged by medical colleges.\nThe inadequate employable skills of youth in India.\nYouths coming out of the higher education system in India are not employable, as they lack relevant industry-level skills.\nIndia\u2019s long-standing neglect of primary and secondary education has limited access to quality basic education. No skill development program can succeed without an underlying foundation of basic education.\nNational Policy on\u00a0Skill Development and Entrepreneurship 2015(PMKVY) has shown disappointing results.\nBudget 2019-20\u00a0stated that the government enables about 10 million youth to take up industry-relevant skill training through the Pradhan Mantri Kaushal Vikas Yojana (PMKVY). The\u00a0 Budget has also increased focus on\u00a0\u2018new-age skills\u2019\u00a0like Artificial Intelligence (AI), Internet of Things (IoT), Big Data, 3D Printing, Virtual Reality, and Robotic.\nCurrently, B Tech courses in AI are offered mostly in premier institutions only.\nSports education is a grossly neglected area in the Indian education scenario. Even today sports education is considered a luxury in India.\nThe budget 2019-20 proposed the National Sports Education Board for the development of sportspersons under the\u00a0Khelo India program (2017).\n\nNow we will look at each rung of the education ladder in India.\n\nEarly childhood education\nEarly childhood education (ECE) is needed for\u00a0cognitive development in the early stage.\nIntegrated Child Development Scheme (ICDS)\u00a0has a component for providing ECE through Anganwadis. But lack of effective\u00a0regulation in this sector is eroding the quality of ECE.\nThere is a National Early Childhood Care and Education Policy 2013. However, the policy has not been properly implemented.\nThere are multiple service providers but there is no clarity in the types of services provided.\nThe sprawling of an unregulated private channel, both organized and unorganized, which is also spreading to rural areas, has led to inequitable access, uneven quality, and commercialization of ECE.\nBoth Anganwadis and private schools focus on reading, writing, and arithmetic rather than cognitive and conceptual development.\nThere is a decline in the quality and training of teachers.\nS.R. Subramanian\u2019s committee report has brought focus to the quality deterioration in this sector.\nPrimary level\nThere is an increasing trend of parents choosing private schools for the primary level. However, there is variable quality in private schools. Also, fees vary from school to school and are on the higher side.\nEschew rigid curricula and make them more cognitive and flexible. There should be a broader cognitive approach than rote learning.\nThere is a need for activity-based learning. Teachers should teach at the right level, rather than teaching for the average learner.\nThe government has launched Padhe Bharat Bade Bharat \u2013\u00a0targeting early reading and writing. The twin-track\u00a0approach of comprehension and math is the main focus.\nThere is a supply-side problem. The government is pumping funds through government schools thus increasing the number of schools and thus enrollment. However, quality and inclusiveness have dropped and dropout rates increased. These lead to poor learning outcomes.\nSCHOOL COMPLEX\nRTE and SSA have resulted in over-access but low-quality primary-level education. Now the aim should be to integrate these into school complexes, as mentioned by the Kasturirangan committee report, thus rationalizing the number of schools in an area.\nThe \u2018Adarsh\u2019 integrated school system of Rajasthan is an example of a school complex system. Here one school provides classes from l to XII under one principal. There is one such school in every gram panchayat.\nThis is an efficient way to solve teacher shortages and also to address the shortages of secondary schools. It can also address the problem of resource scarcity by integrating and rationalizing resources.\nInclusive learning can be furthered through school.\nAlso, these complexes can act as a pivot around which new reforms in education can be implemented.\nSecondary level\n\nASER Rural 2017: In 2017, ASER changed the age group of the survey from primary level to secondary level. The report mentions the following:\n\nEnrollment is low in this age group. There is a high digital divide at this level. Low quality also persists at this level. There is a high amount of absenteeism as well.\nThere is a need to expand RTE to cover the 14-18 age groups.\nTo realize the demographic dividend, skill education for these groups is necessary.\n\nEconomic Survey 2018-19 points out that Indian demography is changing and it requires more quality secondary education system rather than merely an increasing number of primary-level schools.\n\nPRIVATE FEES\nThere is an arbitrary hike in private school fees. Supreme Court in Islamic Academy of Education vs Karnataka 2003\u00a0had said that there is autonomy for private schools to raise fees.\u00a0A reasonable surplus can be generated by schools for the expansion of the institution; however, a balance between the autonomy of the institution and measures to prevent the commercialization of education is needed.\nThe vagueness in the judgment regarding \u2018reasonable surplus\u2019 and \u2018commercialization\u2019 of education has watered down the outcome of the judgment.\nThere are state laws for capping fees. However, implementation problems and litigation make them ineffective.\nCAG report mentioned misreporting and mismanagement by private schools. So laws should address this problem through stricter inspection, penalties, etc.\nHigher education\n\nThere is an increasing number of higher education institutions but their quality is questionable, effectively making \u2018islands of excellence amidst the sea of mediocrity. Increased accessibility to a low-quality higher education system has made democratization of mediocrity.\n\nRaghuram Rajan, the ex-RBI governor, argued that India needs idea factories and universities by leveraging India\u2019s inherent strengths like tolerance, diversity, etc. He said that there is a need for strong accreditation agencies and continuing education.\n\nProblems of the higher education system in India\n\nThere is a dual problem of both quality and quantity. The gross enrollment ratio (GER) in higher education is only 24.5.\nEven though education policy had an elitist bias in favor of higher education, the state of the same is much worse than the state of school education. Unlike school education, there is no national survey of the learning levels of college students.\nThe desired levels of research and internationalization of Indian campuses remain weak points.\nThere is a lack of adequate funds allotted to higher education.\nAlso, there is a low philanthropic investment in this sector. This creates an exclusive dependency on government funding by universities. This, in turn, reduces the autonomy and vision of these universities.\nPrivatization of higher education has not been led by philanthropy but the commercial interest that does not have a symbiotic relationship with the vision of universities.\nThese have led to inadequate human capacity, shoddy infrastructure, and weak institutions. Recommendations of the Narayana Murthy committee,\u00a0on the role of the corporate sector in higher education, have not been implemented and thus channeling of CSR funds to higher education remains inadequate.\nBanks and financial institutions are not giving adequate attention to this area. Giving PSL status to these institutions can be considered.\nIndian higher education system is of a linear model with very little focus on specialization.\nThe regulatory environment of higher education is in shambles.\nUGC and AICTE act more as controllers of education than facilitators.\nDue to the mushrooming of colleges at a higher rate since the 1980s, there is a regulatory sprawl in higher education.\nPoor governance, with mindless\u00a0over-regulation, is widespread in this sector. Educational institutions responded to this with claims of academic and institutional autonomy for themselves, which was mostly a smokescreen for a culture of sloth in these institutions.\nThere is a concentration of powers, as these regulatory institutions control all aspects like accreditation, curriculum setting, professional standard-setting, funding, etc.\nYashpal Committee\u00a02010points out several problems in higher education in India:\nCompartmentalization and fragmentation of the knowledge system.\nDisconnect with society.\nOveremphasis on entrance tests.\nAbsence of innovation in learning methods.\nCorrosion of autonomy of universities.\nFor long basic disciplines across the physical and social sciences and humanities were ignored.\nThere was an increasing trend of bright students choosing foreign institutes over Indian institutes for higher studies. This resulted in a \u2018brain drain\u2018.\nHowever, the Economic Survey 2017-18 mentioned that there is an increase in Ph.D. enrolment in India in Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics (STEM) due to efforts by the government to increase the number and quantum of fellowships. However, there are still fewer researchers in India in comparison to other countries.\nBudget 2019-20 proposes \u2018Study in India\u2019\u00a0with a focus on bringing foreign students to higher educational institutions in India to make India a \u201chub of higher education.\u201d\nHigher education institutions are used as rewards for loyalists and channels of graft by political parties in power.\nIndian higher education system is plagued by unregulated and shoddy coaching institutions. The coaching industry makes around Rs. 24000 crores a year in India. Proper regulation of the same is required.\nResearch and development (R&D)\n\nEconomic Survey 2017-18 stated: \u201cTo transform from net consumer to net producer of knowledge, India should invest in educating its youth in science and mathematics, reform the way R&D is conducted, engage the private sector and the Indian diaspora, and take a more mission-driven approach in areas such as dark matter, genomics, energy storage, agriculture, and mathematics and cyber-physical systems\u201d.\n\nAlthough Gross Expenditure on R&D (GERD) is consistently increasing, as a fraction of GDP it has been stagnant between 0.6-0.7\u00a0 percent of GDP over the past two decades.\nThe universities play a relatively small role in the research activities in India. There is a disconnection between research institutes and universities. This results in the compartmentalization of research activities and teaching into two separate silos.\nThe\u00a0separation of research from teaching leads to a situation where universities\u00a0have students but need additional faculty support, while research institutes have qualified faculty but are starved of young students.\nIndia was, at one point, spending more on R&D as a percentage of GDP than countries like China \u2013 but currently, India under-spends on R&D.\nDoubling of R&D spending is necessary and much of the increase should come from the private sector and universities.\nTHE NEED OF THE HOUR\nIt is imperative to improve math and cognitive skills at the school level to make a difference at a higher level.\nThere is a need to expand R&D in India and to go beyond paper presentations and patents to a broader contribution of providing value for society.\nThere is also a need to encourage Investigator-led Research for funding science research.\u00a0Science and Engineering Research Board (SERB) 2008,\u00a0a statutory body of DST, is a step in the right direction.\nIncrease funding for research from the private sector as well as from state governments. The private sector should be incentivized to both undertake more R&D and support STEM research through CSR funds.\n50:50 partnerships with SERB for industry-relevant research under the Ucchatar Avishkar Yojana (UAY) is the right way to go forward.\nIt would strengthen state universities and provide knowledge in areas specific to a state.\nNational Research Foundation,\u00a0to fund, coordinate, and promote research at the college level, is proposed by the Kasturirangan report. It is reiterated in Budget 2019-20: NRF will ensure the overall research ecosystem in the country is strengthened with a focus on areas relevant to national priorities without duplication of effort and expenditure. The funds available with all Ministries will be integrated into NRF.\nLink national labs to universities and create new knowledge ecosystems. Together they can link up with the commercial sectors and help develop industrial clusters.\nTake a mission-driven approach to R&D \u2013 focus on a few key areas like:\nNational Mission on Dark Matter\nNational Mission on Genomics\nNational Mission on Energy Storage Systems\nNational Mission on\u00a0Mathematics\nNational Mission on Cyber-Physical Systems\nNational Mission on Agriculture\nLeverage the rich scientific\u00a0diaspora\u00a0that India possesses. The growing strength of India\u2019s economy and the growing anti-immigrant atmosphere in some Western countries provide a good opportunity to attract back more scientists. Government programs for the same include:\nRamanujan Fellowship Scheme.\nInnovation in Science Pursuit for Inspired Research (INSPIRE) Faculty Scheme.\nRamalingaswami Re-entry Fellowship.\nVisiting Advanced Joint Research Faculty Scheme (VAJRA).\nImprove the culture of research thus \u2018ease of doing research\u2019. There is a need for less hierarchical governance systems that encourage risk-taking and curiosity in the pursuit of excellence.\nGreater public engagement of the science and research establishment is needed. A greater effort at science communication\u00a0is needed.\nGovernment initiatives on higher education\n\nThe government is trying to revitalize the Indian higher education system and for this many initiatives have been launched. Let\u2019s discuss the importance of them.\n\nNational Testing Agency (NTA) 2017\nNTA was set up for conducting entrance exams in higher educational institutions. It is based on the recommendations of the Ashok Mishra committee on IIT entrance 2015.\nIt will conduct JEE, NEET, National Eligibility Test (NET), Common Management Admission Test (CMAT), and Graduate Pharmacy Aptitude Test (GPAT).\nIt will provide diversity and plurality in higher education. It will also ensure independence and transparency in conducting the exams.\nHowever, it should be ensured that the computer-based test should not lead to further exploitation of rural students.\nNEET\nNEET stands for National Eligibility cum Entrance Test. It is for admissions in medical courses by replacing a plethora of medical entrance tests with one national-level test.\nSupreme Court had said that NEET should be the sole basis for admission to medical courses.\nThere is a controversy about whether urban and CBSE students will dominate NEET. The government should pay heed to this criticism.\nTamil Nadu had claimed that NEET will be difficult for rural and underprivileged children who cannot afford tuition.\nIn Tamil Nadu doctors serving in rural areas get weightage in PG admission. NEET will effectively dislodge this system.\nThis controversy brought forward the conflict between the fair and transparent system of admission to curb the commercialization of medical education and the socioeconomic goals of the state, which in the case of Tamil Nadu includes ensuring enough doctors for rural areas.\nControversy on NEET has brought the following question to the limelight: should uniformity be thrust upon a country with such vast disparity and diversity? The political leadership should iron out the differences and produce a suitable admission policy. This task should not be left to the judiciary.\nBe that as it may, states can\u2019t remain insulated from the need to upgrade their education standard.\nRUSA:\u00a0Rashtriya Uchchatar Shiksha Abhiyan 2013\nAbout 94% of students in higher education study in 369 State universities, whereas less than 6% of students study in 150 Centrally-funded institutions.\n11th 5-year plan\u00a0(2007-12) opined that the center\u2019s bias towards premier central institutions had skewed funding for these institutions mainly and thus neglected state-level institutions.\nState investment in higher education was declining. UGC\u2019s system of direct release of funds to State institutions bypassing State governments also leads to a sense of alienation for the states.\nRUSA tried to correct this bias. The scheme aims at financing state institutions concerning their governance and performance.\nRUSA has shown the result in increasing the performance of state institutions and changing the way regulators function for the good. State Higher Education Council(SHEC)\u00a0made medium-long-term state perspective plans.\nCabinet in 2018 decided to continue the scheme. A renewed focus by the center on RUSA will be a success only if it is impartially administered and states are willing to heed the advice of SHEC.\nHECI:\u00a0Higher Education Commission of India bill\nOn the recommendation of the Yashpal Committee 2010 for renovation and rejuvenation of higher education, the National Commission on Higher Education and Research bill was introduced but was not passed.\nHECI was proposed to act as an overarching regulator of higher education by replacing UGC, which will maintain academic standards, approve new educational institutions, etc. but with no funding powers.\nDraft Higher Education Commission of India (Repeal of University Grants Commission Act) Bill, 2018 was introduced in 2018. Budget 2019-20 proposed to bring a bill on HECI this year.\nThe draft bill had separated funding and placed it under MHRD. This was criticized for the fear of increasing political control and reducing the autonomy of universities.\nIoE:\u00a0Institutions of Eminence 2017\nAround 2005, the Times Higher Education World University Rankings and the QS World University Rankings started, and in 2009 the Academic Ranking of World Universities started. From India, only the Indian Institute of Science was included in the top 500 every year. This prompted the government to introduce NIRF and IoE.\nUnder IoE, UGC was tasked to select 10 government universities and 10 private ones as IoE. These would be given autonomy in operations.\nSelected government institutions would be provided with \u20b91,000 crore over five years.\nThe IoE tag is expected to help them achieve the world\u2019s top 500 higher education institutions in a decade and later into the top 100.\nInstitutes among the top 50 in the National Institute Ranking Framework rankings or in the top 500 in international ratings were eligible.\nCriticism\nThe model for the sector remains dependent on state patronage.\nEntry into the global education race could now become an overriding concern when many systemic issues are plaguing the sector.\nFunding only for public institutions is discriminatory.\nHumanities institutions were neglected.\nNeed\nTransparency in the selection process, and the public sharing of benchmarks and guidelines. The furor over the selection of Jio Institute, even before it functioned, had attracted many eyeballs and criticisms.\nSeparate category to include sectoral institutions like IIM.\nNational Institutional Ranking Framework (NIRF) 2015\n\nNIRF is a methodology adopted by the\u00a0MHRD to rank higher education\u00a0institutions in India.\n\nNIRF is common for public and private institutions as well as state and central institutions. Comparison of state-level colleges with central and private colleges may lead to a vicious cycle of low funding, poor performance, and low ranks among state-level institutions because of the resource gap.\nSo performance index values should be normalized concerning investments and resources that have gone into that institution. Also should consider making another ranking system for state-level institutions.\nHEFA:\u00a0Higher Education Financing Agency 2018\n\nIntroduced in Budget 2018-19, HEFA is a joint venture of MHRD and Canara Bank\n\nWith an initial capital base of Rs 1,000 crores, it will act as a not-for-profit organization that will leverage funds from the market and supplement them with donations and CSR funds. These funds will be used to finance improvement in infrastructure in top institutions.\nIt has been tasked with raising \u20b91 lakh crore to finance infrastructure improvements in higher education by 2022.\n\u00a0Foreign Education Providers Bill\u00a02013\u00a0\nThere is no account of programs delivered by foreign universities in India. Inadequate regulation has led to low-quality courses offered in this sector.\nThe foreign Institution bill was not been able to pass in Parliament. However,\n\nEQUIP report has mentioned the revival of this bill.\n\nThere are many other schemes and initiatives like SWAYAM, which offers open online courses from Class IX to post-graduation free of cost, GIAN and IMPRINT which are primarily focused on elite institutes like IITs and IISc.\n\nAPAAR: One Nation One Student ID Card\n\nThe Automated Permanent Academic Account Registry (APAAR) is a transformative initiative introduced in alignment with the National Education Policy (NEP) of 2020 and the National Credit and Qualifications Framework (NCrF).\n\nIt aims to provide a unified and accessible academic experience for students across India by assigning a unique and permanent 12-digit ID to every student, consolidating their academic achievements in one place.\n\nOther Major Issues connected with the Education sector in India\n\nThe Indian education sector is also affected by other issues like the politicization of campuses, gender parity problems, poor-quality standards, etc.\n\nPoliticization of campuses\nJP movement had provided an impetus to the politicization of students.\nIn Indian higher education institutions, university politics has become a launchpad for political ambitions.\nThough campus politics is vital for democracy, as it makes students better citizens, the negative side of the politicization of campuses has been visible across Indian campuses. Recent incidents at Kerala University are a case in point.\nOne of the most important problems of student politics in India is that it acts as an appendage to political parties without having an independent identity or autonomy.\nGender Parity\nThere is a 2 pronged\u00a0gender discrimination in the Indian education system:\nBy parents \u2192 who send boys to private and girls to government schools. Economic Survey 2018-19: enrollment of girls is higher than that of boys in government schools but the pattern gets reversed in private schools. The gender gap in enrollment in private schools has consistently increased across age groups.\nBy teachers \u2192 who reinforced the belief that boys are quick learners.\nGirls are eased out of school to work on home chores or get married.\nThe government has launched Beti Bachao, Beti Padhao,(BPBP), a campaign to generate awareness and improve the efficiency of welfare services intended for girls in India.\nEconomic Survey 2018-19 opines that BBBP has been a success and proposes to extend the cause of Gender equality by coining the slogan of BADLAV (Beti Aapki Dhan Lakshmi Aur Vijay-Lakshmi) to enhance the contribution of women in the workforce and the economy.\nFor ranking states based on gender disparity, Digital Gender Atlas for Advancing Girl\u2019s Education was launched by MHRD.\nThe Gender Parity Index (GPI) in education reflects the discrimination against girls in access to educational opportunities.\nIn higher education, gender disparities still prevail in enrollment.\nEfforts by the Government through programs like Beti Padhao, and Beti Bachao, the GPI has improved substantially at the primary and secondary levels of enrolment.\nQuality of education\n\nLearning outcomes are not assessed in India as numerical outcomes. The 12th Five-Year Plan noted the need for measuring and improving learning outcomes.\n\nChildren of illiterate parents can\u2019t supplement school studies at home and also can\u2019t afford expensive tuition, leading to a vicious cycle of illiteracy.\nASER 2018\nFrom 2014 to 2018, there was a gradual improvement in both basic literacy and numeracy for Class III students but only a quarter of them are at grade level (ability to read and do basic operations like subtraction of Class II level).\nThe report also shows that 1 out of 4 children leaving Class VIII are without basic reading skills (ability to read at least a Class II level).\nGOVERNMENT INITIATIVES\nCentral Rules under the RTE Act were amended in February 2017 to include the defined class-wise and subject-wise learning outcomes.\nPadhe Bharat Badhe Bharat\nNationwide sub-program of SSA to improve comprehensive early reading, writing, and early mathematics programs for children in Classes I and II.\nTEACHER TRAINING\nTeachers play the most critical role in a student\u2019s achievement.\nThe need is for better incentives for teachers, investments in teacher capacity through stronger training programs, and addressing the problems in the teaching-learning process.\nHowever, teachers in India, especially in government schools, are considered a cog in the way to efficient governance. There is an inadequate focus on their motivation and skill updation.\nNCERT study shows that there is no systematic incorporation of teacher feedback into designing pieces of training. Also, there is no mechanism to check whether this training is translated into classroom performance.\nThese results in de-professionalizing the teaching profession and curb a teacher\u2019s \u201cinternal responsibility\u201d\u2014 the sense of duty to the job.\nDIKSHA\nWorld Development Report on Education (2018) opined that both teaching skills and motivation matter. Individually targeted continued training is important. In line with this, MHRD and the National Council for Teacher Education launched the National Teacher Platform, or Diksha in 2017. It is a one-stop solution to address teacher competency gaps.\nHowever, the current training through Diksha follows a one-size-fits-all approach. Even though the platform is designed to democratize both access to and creation of content by teachers, its real benefits are in the ability to provide continuous professional development which complements existing physical training.\nThis technology-enabled platform allows training to become a continuous activity rather than an annual event and also creates a feedback loop ensuring the effectiveness of the material.\nDiksha has the potential to re-engineer in-service teacher training in India. It is important to create good content and also to ensure technology consumption by teachers, the role of headmasters in promoting teachers\u2019 professional development, etc.\n\nAs India participates in the PISA in 2021, it is to be made sure that we recognize the importance of teachers and their role in education outcomes.\n\nPrivate Schools vs Public Schools: The Big Debate in Education\n\nAt least 30% of students between the 6-14 age groups are in the private sector.\n\nThere is an increasing perception that the quality of teaching in private schools is better than that of public schools. Thus there is a clamour for increasing the number of private schools and simultaneously limiting public spending on government schools.\nHowever, the claim on the quality of private schools is debatable as there is a wide disparity of the same among these schools.\n\nResearch paper by Geeta Gandhi Kingdon, professor of education and international development at the Institute of Education, London, offers insights into private-public school education in India:\n\nThe paper points out that between 2010-11 and 2015-16, the average enrolment in government schools declined from 122 to 108 students per school, while in private schools it rose from 202 to 208.\nNevertheless, according to the District Information System for Education (DISE), 65% of all school-going children, 113 million, get their education from government schools.\nThe study points out that the migration to private schools is due to the belief among parents that these schools offer better value for money in terms of quality.\nIndiaSpend, in 2016, reported that despite the Rs 1.16 lakh crore spent on SSA, the quality of learning declined between 2009 and 2014. It also points out that less than one in five elementary school teachers in India are trained. Also, the contractual teachers, who are high in number in government schools, are likely to be less motivated and accountable.\nPreference for private school tutoring is there.\nThe quality of schools varies between states. In 2016, in Kerala, the proportion of children enrolled in primary government schools increased from 40.6% in 2014 to 49.9% according to ASER 2016.\nStates with better-functioning government schools have more expensive private schools as there is no market for the \u2018low-fee\u2019 budget private schools. Around 80% of private schools in India are \u2018low\u2019 fee schools.\nASER 2016 has shown small improvements in learning outcomes in government schools.\nBetween 2010-11 and 2015-16, the number of private schools grew by 35% \u2013 to 0.30 million. On the other hand, the number of government schools grew only by 1%, to 1.04 million. The migration out of government schools has left many of these economically unviable.\nGovernment teachers in India earn four times that of China but don\u2019t perform as well. Up to 80% of India\u2019s public expenditure on education is spent on teachers. There is a need to link teacher salaries to their accountability.\nHowever, the salary of private teachers is very low compared to their government counterparts. This is due to the \u201cbureaucratically-set high \u2018minimum wage\u2019, which is being influenced by strong unions of government school teachers.\nAnother reason for the low salary of private school teachers is that the private education sector offers salaries based on market factors of demand and supply. Since 10.5% of graduates are unemployed in India, there is a high supply of teachers.\nRather than merely increasing the budget outlay for education, the need is to revise the Education policy for better accountability and monitoring mechanisms.\nGandhi argued that a Public-private partnership (PPP) model may be the solution, with public sector funding and private resources for education, since reforming the present system may not be politically feasible.\n\nRather than debating about private versus public schools, the focus should be to\u00a0enable the private sector to set up more schools under the scrutiny of regulatory authorities. There is no point in driving off the private initiative in schooling given the limited resources of the states. Private investment should be encouraged but made accountable for quality and conduct.\n\nThe above discussion showed the challenges of the Indian education system. A workforce that India wants to create in this digital age requires reforms in education at all levels. UNESCO\u2019s Global Education Monitoring (GEM) Report 2016 opined that India is expected to achieve universal primary education in 2050. India is 50 years late in achieving its global education commitments. If the nation wants fundamental changes in the education system, it has to meet the 2030 SDG targets on education. There is an urgent requirement for greater evolution in education in India.\n\nEducation Quality Upgradation and Inclusion Programme (EQUIP): How to transform Education in India?\n\nEQUIP is a\u00a0five-year vision plan on education, released by MHRD, by\u00a0the Prime Minister\u2019s decision to create a five-year vision plan for each Ministry.\n\nThe EQUIP project is crafted by ten expert groups led by experts within and outside the government:\n\nGroup 1:\u00a0Strategies for expanding access\nGroup 2:\u00a0Towards global best teaching/learning process\nGroup 3:\u00a0Promoting Excellence\nGroup 4:\u00a0Governance reforms\nGroup 5: Assessment, Accreditation, and Ranking Systems\nGroup 6: Promotion of research and innovation\nGroup 7: Employability and Entrepreneurship\nGroup 8: Using Technology for Better Reach\nGroup 9:\u00a0Internationalisation\nGroup 10: Financing Higher Education\n\nThe groups have suggested initiatives to transform the education system completely. The goals set by the groups are:\n\nDouble GER in higher education and resolve the geographically and socially skewed access to higher education institutions.\nUpgrade the quality of education to global standards.\nPosition at least 50 Indian institutions among the top 1000 global universities.\nIntroduce governance reforms in higher education for well-administered campuses.\nAccreditation of all institutions as an assurance of quality.\nPromote Research and Innovation ecosystems for positioning India in the top three countries in the world in matters of knowledge creation.\nDouble the employability of the students passing out of higher education.\nHarness education technology for expanding the reach and improving pedagogy.\nPromote India as a global study destination.\nAchieve a quantum increase in investment in higher education.\n\nWe can see that each of the above goals has been known to us for a long time. The problem is its implementation. The political class and all other stakeholders should come together to achieve these goals. The plethora of government initiatives on higher education is a sure sign of the importance given by the political class in the reform of the education system of India. Let\u2019s hope that a new dawn of Indian education is around the corner which will bring back the glory of ancient times when India was the centre of knowledge production.\n\nAs the Economic Survey 2016-17 points out, lack of health, malnourishment, etc. affects the cognitive ability of children. This will, in turn, have a detrimental effect on their future educational prospects. This leads to a vicious cycle of inter-generational illiteracy, poor health, and ultimately poverty. So education and health are complementary to each other and reforms in one sector should invariably be preceded and followed by reforms in other sectors. Human development as a whole can be considered as a wholesome development and we must appreciate the interlinkages of each section of human capital formation, be it health, education, digital literacy, skills, etc.\n\nAlso read: PM-USHA\n\nConclusion\n\nIn the larger domain of human capital, education, and skill development have a big role.\n\nCensus 2011 data on literacy gives us a quick perspective on the current status of education. However, education is not just about literacy.\n\nRTE act acts as a cornerstone for Indian education. Nevertheless, it is the various education policies, charted out since Independence, which led to the historical evolution of the education system in India.\n\nThe results of these policies can be said to be mixed. There is still a lot of room for improvement.\n\nThere are various government initiatives targeting each level of the education system in India. The higher Education System is given a greater focus these days.\n\nThe latest update in the education sector is the Kasturirangan report or draft new education policy. It captures the need of the hour for reforming education.\n\nThe modern Indian education system is crying for a revamp. The draft New Education Policy (NEP) is the right moment to take stock of its history, achievements, and misgivings to chart out a futuristic education plan for 21st-century India.\n\nAlso read:\u00a0Education in state list: Should it be restored?\n\nArticle by\u00a0Sethu\u00a0Krishnan M, curated by ClearIAS Team"

            "[META]": "Last updated on September 21, 2023 by ClearIAS Team",
            "[CONTENT]": "As per the current education system in India, all the students up till Class 8 will automatically be promoted to next class. No one can be failed as per the Right to Education Act. This is known as the \u2018No-Detention Policy\u2018.\n\nAn expert committee headed by T S R Subramanian set up to formulate the new National Education Policy had last year recommended that the \u2018No-Detention Policy\u2019 be reviewed and exams are held from Class VI. Recently, Union Cabinet has approved the scrapping of the no-detention policy in schools till Class VIII.\n\nIn this article, we discuss if the no-detention policy should be scrapped from the next academic year. Has the no-detention policy negatively impacted the quality of basic education in the country? Let\u2019s see.\n\nTable of Contents\n\nWhat is \u2018No-Detention\u2019 policy?\nThe Right To Education (RTE) Act\nThe RTE Act provides for:\nWhy is the No-Detention Policy reconsidered?\nWhat is the new proposal?\nReasons why \u2018no-detention policy\u2019 is criticized\nReasons why \u2018no-detention policy\u2019 is supported\nWhat is the stand of various states in this regard?\nWill scrapping the no-detention policy solve all problems?\nWay ahead\nConclusion\nWhat is \u2018No-Detention\u2019 policy?\nAs per the No-Detention Policy under the Right to Education Act, no student can be failed or expelled from school till the completion of elementary education covering classes 1 to 8. All the students up till Class 8 will automatically be promoted to next class.\nThe essence of the policy is that children should not be \u2018failed\u2019 and detained up to Class 8. There are no \u201cexaminations\u201d in the narrow traditional sense of the word up to Class 8. Instead, the Act mandates a process of Continuous and Comprehensive Evaluation (CCE) to assess and evaluate the student\u2019s learning.\nThe Right To Education (RTE) Act\nThe Constitution (Eighty-sixth Amendment) Act, 2002 inserted Article 21-A in the Constitution of India to provide free and compulsory education of all children in the age group of six to fourteen years as a Fundamental Right in such a manner as the State may, by law, determine.\nIt means that every child has a right to full-time elementary education of satisfactory and equitable quality in a formal school which satisfies certain essential norms and standards.\nIt came into effect on 1 April 2010.\nThe RTE Act provides for:\nEvery child in the age group of 6-14 has the right to free and compulsory\u00a0education in a neighbourhood school, till the completion of elementary education.\nPrivate schools will have to take 25% of their class strength from the weaker section and the disadvantaged group of the society through a random selection process. The government will fund the education of these children.\nNo donation and capitation fee\u00a0is allowed.\nNo admission test or interview\u00a0either for child or parents.\nNo child can be held back, expelled and required to pass the board examination till the completion of elementary education.\nThere is provision for the establishment of commissions to supervise the implementation of the act.\nA fixed student and teacher ratio\u00a0is to be maintained.\nAll schools have to adhere to rules and regulations laid down in this act, failing which the school will not be allowed to function. Three years moratorium period has been provided to school to implement all that is required of them.\nNorms for teachers training and qualifications\u00a0are also clearly mentioned in the act.\nAll schools except private unaided schools are to be managed by School Management Committees with 75% of parents and guardians as members.\nWhy is the No-Detention Policy reconsidered?\nVarious states, including Delhi, have raised serious objections against the no-detention policy, citing it as a reason of high failure and dropouts in classes 9 and 10.\nAlso, it is criticized that due to no-detention policy, students do not focus much on education as they already have it in their mindset that they will be promoted to the next class even if they don\u2019t perform well.\nWhat is the new proposal?\n\nWhen the no-detention policy is scrapped, an enabling provision will be made in the Right of Children to Free and Compulsory Education Amendment Bill which will allow states to detain students in class 5 and class 8 if they fail in the year-end exam.\n\nReasons why \u2018no-detention policy\u2019 is criticized\nNegative impact on the standard of education:\u00a0Most of the schools in interior places are running without any teachers. Hence, if the \u2018no-detention policy\u2019 continues, it will leave a negative impact on the standard of education in India and force the children to face more harsh future.\nNo reward for hard work: This policy has led to students developing a lackadaisical attitude, with there being no risk of failing. It also makes no distinction between good and bad students, and between those who work hard and those who don\u2019t. Thus it makes no effective way to implement a good level of teaching and learning.\nApathy from teachers: With the policy in place, the Education Department does not take steps to revamp itself and the teachers do not take the pain to ensure a good education for the children.\nDark future of students:\u00a0Students coming from poor economic background face problem in their coming life because of no good education in the schools.\nWill affect the women empowerment programs:\u00a0The girls especially will face a major problem if not getting a proper education in the schools.\nZero academic outcomes:\u00a0If no merit is checked while giving promotion to another class, the children will never learn the importance of studying and acquiring knowledge. It will lead to a poor academic outcome in classes.\nReasons why \u2018no-detention policy\u2019 is supported\n\nStemming dropouts from the schools due to peer pressure was the main reason the Right to Education Act included the no-detention provision. If it is reversed, many students would stop going to schools when they fail.\n\nThe section 29 (2) (h) of the RTE Act makes a comprehensive and continuous evaluation (CCE) mandatory, wherein schools are expected to use test results to improve teaching and learning of the child. Unlike traditional board examinations, the CCE visualises evaluation as a diagnostic tool to improve learning. So scrapping the policy is not a solution, in fact, it should be modified and corrected. (Reference: Wikipedia)\nIf a student is made to repeat a grade, there\u2019s a strong chance he or she will discontinue learning. Also, there is no research which establishes that repeating a year helps children perform better. In fact, not much burden helps the child not to take studies as a burden.\nThere can be modifications such as \u2013 each school should conduct exams to ascertain which student is weak in what subject. If the child is weak, the school should take additional classes or special coaching.\nWhat is the stand of various states in this regard?\n\n\ud83d\udc49 Which year are YOU targeting for success in the IAS/IPS/IFS Exam? \ud83d\ude80\n\n(1) \u21d2 UPSC 2025: Prelims cum Mains\n\n(2) \u21d2 UPSC 2026: Prelims cum Mains\n\n(3) \u21d2 UPSC 2027 Prelims cum Mains\n\nTip: Know more about ClearIAS Courses (Online/Offline)\n\nAll States/UTs were asked to share their views on the No-Detention policy. 28 States have shared their views on the No Detention policy out of which 23 States have suggested a modification to the No Detention policy. \u00a0(Reference: PIB)\n\nWill scrapping the no-detention policy solve all problems?\nFlawed teachers\u2019 training (the eye of many scams), social indifference to the plight of school teachers, rampant use of ad hoc teachers in small towns and villages, etc. have all substantively contributed to a failing school system. Only scrapping the policy is not going to drastically improve the standard of education in the country.\nAccording to some educationists, the policy was wrongly interpreted to create an environment in which the significance of evaluating a school-goer\u2019s learning outcomes was undermined. Continuous Comprehensive Evaluation (CCE), that aimed to assess the child\u2019s understanding of what was being taught in class at periodic intervals, proved to be a non-starter in many schools. The policy alone cannot be blamed for poor results.\nThe teachers were not given adequate training to undertake this reform. They had no idea of what was to be evaluated, and how. In several schools, CCE was reduced to \u201cproject work\u201d, which parents resented. The RTE\u2019s provisions regarding the upgrading of school infrastructure and an increase in the teacher-student ratio \u2014 that would have created an enabling environment for the policy \u2014 were given a short shrift. Hence, the poor performance can be linked to a variety of other factors rather than just the no detention policy.\nWay ahead\nThe phenomenon of poor learning outcomes is the product of many\u00a0factors which influence learning, and should not be conveniently pinned to the door of\u00a0the no-detention policy. The steps that can be taken to improve learning outcomes can be:\nmeasuring learning level outcomes of all children on a regular basis,\ncatalysing a \u201cperformance-driven culture\u201d and rewarding high performers at every level,\nchanging stakeholders\u2019 mindset and preparing them for new provisions, in which parents were made responsible or accountable for full attendance of their children.\nThe policy should be implemented in a phased manner and a scale-up to all classes should be undertaken only after the critical infrastructural, teacher strength and teachers\u2019 skill-set requirements were fully met.\nConclusion\n\nRather than addressing the core issues that affect the quality of education in the country, the entire focus seems to be shifting to bring back the pass/fail model.\nA greater level of seriousness on all sides is the need of the hour. It is high time steps are taken to remove the other flaws that exist.\nHence, the policy should either be renovated with adequate changes to neutralize the ill effects or replaced with a new policy that would take a balanced approach. The prime objective should be to effect an all-round development of children and equipping them with life skills.\n\nArticle by: Pooja Chaudhary"

The doctor-population ratio\u00a0is far lower than prescribed by World Health Organisation (one for every 1,674 persons, as per the parliamentary panel report, against the WHO-recommended one to 1,000).\n\nMedical Council of India (MCI)\n\nManagement of medical education in India should take the major responsibility of such a paradoxical trend. Medical Council of India (MCI) is the regulatory body for medical education and medical practices in India. Many blame MCI for problems in the India health sector.\u00a0The solution to this situation lies mainly in reforming and revamping MCI.\n\nHowever, Medical Council of India (MCI) has conducted many studies to identify the problems the medical field (Eg: Vision 2015 Report).\n\nVision 2015 report of MCI\n\nMCI published a vision document, in which it has analyzed problems of healthcare sector and reforms needed to resolve them.\n\n3 main reasons for India\u2019s healthcare woes:\nShortage of physicians\u00a0(both generalists and specialists).\nInequitable distribution of manpower and resources.\nDeficiencies in the quality of medical education.\nProposed reforms:\nIncrease production of doctors.\nReform curriculum by a transition from a science-based curriculum to skills and competency-based curriculum.\nThere is a need to emphasis on primary health care and family medicine.\nMedical institutions should be\u00a0strengthened by investing in technology.\n\nThe final goal of the vision document is to produce world-class Indian doctors. Needless to say, this vision remained a mere vision, even in 2018, without any marked improvement in ground reality.\n\n\ud83d\udc49 Which year are YOU targeting for success in the IAS/IPS/IFS Exam? \ud83d\ude80\n\n(1) \u21d2 UPSC 2025: Prelims cum Mains\n\n(2) \u21d2 UPSC 2026: Prelims cum Mains\n\n(3) \u21d2 UPSC 2027 Prelims cum Mains\n\nTip: Know more about ClearIAS Courses (Online/Offline)\n\nThe Problems of Medical Education in India\n\nMedical education in India faces many issues, some of which are identified in the vision document. Most important of them are:\n\n1. Inter-state and intra-state\u00a0inequality in the distribution of manpower and resources\nThere is a huge disparity in availability of opportunities for students across states.\n2010 report by MHRD had stated that four states \u2013 Andhra Pradesh, Karnataka, Maharashtra and Tamil Nadu \u2013 account for 1.3 lakh out of 2.4 lakh medical seats across India.\nThere is also a glaring rural-urban disparity in both availabilities of health care and colleges.\nA blanket standard for starting a medical college leads to neglect of states like Arunachal Pradesh, Mizoram, Nagaland etc. and rural areas.\nAmidst this situation, new medical colleges can bring in uniformity of access across sates and fill the demand-supply gap.\n2. Low doctor-population ratio\u00a0\nOne of the reasons for this low ratio is that only low number of medical graduates are passing out each year. Reasons include:\nAs MBBS students are unable to find jobs, they are forced to specialize in a particular field leading to a Super-Specialty craze.\nBrain drain to developed countries is also one of the reasons for unavailability of doctors in India.\nMCI regulations prevent experienced MBBS doctors from carrying out procedures like cesareans and ultrasound tests. Experienced nurses are barred from administering anaesthesia. This leads to failure of utilizing the experienced manpower to increase the service delivery.\nThis shortage of doctors is largely affected by rural health care.\u00a0\nAnother casualty of the Super-specialty craze is Research and teaching, as no one is choosing research or teaching as their preferred career.\n\nSingle breed of doctors can\u2019t cater to all the needs, especially in a country as diverse as India. So medical colleges should sensitize students about all the available opportunities and the attached perks and perils. This will introduce various options available to the students to explore and choose the field best applicable to them.\n\n3. Deficiencies in the quality of medical education\nThere is no uniformity in selection students to medical colleges. A common entrance test at all India level is required to ensure this uniformity.\nBreakthroughs are frequent in the medical field, but syllabus is not updated adequately reflecting these new trends in the medical field.\nLack of skilled teachers has afflicted all the educational paradigms of India. In the medical field, this issue is more critical. Here teachers are selected based on academic knowledge rather than clinical experience and adequate training is not imparted to them. Inadequate salary to teachers is also the main problem that makes this profession unattractive.\nNo uniform quality standards of graduating doctors across India. There should be an exit test, that will bring parity to standards graduating from all medical colleges across India.\n4. Lack of social accountability\nThe medical profession is unique as it requires an amount of social responsibility and societal empathy. Newly graduated doctors are unaware or indifferent to their social responsibility. Colleges play a major role in infusing the young students with an empathetic attitude towards society. But instead, they are encouraging rot learning without the consideration of humanitarian dimension. Hippocratic oath is largely morphing into hypocrisy.\n5. The recognition issue of foreign degrees\nMCI recognizes only a few medical courses from foreign universities. This becomes difficult for foreign graduated students to start practising in India.\n6. Unregulated private colleges\nChange in rules brought about after the reforms of the 1990s made it easier to open private colleges. This has increased the number of medical colleges but leads to many undesired consequences.\nThis commercialization of medical education had a profound impact on quality of graduate doctors, as anyone with money can buy seats in these colleges.\nMCI was incompetent to deal with this influx of commercialization and capitation fee skyrocketed, leading to\u00a0corruption\u00a0and black money circulation.\nThus sanctity of education was lost as medical education became a field for unscrupulous practice and profit gain than imparting education and providing quality doctors. This has resulted in an unhealthy competition which in-turn lead to unreasonable medical practices and unwarranted diagnostics as graduates from these institutions wanted to recover their capitation fees at the earliest. Eventually, this leads to complete crowding out of the societal and humanitarian dimension of medical education from colleges.\nMedical Council of India (MCI) \u2013 History | Objectives | Issues\n\nIndian education system is regulated by Medical Council of India. From setting standards of education to approving colleges and setting ethical guidelines for doctors, are vested in this single institution. So the working of the same will be the main determinant of the success of medical education in India. Given the maladies of the medical education system, an overhaul of MCI is the first and foremost step of rescuing the medical system from its current rot.\n\nHistory of MCI\nMCI is a statutory body for establishing uniform and high standards of medical education in India.\nIt was established in 1934 under the Indian Medical Council Act, 1933. It later reconstituted under the\u00a0Indian Medical Council Act, 1956.\nBut the controversy over corruption plagued the institution as it was dissolved by the President of India in 2010 following the arrest of MCI\u2019s president Ketan Desai under the Prevention of Corruption Act.\nIt was then reconstituted in 2013. After several committee reports and court orders, the government introduced National Medical Council bill in 2018.\nObjectives of MCI\nMaintenance of uniform standards of medical education, for both undergraduate and postgraduate courses.\nRecommendation for recognition/de-recognition of medical qualifications of medical institutions of India or foreign countries.\nPermanent registration/provisional registration of doctors with recognized medical qualifications.\nReciprocity with foreign countries in the matter of mutual recognition of medical qualifications.\nIssues of MCI\nSeparation of regulatory powers\nThe council regulates medical education as well as medical practice leading to the centralization of all regulatory functions in one single body.\nThere should be a separation between the regulation of medical education from regulation of medical practice. Expert committee- Ranjit Roy committee\u00a02014\u00a0\u2013recommended structural re-configuration of the council by separation of power.\nComposition of MCI\nMost of the members of the MCI are elected.\nNITI Aayog Committee (2016) noted that there will be a conflict of interest if members are elected. Because if the regulator is elected by the same fraternity that it would monitor, it will become ineffective and also prevents the entry of skilled professionals for the job. The Committee recommended the appointment of regulators through an independent selection process than elections.\nFee Regulation\nMCI is authorized for fee regulation of private colleges.\nNITI Aayog Committee (2016)\u00a0recommended against this practice as it will lead to corruption and increased capitation fees. Fee cap will discourage the entry of genuine private colleges, limiting the expansion of medical education in the country. Disallowing for-profit medical education has driven profit-taking underground with various kinds of inventive fee structures by medical colleges.\nProfessional conduct\nStanding Committee on Health (2016)\u00a0observed that the present focus of the MCI is only on licensing of medical colleges and no emphasis given to the enforcement of medical ethics in education and on instances of corruption noted within the MCI.\nCommittee recommended that the areas of medical education and medical practice should be separated in terms of enforcement of the appropriate ethics for each of these stages.\n\nThus, now MCI has evolved into a body that has become a powerful rationing authority, controlled by those who it is supposed to be regulating, that is powerful medical colleges and medical professionals.\n\nVarious Committees on Medical Education in India\n1. Ranjit Roy committee\u00a02014\n\nAmidst these crises, the government appointed a high power committee under the chairmanship of Ranjith Roy to look into the issue comprehensively and recommend reforms. Thus the committee has given recommendations, which form the basis of current restructuring of medical education in India. Important recommendations are:\n\nAn\u00a0umbrella body \u2013\u00a0National Medical Commission (NMC) should be constituted through a new act\nNational Medical Commission should have an Appellate Tribunal and four independent and autonomous boards viz.\nUnder-Graduate medical Education Board (UGMEB),\nPost-Graduate Medical Education Board (PGMED),\nMedical Assessment and Rating Board (MARB)\nEthics and Medical Registration Board (EMRB).\nSteps to be taken to decrease the cost of medical education in India.\nRegional\u00a0accessibility should be\u00a0increased.\nDoctor to patient ratio should be increased.\nCommon entrance exam should be conducted.\n\nA parliamentary committee to overhaul MCI was constituted to study Ranjith Roy committee report.\n\n2. Parliamentary standing committee to overhaul MCI 2016 \u2013\u00a0Prof Ram Gopal Yadav\n\nMajor observations of the committee are:\n\nThe committee called MCI a \u201cclub\u201d of influential medical practitioners who act without any fear of government and regulations.\nThere was widespread corruption in granting approval for setting up medical colleges and prevalence of \u2018random\u2019 and opaque inspections as a scrupulous method for corruption.\nThe committee finds MCI as responsible for the prevailing pathetic state of health care and low standard of conduct of medical practitioners and hospitals.\nIt opined that the composition of MCI neither represent professional excellence nor follows medical ethos. More than half of the members are either from corporate hospitals or in private practice, carrying out unnecessary diagnostic tests and surgical procedures and flouting government rules and regulations, especially about treating patients from underprivileged backgrounds.\n\nThe committee asked the government to implement Prof Ranjit Roy Chaudhury committee. The government has introduced NEET exam as a common entrance test from 2016. But on other recommendations, government dragged its feet. Supreme Court ordered an oversight committee under Justice Lodha. Thus the inefficiency of government or executive paved the way for judicial activism.\n\n3. Oversight committee under Justice Lodha 2016\n\nSupreme Court set up an oversight committee under Justice Lodha while\u00a0endorsing\u00a0Parliamentary standing committee report, through\u00a0Article 142,\u00a0to bring in transparency and accountability within the MCI and oversee its statutory functioning. But a turf war between the Supreme court established the oversight committee and MCI hindered reform measures Then the government-appointed a team of five eminent doctors to oversee the medical regulatory body as the 1-year mandate of oversight committee ended.\n\nNational Medical Council Bill 2018 \u2013 Concerns and Solutions\n\nThus we have seen that there are many maladies in medical education in India, most of which roots back to the inefficient functioning of the regulator, the MCI. After a parliamentary committee report and an oversight committee by the Supreme Court, finally, the government have introduced a new bill, titled National Medical Council 2018. It\u00a0is\u00a0currently being debated in parliament. As the bill is being debated, we will look into the issues that are needed to be addressed in the bill:\n\n#Issue 1 \u2013 Inequitable distribution of manpower and resources\nA fixed percentage of seats in each private colleges with government-determined fee structure will cater to economically underprivileged meritorious students. This can meet the issue of access to medical education by weaker sections.\nRemoving bottlenecks to starting colleges, such as conditions stipulating the possession of a vast extent of land and needlessly extensive infrastructure, will considerably rectify the imbalance, especially in under-served States. The primary criterion to set up a college should only be the availability of suitable facilities to impart quality medical education.\n#Issue 2 \u2013 Low doctor-population ratio\nEnding the fee cap and allowing private medical colleges to start new for-profit colleges.\nThis will meet the supply side constraints of medical practice in India by increasing number of doctors. It will also eliminate the regulatory-capture of the medical field in India.\nthis will also reduce corruption and black money generation simultaneously increasing the government revenue. Also, competition among private colleges will decrease the fees, making medical education accessible to all sections of society.\nBridge courses which allow alternative-medicine practitioners (AYUSH) to prescribe modern drugs. (in line with barefoot doctors in China) can broad-base pyramid of health sector by increasing doctors in primary and secondary sector.\nEmpowering experienced doctors and nurses for taking additional responsibilities will be a method for optimal utilization of experienced manpower to give health care services.\nthree-year diploma course for rural medical-care providers, in lines of the Licentiate Medical Practitioners(before 1946), to take up the additional responsibilities of the healthcare sector\nLeverage practitioners in AYUSH to meet doctor deficit through\u00a0cross-practising.\u00a0Shailaja Chandra report 2013\u00a0had opined that\u00a0National Rural Health Mission had recruited AYUSH physicians as the sole care provider in many states, which were effective in meeting the requirement of health care providers. The report recommended training those AYUSH physicians to meet demands in Primary Health Centres.\n#Issue 3 \u2013 Deficiencies in the quality of medical education\nNational licentiate examination for doctors to practice medicine can help to restore public confidence in the competence of medical practitioners by ensuring uniform quality standards across India. Entrance level non-uniformity is met with the introduction of NEET\nIndian healthcare system should incorporate the\u00a0Psycho Socio-Ecological (PSE) model of health.\u00a0PSE focuses on\u00a0social determinants of health with an emphasis on health promotion and disease prevention\nMedical education pedagogy should be improved by frequently revamping syllabus with respect to new breakthroughs in the medical field. The curriculum should include training on emerging technologies and models of healthcare delivery.\nIndia doesn\u2019t follow the use of OSCEs (objective structured clinical exams) to test medical candidates. Thus, their clinical skills are not tested till they start practising.\n#Issue 4 \u2013 Lack of social accountability\nNeed to align medical education with societal needs and expectations than work in isolation. For this community-based education is needed.\n#Issue 5 \u2013 Revamping MCI\nSeparation of power between medical education and medical practice should be the first step in reforming the MCI.\nThere should be an independent selection committee to select members in NMC than electing the members as is done previously with MCI.\nthe annual inspection should be scrapped with one-time registration and licensing, thus nullifying the scope of corruption through random inspections.\nThere should be an independent accreditation and rating agency to inspect and rate colleges on basic standards and a penalty for not conferring with set standards.\nTo reflect interests and concerns of states, an advisory body consisting of representatives from all states and UT should be constituted to advise NMC. Because each state have varied requirements and for a federal nation like India, a one-size-fits-all policy is not suitable. This will lead to issues, like that of Tamil Nadu during the implementation of NEET, to crop up.\nConclusion\n\nIndian higher education system has a common problem concerning with incapacity of regulators like UGC, AICTE, MCI etc. A common problem of these institutions is the concentration of power as they regulate both educational practices and professional practices\u00a0leading to a conflict of interest. There is a need for comprehensive reforms to usher in governance reforms for cleansing Indian higher education system of its maladies.\n\nMoreover, all stakeholders should acknowledge that medical education has a special sanctity in itself. This should not be lost to the altar of profit-making.\n\nAs from above discussion, it is clear that a complete surgery of Indian medical education system is needed in order to cure cancer with which it has been afflicted. NMC act will be a watershed act in this respect. For a bill of such huge scope, it is prudent to have wide-ranging debates and discussions. So delay in the passage of the act is worth the while for waiting.\n\nArticle by: Sethu\u00a0Krishnan M\n\nReferences: PRS blog, The Hindu, Wikipedia, Hindustan Times, New Indian Express, India Today"

This will bring the hitherto uncovered age group of 3-6 years under the school curriculum, which has been recognized globally as the crucial stage for the development of the mental faculties of a child. The new system will have 12 years of schooling with three years of Anganwadi/ pre-schooling.\n\nNCERT will develop a National Curricular and Pedagogical Framework for Early Childhood Care and Education (NCPFECCE) for children up to the age of 8. ECCE will be delivered through a significantly expanded and strengthened system of institutions including Anganwadis and pre-schools that will have teachers and Anganwadi workers trained in the ECCE pedagogy and curriculum.

Sanskrit to be offered at all levels of school and higher education as an option for students, including in the three-language formula. Other classical languages and literature of India also to be available as options. No language will be imposed on any student.\n\nStudents to participate in a fun project/activity on \u2018The Languages of India\u2019, sometime in Grades 6-8, such as, under the \u2018Ek Bharat Shrestha Bharat\u2019 initiative. Several foreign languages will also be offered at the secondary level. Indian Sign Language (ISL) will be standardized across the country, and National and State curriculum materials developed, for use by students with hearing impairment.\n\nAssessment Reforms\n\nNEP 2020 envisages a shift from summative assessment to regular and formative assessment, which is more competency-based, promotes learning and development, and tests higher-order skills, such as analysis, critical thinking, and conceptual clarity. All students will take school examinations in Grades 3, 5, and 8 which will be conducted by the appropriate authority.\n\nBoard exams for Grades 10 and 12 will be continued, but redesigned with holistic development as the aim. A new National Assessment Centre, PARAKH (Performance Assessment, Review, and Analysis of Knowledge for Holistic Development), will be set up as a standard-setting body.\n\nEquitable and Inclusive Education\n\nNEP 2020 aims to ensure that no child loses any opportunity to learn and excel because of the circumstances of birth or background. Special emphasis will be given to Socially and Economically Disadvantaged Groups (SDGs), including gender, sociocultural, and geographical identities and disabilities.

It is a significant step towards building a knowledge-based society that is equipped to meet the challenges of the 21st century. The NEP aims to transform the education system by providing equitable access to quality education, promoting innovation, and fostering holistic development.\n\nThe policy emphasizes the need for a learner-centered approach that focuses on critical thinking, creativity, and problem-solving. It also seeks to promote interdisciplinary learning, multilingualism, and the integration of vocational education into the mainstream curriculum.\n\nThe NEP\u2019s vision of a flexible and inclusive education system that enables lifelong learning is laudable. However, the success of the policy will depend on its effective implementation, which will require adequate funding, infrastructure, and skilled educators.\n\nOverall, the NEP has the potential to revolutionize the education sector in India and make it more relevant and responsive to the needs of the changing world. It is a bold and visionary document that seeks to transform education from being a means of social mobility to a tool for building a better and more just society.\n\nAlso Read: Institutions of Eminence Scheme;\u00a0Education in state list: Should it be restored?"

These reform movements evoked the spirit of devoting life to doing something for the disadvantaged sections of society. It recognized the right of untouchables to education, work of choice and worship, the right of women to education and other social aspects of life. This gave birth to the idea of voluntary organizations for the first time in Indian history.\n\nPhase two: The second half of the 19th century witnessed an unprecedented socio-political awakening that resulted in the blooming of institutionalized reform movements such as Brahmo Samaj, Arya Samaj, Ramakrishna Mission etc. This prompted the Government to enact the Societies Registration Act of 1860.\n\nPhase three\u00a0(1900-1947): This period marked the successful attempt to channel the voluntary spirit for political action and mass mobilization for the struggle for independence. It influenced the formation of many future voluntary organizations.\n\nPost-Independence period:\u00a0 In the post-independence period, a large number of voluntary organizations have taken part in the process of nation-building. The shift to a neoliberal economic and political agenda facilitated the growth of voluntary organizations at a faster pace.\n\nRegistration of NGOs\n\nIndian NGOs mainly come under three segments \u2013 Societies, Trusts, and Charitable Companies.\n\nSocieties: Societies have to register under The Societies Registration Act, of 1860.\nTrusts: Private trusts are registered under the central government\u2019s Indian Trusts Act, of 1882, and public ones are registered under the state legislation concerned.\nCharitable companies: They are set up according to section 8 of the Companies Act, 2013. For charitable companies, the compliance requirements are high, as loans and advances are easily available to them compared to a trust or a society. They have to even pay Income tax under the IT Act 1961.\nWho regulates NGOs?\n\nThere are laws for the regulation of the functioning of NGOs in India. Foreign Contribution Regulation Act(FCRA) and Foreign Exchange Management Act(FEMA Act)\u00a0are among the most important laws connected with NGOs.\n\nForeign Contribution Regulation Act(FCRA)\n\nHistory: Enacted in 1976 by the IndiraGandhi-led Government during the emergency. It regulates all grants, non-Indian gifts, and donations-Indian residents. It also prohibits electoral candidates, political parties, judges, MPs and even cartoonists from accepting foreign contributions. The ostensible justification given for the law was to curb foreign interference in domestic politics.\n\nFCRA (Amendment Act) 2010 highlights:\n\nThe amended FCRA Act 2010, barred organizations of a \u2018political nature\u2019 from accepting foreign contributions. It also mandated that the organizations receiving foreign funds should renew their licenses every five years.\n\nFCRA and Political parties\nIn 2014, the Delhi High Court found that both BJP and Congress were violating the provisions of FCRA (See the FCRA,2010 Amendment) by accepting funds from the Indian Subsidiaries of London-based multinational Vedanta.\nIn 2016, the Government made an amendment to FCRA 2010 with retrospective effect, so that contributions from foreign companies (with 50% foreign shareholding) to not-for-profit, political parties and candidates contesting elections, newspapers, government employees etc. does not come under the definition of foreign source.\nImpact of Amendment\nIt made it legal for political parties to accept foreign aid through Indian subsidiaries.\nThis move helped Companies to ease CSR (Corporate Social Responsibility) spending as repetitive consent from the Home Ministry is no longer required for the disbursement of funds by foreign companies.\nNGOs have got access to foreign funds more easily than before except for the prior permission category NGOs.\nFCRA and NGOs:\nAccording to the FCRA, any NGO that accepts foreign contributions has to register with the Home Ministry and such contributions can only be accepted through designated banks.\nThe NGO has to report to the central government any foreign contribution within 30 days of its receipt.\nThey need to file annual reports with the home ministry. It must also report the amount of foreign contribution, its source, how it was received, the purpose for which it was intended, and the manner in which it was utilized.\nIn a case of non-compliance with provisions of the FCRA, the government can penalize an NGO. For example, if these NGOs don\u2019t file annual returns, the government can issue a show-cause notice and subsequently, suspend or cancel their foreign funding licenses.\nIn the last two years, licenses of around 20000 NGOs have been cancelled by the central government after they were found violating various provisions of the FCRA act. Hence those NGOs were barred from receiving any foreign funds.\nForeign Exchange Management Act (FEMA)\nThere are certain NGOs which are registered under FEMA and they disburse foreign funds to various associations within the country. Nearly 100 international NGOs and associations receive foreign funds through their liaison offices and disburse them to NGOs across India.\nAccording to the FEMA Act, these NGOs are regulated by the Finance Ministry. For example, International donors such as the Ford Foundation, the U.K.\u2019s Department for International Development etc are registered under FEMA but not the Foreign Contribution Regulation Act (FCRA) 2010. This makes it difficult to monitor the flow of funds effectively.\nThe role of NGOs in our society\nThey act as service contractors, able to work more efficiently and more effectively than government agencies thereby playing an important role in the socio-economic transformation.\nIt brings accountability and transparency to governance.\nIt acts as a human rights watchdog in the society.\nNGOs act as channels for donors to provide international development funds to low-income countries or developing countries.\nIssues with the functioning of NGOs:\n\nMisappropriation of funds: Many NGOs don\u2019t have sophisticated finance and legal teams, nor do they have the funds to conduct audits.\nThe external issue of funding: According to government data a total of 3,068 non-governmental organizations (NGOs) received foreign funding above Rs. 22,000 Cr in 2014-15. It is often said that foreign-funded NGOs try to propagate foreign propaganda to stall developmental projects. Example: Kudankulam Protest.\nNonaccountable, nontransparent undemocratic functioning: CBI records filed in the Supreme Court show that only 10% of the total registered NGOs under the Societies Registration Act file annual financial statements.\nMoney Laundering: Corrupt or unscrupulous NGOs that receive foreign funds may serve as conduits for money laundering.\nWay ahead\nA regulatory mechanism to keep a watch on the financial activities of NGOs and voluntary organizations is the need of the hour.\nThe government should frame guidelines for their accreditation, the manner in which these organizations should maintain their accounts and the procedure for recovery in case they fail to submit their balance sheets.\nAvoid tussle between the Home Ministry and Finance Ministry by bringing the regulation of NGOs under one head.\nGeneral Financial Rules, 2005 have mandated a regulatory mechanism for the NGOs and a comprehensive law in line with these rules should be framed in no time.\n\nRead:\u00a0Self-Regulatory Organisations (SROs)\n\nReferences:\n\nThe Hindu\u00a0and The Hindu.\nWikipedia.\nWHO.\nPRSindia.\nEconomic Times.\nFirst Post.\nFinMin.\nFCRAonline.\nGlobal Policy.\n\nArticle contributed by: Sree Resmi S"

Such information includes GST collections, digital payments, satellite photographs, electricity production, cargo movements, internal/external trade, infrastructure roll-out, delivery of various schemes, mobility indicators etc.\n\nThe \u201cAgile approach\u201d is based on feedback loops, real-time monitoring of actual outcomes, flexible responses, safety-net buffers and so on.\n\nPlanning is not done in the Agile approach as a deterministic prediction of the flow of events. Still, planning is relevant in the framework \u2013 mostly for scenario analysis, identifying vulnerable sections, and understanding policy options.\n\nEconomic Survey 2021-22: Highlights\n\nEconomic Survey 2021-22 reverts to a single volume plus a separate volume for the Statistical Appendix.\n\nThe highlights of the Economic Survey are as follows:\n\nState of the Economy\nEconomic Survey 2021-22 estimates that the Indian economy (GDP) may grow by 9.2 per cent in real terms in 2021-22 (as per first advanced estimates) subsequent to a contraction of 7.3 per cent in 2020-21.\nGDP is projected to grow by 8- 8.5 per cent in real terms in 2022-23.\nThe year ahead is poised for a pickup in private sector investment with the financial system in a good position to provide support for the economy\u2019s revival.\nProjection is comparable with World Bank and Asian Development Bank\u2019s latest forecasts of real GDP growth of 8.7 per cent and 7.5 per cent respectively for 2022-23.\nAs per IMF\u2019s latest World Economic Outlook projections, India\u2019s real GDP is projected to grow at 9 per cent in 2021-22 and 2022-23 and at 7.1 per cent in 2023-2024, which would make India the fastest-growing major economy in the world for all 3years.\nAgriculture and allied sectors are expected to grow by 3.9 per cent; industry by 11.8 per cent and services sector by 8.2 per cent in 2021-22.\nOn the demand side, consumption is estimated to grow by 7.0 per cent, Gross Fixed Capital Formation (GFCF) by 15 per cent, exports by 16.5 per cent and imports by 29.4 per cent in 2021-22.\nMacroeconomic stability indicators suggest that the Indian Economy is well placed to take on the challenges of 2022-23.\nA combination of high foreign exchange reserves, sustained foreign direct investment, and rising export earnings will provide an adequate buffer against possible global liquidity tapering in 2022-23.\nThe economic impact of the \u201csecond wave\u201d was much smaller than that during the full lockdown phase in 2020-21, though the health impact was more severe.\nGovernment of India\u2019s unique response comprised of safety-nets to cushion the impact on vulnerable sections of society and the business sector, significant increase in capital expenditure to spur growth and supply-side reforms for a sustained long-term expansion.\nThe government\u2019s flexible and multi-layered response is partly based on an \u201cAgile\u201d framework that uses feedback-loops, and the use of eighty High-Frequency Indicators (HFIs) in an environment of extreme uncertainty.\nFiscal Developments\nEconomic Survey 2021-22 observes that the revenue receipts from the Central Government (April to November 2021) have gone up by 67.2 per cent (YoY) as against the expected growth of 9.6 per cent in the 2021-22 Budget Estimates (over 2020-21 Provisional Actuals).\nGross Tax Revenue registers a growth of over 50 per cent from April to November 2021 in YoY terms.\u00a0 This performance is strong compared to pre-pandemic levels of 2019-2020 also.\nDuring April-November 2021, Capex has grown by 13.5 per cent (YoY) with a focus on infrastructure-intensive sectors.\nSustained revenue collection and a targeted expenditure policy have contained the fiscal deficit for April to November 2021 at 46.2 per cent of BE.\nWith the enhanced borrowings on account of COVID-19, the Central Government debt has gone up from 49.1 per cent of GDP in 2019-20 to 59.3 per cent of GDP in 2020-21 but is expected to follow a declining trajectory with the recovery of the economy.\nExternal Sectors\nIndia\u2019s merchandise exports and imports rebounded strongly and surpassed pre-COVID levels during the current financial year.\nThere was a significant pickup in net services with both receipts and payments crossing the pre-pandemic levels, despite weak tourism revenues.\nNet capital flows were higher at US$ 65.6 billion in the first half of 2021-22, on account of continued inflow of foreign investment, revival in net external commercial borrowings, higher banking capital and additional special drawing rights (SDR) allocation.\nIndia\u2019s external debt rose to US $ 593.1 billion at the end-September 2021, from US $ 556.8 billion a year earlier, reflecting additional SDR allocation by IMF, coupled with higher commercial borrowings.\nForeign Exchange Reserves crossed US$ 600 billion in the first half of 2021-22 and touched US $ 633.6 billion as of December 31, 2021.\nAs of end-November 2021, India was the fourth-largest forex reserves holder in the world after China, Japan and Switzerland.\nMonetary Management and Financial Intermediation\nEconomic Survey 2021-22 notes that the liquidity in the system remained in surplus.\nRepo rate was maintained at 4 per cent in 2021-22.\nRBI undertook various measures such as G-Sec Acquisition Programme and Special Long-Term Repo Operations to provide further liquidity.\nThe economic shock of the pandemic has been weathered well by the commercial banking system:\nYoY Bank credit growth accelerated gradually in 2021-22 from 5.3 per cent in April 2021 to 9.2 per cent as of 31st\u00a0December 2021.\nThe Gross Non-Performing Advances ratio of Scheduled Commercial Banks (SCBs) declined from 11.2 per cent at the end of 2017-18 to 6.9 per cent at the end of September 2021.\nNet Non-Performing Advances ratio declined from 6 per cent to 2.2 per cent during the same period.\nThe capital to risk-weighted asset ratio of SCBs continued to increase from 13 per cent in 2013-14 to 16.54 per cent at the end of September 2021.\nThe Return on Assets and Return on Equity for Public Sector Banks continued to be positive for the period ending September 2021.\nExceptional year for the capital markets:\nRs. 89,066 crores were raised via 75 Initial Public Offering (IPO) issues in April-November 2021, which is much higher than in any year in the last decade.\nSensex and Nifty scaled up to a touching peak at 61,766 and 18,477 on October 18, 2021.\nAmong major emerging market economies, Indian markets outperformed peers in April-December 2021.\nPrices and Inflation\nThe average headline CPI-Combined inflation moderated to 5.2 per cent in 2021-22 (April-December) from 6.6 per cent in the corresponding period of 2020-21.\nThe decline in retail inflation was led by the easing of food inflation.\nFood inflation averaged at a low of 2.9 per cent in 2021-22 (April to December) as against 9.1 per cent in the corresponding period last year.\nEffective supply-side management kept prices of most essential commodities under control during the year.\nProactive measures were taken to contain the price rise in pulses and edible oils.\nReduction in central excise and subsequent cuts in Value Added Tax by most States helped ease petrol and diesel prices.\nWholesale inflation based on the Wholesale Price Index (WPI) rose to 12.5 per cent during 2021-22 (April to December).\n\u00a0This has been attributed to:\nLow base in the previous year,\nPick-up in economic activity,\nA sharp increase in international prices of crude oil and other imported inputs, and\nHigh freight costs.\nThe divergence between CPI-C and WPI Inflation:\nThe divergence peaked at 9.6 percentage points in May 2020.\nHowever, this year there was a reversal in divergence with retail inflation falling below wholesale inflation by 8.0 percentage points in December 2021.\nThis divergence can be explained by factors such as:\nVariations due to base effect,\nThe difference in scope and coverage of the two indices,\nPrice collections,\nItems covered,\nThe difference in commodity weights, and\nWPI is more sensitive to cost-push inflation led by imported inputs.\nWith the gradual waning of the base effect in WPI, the divergence in CPI-C and WPI is also expected to narrow down.\nSustainable Development and Climate Change\n\nIndia\u2019s overall score on the NITI Aayog SDG India Index and Dashboard improved to 66 in 2020-21 from 60 in 2019-20 and 57 in 2018-19.\n\nThe number of Front Runners (scoring 65-99) increased to 22 States and UTs in 2020-21 from 10 in 2019-20.\n\nIn North-East India, 64 districts were Front Runners and 39 districts were Performers in the NITI Aayog North-Eastern Region District SDG Index 2021-22.\n\nIndia has the tenth largest forest area in the world.\n\nIn 2020, India ranked third globally in increasing its forest area from 2010 to 2020.\n\nIn 2020, the forests covered 24% of India\u2019s total geographical, accounting for 2% of the world\u2019s total forest area.\n\nIn August 2021, the Plastic Waste Management Amendment Rules, 2021, was notified which is aimed at phasing out single-use plastic by 2022.\n\nDraft regulation on Extended Producer Responsibility for plastic packaging was notified.\n\nThe Compliance status of Grossly Polluting Industries (GPIs) located in the Ganga main stem and its tributaries improved from 39% in 2017 to 81% in 2020.\n\nThe consequent reduction in effluent discharge has been from 349.13 million litres per day (MLD) in 2017 to 280.20 MLD in 2020.\n\nThe Prime Minister, as a part of the national statement delivered at the 26th\u00a0Conference of Parties (COP 26) in Glasgow in November 2021, announced ambitious targets to be achieved by 2030 to enable further reduction in emissions.\n\nThe need to start the one-word movement \u2018LIFE\u2019 (Lifestyle for Environment) urging mindful and deliberate utilization instead of mindless and destructive consumption was underlined.\n\nAgriculture and Food Management\n\nThe Agriculture sector experienced buoyant growth in the past two years, accounting for a sizeable 18.8% (2021-22) in Gross Value Added (GVA) of the country registering a growth of 3.6% in 2020-21 and 3.9% in 2021-22.\n\nMinimum Support Price (MSP) policy is being used to promote crop diversification.\n\nNet receipts from crop production have increased by 22.6% in the latest Situation Assessment Survey (SAS) compared to the SAS Report of 2014.\n\nAllied sectors including animal husbandry, dairying and fisheries are steadily emerging to be high growth sectors and major drivers of overall growth in the agriculture sector.\n\nThe Livestock sector has grown at a CAGR of 8.15% over the last five years ending 2019-20. It has been a stable source of income across groups of agricultural households accounting for about 15% of their average monthly income.\n\nGovernment facilitates food processing through various measures of infrastructure development, subsidized transportation and support for the formalization of micro food enterprises.\n\nIndia runs one of the largest food management programmes in the world.\n\nThe government has further extended the coverage of food security networks through schemes like PM Gareeb Kalyan Yojana (PMGKY).\n\nIndustry and Infrastructure\nIndex of Industrial Production (IIP) grew at 17.4 per cent (YoY) during April-November 2021 as compared to (-)15.3 per cent in April-November 2020.\nCapital expenditure for the Indian railways has increased to Rs. 155,181 crores in 2020-21 from an average annual of Rs. 45,980 crores during 2009-14 and it has been budgeted to further increase to Rs. 215,058 crores in 2021-22 \u2013 a five times increase in comparison to the 2014 level.\nThe extent of road construction per day increased substantially in 2020-21 to 36.5 Kms per day from 28 Kms per day in 2019-20 \u2013 a rise of 30.4 per cent.\nNet profit to sales ratio of large corporates reached an all-time high of 10.6 per cent in the July-September quarter of 2021-22 despite the pandemic (RBI Study).\nIntroduction of Production Linked Incentive (PLI) scheme, the major boost provided to infrastructure-both physical as well as digital, along with measures to reduce transaction costs and improve ease of doing business, would support the pace of recovery.\nServices\nGVA of services crossed pre-pandemic level in July-September quarter of 2021-22; however, GVA of contact intensive sectors like trade, transport, etc. still remain below pre-pandemic level.\nOverall service Sector GVA is expected to grow by 8.2 per cent in 2021-22.\nDuring April-December 2021, rail freight crossed its pre-pandemic level while air freight and port traffic almost reached their pre-pandemic levels, domestic air and rail passenger traffic are increasing gradually \u2013 shows the impact of the second wave was much more muted as compared to during the first wave.\nDuring the first half of 2021-22, the service sector received over US$ 16.7 billion FDI \u2013 accounting for almost 54 per cent of total FDI inflows into India.\nIT-BPM services revenue reached US$ 194 billion in 2020-21, adding 1.38 lakh employees during the same period.\nMajor government reforms include removing telecom regulations in the IT-BPO sector and opening up of space sector to private players.\nServices exports surpassed the pre-pandemic level in the January-March quarter of 2020-21 and grew by 21.6 per cent in the first half of 2021-22 \u2013 strengthened by global demand for software and IT services exports.\nIndia has become 3rd largest start-up ecosystem in the world after US and China.

He pointed out a few months back that the loss of trust is the main reason for the current economic slowdown in India. It\u2019s a good sign that the ES2020 is paving the way for policies addressing this concern.\n\nNote: The theme of last year\u2019s Economic Survey (ES 2018-2019) was to enable shifting gears to accelerate and sustain a real GDP growth rate of 8% and thereby achieve the vision of a $5 trillion Indian economy.\n\n3. Only when wealth is created wealth will be distributed\n\nEconomic Survey2020 quotes the Hon\u2019ble Prime Minister\u2019s Independence Day Speech on 15th August 2019, when he highlighted that only when\nwealth is created will wealth be distributed?\n\n4. Suspicion towards India\u2019s wealth-creators is ill-advised\n\nES2020 says that the feeling of suspicion and disrespect towards India\u2019s wealth-creators is ill-advised.\n\nEcoSurvey 2019-20 attempts to put to rest any skepticism about the benefits accruing from a market economy, both in economic thinking and policy-making.\n\n5. Ethical wealth creation is a noble human pursuit\n\nEconomic Survey 2019-2020 is bold and open in stating that ethical wealth creation is a noble human pursuit.\n\n6. The ideas of wealth creation are rooted in India\u2019s old tradition\n\nThe Survey documents that ideas of wealth creation are rooted in India\u2019s old and rich traditions ranging from Kautilya\u2019s Arthashastra to Thiruvalluvar\u2019s Thirukural. ES survey finds that India has been the dominant economic power globally for more than three-fourths of known economic history. The survey points out that India has designed it to be wealthy.\n\n7. The invisible hand of the market supported by the hand of trust\n\nEconomic Survey \u2013 throughout most chapters \u2013 hints about the power of the invisible hand of the market. It argues for eliminating policies that undermine markets through government intervention.\n\nThe survey also speaks volumes about the need to build trust by ending static-crony capitalism. It mentions the need to shift from \u201cPro-crony\u201d to \u201cpro-business\u201d, particularly promoting entrepreneurship at the grass-root level.\n\n8. Trust is a public good\n\nEconomic Survey Introduces the idea of \u201ctrust as a public good that gets enhanced with greater use\u201d. The Survey also makes some suggestions for enhancing this public good.\n\n9. Indian GDP estimates can be trusted\n\nWhile many are now skeptical about the authenticity and accuracy of the GDP figures released by the Government of India, the Survey says that GDP estimates can be trusted.\n\n10. Use of principles of behavioral economics as instruments of economic policy\n\nThis year\u2019s ES like last year\u2019s ES, uses principles of behavioral economics as instruments of economic policy. This is used as an easy prism to gain insights about human behavior.\n\nIn this context, the Economic Survey 2019-20 presents \u201cThalinomics\u201d- an attempt to relate economics to the common person using something that he or she encounters every day \u2013 a plate of food i.e. a Thali.\n\nImportant Economic Statistics from Economic Survey 2019-20\n\nEconomic Survey 2019-20 has put current fiscal growth (2019-20) at five per cent.\nES2020 mentions that the fiscal deficit target for the current fiscal may need to be relaxed to revive growth.\nEconomic Survey 2019-20 has projected economic growth at 6 to 6.5 per cent in the fiscal year (2020-21) starting 1st of April this year.\nAbout 1.24 lakh new firms were created in 2018, which is an increase of about 80 percent from about 70,000 in 2014.\nThe industrial sector, as per the Index of Industrial Production (IIP), registered only a growth of 0.6 percent in 2019-20 (April-November) as compared to 5.0 percent during 2018-19 (April-November).\nIndia\u2019s BoP position improved from US$ 412.9 bn of forex reserves in end-March, 2019 to US$ 433.7 bn in end-September 2019. Foreign reserves stood at US$ 461.2 bn as of 10th January 2020.\nThe Gross Non-Performing Advances ratio remained unchanged for Scheduled Commercial banks at 9.3% between March and September 2019. NPA increased slightly for the Non-Banking Financial Corporations (NBFCs) from 6.1% in March 2019 to 6.3% in September 2019.\nCurrent Account Deficit (CAD) narrowed to 1.5 % of GDP in H1 of 2019-20 from 2.1 % in 2018-19.\nFrom 2006-07 to 2019-20, the affordability of vegetarian Thalis improved by 29 % while the affordability of non-vegetarian Thalis improved by 18 %.\n\nDOWNLOAD 100 IMPORTANT MCQS FROM ES AND BUDGET 2020\n\nWhat makes the Economic Survey 2020 special?\n\nKrishnamurthy V. Subramanian, the Chief Economic Adviser of the Ministry of Finance has done a commendable job in producing a thought-provoking masterpiece on \u2018ethical wealth creation\u2018, particularly at this crucial time when India is facing a major economic slowdown.\n\nEconomic Survey 2019-20 believes that India has an unprecedented opportunity to chart a China-like labor-intensive, export trajectory. The survey emphasizes creating jobs and growth by specialization in network products.\n\nThe survey moves forward ideas like integrating \u201cAssemble in India\u201d into \u201cMake In India\u201d to focus on labor-intensive exports and thereby create jobs on a large scale. It also discusses efficiently scaling up the banking sector to be proportionate to the size of the Indian economy. Meanwhile, it also advises tracking the health of the shadow banking sector.\n\nThe survey had called for more reforms to make it easier to do business in the country. It advises the use of privatization to foster efficiency.\n\nThe survey said for India to achieve a five trillion US dollar economy depends on promoting pro-business policies, strengthening the invisible hand of the market, and ease of doing business.\n\nThe Economic Survey 2019-20 has given the emphasis on entrepreneurship and wealth creation at the grassroots. This message is reflected in Budget 2020 as well."

India has only 7 taxpayers for every 100 voters!\n\nIndia has only 7 taxpayers for every 100 voters ranking us 13th amongst 18 of our democratic G-20 peers. This raises one important question: India has political democracy, but does it has fiscal democracy?\n\n2. India\u2019s Demographic Dividend will last longer (for around 45 years)\n\nIndia has a distinctive demographic dividend. India\u2019s share of working age to non-working age population will peak later and at a lower level than that for other countries but last longer. The peak of the growth boost due to the demographic dividend is fast approaching, with peninsular states peaking soon and the hinterland states peaking much later.\n\n3. As a percent of GDP, India Trades More Than China!\n\nAs of 2011, India\u2019s openness \u2013 measured as the ratio of trade in goods and services to GDP has far overtaken China\u2019s, a country famed for using trade as an engine of growth. India\u2019s internal trade to GDP is also comparable to that of other large countries and very different from the caricature of a barrier-riddled economy.\n\n\ud83d\udc49 Which year are YOU targeting for success in the IAS/IPS/IFS Exam? \ud83d\ude80\n\n(1) \u21d2 UPSC 2025: Prelims cum Mains\n\n(2) \u21d2 UPSC 2026: Prelims cum Mains\n\n(3) \u21d2 UPSC 2027 Prelims cum Mains\n\nTip: Know more about ClearIAS Courses (Online/Offline)\n\nIt should also be noted that India\u2019s internal trade as a percentage of GDP is also reasonably high. India\u2019s internal trade to GDP is also comparable to that of other large countries and very different from the caricature of a barrier-riddled economy.\n\n4. Divergence within India, Big Time\n\nSpatial dispersion in income is still rising in India in the last decade (2004-14), unlike the rest of the world and even China. That is, despite more porous borders within India than between countries internationally, the forces of \u201cconvergence\u201d have been elusive.\n\n5. There is Big Unexploited Property Tax Potential in India\n\n\nEvidence from satellite data indicates that Bengaluru and Jaipur collect only between 5% to 20% of their potential property taxes.\n\n6.\u00a0Work-Related Migration has increased since 2011\n\nAs can be seen from the above graph, 8-10 million people migrate on annual basis for work. This is\u00a0based on railway passenger traffic data. This figure is almost double of what the 2011 Census suggests.\n\n7. There are biases in perception with respect to China and India\n\nChina\u2019s credit rating was upgraded from A+ to AA- in December 2010 while India\u2019s has remained unchanged at BBB-. From 2009 to 2015, China\u2019s credit-to-GDP soared from about 142 percent to 205 percent and its growth decelerated. The contrast with India\u2019s indicators is striking.\n\n8. There is a big shortfall in the allocation of funds to many poor districts!\n\nWelfare spending in India suffers from misallocation: as the pair of charts show, the districts with the poorest (in red on the left) are the ones that suffer from the greatest shortfall of funds (in red on the right) in social programs. The districts accounting for the poorest 40% receive only 29% of the total funding. There is a big shortfall in allocation to many poor districts.\n\nCourtesy: Economic Survey"

            "[META]": "Last updated on September 22, 2023 by Alex Andrews George",
            "[CONTENT]": "Just like the Economic Survey 2016 which had 8 interesting facts, Economic Survey 2017 too has brought us new facts. The Economic Survey 2017-18 has relied upon analysis of the new data to highlight ten new economic facts, which is discussed below.\n\nTable of Contents\n\nFact 1: Large increase in registered indirect as well as direct taxpayers.\nFact 2: Indian formal sector is substantially greater than what it is currently is believed to be\nFact 3: States prosperity is positively correlated with international trade and inter-state trade\nFact 4: India\u2019s export structure is more egalitarian than many large countries\nFact 5: Clothing incentive package boosted exports of ready-made garments\nFact 6: Indian parents continue to have children until they get the desired number of sons\nFact 7: Government action could decrease substantial litigation in the tax arena\nFact 8: Growth in Saving\u00a0\u2260 Economic Growth; Growth in Investment = Economic Growth\nFact 9: Collection of direct taxes by Indian states and Local Self Governments are significantly lower than their counterparts\nFact 10: Extreme weather adversely impacts agricultural yields\nView the 10 New Facts on Indian Economy as a Graphical Presentation\nFact 1: Large increase in registered indirect as well as direct taxpayers.\n\nGoods and Services Tax (GST) has given a new perceptive of the Indian economy and new data has emerged. There has been a fifty percent increase in the number of indirect taxpayers. There has also been a large increase in voluntary registrations, especially by small enterprises that buy from large enterprises wanting to avail themselves of input tax credits.\n\nThe Survey also stated that fears of major producing states that the shift to the new system would undermine their tax collections have been allayed as the distribution of the GST base among the states got closely linked to the size of their economies.\n\nSimilarly, there has been an addition of about 18 lakh in individual income tax filers since November 2016.\n\nFact 2: Indian formal sector is substantially greater than what it is currently is believed to be\n\nIndia\u2019s formal sector, especially formal non-farm payroll, is substantially greater than what it currently is believed to be. It became evident that when \u201cformality\u201d was defined in terms of social security provisions like EPFO/ESIC the formal sector payroll was found to be about 31 percent of the non-agricultural workforce. When \u201cformality\u201d was defined in terms of being part of the GST net, such formal sector payroll share was found to be 53 percent.\n\nFact 3: States prosperity is positively correlated with international trade and inter-state trade\n\nData on the international exports of states indicates a strong correlation between export performance and states\u2019 standard of living. States that export internationally and trade with other states were found to be richer. Such correlation is stronger between prosperity and international trade.\n\nFact 4: India\u2019s export structure is more egalitarian than many large countries\n\nIndia\u2019s exports are unusual in that the largest firms account for a much smaller share of exports than in other comparable countries. Top one percent of Indian firms account only for 38% of exports unlike in other countries where they account for substantially greater share \u2013 (72, 68, 67 and 55 percent in Brazil, Germany, Mexico and USA respectively). Such tendencies were also found to be true for the top five or ten percent of the Indian companies.\n\n\ud83d\udc49 Which year are YOU targeting for success in the IAS/IPS/IFS Exam? \ud83d\ude80\n\n(1) \u21d2 UPSC 2025: Prelims cum Mains\n\n(2) \u21d2 UPSC 2026: Prelims cum Mains\n\n(3) \u21d2 UPSC 2027 Prelims cum Mains\n\nTip: Know more about ClearIAS Courses (Online/Offline)\n\nFact 5: Clothing incentive package boosted exports of ready-made garments\n\nIt was pointed out that the Rebate of State Levies (ROSL) has increased exports of ready-made garments (man-made fibres) by about 16 percent but not of others.\n\nFact 6: Indian parents continue to have children until they get the desired number of sons\n\nThe data highlighted another seemingly known fact that Indian society exhibits a strong desire for a male child. It pointed out that most parents continued to have children until they get a number of sons. The survey gave details of various scenarios leading to skewed sex ratios and also gave a comparison of sex ratio by birth between India and Indonesia.\n\nFact 7: Government action could decrease substantial litigation in the tax arena\n\nThe survey pointed out that tax departments in India have gone in for contesting against in several tax disputes but also with a low success rate which is below 30 percent. About 66 percent of pending cases accounted for only 1.8 percent of value at stake. It further stated that 0.2 percent of cases accounted for 56 percent of the value at stake.\n\nFact 8: Growth in Saving\u00a0\u2260 Economic Growth; Growth in Investment = Economic Growth\n\nExtrapolating the data the survey indicated that growth in savings did not bring economic growth but the growth in investment did.\n\nFact 9: Collection of direct taxes by Indian states and Local Self Governments are significantly lower than their counterparts\n\nThe survey mentions that collections of direct taxes by Indian states and other local governments, where they have powers to collect them is significantly lower than their counterparts in other federal countries. A comparison has been given between ratios of the direct tax to total revenues of local governments in India, Brazil and Germany.\n\nFact 10: Extreme weather adversely impacts agricultural yields\n\nThe survey captures the footprints of climate change on the Indian territory and consequent adverse impact on agricultural yields. Extreme temperature increases and deficiency in rainfall have been captured on the Indian map and the graphical changes in agricultural yields are brought out from such data. The impact was found to be twice as large in un-irrigated areas as in irrigated ones.\n\nView the 10 New Facts on Indian Economy as a Graphical Presentation\n\n[slideshare id=92036092&doc=10newfactsonindianeconomybasedones2017-180327090638]"

It gives a detailed account of the various sectors of the economy and overall economic scenario of the country in the past years and provides an outline for the year ahead. Increasingly it has also become a forum for analysis and research on the economy, and hence also a source of policy ideas.\n\nWhen was the first Economic Survey of India presented?\n\nIndias first Economic Survey was presented in the year 1950-51. Up to\u00a01964, it was presented along with the Union Budget. From 1964 0nwards, it has been delinked from the Budget.\n\nWho prepares the Economic Survey?\n\nThe Economic Survey was prepared by the Economic Division of the Department of Economic Affairs in the Finance Ministry under the overall guidance of the Cheif Economic Adviser.

The Economic Survey is presented normally a day before the presentation of the Union Budget in the Parliment by the Finance Minister.\n\nWhy is it presented before the Budget?\n\nThe Economic survey provides the assessment of overall performance of the economy during the year along with the background knowledge of the financial developments in the country. The survey was de-linked from the Budget in the year 1964 and circulated in advance so that a context of the Budget can be provided.

But deviating from its previous stand, India didn\u2019t sign the TFA pointing some other reasons. We will come to that later.\n\nNow, what is Trade Facilitation Agreement (TFA)? The Trade Facilitation Agreement (TFA) was one among the 10 agreements of the deal the WTO members (including India) had agreed upon in December 2013 Bali Ministerial meeting. The TFA seeks to speed up global trade by reforming customs procedures and cutting red tape.\n\nIndia had agreed to sign the TFA by July 31st 2014, but with the change in government, we took a different stand.\n\nSo what\u2019s the big deal about TFA? We didn\u2019t sign it, so what?\n\nActually TFA is projected as the most ambitious trade agreement with the potential to generate 1 trillion dollar trade and 2 crore job opportunities. With India refusing to sign it, most of the other 159 member nations of WTO consider a \u2018TFA without India\u2019\u00a0as meaningless.\n\n\ud83d\udc49 Which year are YOU targeting for success in the IAS/IPS/IFS Exam? \ud83d\ude80\n\n(1) \u21d2 UPSC 2025: Prelims cum Mains\n\n(2) \u21d2 UPSC 2026: Prelims cum Mains\n\n(3) \u21d2 UPSC 2027 Prelims cum Mains\n\nTip: Know more about ClearIAS Courses (Online/Offline)\n\nSo the hope of a global trade agreement under WTO collapsed. TFA was proposed to take effect from July 31st, 2015, but it didn\u2019t materialize.\n\nWhy India back out from TFA at the last moment?\n\nAs pointed out in the beginning, India is not against TFA. The new government under Modi, had a different concern with another agreement. It was because of some \u2018disagreements\u2019 regarding the next agreement that India backed out.\n\nOur issue was with Food Security ie. about the\u00a0Ministerial Decision on Public Stockholding for Food Security Purposes.\n\nSo there are two major issues \u2013 TFA and Food Security!\n\nThe UPA government saw these two issues separately. But the NDA government clubbed these two issues together. The new stand is something like this : TFA and Food Security deals can only be signed together. In other words, without finding a permanent solution to Food Security problem, India will not sign the TFA!\n\nThe Bali Package(2013) had 10 agreements, which can be clubbed under three heads: TFA, Agriculture (Food Security) and Least Developed Nations (LDC).\n\nWhile developed nations\u2019 primary attention was on TFA, India\u2019s concern was regarding moving ahead without finding a permanent solution to the food security issue. India has been insisting that it would not agree to the TFA unless the entire Bali package, which includes allowing developing countries to buy food from farmers for food security needs, is simultaneously firmed up.\n\nNo Permanent solution to the issue of public stockpiling for food security; but only a peace clause under the Bali agreement\n\nNew Delhi has been seeking a permanent solution to the issue of public stockpiling for food security because under the current rules, subsidies are capped at 10% of value of total production based on 1986-88 prices.\n\nIndia is close to breaching this on account of high inflation over the past few years.\n\nIndia wants inflation to be taken into account when calculating subsidy limits. The country buys rice and wheat from farmers at minimum support prices (MSP) to provide a reasonable income to producers. The stockpile is used to provide heavily subsidised food to the poor.\n\nPeace Clause under the Bali agreement\n\nPeace clause\u2019 available to India under the Bali agreement that says no member can take action against another on the food subsidy issue till a final agreement is reached on the issue, the deadline for which is the 11th ministerial in 2017.\n\nThe summary of facts relating to the stand taken by India in the World Trade Organization (WTO) recently (Courtesy: PIB)\n\nThe Bali Ministerial Declaration was adopted on 7 December 2013 on conclusion of the Ninth Ministerial Conference of the WTO in Bali. Ministerial Decisions were adopted on ten issues relating to the Doha Development Agenda which is the agenda for the unfinished Doha Round of trade negotiations, underway in the WTO since 2001.\nAmongst these Ministerial Decisions, two are of particular significance \u2014 the Ministerial Decision for an Agreement on Trade Facilitation and the Ministerial Decision on Public Stockholding for Food Security Purposes.\nThe Trade Facilitation Agreement is basically aimed at greater transparency and simplification of customs procedures, use of electronic payments and risk management techniques and faster clearances at ports. We have autonomously taken several similar measures such as the \u2018Indian Customs Single Window Project\u2019 announced in the Budget 2014-15 to facilitate trade, under which importers and exporters will be able to lodge documents at a single point, reducing interface with Governmental agencies, dwell time and the cost of doing business.\nThe Protocol of the Trade Facilitation Agreement (TFA) was to be adopted by 31 July 2014 by the WTO. After this the Agreement would automatically come into force from 31 July 2015 if ratified by two-thirds of the members of the WTO.\nIn contrast to their efforts on Trade Facilitation in the WTO, some developed countries have been reluctant to engage on other issues.\nSeeing the resistance to taking forward the other Decisions, the apprehension of developing countries was that once the process of bringing the Trade Facilitation Agreement into force was completed, other issues would be ignored, including the important issue of a permanent solution on subsidies on account of public stockholding for food security purposes.\nIndia, therefore, took the stand that till there is an assurance of commitment to find a permanent solution on public stockholding and on all other Bali deliverables, including those for the Least Developed Countries (LDCs), it would be difficult to join the consensus on the Protocol of Amendment for the Trade Facilitation Agreement.\nWithout a permanent solution, public stockholding programmes in India and other developing countries will be hampered by the present ceiling on domestic support which is pegged at 10 per cent of the value of production and is wrongly considered as trade-distorting subsidy to farmers under existing WTO rules. The existence of such a subsidy element is determined by comparing present-day administered prices with fixed reference prices of the 1986-88 period which is unrealistic.\nThe problem is a very real one. Developing countries are finding themselves hamstrung by the existing rules in running their food stockholding and domestic food aid programmes. The developed world too had market price support programmes and was able to move away from such support \u2013 though not fully even now \u2013 because of their deep pockets. This is not possible for developing countries. It is important for developing countries to be able to guarantee some minimum returns to their poor farmers so that they are able to produce enough for themselves and for domestic food security.\nDeveloped countries continue to have large entitlements to provide support to farmers. These would have been cut in the Doha Development Round which unfortunately remains unfinished. Had this Round, which has development at its core, concluded as per the agreed timelines and its development agenda, the world would have had an outcome in a single undertaking in which competing interests could have been balanced.\nToday, developing countries are fighting to keep the negotiations focused on development against the single-minded mercantilist focus of most of the rich developed world on market access issues.\nOverall balance is important even in a limited package of outcomes. The Bali outcomes were negotiated as a package and must be concluded as such.\nIt is regrettable indeed that today the WTO is unable to agree even to fast track negotiations on an issue of such importance to millions of subsistence farmers across the developing world, while the rich world can continue to subsidise their farmers unabatedly.\nThe matter came up for discussion in the margins of the BRICS Trade Ministers meeting in Brazil on 14 July and the G20 Trade Ministers meeting in Sydney on 19 July. It was also raised by the representatives of some countries in their interactions with the Indian government.\nOn each occasion, we explained that India is a signatory to the Bali Decisions, including Trade Facilitation and is not standing in the way of its implementation but is seeking an equal level of commitment and progress in working on the issue of public stockholding which affects the country\u2019s livelihood and food security.\nA permanent solution on food security is a must for us and we cannot wait endlessly in a state of uncertainty while the WTO engages in an academic debate on the subject of food security which is what some developed countries seem to be suggesting before they are ready to engage on this important issue.\nFood security is a humanitarian concern especially in these times of uncertainty and volatility. Issues of development and food security are critical to a vast swathe of humanity and cannot be sacrificed to mercantilist considerations.\nDeveloping countries such as India must have the freedom to use food reserves to feed their poor without the threat of violating any international obligations. This is our sovereign right. It is our duty to protect our citizens\u2019 fundamental rights to life and livelihood.\nAgriculture is the mainstay of the Indian population. In a country of the size of India with 60% of the population dependent on a relatively unremunerative agriculture sector, we cannot give up administered prices. This is the only way we can procure food for the Public Distribution System (PDS), the central pillar on which our efforts to ensure food security, rest. Public stockholding is a widely used means to ensure food security in many developing countries where agriculture is largely rainfed.\nWe have to look after both consumer and producer interests. We have to enable our people to live a life of dignity by ensuring access to an adequate quantity of quality food at affordable prices.\nOn 25 July 2014, India made a statement in the WTO General Council conveying, inter alia, that the adoption of the TF Protocol must be postponed till a permanent solution on public stockholding for food security is found.\nIndia offered suggestions on the procedure to be followed in order to ensure time-bound delivery of an outcome on public stockholding for food security. We also urged that a similar approach be adopted on all other elements of the Bali Package notably the LDC issues.\nThe integrity of India\u2019s stand is reflected in our unwavering efforts to offer a way forward in the face of criticism. Even on 31 July 2014, India offered a way to achieve not only a permanent solution on the issue of public stockholding for food security but also to implement the Trade Facilitation Agreement in the agreed timeframe as well as deliver favourable outcomes for LDCs.\nWe have offered practical suggestions for the way forward. The issue of a permanent solution on public stockholding is a simple one that can be addressed very easily as there are already several proposals on the table. A solution to this simple problem will be a tremendous relief for millions of farmers and poor consumers.\nHowever, despite India\u2019s efforts, our concerns were not satisfactorily addressed.\nThe Director General of the WTO reported to an informal meeting of the Trade Negotiations Committee on 31 July 2014 that a solution could not be found to bridge the gap.\nThe General Council meeting was, thereafter, formally declared closed without adopting the TF protocol.\nIndia stood firm on its demands despite immense pressure. The Government of India is committed to protecting the interests of our farmers against all odds. Our farmers work in extremely adverse conditions, most of them at the mercy of the vagaries of the monsoon, aggravated today by climate change. For farmers in many developing countries farming is a subsistence activity, not a commercial one. We are committed to their welfare and there was\u00a0the support and understanding extended by farmers\u2019 organizations in this cause.\nIndia\u2019s stand has resonated across the world and some developing\u00a0countries stood by India in the VVTO.\nIndia is an unwavering votary of the multilateral trading system and we reiterate our commitment to the WTO. We continue to believe that it is in the best interest of developing countries, especially the poorest, most marginalized ones among them and we are determined to work to strengthen this institution. The timely correction of any imbalances or anomalies in the working of the system or its rules is critical to ensure that the WTO works impartially and fairly in the interest of all its Members and not just a select few.\nIndia will be able to persuade the WTO Membership to appreciate the sensitivities of India and other developing countries and see their way to taking this issue forward in a positive spirit. This would be a major contribution by this institution towards \u2018meeting the global challenge of food insecurity and would convey a strong message that the WTO is genuinely committed to the cause of development.\nConclusion\n\nYes, India backed from its previous stand, but for better reasons. TFA is most likely to help developed nations though it is projected to help developing and underdeveloped nations better.\n\nIf the betterment of developing and underdeveloped nations was the major intention, stress should be on passing the agreements on other aspects related to agriculture (food security) and LDC.\n\nIt seems India backed out for better bargaining power. Had India signed the deal on TFA, there might not arise the urgency to find a permanent solution to food security.\n\nThe present peace clause will end in 2017, and the new impositions may turn unfavourable to India. Having clubbed food security along with TFA, India now asserts that the Bali Package can be voted only together. Let\u2019s wait and see how things unfold in future.\n\nUpdate: India \u2013 US Bilateral deal to take TFA forward: Permanent Peace Clause\n\nIndia and the US have struck a deal to make TFA a reality. US proposed a permanent peace clause instead of the temporary peace clause till 2017 on food security issue.\n\nThe permanent peace clause will exist until a permanent solution to food security is agreed by member nations. This means that there will not be any legal action on India by WTO, if our subsidy crosses 10 percent of the value in 1986-1988.\n\nHaving avoided the legal action with the permanent peace clause, India has agreed with US to take the TFA forward. Once the same agreement is approved by WTO, TFA can turn as a reality.\n\nUpdate (28-11-14): WTO clears Trade Facilitation Agreement\nWTO agreed to delink \u2018negotiations for a permanent solution on public stock holding for food security purposes\u2019 from the agriculture negotiations on other issues under the Doha Development Agenda.\nThis would ensure that the negotiations for a permanent solution would continue even if the negotiations on such other issues are delayed.\n\nRead: Marrakesh agreement;\u00a0WTO and developing countries"

So here starts our Background Digging Operation on the most highlighted economy terms in recent times.\n\nTopics that will be covered in the article series:\n\nSub-prime crisis.\nFiscal Cliff and Fiscal Drag.\nUS debt ceiling crisis and US Federal Government Shutdown.\nQuantitative Easing and Federal Tapering.\n\nTable of Contents\n\nBackground: Sub-Prime Crisis of 2008\nSub-prime mortgage crisis: What was that?\nFiscal Cliff Explained\nReasons for Fiscal Cliff and the Possible Impact\nHow did the US avoid the fiscal cliff?\nFiscal Drag: What does it mean?\nBackground: Sub-Prime Crisis of 2008\n\nThe United States, being the biggest economy in the world always enjoyed a strong position to influence the world economic affairs in a globalized world. Be it positive or negative, whatever happens in the US has an impact on almost all countries including India. But the strength of US economy was tested thoroughly in 2008 by a crisis called a sub-prime crisis, and the results portrayed the problems of the economic structure of the US.\n\nNews about economics crisis in the US banks started to spread like forest fire. New terms like the recession, meltdown etc. made headlines in newspapers across the world. What was the reason? Let\u2019s analyze crisis situation in 2008, popularly known as Subprime Mortgage Crisis.\n\n\ud83d\udc49 Which year are YOU targeting for success in the IAS/IPS/IFS Exam? \ud83d\ude80\n\n(1) \u21d2 UPSC 2025: Prelims cum Mains\n\n(2) \u21d2 UPSC 2026: Prelims cum Mains\n\n(3) \u21d2 UPSC 2027 Prelims cum Mains\n\nTip: Know more about ClearIAS Courses (Online/Offline)\n\nSub-prime mortgage crisis: What was that?\n\nThe term is associated with sub-prime lending. Many US banks had lent money to sub-prime borrowers (those borrowers who were rated below the prime borrowers), and these sub-prime borrowers failed to pay back the loans they had taken. Loans were given during real estate boom time, but when the bubble burst, banks lost most of their money. Badly affected banks include names like Lehman Brothers, Merril Lynch, and Bear Stearns.\n\nAs many of these banks closed their operations, US went into a period of recession (period of low growth) and the whole world was affected by it. US Federal bank (the supreme bank in US, just like the RBI of India) intervened and it tried everything it could do to prevent further collapse. The Fed pumped money, they bought many mortgages and gave liberal credit to other banks [Monetary Policy]. US government also made significant steps as part of their fiscal policy to control sub-prime crisis and recession. The government announced many tax cuts and started huge public expenditure programs [Fiscal Policy].\n\nFiscal Cliff Explained\n\nThe story of Fiscal Cliff starts with the subprime crisis. Hence we covered that first. US Congress ( the legislative body, similar to Indian Parliament) had passed many laws during the recession period calling for tax cuts, in-order to boost economic activity. But there was a time period specified for these exemptions. Many of these exemptions expired at midnight on December 31, 2012. So period from Jan 1, 2013, was supposed to be a period of high taxes. A sudden condition of high taxes and reduced public expenditure after a long period of tax cuts and liberal public expenditure is known as Fiscal Cliff. In the case of US, it was more a technical or policy issue, but to avoid this policy issue, the two houses of the US congress had to reach a consensus, which they didn\u2019t reach initially.\n\nTo sum up, Fiscal Cliff is the burden due to sudden increase in tax and less expenditure as mandated by some US bills (mainly a technical issue, but has practical reasons for each bill). It was the Congress to take action, but if they had not taken, US would have faced a fiscal contraction worth $600bn in 2013, which could tip the economy into a new recession.\n\n[Source My own quote : For your understanding!]\n\nReasons for Fiscal Cliff and the Possible Impact\nThe primary reason: expiry of Bush-era tax cuts.\nFiscal Cliff became a highlighted issue because of the provisions mentioned in the following bills:\u00a02010 Tax Relief Act,\u00a0Budget Control Act of 2011.\nThe\u00a0Budget Control Act of 2011\u00a0codified in law a grudging political compromise forcing the government to slash spending by $1.2 trillion over 10 years from January 1, 2013.\u00a02013 cuts, called \u201csequestration,\u201d was about $109 billion. ( Budget Control Act of US is analogous to\u00a0FRBM act of India!)\nA package of tax reductions and an extension of unemployment benefits will expire, meaning taxes will rise much for most Americans.\nTogether, higher taxes and lowered spending could slice the $1.1 trillion deficit racked up in fiscal 2012 by almost $600 billion in 2013, according to the Congressional Budget Office, vastly improving the government\u2019s financial picture. Though it might seem positive from the budget angle of government, it is a sudden and heavy burden on the people.\nThe CBO estimated the shock treatment would send the country back to recession and push the unemployment rate to 9.1 percent.\nFiscal cliff expected from Jan 1, 2013, would have resulted in Fiscal Drag.\nHow did the US avoid the fiscal cliff?\n\nThe\u00a0American Taxpayer Relief Act of 2012\u00a0(ATRA) addressed the revenue side of the fiscal cliff by implementing smaller tax increases compared to the expiration of the Bush tax cuts. Also, a\u00a0compromise was reached between Democrats and Republicans on January 1, 2013, regarding tax cuts. Higher income tax rates were agreed for the wealthy. Tougher decisions on spending cuts have been discussed in the Congress.\n\nFiscal Drag: What does it mean?\n\nThe first point to remember about fiscal drag is that government will get more tax revenue (mainly income tax) at the time of fiscal drag. Fiscal drag is the tendency of revenue from\u00a0taxation\u00a0to rise as a share of GDP in a growing economy.\u00a0Fiscal drag may happen due to inflation or fiscal policies of the government.\n\nFiscal drag is normally associated with progressive tax rates. Because of progressive taxes, the government will get more taxes when the economy is booming. This also\u00a0helps slow the rate of increase in\u00a0demand, reducing the pace of\u00a0growth, making it less likely to result in higher\u00a0inflation. Thus fiscal drag is an automatic stabilizer, as it acts naturally to keep demand stable.\n\nAlso note that fiscal drag means greater tax burden for people. And the greater tax burden can lead to less consumer spending.\n\nRead the second part of this article series in the link:\u00a0US debt ceiling crisis and US Federal Government Shutdown."

So, straight to the topic.\n\nTable of Contents\n\nUS Debt Ceiling Crisis\nBack to Fiscal Cliff Crisis\n$1 trillion-plus annual budget gap of US!\nWhat is Debt ceiling? Who sets this figure?\nUnited States Federal Government shut down\nSolutions to US Debt Ceiling Crisis and US Shut down\nUS Debt Ceiling Crisis\n\nDo you remember that the Fiscal Cliff was rather a technical and policy issue rather than an economic issue? Do you remember the date December 31, 2012? On the same date, another related but different problem was creating trouble for the US government. This crisis too was related to bills. And the name of the crisis: US Debt Ceiling Crisis.\n\nBack to Fiscal Cliff Crisis\n\nFiscal Cliff became a highlighted issue because of the provisions mentioned in the following bills.\n\n\ud83d\udc49 Which year are YOU targeting for success in the IAS/IPS/IFS Exam? \ud83d\ude80\n\n(1) \u21d2 UPSC 2025: Prelims cum Mains\n\n(2) \u21d2 UPSC 2026: Prelims cum Mains\n\n(3) \u21d2 UPSC 2027 Prelims cum Mains\n\nTip: Know more about ClearIAS Courses (Online/Offline)\n\n2010 Tax Relief Act.\nBudget Control Act of 2011.\n\nThe fiscal cliff crisis was partially solved with the passage of\u00a0the American Taxpayer Relief Act of 2012\u00a0on Jan 1, 2013. This meant that there was a compromise that taxes should not be increased beyond a limit and there should not be excessive cuts on public expenditure. But this compromise had another problem \u2013 the debt ceiling \u2013 associated with it. That too, is a self-imposed, technical, and policy issue.\n\n$1 trillion-plus annual budget gap of US!\n\nHope you are now clear about the fact that the economic condition of the US is not very good. $1 trillion-plus is the US annual budget gap (A figure which is around India\u2019s GDP). Too much budget deficit is not good for any economy. The risk of reduction of credit rating always exists. Also, there are more chances of populism. So\u00a0Budget Control Act of 2011\u00a0imposed restrictions on the debt limit of the US government. And that value was 16.399 trillion dollars.\n\nCan you think of any way of reducing the $1 trillion-plus US annual budget deficit? The usual way out is either to increase taxes or reduce spending. But this contradicts the compromise on the Fiscal Cliff crisis. Besides, the two houses of the US Congress, are on two different pages, creating a deadlock. So what to do then?\n\nWhat was needed to solve the Fiscal Cliff crisis was directly antagonistic to the solution of the US debt ceiling crisis. So it turned out that the solution to resolve the US debt ceiling crisis was not to reduce the debt, but rather increase or suspend the debt ceiling limit itself!\n\n[Source: My own quote: For your understanding!]\n\nAlso read: Debt Sustainability\n\nWhat is Debt ceiling? Who sets this figure?\nThe limit is set by Congress. The United States will not be able to borrow any more money if it crosses the debt ceiling and would, in theory, be forced to slash spending to make ends meet.\nThe debt limit does not control or limit the ability of the federal government to run deficits or incur obligations. Rather, it is a limit on the ability to pay obligations already incurred. It does not prohibit Congress from creating further obligations upon the United States. The ceiling was last set at $16.4 trillion in 2011.\nPossible, but desperate, remedies would include halting pay to the military, retirement health benefits, social security, and failing to pay government debts.\nThe US will not default on its own debt immediately. The Treasury has various extraordinary measures in its armory, including halting the issuance of securities to state and local governments, which could buy about two months of leeway.\nAfter the passing in early January 2013 of the American Taxpayer Relief Act of 2012 to avert the projected fiscal cliff, political attention shifted to the debt ceiling.\nThe debt ceiling had technically been reached on December 31, 2012, when the Treasury Department commenced \u201cextraordinary measures\u201d to enable the continued financing of the government.\n\nAlso read: Public Debt: Overview\n\nUnited States Federal Government shut down\n\nFrom October 1 through 16, 2013, the\u00a0United States federal government entered a shutdown\u00a0and curtailed most routine operations after Congress failed to enact legislation appropriating funds for fiscal year 2014, or a continuing resolution for the interim authorization of appropriations for fiscal year 2014. Regular government operations resumed on October 17 after an interim appropriations bill was signed into law. There was a conflict of interest on the\u00a0Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act\u00a0(commonly known as \u201cObamacare\u201d) between Democrats and Republicans.\n\nThe 16-day-long shutdown of October 2013 was the third-longest government shutdown in U.S. history, after the 18-day shutdown in 1978 and the 21-day 1995\u201396 shutdown.\n\nThe US Government shutdown was rather a budget issue appropriation issue for the new fiscal year. It was connected with the US debt ceiling, but the shutdown issue was a short-term one (connected only with the spending for the next fiscal), but the debt ceiling was a long-term problem (connected with the long-term borrowing limit.)\n\n[ Relate the Shutdown issue with a case like the Indian Budget got passed in Lok Sabha but not in Rajya Sabha; the Debt ceiling can be related to the provisions of the FRBM act which places restrictions on the Fiscal Deficit].\n\nAlso read: Budget Documents Made Simple\n\nSolutions to US Debt Ceiling Crisis and US Shut down\n\nSolution tried = Suspend the debt ceiling!\n\nThe 2013 crisis began in January 2013 and ended on October 17, 2013, with the passing of the\u00a0Continuing Appropriations Act, of 2014, though the debate continues.\nOn October 16, the Senate passed the Continuing Appropriations Act, 2014, a continuing resolution, to fund the government until January 15, 2014, and\u00a0suspend the debt ceiling\u00a0until February 7, 2014, thus ending both the United States federal government shutdown of 2013 and the United States debt-ceiling crisis of 2013.\nOn January 14, 2014, the House and the Senate Appropriations Committees agreed on a spending plan that would fund the federal government for two years.\nOn January 16, 2014, Congress passed a $1.1 trillion appropriations bill that will keep the federal government funded until October 2014.

            "[CONTENT]": "Bitcoin is a hot word these days. Many know that it is related to money or currency. But what exactly is Bitcoin? What is a cryptocurrency? Is it legal in India? Why is it in the news? Read further to know.\n\nSupreme Court of India has recently lifted the ban on cryptocurrencies imposed by the Reserve Bank of India.\n\nBut why did the Reserve Bank of India warn about Bitcoins? Let\u2019s see each of these questions in detail in this article.\n\nTable of Contents\n\nWhat is Bitcoin?\nHow does Bitcoin work?\nWhat are the advantages of Bitcoins?\nArguments against Bitcoins\nWhy is RBI not an advocate of Bitcoins?\nSupreme Court of India ruling on Cryptocurrencies\nProbable Questions\nWhat is Bitcoin?\n\nBitcoin is a type of digital currency that enables instant payments to anyone. It was introduced in 2009.\n\nIt is based on an open-source protocol and is not issued by any central authority. It is a peer-to-peer currency. Peer-to-peer means that no central authority issues new money or tracks transactions. These tasks are managed collectively by the network.\n\n\u201cBitcoin\u201d, capitalized, refers to the protocol and transaction network whereas \u201cbitcoin\u201d, lowercase, refers to the currency itself.\n\nIt is the first decentralized digital currency.\nThey are digital coins you can send through the Internet.\nCompared to other alternatives,\u00a0they have several advantages.\nThey are transferred directly from person\u00a0to person\u00a0via the net\u00a0without going through a bank\u00a0or clearinghouse. (This means that the fees are much lower,\u00a0you can use them in every country,\u00a0your account cannot be frozen\u00a0and there are no prerequisites\u00a0or arbitrary limits.)\nHow does Bitcoin work?\nThe digital currency is generated all over the Internet by anybody running a free application\u00a0called a Bitcoin miner.\u00a0\nMining requires a certain amount of work\u00a0for each block of coins.\nThis amount is automatically adjusted\u00a0by the network\u00a0such that Bitcoins are always created\u00a0at a predictable and limited rate.\nYour Bitcoins are stored in your digital wallet\u00a0which might look familiar if you use online banking.\nWhen you transfer them, an electronic signature is added.\nAfter a few minutes, the transaction is verified by a miner\u00a0and permanently and anonymously stored\u00a0in the network.\n\nIt uses public-key cryptography, peer-to-peer networking, and proof-of-work to process and verify payments. They are sent (or signed over) from one address to another with each user potentially having many, many addresses.\n\n\ud83d\udc49 Which year are YOU targeting for success in the IAS/IPS/IFS Exam? \ud83d\ude80\n\n(1) \u21d2 UPSC 2025: Prelims cum Mains\n\n(2) \u21d2 UPSC 2026: Prelims cum Mains\n\n(3) \u21d2 UPSC 2027 Prelims cum Mains\n\nTip: Know more about ClearIAS Courses (Online/Offline)\n\nEach payment transaction is broadcast to the network and included in the blockchain so that the included bitcoins cannot be spent twice.\nAfter an hour or two, each transaction is locked in time by the massive amount of processing power that continues to extend the blockchain. (Bitcoin blockchain is a database that holds information about all transactions.) Using these techniques, Bitcoin provides a fast and extremely reliable payment network that anyone can use.\nWhat are the advantages of Bitcoins?\n\nAdvocates highlight the following points in favor of Bitcoins.\n\nThe Bitcoin software is completely open-source and anybody can review the code.\nIt is changing finance the same way the web changed publishing. When everyone has access to a global market, great ideas flourish.\n\nLet\u2019s look at some examples of how they are already used today:\n\nYou can purchase video games,\u00a0gifts,\u00a0books,\u00a0servers, and alpaca socks.\nSeveral currency exchanges exist\u00a0where you can trade them for dollars,\u00a0euros, and more.\nThey are a great way for small businesses and freelancers\u00a0to get noticed.\nIt doesn\u2019t cost anything to start accepting them,\u00a0there are no chargebacks or fees\u00a0and you\u2019ll get additional business\u00a0from the Bitcoin economy.\n\nBitcoins are sent easily through the Internet, without needing to trust any third party.\n\nTransactions:\nAre irreversible by design\nAre fast. Funds received are available for spending within minutes.\nCost very little, especially compared to other payment networks.\nThe supply is regulated by software and the agreement of users of the system and cannot be manipulated by any government, bank, organization, or individual.\nThe limited inflation of the Bitcoin system\u2019s money supply is distributed evenly (by CPU power) to miners who help secure the network.\n\nAre Bitcoins limited?\n\nThe total possible number of bitcoins is around 21 million. A bitcoin was valued at $10 in October 2012 but it leapt to around $1000 or Rs 67,000 in December 2013. Now, as of March 2020, a bitcoin is valued at around $8800 or Rs. 6,50,000.\n\nHow to get them?\n\nExchanges with local currency.\nMine.\nSell something and get bitcoins in return.\nArguments against Bitcoins\nAssets are not backed by tangible entities such as land.\nWastes computer power.\nEnables crime.\nEncourages anarchy.\nIt\u2019s very much still an experimental currency and is a high-risk environment for consumers and investors at the moment.\n\nRenowned economist Paul Krugman, is a skeptic that for example, says: \u201cSo do we need a new form of money? I guess you could make that case if the money we have were misbehaving. But it isn\u2019t. We have huge economic problems, but green pieces of paper are doing fine \u2014 and we should let them alone.\u201d\n\nIn 2014 Warren Buffett warned other investors to stay away from Bitcoin, calling it \u201ca mirage.\u201d He went so\u00a0far as saying that, even though there\u00a0may be a better way of transmitting money, the \u201cidea that it has some huge intrinsic value is just a joke!\n\nWhy is RBI not an advocate of Bitcoins?\n\nThe RBI issued a circular in April 2019 banning regulated financial institutions from providing services to crypto businesses. The ban went into effect three months later. Banks subsequently closed the accounts of crypto exchanges.\n\nThe Reserve Bank of India points out that users expose themselves to potential financial, legal, and security-related risks when they deal in virtual currencies like bitcoins.\n\nIn its list of potential risks, the apex bank highlights problems such as losses arising out of hacking, no sources of customer recourse, and the general financial volatility surrounding Bitcoins.\n\n\u201cThe creation, trading or usage of virtual currencies including Bitcoins are not authorized by any central bank or monetary authority. As such, there is no established framework for recourse to customer problems,\u201d the RBI said in a statement.\n\nSeveral India-based trading platforms and exchanges have sprung up over the last six months, catering to Indian users by allowing them to purchase Bitcoin in rupees. The RBI, however, has pointed out that no regulatory approval has been obtained by any entities that carry out such activities.\n\nSupreme Court of India ruling on Cryptocurrencies\n\nThe RBI ban on cryptocurrencies was challenged in the Supreme Court by the Internet and Mobile Association of India and a few other stakeholders.\n\nIn a significant judgment (March 03, 2020), the Supreme Court on lifted the curbs on exchanges in cryptocurrency imposed by the Reserve Bank of India. The Court held that the RBI\u2019s circular preventing bans from dealing in transactions involving cryptocurrency was disproportionate.\n\n\nProbable Questions\n\nBitcoins can be a topic in UPSC Prelims, Mains, or Interviews.\n\nFor UPSC Interview: Can Bitcoins replace the Indian Rupee? If yes, explain why.\n\nFor UPSC Mains: What are bitcoins? Analyze the effectiveness of digital currency in the background of recent RBI observations.\n\nFor UPSC Prelims: Which among the following statements about bitcoins are true?\n\nIn India, RBI controls the Bitcoin market.\nBitcoins are free from inflation and deflation.\nThe total possible number of Bitcoins is limited.\nBitcoins help in preventing money laundering and illegal trading.\n\nChoices: A \u2013 1 only, B \u2013 1, 2, 4 only, C \u2013 3 only, D \u2013 All the above\n\nRead: Bitcoin halving"

Though World Bank used to publish the \u2018Doing Business\u2019 reports from 2003, the ranking of economies started only from 2006.\n\nThe EODB study tries to capture the experience of small and mid-sized companies in a country with their regulators, by measuring the time, costs and red tape they deal with.\n\nThe goal of\u00a0the World\u00a0Bank in coming up with Doing Business score every year is to provide an objective basis for understanding and improving the regulatory environment for business around the world.\n\nThe Ease of Doing Business Rank is based on\u00a010 parameters relating to starting and doing business in a country\n\n10 parameters used for calculating the Ease of Doing Busines Rank (Score)\n\nEase of starting a business.\nDealing with construction permits.\nGetting electricity for the same.\nRegistering your property.\nGetting credit for your business.\nProtecting minority investors.\nPaying taxes.\nTrading across borders.\nEnforcing contracts.\nResolving insolvency.\nWhat is the\u00a0Importance of the Doing Busines Rank?\n\nDoing Business Rank attempts to quantitatively capture the regulation that small- and medium-sized firms encounter in 190 countries around the world.\n\n\ud83d\udc49 Which year are YOU targeting for success in the IAS/IPS/IFS Exam? \ud83d\ude80\n\n(1) \u21d2 UPSC 2025: Prelims cum Mains\n\n(2) \u21d2 UPSC 2026: Prelims cum Mains\n\n(3) \u21d2 UPSC 2027 Prelims cum Mains\n\nTip: Know more about ClearIAS Courses (Online/Offline)\n\nEODB rankings are carefully evaluated by foreign investors when they look to start a firm in any country.\n\nIndia\u2019s performance in the 2019 Doing Business Study\n\nIndia has been one of the biggest \u2018improvers\u2019 in the 2019 study, with its rank shooting up from 100 to 77 last year, among 190 countries. Its rank crept up from 142 to 77 in the five years from 2015 to 2019.\n\nWith a rank of 77/190, World Bank now deems India an easier place to do business in than BRICs peers such as Brazil (109) and South Africa (82), however, China has a better rank (46). India\u2019s Doing Business Score is 67.23 out of 100.\n\nDoing Business Parameters \u2013 Areas India improved\n\nIndia\u2019s climb in the 2019 rankings seems to have come mainly from sharply higher scores on two \u2018doing business\u2019 indicators \u2014 securing construction permits and trading across the borders. It also made smaller improvements in starting a business and getting credit.\n\nDoing Business Parameters \u2013 Areas India is yet to improve\n\nIndia\u2019s score remains dismal on registering property, where it ranks 166. While it takes 69 days to register a piece of property in India, in Newzealand this can be done in a single day!\n\nAnother major bottleneck in India is regarding paying taxes. While many Indian businesses make about 13 tax payments in a year\u00a0(giving away as much as 53 per cent\u00a0of their profits),\u00a0\u00a0those in businessmen in Hong Kong make just three payments a year. The average tax rate across global economies is less than half of the Indian rate!\n\nThe process of calculating the Ease of Doing Business Ranking\n\nAs we have already seen, the Ease of Doing Business study tries to capture the experience of small and mid-sized companies in a country with their regulators, by measuring the time, costs, and red tape they deal with.\n\nTo collect data, World Bank empanels experts from the largest business cities in each country (only Mumbai and Delhi are surveyed in India).\n\nIt has many rounds of interactions with the experts \u2014 typically lawyers, business consultants, accountants, freight forwarders, government officials \u2014 who can capture the experience of multiple businesses.\n\nEach country is assigned a rank out of 190 based on the total score it earns on 10 key aspects of doing business.\n\nNote: Over 13,800 experts participated in the 2019 study, from June 2, 2017, to May 1, 2018.\n\nShortcomings of the Doing Busines Report\n\nThough the report acts as an indicator to understand the ease of doing business with respect to companies in major cities, it has many shortcomings.\n\nThe Ease of Business Report in India does not cover Proprietary and Partnership Firms \u2013 Despite the fact that proprietorship and partnership firms dominate the small business space, the EODB rank does not include these types of firms \u2013 it covers only companies.\nThe Ease of Business Report in India covers only Mumbai and Delhi \u2013 The report does not take into account the red-tapism experienced by the business firms located in tier 2 or tier 3 towns. Delhi and Mumbai cannot be taken as an exact sample of India. Actually, it is the single-window clearance for securing building permits in Delhi and a new online system in Mumbai brought about this quantum change in India\u2019s rankings recently.\n\nNote: Subnational Doing Business Rankings were calculated in 2009 for 17 select locations in India. However, the same is not used to find the Ease of Doing Business Rank of India."

            "[CONTENT]": "We\u00a0hear news about Black Money in Indian economy very often these days. But what exactly is Black money? What makes money black or white? This short analysis is a humble attempt to cover essentials one should know about the black money issue in India.\n\nTable of Contents\n\nDefinition of Black Money:\nBlack money is not fake notes!\nIdeal economy \u2013 accounted and legitimate transactions\nCash transactions can be black money!\nHow is black money generated in an economy?\nBlack money generation \u2013 day to day examples\nThe black money problem in India\nEstimates of Black Money in India\nIndian Black Money \u2013 Abroad or in India itself?\nCan black money be made white money?\nEffects of Black Money\nSteps to curb black money: Some recent developments\nSummary\nDefinition of Black Money:\n\nIt is to be noted here that there is no clear cut definition for black money in either economic or sociological concepts. In very simple terms we can say any money which is not accounted as one or another form of black money.\n\nBlack money is often money illegally obtained or transacted. As being unaccounted money, black money is not declared for tax purposes.\u00a0Black money is also hidden from the government authorities which calculates national income like GDP, GNP etc.\n\nBlack money is not fake notes!\n\nIt has not be understood that fake notes are not synonymous to black money. Counterfeiting is about printing\u00a0new money by unauthorized agents. Black money is not about printing new money, but is more related to tax evasion.\n\nIdeal economy \u2013 accounted and legitimate transactions\n\nIdeally all transactions where money change hands should be accounted. This helps the government to collect taxes.\n\nBut if money change hands without proper accounting (Eg: cash transactions), government may fail to notice even the presence of such money in the economy. Besides, there are many economic transactions in the countries which are by the nature itself illegal (Eg: Smuggling). These transactions can by now means taxed. All these unaccounted money can be classified under the umbrella term \u2013 black money.\n\nCash transactions can be black money!\n\nYou may wonder; but if cash change hands without proper transaction accounting, the money involved is black money!\n\n\ud83d\udc49 Which year are YOU targeting for success in the IAS/IPS/IFS Exam? \ud83d\ude80\n\n(1) \u21d2 UPSC 2025: Prelims cum Mains\n\n(2) \u21d2 UPSC 2026: Prelims cum Mains\n\n(3) \u21d2 UPSC 2027 Prelims cum Mains\n\nTip: Know more about ClearIAS Courses (Online/Offline)\n\nHow is black money generated in an economy?\nIllegitimate Activities:\u00a0Money is generated through illegitimate activities like trafficking, robbery, smuggling, terrorism, money laundering, corruption etc.\nTax Evasion: People either fail to report their tax to the authorities by virtue of ignorance or intentionally to avoid paying tax which is otherwise termed as tax evasion.\nTax Avoidance: The third scenario is about taking advantage of the legal system in a country, where individuals and companies avoid paying tax \u2013 which is called as tax avoidance.\nBlack money generation \u2013 day to day examples\n\nSome very common forms of this menace may include:\n\nSellers who don\u2019t give bills for sales creates a form of black money.\nIn the land registration process and in other reality sector business, people tend to undervalue their costs (sssets)\u00a0so as to reduce the tax and registration fees to be paid.\nPeople investing in jewelry and bullion so as to to hide their actual income. Money is also\u00a0hidden in\u00a0places like bank lockers and underground tunnels.\nNonprofit organizations, trusts, financial markets\u00a0etc are often pointed for their involvement in black money.\nTax heavens, round tripping, transfer pricing,\u00a0hawala transactions, treaty shopping etc. (to be dealt in detail later.)\nParticipatory Notes otherwise called P \u2013 Notes are another source of black money.\nTill recently bitcoins were also considered to be a source of funding of black money as it provides a safe platform for investors with handsome returns from its value appreciation.\nThe black money problem in India\n\nThe problem of black money in India started popping up by 1960\u2019s. This is mainly attributed due to the high\u00a0level of income tax and corporate tax charged then. This resulted in huge tax evasion by individuals and business communities. Now, after liberalization in 1991, the black money issue has compounded.\n\nEstimates of Black Money in India\n\nAs black money is not accounted it is not easy to estimate it either. Different reports suggests different estimates.\u00a0Some estimates are as\u00a0below:\n\nA former CBI Director of India has said that the total black money in India is around 500 billion US dollars.\nGlobal Financial Integrity Report has mentioned that\u00a0India lost around 120 billion US Dollars in the time frame of 2001-2010. It ranked India in 8th spot in black money generation.\nIndians\u2019 share in tax-havens across the world\u00a0is estimated at $152-181 billion (Rs. 10 lakh crore), by one calculation of Bank of Italy. Note \u2013 6-7\u00a0trillion dollars worth of black wealth lies hidden in tax havens across the world, according the senior economists from the Bank of Italy.\nIndian Black Money \u2013 Abroad or in India itself?\n\nThere are many experts who consider\u00a0that 90 percent of India\u2019s black money stays in India itself.\u00a0Some value it around 70 lack crore. This is because funds transferred to foreign banks\u00a0fetch very little or no bank interest. But at the same time, the booming Indian economy offers large scope for investment.\n\nAccording to one study, out of 100 rupees of black money generated in our country, 90 percent stays in India. The balance 10 percent is takes the form of\u00a0round tripping and transfer pricing; while a little\u00a0portion is consumed abroad itself.\n\nCan black money be made white money?\n\nRecipients of black money must hide it, spend it only in the underground economy, or attempt to give it the appearance of legitimacy through money laundering. Money laundering is the process by which black money is converted to white money. One of the practice involved in money laundering is round-tripping, where tax-evaded money comes back to the same country as\u00a0foreign\u00a0investment.\n\nEffects of Black Money\n\nThe after effects of black money in our economy is manifold and have serious consequences. Some of the negative impacts are listed below.\n\nIt affects the financial system of the country. RBI may not be able to control the money supply in the economy and thereby leading to higher inflation in the system. The persistent level of high inflation is detrimental to the economy as it will erode the value of money and eats up investments and savings.\nIt will affect the credibility of our country.\nThe money generated in the form of black money is often\u00a0routed for terrorism and hence, it becomes an issue of national security.\nA parallel economy will be created in the country and hence, governance will be ineffective to a large extent. We have the examples like Mexico where a parallel economy is rampant due to illegal drug trafficking.\nThere is a huge loss of money for government exchequer because of\u00a0tax loss for the country\nReal estate prices may shoot up. This may result in asset bubble which is detrimental to an economy.\nSteps to curb black money: Some recent developments\n\nDifferent steps has been formulated to curb the menace of black money in India. There were\u00a0co-ordinated efforts from the part of government, RBI, and Supreme court. Steps taken include:\n\nFormation of Special Investigation Team (SIT) by SC during\u00a0the UPA government tenure while considering a case filed by former Law Minister Shri. Ram Jetmalani.\nThe government passed The Undisclosed Foreign Income and Assets (Imposition of Tax) Bill, 2015\nRBI initiated the process of taking back the currency notes issued before 2005 to reduce the level of counterfeit notes and also to curb the menace of black money to a greater extent.\nThe government is mulling for a dual strategy in the form of framing policies to bring back the illicit money stashed abroad and also making domestic laws stringent to locate and identify the black money in India.\nTax reforms in the form of tax deduction at source (TDS) , increasing tax base than merely increasing tax rates, voluntary disclosure schemes etc.\nGovernment and RBI are promoting the cashless economy. The government has either slashed taxes or surcharge on online / card transactions to make transfers accountable and try to bring the money into the normal banking system.\nGovernment has scrapped Rs.500 and Rs.1000 notes and changed the cash withdrawal limits from banks and ATMs.\nIndia joined FATF ( Financial action Task forece)\u00a0in 2005 to combat against financing terrorism through the black money route. We also framed AML / PML laws in 2003 for combating money laundering activities in our country.\nPrevention of Corruption Act and Binami Transactions Act were other such steps in the right direction.\nUnder pressure from India and other countries Switzerland and other tax havens have agreed in principle to share the details of accounts to the public authorities on a case to case basis.\nMaking PAN number mandatory for real estate and bullion purchases.\nThe government is in a process of renegotiating DTAAs with countries which we have already signed.\nLimitation of benefits clause needs to be invoked in appropriate areas where it deemed necessary.\n2015 HSBC leak.\n2016 Panama Papers leak.\nSummary\n\nIt is to be noted here that though we have formulated different strategies and policies to combat black money, its effect is not reflected in implementation. The need of the hour is greater political will and global coordination to counter the issue.\n\nArticle by Sandeep A"

It was founded by German lawyer Jurgen Mossack in 1977, and later joined by Panamanian novelist/lawyer Ramon Fonseca.\nIts Services:\nIt specializes in commercial law, trust services, investor advisory, and international business structures.\nIt also offers intellectual property protection, wealth management and maritime law services.\nMore importantly its services include incorporating companies in offshore jurisdictions such as British Virginia Islands and helping in administering such firms, for a yearly fee.\nThough it is based in Panama, it has operations and franchises worldwide, particularly in the tax havens like Switzerland, Cyprus, and British Virginia Islands (BVI) etc. It has so far acted for more than 3, 00,000 companies, including a lakh such companies in BVI alone.\nIt was also in news for Argentine money laundering controversy (K-Money); money laundering by German Commerzbank; its role in the Petrobras corruption scandal and more recently following the Panama Papers Leak.\nHow the leak was possible?\nThe documents were made available to a Munich based newspaper Suddeutsche Zeitung, from early 2015 through encrypted channels, from an anonymous source who was using the pseudonym John Doe.\nIt is said that the whistle blower didn\u2019t seek nothing but undisclosed security cover as compensation, as (s)he believed the company was involved in unethical business.\nThe cache of information sized around 2.6 terabytes, and Suddeutsche Zeitung sought the help of the US based International Consortium of Investigative Journalists (ICIJ). The consortium helped in distributing the documents for parallel investigation and analysis to around 107 media centres in 80-odd countries.\nWhat is ICIJ?\nIn 1997 International Consortium of Investigative Journalists, was launched by Center for Public Integrity, CPI (an American not-for-profit investigative journalism organisation. It won the Pulitzer Prize in 2014).\nIt is based in Washington and includes around 165 investigative journalists from over 65 countries.\nTheir main area of investigations include cross-border crime, corruption, accountability of the power etc.\nCPI\u2019s previous reports include those on\n\u201cWho\u2019s behind the financial Meltdown\u201d 2009,\nThe Climate Change Lobby Explosion, 2009;\nTobacco Underground, 2010;\nSecrecy for Sale: offshore accounts, 2013 to present.\nWho are involved in the Leaked Papers?\nAs per the disclosed papers, there are at least 12 national leaders among the 143 politicians or their family members or close associates, managing offshore firms, besides other famous personalities around the globe.\nSome of the more famous names are:\nRussian President Vladimir Putin\u2019s Best Friend, one Sergei Roldugin, is at the centre of a scheme in which money from Russian state banks is hidden offshore.\nNawaz Sharif, the Pakistan Prime Minister\u2019s family (3 of his 4 children).\nAyad Allawi, ex-interim Prime Minister of Iraq.\nPetro Poroshenko, the in-famous President of Ukraine. He had set up a secret off-shore company in British Virginia Islands. He didn\u2019t disclose any information about the firm, while serving as the President, and hence violates the country\u2019s constitution, says anti-corruption group Transparency International.\nTwo cousins of the Syrian President Bashar al-Assad.\nSaudi King Salman Bin Abdulaziz Bin Abdulrahman al Saud held an \u2018unspecific role\u2019, in a Luxembourg based company.\nAla Mubarak, son of Egypt\u2019s former President Hosni Mubarak.\nSigmundur David Gunnlaugsson, Prime Minster of Iceland. He was elected after the 2008 banking collapse in Iceland and had pledged to clean up corruption in the banking system. Following the leak, he announced his resignation on April 5, even while vehemently opposing any wrong-doing.\nBrother-in-law of Chinese President Xi Jinping.\nAn offshore investment fund was run by British Prime Minister David Cameroon\u2019s father.\nLionel Andres Messi, the football club Barcelona (FCB)\u2019s forward and 5-time Ballon d\u2019Or winner. His family has been accused of tax evasion.\nScandal also touches a key member of FIFA\u2019s Ethics Committee, Juan Pedro Damiani, banks like HSBC etc.\nIndians involved: the Indian newspaper represented in ICIJ consortium is The Indian Express. The Indian names (so far) revealed by the newspaper include:\nAiswarya Rai: was director/share-holder of a now dissolved company based in British Virginia Islands.\nAmitabh Bachchan: was director of one shipping firm in BVI and three in Bahamas.\nSameer Gehlaut, India bulls owner.\nKP Singh, DLF Promoter.\nVinod Adani.\nTwo politicians Shishir Bajoria from West Bengal and Anurag Kejriwal of Delhi.\n\nNote: The newspaper states that while RBI let individuals buy shares under LRS (Liberalised Remittance Scheme), it never allowed them to set up companies abroad, having clarified it through an FAQ mid-way in September 2010.\n\nWhat is LRS?\nThe legal framework for administration of foreign exchange transactions in India is provided by the Foreign Exchange Management Act, 1999.\nUnder the Liberalised Remittance Scheme, all resident individuals, including minors, are allowed to freely remit up to USD 2,50,000 per financial year (April \u2013 March) for any permissible current or capital account transaction or a combination of both.\nThere are no restrictions on the frequency of remittances under LRS. However, the total amount of foreign exchange purchased from or remitted through, all sources in India during a financial year should be within the cumulative limit of USD 2,50,000. Once a remittance is made for an amount up to USD 2,50,000 during the financial year, a resident individual would not be eligible to make any further remittances under this scheme, even if the proceeds of the investments have been brought back into the country.\n\nWhile one is travelling abroad, on a private visit, (other than to Nepal and Bhutan), he can obtain foreign exchange up to an aggregate of USD 2,50,000 (only 3,000 as cash, rest as travellers cheque or banker\u2019s draft) in any financial year. This limit is also subsumed under LRS.\n\nAre all people who use offshore structures crooks?\nNot quite.\nIn fact, using such offshore structures and firms is entirely legal (and even promoted by many host countries).\nThere could be legitimate reasons for such investments.\nSome use it to defend \u201craids\u201d from criminals, or sometimes to get around hard currency restrictions or currency exchange restrictions.\nSometimes firms are set up to make use of favourable tax or a bilateral treaty or a free trade agreement with another country.\nOthers use offshore for reasons of inheritance or estate planning etc.\nAre some people who use offshore structures crooks?\nYes, more often than not, such offshore structures smacks wrong doing.\nMany a time such off shore business firms are set up in what is called as \u201cTax Havens\u201d. The motive behind the same is multifarious.\nWhat are Tax Havens?\nThey are defined as those jurisdictions in which their banks provide services primarily to non-residents and they do not require the account holders to disclose information about them or their business, more than the bare minimum.\nSuch jurisdictions offer the comfort of high privacy and opaque transactions, an impenetrable wall of secrecy.\nTax havens are invariably low-tax regimes.\nExamples: Many of such jurisdictions are small island nations (and hence the name). Examples include British Virginia Islands, Panama, Bahamas, and Macao etc.\nMany of the firms registered in such jurisdictions are \u2018Shell Companies\u201d.\nWhat are Shell Companies?\nA shell company has an outward appearance of being a legitimate firm, but it is nothing but an empty shell.\nIt helps in managing the money involved within the company, while hiding who really owns the company.\nIt is also called \u201cletter-box company\u201d, as consist of little more than an address to post to.\nSo most obvious motive behind such off-shore firms in the tax havens is to avoid taxes, in the mother country.\nThus such jurisdictions thus play an important role in large-scale money-laundering activities, corruption activities, terrorism funding, storing revenue from organised crimes etc.\nWhat is money-laundering (in a nutshell\u2026)?\n\nIt literally means laundering (cleaning) the dirty money, so that one can use it without evoking any suspicion. There are many ways to launder the money like using Bearer Bonds or paying for non-existent imports, or even buying toilet papers for a million Rupees (inflating the price).\n\nWhat is\u00a0Mossack Fonseca\u2019s take on Panama Papers?\n\nTheir press release is as below:\n\nRecent media reports have portrayed an inaccurate view of the services that we provide and, despite our efforts to correct the record, misrepresented the nature of our work and its role in global financial markets.\n\nThese reports rely on supposition and stereotypes, and play on the public\u2019s lack of familiarity with the work of firms like ours.\n\nConclusion:\n\nThe Panama Papers have evoked great interest from governments and civil society around the world. While some have used the opportunity to tar capitalism as a concept promoting crooks, the debate over bringing back the illicit money has gained more traction. The data is a shot in the arm for government of India as well, which was reeling without adequate information about black money abroad. The Government has done the right thing by constituting an inter-department investigation team to look into the veracity of the leaked papers. It would also be interesting to note whether the current dispensation has the spine to take action against the Who\u2019s Who of India.\n\n\ud83d\udc49 Which year are YOU targeting for success in the IAS/IPS/IFS Exam? \ud83d\ude80\n\n(1) \u21d2 UPSC 2025: Prelims cum Mains\n\n(2) \u21d2 UPSC 2026: Prelims cum Mains\n\n(3) \u21d2 UPSC 2027 Prelims cum Mains\n\nTip: Know more about ClearIAS Courses (Online/Offline)\n\nReference and Courtesy:\n\nThe Guardian, BBC.\nThe Indian Express.\nhttps://panamapapers.icij.org\n\nArticle by: Jishnu J Raju"

            "[TITLE]": "10 Benefits of Goods and Service Tax (GST)",
            "[META]": "Last updated on September 13, 2023 by ClearIAS Team",
            "[CONTENT]": "Goods and Service Tax (GST) is a single tax on the supply of goods and services, right from the manufacturer to the consumer.\u00a0GST is one indirect tax for the whole nation, which will make India one unified common market.\n\nTable of Contents\n\nThe benefits of Goods and Service Tax (GST)\n1. Easy compliance:\n2. Uniformity of tax rates and structures:\n3. Removal of cascading:\n4. Improved competitiveness:\n5. Gain to manufacturers and exporters:\n6. Simple and easy to administer:\n7. Better controls on leakage:\n8. Higher revenue efficiency:\n9. Single and transparent tax proportionate to the value of goods and services:\n10. Relief in the overall tax burden:\nSummary\nThe benefits of Goods and Service Tax (GST)\n\nGST is beneficial not only for the business and industry but also for the government and consumers. Here, we bring the ten benefits of Goods and Service Tax (GST).\n\n1. Easy compliance:\n\nA robust and comprehensive IT system would be the foundation of the GST regime in India. Therefore, all taxpayer services such as registrations, returns, payments, etc. would be available to the taxpayers online, which would make compliance easy and transparent.\n\n2. Uniformity of tax rates and structures:\n\nGST will ensure that indirect tax rates and structures are common across the country, thereby increasing certainty and ease of doing business. In other words, GST would make doing business in the country tax neutral, irrespective of the choice of place of doing business.\n\n3. Removal of cascading:\n\nA system of seamless tax credits throughout the value-chain, and across boundaries of States, would ensure that there is minimal cascading of taxes. This would reduce the hidden costs of doing business.\n\n\ud83d\udc49 Which year are YOU targeting for success in the IAS/IPS/IFS Exam? \ud83d\ude80\n\n(1) \u21d2 UPSC 2025: Prelims cum Mains\n\n(2) \u21d2 UPSC 2026: Prelims cum Mains\n\n(3) \u21d2 UPSC 2027 Prelims cum Mains\n\nTip: Know more about ClearIAS Courses (Online/Offline)\n\n4. Improved competitiveness:\n\nReduction in transaction costs of doing business would eventually lead to improved competitiveness for the trade and industry. World Bank believes that the implementation of the Goods and Service Tax (GST), combined with the dismantling of inter-state check-posts, is the most crucial reform that could improve the competitiveness of India\u2019s manufacturing sector.\n\n5. Gain to manufacturers and exporters:\n\nThe subsuming of major Central and State taxes in GST, complete and comprehensive set-off of input goods and services and phasing out of Central Sales Tax (CST) would reduce the cost of locally manufactured goods and services. This will increase the competitiveness of Indian goods and services in the international market and give a boost to Indian exports. The uniformity in tax rates and procedures across the country will also go a long way in reducing compliance costs.\n\n6. Simple and easy to administer:\n\nMultiple indirect taxes at the Central and State levels are being replaced by GST. Backed with a robust end-to-end IT system, GST would be simpler and easier to administer than all other indirect taxes of the Centre and State levied so far.\n\n7. Better controls on leakage:\n\nGST will result in better tax compliance due to a robust IT infrastructure. Due to the seamless transfer of input tax credit from one stage to another in the chain of value addition, there is an in-built mechanism in the design of GST that would incentivize tax compliance by traders.\n\n8. Higher revenue efficiency:\n\nGST is expected to decrease the cost of collection of tax revenues of the Government, and will, therefore, lead to higher revenue efficiency.\n\n9. Single and transparent tax proportionate to the value of goods and services:\n\nDue to multiple indirect taxes being levied by the Centre and State, with incomplete or no input tax credits available at progressive stages of value addition, the cost of most goods and services in the country today is laden with many hidden taxes. Under GST, there would be only one tax from the manufacturer to the consumer, leading to transparency of taxes paid to the final consumer.\n\n10. Relief in the overall tax burden:\n\nCredits of input taxes paid at each stage will be available in the subsequent stage of value addition, which makes GST essentially a tax only on value addition at each stage.\u00a0Because of efficiency gains and the prevention of leakages, the overall tax burden on most commodities will come down, which will benefit consumers. The final consumer will thus bear only the GST charged by the last dealer in the supply chain, with set-off benefits at all the previous stages.\n\nSummary\n\nGST has been so designed that credit of taxes paid at every stage of value addition from the point of manufacture to the point of consumption, can be availed at the next stage. GST is essentially a tax on value addition, and there is a seamless transfer of input tax credit across the value chain. GST will simplify and harmonise the indirect tax regime in the country.\n\nIt is expected to reduce the cost of production and inflation in the economy, thereby making Indian trade and industry more competitive, domestically as well as internationally. It is also expected that the introduction of GST will foster a common or seamless Indian market and contribute significantly to the growth of the economy. Further, GST will broaden the tax base, and result in better tax compliance due to a robust IT infrastructure. Due to the seamless transfer of input tax credit from one stage to another in the chain of value addition, there is an in-built mechanism in the design of GST that would incentivize tax compliance by traders.\n\nReference: PIB"

It is relevant for a particular cause.\nIt is a way of raising capital using the internet or social networking like Facebook or Twitter or by using crowdfunding-dedicated websites.\nIt helps to improve the presence of small businesses and startups in social media, and increases their investment base, and funding prospects.\nThere are different types of crowdfunding like debt-based, equity-based, cause-based, rewards-based, software value token, donation-based, litigation, etc.\nPublic-Private Partnership (PPP) based on the equity-based model is practised in crowdfunding in India.\n\nCrowdfunding is not a new concept but has been for ages as Chandas has been collected for religious festivals since years.

Some of them are:\n\nTo fund the training of new generation artists, a crowdfunding campaign was launched for preserving the theatre art form Koodiyattam.\nParalympic badminton star Mark Dharma is crowdfunded to compete at the Thailand Parabadminton International 2017.\nCrowdfunding Platforms\nWishberry, Milaap, Miracle Foundation, RangDe CrowdCube and Seedrs are some of the leading crowdfunding platforms in India.\nWishberry funds for creative artists.

AgFunder is one of such global platform.\nIt bypasses caste or gender prejudice to community network and hence inclusiveness is enhanced.\nIt reduces costs. The platforms reduce search and transaction costs, which allow a higher participation in the market.\nIt opens up some of the neglected markets to individual investors.\nInvestors add value to companies and hence the value of companies is increased with crowdfunding.\nWhat are the concerns?\nIt is risky for the new small-scale investors and entrepreneurs and hence they often fail in their novice ventures.\nReputation is damaged if there is a failure to meet goals and targets or to generate interest which results in a public failure.\nIntellectual Property (IP) protection can be an issue as creators who engage in crowdfunding are required to release their product to the public in early stages of funding which exposes them to the risk of copy by competitors.\nThere is a risk that if the same network of supporters is reached out to multiple times, that network will eventually cease to supply necessary support and hence all the effort would go in vain in the end.\nSince it is without a regulatory framework there is a fear of public misuse.\nSince it is not formal banking system, chances of fraud and money laundering are high here.\nThere is a problem of creditworthiness and enforceability.\nThere is lack of expertise as the ratio of a novice is high here.\nThere is immaturity in startup sector in India and hence the chances of failure are very high.\n\nAlso read: Utilization of Public Funds\n\nWhat is the way forward?\n\nThere should be a complete transparency and accountability to do away with fraud and illegal activities. Awareness should be spread with the help of social media.\n\nIt should be ensured that the money should reach directly from the one who raises money to the contributor.\n\nThere should be documentation of details so that there is no misuse of the funds collected. Also, there should be laws to support the crowdfunding and entrepreneurship in India.\n\nThe mindset of people should change and belief in private entities should be there too as they are not solely profit oriented.\n\nA pro-business environment is necessary to be established in India for crowdfunding to be successful.\n\nArticle by: Ipsita Mishra"

            "[CONTENT]": "The term \u2018Gig Economy\u2019 is often in news these days. The trend toward a gig economy has begun. Why is it so controversial? Let\u2019s see.\n\nTable of Contents\n\nWhat is a Gig?\nWhat is a Gig Economy?\nIs Gig economy a new concept?\nHow many people are part of the Gig economy?\nWhat factors contribute to a Gig economy?\nWhy is Gig Economy preferred by workers?\nWhy is Gig Economy preferred by Employers?\nWhat are the stumbling blocks in a gig economy?\nWhat is the way forward?\nWhat is a Gig?\n\nA gig is a temporary contract job. It denotes a short-term contract or a freelance work as opposed to a permanent job. The contract employee gets paid once he finishes the work.\n\nWhat is a Gig Economy?\n\nIn a Gig Economy instead of traditional workforce, there would be only temporary or part-time work force.\n\nThe gig economy gets its name from each piece of work being similar to an individual \u2018gig\u2019.\n\nWorkers are paid for each individual gig they do \u2013 such as food delivery or a car journey \u2013 instead of monthly salary/days wage/hourly wage.\n\nCompanies like Uber, Ola, Deliveroo have made a huge success with this concept. Even software companies hire gig workers on a project basis.\n\nIs Gig economy a new concept?\n\nThe \u2018Gig concept\u2019 is very common in advanced countries like the US, Europe, who hire part time workers.\n\n\ud83d\udc49 Which year are YOU targeting for success in the IAS/IPS/IFS Exam? \ud83d\ude80\n\n(1) \u21d2 UPSC 2025: Prelims cum Mains\n\n(2) \u21d2 UPSC 2026: Prelims cum Mains\n\n(3) \u21d2 UPSC 2027 Prelims cum Mains\n\nTip: Know more about ClearIAS Courses (Online/Offline)\n\nWith freelancing evolving into the Gig Economy, the concept is attracting a lot of people in India as well.\n\nGig economy is remunerative and gives a wide range of choices but it also leads to\u00a0casualisation of the labour. (Reference \u2013 Investopedia)\n\nHow many people are part of the Gig economy?\nAs many as 30 percents of workers across the United States and Europe are thought to make up the gig economy.\nThere are five million people currently working in the gig economy in the UK according to the McKinsey Global Institute (MGI). This is around 15.6 percent of the total full and part-time workforce (31.95 million people).\nThe statistics of people involved in Gig economy in India is not very clear till now.\nWhat factors contribute to a Gig economy?\nThe comfort of working from home \u2013 In a modern digitized world, it is easy to work from home with the click of a mouse. It is independent contract work and workers don\u2019t need to go to the office for work but can work remotely from home too.\nMore choices \u2013 There is a wide range of choices for the employment seeker as well as the job provider as proximity to work place does not matter here. People also change jobs several times.\nExperimentation \u2013 Gig economy is a reflection of experimentation too.\nUncertain business climates\u00a0\u2013\u00a0As the nature of jobs is changing (eg. by automation, artificial intelligence), there is no need to hire permanent employees.\nWhy is Gig Economy preferred by workers?\nOne can also work on freelancing as well as work full-time somewhere else. Hence it is profitable to the worker as he can hit two targets together and multitask.\nIt is very beneficial for women who work on this concept when they cannot continue their work or take a break from career due to marriage or child birth.\nRetired people can also stay active after retirement as this will keep them engaged away from loneliness and depression. They can earn as well on their own rather than depending on their children or pensions.\nIt offers flexibility and diversity to the workers, unlike the monotonous full-time jobs. It offers flexibility when workers can work according to their convenience and schedule rather than routine like in full-time jobs.\nThe travel costs and energy to travel to the workplace is reduced.\nWhy is Gig Economy preferred by Employers?\nThe efficiency, efficacy and productivity of workers in gig economy are much more than that of a stable full-time job.\nMore Economical for employers\u00a0\u2013 When employment givers can\u2019t afford to hire full-time workers, they hire people for specific projects and pay them.\nStart-up companies and entrepreneurs \u2013 who do not have big financial space \u2013 can grow only if they can leverage the services of contract employees or freelancers.\nIn a gig economy, businesses save\u00a0resources in terms of benefits, office space and training. (Reference \u2013 Whatis)\nWhat are the stumbling blocks in a gig economy?\nThere is no certainty, stability\u00a0or job security in gig economy.\nWorkers can be terminated anytime here in a gig economy.\nWorkers do not have a bargaining power in a gig economy.\nWorkers do not get pensions, gratuity, perks etc that is available for full-time workers.\nThere is no basis on which banks and other financial service providers can extend lines of credit when steady income is not assured.\nThe social welfare objectives can be neglected if business and profitable avenues of freelancing are prioritized.\nIt is not accessible for people in many rural areas where internet connectivity and electricity still is a distant dream. Hence they are deprived of this opportunity and this stems up inequality debate again.\nConfidentiality of documents etc of the workplace is not guaranteed here. When there is a situation where gig worker is potentially working for others as well, including competitors, the employer is wary of what he shares with the gig worker and perennially suspicious.\nIn few work projects where teamwork is essential, gig economy becomes dysfunctional in such a scenario.\nIt is still in a nascent stage in a country like India.\nWhat is the way forward?\n\nThe UK PM Theresa May had said: \u201cI am clear that this Government will act to ensure that the interests of employees on traditional contracts, the self-employed and those people working in the \u2018gig\u2019 economy are all properly protected.\u201d\n\nThe government needs to step in, not to regulate away flexibility but to build worker and workplace protection into the system.\nOne of the biggest changes is a recommendation to change the law to redefine what a \u201cworker\u201d means.\nBasic labour welfare like minimum wages, pension etc can be paid to the gig workers.\nTraditional job descriptions should be overturned into skills-based categorizations.\nThere should be revamped of employee policy assessments and evaluations. An effective evaluation process is required to ensure consistent and quality work, where customized assessment procedures will need to be developed.\nEffectively communicating employer brand is important as communicating an authentic corporate brand is needed for traditional talent acquisition processes, even more important in a gig economy, where the foundation is built upon trust.\nIndia should learn from developed countries like the US and basic training and courses on freelancing, etc. should be provided to people.\nIndia can engage with the European Union and the United States, where discussion on protections in a gig economy is already underway.\nCompanies can introduce peer-to-peer mentoring and establish sharing platforms, both offline and online, to enable workers to connect with each other.\nCareer Avenues, choices, counselling should be available to students and workers on gig economy.\nCompanies will also need a human resource department that can manage a diverse workforce and imbue the company\u2019s culture into gig workers.\nAll casual workers must be given a full list of their rights and duties along with employment contracts in a gig economy.\nThe business, as well as welfare considerations of the people, should be well balanced.\n\nArticle by: Ipsita Mishra"

It covers a wide range of interlinked established and emerging sectors.\n\nThe Commonwealth of Nations: Blue Economy is an emerging concept that encourages better stewardship of our ocean or \u2018blue\u2019 resources.\n\nConservation International: Blue economy includes economic benefits that may not be marketed, such as carbon storage, coastal protection, cultural values, and biodiversity.\n\nThe Center for the Blue Economy: The blue economy is now a widely used term around the world with three related but distinct meanings- the overall contribution of the oceans to economies, the need to address the environmental and ecological sustainability of the oceans, and the ocean economy as a growth opportunity for both developed and developing countries.\n\nUnited Nations: It is an economy that comprises a range of economic sectors and related policies that together determine whether the use of ocean resources is sustainable. An important challenge of the blue economy is to understand and better manage the many aspects of oceanic sustainability, ranging from sustainable fisheries to ecosystem health to preventing pollution. Secondly, the blue economy challenges us to realize that the sustainable management of ocean resources will require collaboration across borders and sectors through a variety of partnerships, and on a scale that has not been previously achieved. This is a tall order, particularly for Small Island Developing States (SIDS) and Least Developed Countries (LDCs) which face significant limitations. The UN notes that the Blue Economy will aid in achieving the UN Sustainable Development Goals, of which one goal, 14, is \u201clife below water\u201d.\n\nWorld Wildlife Fund: For some, a blue economy means the use of the sea and its resources for sustainable economic development. For others, it simply refers to any economic activity in the maritime sector, whether sustainable or not.\u201d\n\nImportant Activities Connected to a Blue Economy\n\nThe Blue Economy encompasses activities that include:\n\n(1) Renewable Energy\n\nSustainable Marine Energy plays a vital role in social and economic development.\n\n(2) Fisheries\n\nMarine Fisheries contribute more than US$ 270 annually to global GDP. Sustainable Fisheries generate more revenue and help restore fish stocks.\n\n(3) Water Transport\n\nMore than 80 % of traded goods are transported by Sea and the rate of seaborne trade is expected to double by 2030 and quadruple by 2050.\n\n(4) Tourism\n\nOcean and Coastal Tourism can bring jobs and economic growth. More than 41 million visitors per year visit Least Developed Coastal countries and small island developing countries.\n\n(5) Climate Change\n\nThe staggering impacts of climate change include rising sea levels, Coastal Erosion, changing Ocean Current patterns, and Acidification. Oceans are an important Carbon Sink and help mitigate climate change.\n\n(6) Waste Management\n\n80% of litter in oceans is due to land-based sources.\n\nA Better Waste Management system can help revive deteriorating ocean health.\n\nIndia\u2019s Draft Policy Framework: India\u2019s Vision of New India by 2030\n\nThe Government of India\u2019s Vision of New India by 2030 highlighted the Blue Economy as one of the ten core dimensions of growth.\n\nBlue Economy was mentioned as the sixth dimension of Vision of New India 2030 stressing the need to improve the lives of the coastal communities and accelerate their development.\n\nThe objective of India\u2019s Blue Economic policy framework should be to enhance the country\u2019s GDP by promoting sustainable and inclusive economic growth whilst aligning with national security goals and the international development agenda.\n\nThe potential of Blue Economy concerning India\n\nIndia has a coastline of 7517 km long, 12 major ports, and 187 non-major ports which handled about 633.87 million tons of cargo in the year 2019.\n\n95% of India\u2019s trade volume transits by sea.\n\nIndia\u2019s two million square kilometers Exclusive economy is rich in living and non-living resources and contains a substantial amount of crude oil and natural gas.\nIt can potentially enhance value addition in coastal manufacturing and services, trade, deep-sea minerals, aquaculture, and marine-related technologies.\nThe coastal economy also sustains more than 40 lakh fishermen and other significant populations of coastal communities.\nAccording to pre-pandemic OECD estimates the global Blue Economy was expected to grow double the rate of the rest of the world economy.\nIn the post-COVID-19 global scenario, India witnesses significant growth in the marine sector by efficient and sustainable utilization of ocean resources.\nThe blue economy along with the market opportunities paves the way for the conservation and development of intangible \u2018blue\u2019 resources such as carbon sequestration and coastal resilience and decision-making to help vulnerable nations to mitigate the devastating effects of climate change.\nImportant facts connected with the potential of Oceans\nThe worldwide ocean economy is valued at around US$1.5 trillion per year.\nEighty percent of global trade by volume is carried by sea.\n350 million jobs worldwide are linked to fisheries.\nBy 2025 it is estimated that 34% of crude oil production will come from offshore fields.\nAquaculture is the fastest-growing food sector and provides about 50% of fish for human consumption.\nBlue Economy vs Green Economy\n\nThe green economy is defined as an economy that aims at reducing environmental risks, and that aims for sustainable development without degrading the environment.\u00a0 Therefore, the blue economy is a part of the green economy.\n\nDuring the Rio+20 Summit in June 2012, Pacific small island developing states stated that, for them, \u201ca green economy was a blue economy\u201d.\n\nRead: Blue Economy 2.0"

These plans were centralized plans for economic and social development based on Soviet-era models.\n\nThe first five-year plan (1951- 1956), The Harrod\u2013Domar model served as the foundation for this strategy. It concentrated on irrigation and agriculture to increase farm output.\n\nA plan to establish five Indian Institutes of Technology (IITs) as important technical institutions was one of the most significant advancements in infrastructure.\n\nSecond Five-Year Plan, The plan prioritised \u201crapid industrialization\u201d and the growth of the public sector.\n\nThe Mahalanobis model was used in the Plan. Steel and power were named as the main planning pillars.\nAlong with this strategy and the Industrial Policy Resolution of 1956, which has long been regarded as India\u2019s economic constitution, there was a deliberate push for the replacement of the basic and capital goods sectors.\nThe developments included the following:\nWith assistance from the Soviet Union, Britain (the UK), and West Germany, hydroelectric power projects and five steel mills were created in Bhilai, Durgapur, and Rourkela, respectively.\nThe amount of coal produced rose.\nThe North East received more railway lines.\n\nDuring the Fourth Plan (1969\u2013 1974), the nationalization of 14 public sector banks was a significant development that had a profound effect on the Indian economy and infrastructure.\n\nThe Fifth Plan (1974-78) saw the introduction of the Indian National Highway System and the widening of numerous highways to handle the rising traffic\n\nAfter the Economic Reform in 1991, Infrastructure services in India are gradually transitioning from being under government control to being provided by the private sector.\n\nUp until 1991, the public sector dominated the private sector, which merely supported the economy.\nWith the assistance of the public and private sectors, India has experienced tremendous growth in the industrial and infrastructure sectors in recent years.\nFollowing the 1991 policy, FDI (Foreign Direct Investors) entered the industries directly and indirectly. With their assistance, India received funding and equipment to build and grew to be one of the countries that spent the most on infrastructure and industries.\nState-owned agencies are giving way to private sector companies in sectors ranging from telecommunications and highways to power and ports, allowing them to function in a competitive market and subject to economic control where necessary.\nSimilar to how protein is the lifeblood of the human body, infrastructure is an economy\u2019s \u201clifeline.\u201d An appropriate degree of infrastructure presence is a prerequisite for growth and development.\n\nThe Key areas of infrastructure development include energy, Ports, Road, Railways\u2026etc\n\nEnergy sector\n\nEnergy is one of the most crucial ties for sustainable economic progress and human development.\n\nOne of the key metrics used to evaluate a nation\u2019s economic and social growth is its per capita energy consumption.\nProfessionals agree that energy is one of the key factors boosting the economy in emerging nations like India and is a crucial component of economic development.\nThe Indian energy sector has experienced significant expansion in response to the demands of a developing country.\nMany areas have transformed, including resource exploration and exploitation, capacity expansion, and energy sector reforms.\nHowever, resource expansion and an increase in energy supply have fallen short of the demands placed on them by the expanding population, fast urbanization, and advancing economy. As a result, India continues to experience severe energy shortages and is forced to rely on imports.\nPort Infrastructure\n\nPort infrastructure is essential to every country\u2019s development.\n\nIndia has an around 7,500 km long coastline. Ports handle almost 90% of India\u2019s external trade in terms of volume and 70% in terms of value.\nIron ore, coal, crude petroleum, and other necessary commodities are all imported via the marine route.\nIndia\u2019s coastline is home to 205 minor ports and 12 major ports.\nRoad Network\n\nIndia has one of the world\u2019s largest road networks.

One major challenge is the lack of infrastructure, which hinders economic development and contributes to inefficiency.\n\n\ud83d\udc49 Which year are YOU targeting for success in the IAS/IPS/IFS Exam? \ud83d\ude80\n\n(1) \u21d2 UPSC 2025: Prelims cum Mains\n\n(2) \u21d2 UPSC 2026: Prelims cum Mains\n\n(3) \u21d2 UPSC 2027 Prelims cum Mains\n\nTip: Know more about ClearIAS Courses (Online/Offline)\n\nThe country also suffers from a high level of bureaucracy and corruption, which can make it difficult for businesses to navigate the regulatory environment and access financing.\nAnother issue related to planning in India is the challenge of balancing economic growth with social and environmental concerns. The country has made significant progress in reducing poverty and improving living standards in recent decades, but there are still large disparities in wealth and access to resources.\nAdditionally, the rapid pace of economic development has had negative impacts on the environment, including air and water pollution and deforestation.\n\nOverall, the Indian economy faces several challenges related to planning, but the government and private sector are working to address these issues and promote sustainable and inclusive growth.\n\nAlso read: Issues related to planning of the Indian Economy\n\nIndian Economy and Issues Relating to Mobilization of Resources\n\nMobilization of resources, or the process of allocating resources efficiently and effectively, is a key challenge facing the Indian economy. Several factors contribute to this challenge:\n\nLimited access to credit: Many small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) in India face difficulties in accessing financing from banks and other financial institutions. This can hinder their ability to invest in new projects and expand their operations.\nInfrastructure constraints: Poor infrastructure, including a lack of roads, ports, and electricity, can make it difficult for businesses to transport goods and access markets. This can limit the productivity of firms and hinder economic growth.\nSkilled labor shortages: India has a large and growing population, but there are shortages of skilled workers in certain sectors, such as technology and manufacturing. This can make it difficult for businesses to find the workers they need to grow and compete in the global economy.\nResource allocation: The allocation of resources, such as land and water, can be a challenge in India due to a complex regulatory environment and issues such as corruption and political interference.\n\nTo address these challenges, the Indian government has implemented many initiatives to improve the mobilization of resources. These include measures to increase access to credit for SMEs, investments in infrastructure, and efforts to improve the education and skills of the workforce. However, there is still much work to be done to fully unlock the potential of the Indian economy.\n\nAlso read: Issues relating to the mobilization of resources in the Indian Economy\n\nIndian Economy and Issues Relating to Growth\n\nThe Indian economy, one of the world\u2019s fastest-growing, stands at the crossroads of leveraging its demographic advantage and overcoming structural challenges. Several issues need to be addressed to sustain its growth trajectory.\n\nKey Issues:\n\nEconomic Reforms: Implementation of reforms such as GST and FDI liberalization has boosted economic activity, yet uneven execution presents hurdles.\nEmployment: Harnessing the demographic dividend requires significant job creation and skill development to match industry needs.\nAgriculture: The sector, crucial for employment, faces productivity challenges due to small landholdings, inadequate technology access, and dependence on monsoon.\nInfrastructure: Despite progress, gaps in the quality and reach of infrastructure like roads, railways, and power remain, affecting business efficiency.\nFinancial Sector: Addressing non-performing assets and strengthening the banking sector are essential for financial stability and growth.\nExternal Factors: Global economic conditions and oil price volatility impact India\u2019s growth prospects significantly.\nEnvironmental Concerns: Balancing economic growth with environmental sustainability and addressing issues like pollution and resource depletion is critical.\n\nTo realize its full potential, India must navigate challenges related to employment, agriculture, infrastructure, and financial health, all while ensuring environmental sustainability. Strategic policy-making focused on inclusivity and sustainability will be pivotal in achieving comprehensive growth and development.\n\nAlso read: Issues related to the growth of the Indian Economy\n\nIndian Economy and Issues Related to Development\n\nIndia has experienced rapid economic growth in recent decades, with GDP per capita more than quadrupling since 1991. However, the country still faces several challenges related to development. Some of the key issues are:\n\nPoverty: Despite significant progress in reducing poverty, it remains a major problem in India. According to the World Bank, about 21% of the population lived below the poverty line in 2020.\nIncome inequality: India has one of the highest levels of income inequality in the world, with a large gap between the rich and the poor. This can hinder social mobility and contribute to social tensions.\nUnemployment: Unemployment remains a challenge in India, especially for young people and those with lower levels of education. The country\u2019s labor force is growing faster than the number of new jobs being created, which has led to rising unemployment and underemployment.\nEnvironmental degradation: The rapid pace of economic development has had negative impacts on the environment, including air and water pollution and deforestation. This can harm the health of the population and hinder long-term economic growth.\n\nTo address these challenges, the Indian government has implemented some policies and initiatives aimed at promoting sustainable and inclusive economic growth. These include measures to improve access to education, healthcare, and social services, as well as efforts to reduce pollution and protect the environment.\n\nAlso read: Issues related to the development of the Indian Economy\n\nIndian Economy and Issues Relating to Employment\n\nEmployment is a major challenge facing the Indian economy. Some of the key issues related to employment in India are:\n\nUnemployment: India\u2019s labor force is growing faster than the number of new jobs being created, which has led to rising unemployment. The unemployment rate in India was around 6% in 2020, according to the World Bank.\nUnderemployment: Many workers in India are underemployed, meaning they are working in jobs that do not fully utilize their skills or provide sufficient income. This is a particularly big problem in rural areas, where many people work in low-paying agriculture or informal sector jobs.\nSkill shortages: There are shortages of skilled workers in certain sectors of the economy, such as technology and manufacturing. This can make it difficult for businesses to find the workers they need to grow and compete in the global economy.\nLack of labor protections: Many workers in India, particularly those in the informal sector, do not have access to basic labor protections such as minimum wage, overtime pay, and job security. This can lead to exploitation and poverty.\n\nTo address these issues, the Indian government has implemented many initiatives to improve employment in the country. These include measures to improve education and training, promote entrepreneurship and small businesses, and increase access to credit for small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs). However, more needs to be done to address the underlying challenges facing the labor market in India.\n\nAlso read: Issues related to the employment in the Indian Economy\n\nConclusion\n\nIn conclusion, the Indian economy has made significant progress in recent decades, with GDP per capita more than quadrupling since 1991.\n\nHowever, the Indian economy and issues related to growth and development are still a challenge for the country.

It is challenging to balance private property rights in India.\n\nIntellectual creations versus public access to such inventions since such overlapping protection conflicts with the carefully formed concepts that have emerged over time.\n\nIssues related to Plagiarism:\u00a0Plagiarism is another serious problem. It is the act of taking another person\u2019s intellectual property, which includes words, slogans, designs, confidential information, and creative works of authorship, and utilizing them as one\u2019s own without acknowledging the original author or inventor.\n\nImproper enforcement of IP laws in cyberspace: On the Internet, intellectual property rights are applicable, but their enforcement is the key concern.\n\nPublishers contend that the Internet undermines their rights to intellectual property since it fundamentally alters the nature and methods of publishing, leaving their products very susceptible to online piracy.\nDue to the Internet\u2019s management being decentralized, any user can extensively disseminate work on the electronic network known as Cyberspace through a variety of means.\nAn individual can simply share a piece of art with newsgroups via email or on a personal website. The law governing intellectual property rights has caused issues for those working with advanced technology, such as computer programmers. The law stipulates that something must either be in writing to be protected by copyright or a machine to be protected by a patent.\n\nNo equivalent legislation to the Western copyright laws:\u00a0Although the Indian Copyright Act followed international norms, it has significant shortcomings when compared to Western copyright laws. Because India does not join the \u201cWIPO Internet Treaties,\u201d there is no equivalent legislation to the US DMCA in India.\n\nThe current Indian Copyright Act makes no mention of \u201ctechnological protective measures\u201d or the need to preserve electronic rights management data. The Indian Penal Code, 1860 (IPC) contains several sections that could provide legal protection for technological measures. The IPC\u2019s Section 23 refers to \u201cwrongful gain or wrongful loss.\u201d\n\nCompulsory licensing norms:\u00a0In several cases, the Indian government has been hesitant to enforce IPR to safeguard the interests of Indian citizens.\n\nFor instance, the government may use the compulsory licensing clause to compel the patent holder or hire a third party to mass-produce a necessary drug in an emergency.\n\nEvergreening of patent:\u00a0Evergreening is a tactic for retaining royalties by prolonging the period of a granted patent that is set to expire without improving medicinal efficacy.\n\nSection 3(d) of the Indian Patent Act, which prohibits large pharmaceutical corporations from \u201cevergreening\u201d or extending the patent indefinitely by making small changes to prior patents, is another problematic topic.\n\nSubsidies and IPR issues:\u00a0In India, IPR protection in agriculture is a sensitive topic.\n\nSubsidies, such as minimum support prices for agricultural products and those for fertiliser, etc., are required to be phased out under the TRIPs agreement.\nPolitical parties are unlikely to consent to this happening anytime soon because it affects livelihoods and food security. Farmers have also expressed some opposition to transnational firms patenting seeds.\n\nProtecting Traditional Knowledge:\u00a0Traditional knowledge is like a rich mine, especially in the medical area.\n\nGOI is required to safeguard traditional knowledge by prohibiting MNCs from obtaining patents on traditional culture.\nAbove all, the government established the Traditional Information Digital Library (TKDL) to stop traditional knowledge from being patented.\n\nData exclusivity: According to claims made by foreign investors and MNCs, Indian law does not protect against the unfair commercial use of test results or other data that is submitted to the government as part of a request for the government to approve a pharmaceutical or agrochemical product for sale.\n\nThey call for a Data Exclusivity law in response.\nWith limited knowledge and weak enforcement, protecting IPRs can be challenging in India. However, preserving copyrights, trademarks, and patents is essential for innovation and advancement.\nEven so, we still lag behind nations like China despite our remarkable advancement on the industrial, scientific, and economic fronts. A culture of invention and innovation will be fostered by effective IPR protection, which may help us quickly narrow that gap.\n\nGlobal Pressure and Compliance: India faces international pressure to conform to global IPR standards, often perceived as beyond its TRIPS agreement obligations. Balancing international expectations with domestic needs and development goals is a continual challenge.\n\nWay Forward\nFor addressing IPR-related disputes, a suitable resolution process is required.\nIndia must fix any gaps in its IP laws and regulations if it is to fully benefit from the transformative advantages of a strong IP system.\nThe expansion of the innovation ecosystem with improved IPR safeguards is necessary for the success of India\u2019s flagship programs, Make in India and Startup India.\nTo encourage the Indian industry to innovate as well as to protect and enforce their ideas, there has to be greater knowledge about the development, protection, and enforcement of IPRs.\nConclusion\n\nAddressing the issues related to intellectual property rights requires a multi-pronged approach, including legal reforms, strengthening enforcement mechanisms, enhancing judicial capacities, and fostering a culture of innovation and respect for IPR.\n\nMoreover, policies need to be inclusive, considering India\u2019s developmental needs, public health concerns, and the imperative to foster innovation and creativity.\n\nTo improve efficiency and reduce the time needed to issue patents, India has implemented several improvements to its IPR framework.\n\nIn the nation, innovation culture is becoming more prominent. India is in a good position to prioritize R&D. This has resulted in an increased rating in the Global Innovation Index over time.\n\nArticle Written By: Aryadevi E S"

Read here to learn about venture capital and venture debt.\n\nVenture capital (VC) refers to a type of private equity financing that venture capital firms or funds offer to startups, early-stage, and emerging businesses that have shown a high growth trajectory (either in terms of annual revenue or staff count) or are deemed to have high growth potential.\n\nThese businesses are funded by venture capital firms or funds in return for equity, or a share of the business.\n\nLarge organizations like pension funds, university endowments, and affluent individuals are usually the investors in venture capital firms.\n\nTable of Contents\n\nVenture Capital\nHow Venture Capital Works?\nTypes of Venture Capital\nBenefits and Risks\nVenture debt\nAdvantages and Risks of Venture Debt\nConclusion\nVenture Capital\n\nVenture capital plays a crucial role in the ecosystem of innovation and entrepreneurship.\n\nIt provides necessary funding resources for startups that do not have access to capital markets, bank loans, or other debt instruments due to their newness, small size, or lack of tangible assets.\nVenture capital investment is often risky but offers the potential for above-average returns, which attracts investors.\nHow Venture Capital Works?\nFundraising: Venture capital funds raise money from various investors to create a pool of funds.\nInvestment: They then identify and invest in startups and early-stage companies with high growth potential. The investment is not just monetary; venture capitalists also provide mentorship, strategic advice, and networking opportunities.\nGrowth Stage: With the infusion of capital, these companies ideally grow and expand. During this phase, venture capitalists may provide additional rounds of funding.\nExit: The ultimate goal of a venture capital investment is to exit the investment at a significantly higher valuation than the entry point. Exits are typically achieved through an initial public offering (IPO) or by selling the company to a larger one (acquisition).\n\nVenture Capital Process:\n\n\ud83d\udc49 Which year are YOU targeting for success in the IAS/IPS/IFS Exam? \ud83d\ude80\n\n(1) \u21d2 UPSC 2025: Prelims cum Mains\n\n(2) \u21d2 UPSC 2026: Prelims cum Mains\n\n(3) \u21d2 UPSC 2027 Prelims cum Mains\n\nTip: Know more about ClearIAS Courses (Online/Offline)\n\nDeal Origination: Venture capitalists find potential investment opportunities through networking, pitches, or referrals.\nScreening: Initial review to assess the viability, market potential, team, and product.\nDue Diligence: Comprehensive review of the business model, team, market size, and product to mitigate investment risks.\nInvestment Decision: Based on the due diligence, the venture capital firm decides whether to invest.\nPost-Investment Activities: Active involvement in the company, providing strategic guidance, financial management advice, and networking opportunities.\nExit: Through a strategic sale, IPO, or occasionally, a buyback by the company\u2019s founders.\nTypes of Venture Capital\nSeed Capital: Very early investment to prove a new idea, often before the startup has fully formed its product or business model.\nEarly Stage Financing: Investments given for product development and initial marketing. This can include Series A and Series B rounds.\nExpansion Financing: Also known as growth financing, this is capital provided to expand market reach, make significant R&D investments, or increase working capital.\nLate Stage Financing: Funding provided to companies that have reached a certain level of maturity right before IPO.\nBenefits and Risks\n\nBenefits:\n\nAccess to funds without the need to repay.\nExpertise and mentorship from seasoned professionals.\nNetworking opportunities.\n\nRisks:\n\nDilution of ownership and control.\nPressure to scale quickly and deliver high returns.\nPotential for misalignment between investors and founders.\n\nVenture capital is an essential driver of innovation, enabling cutting-edge technologies and business models to flourish. It is a high-risk, high-reward environment that demands a robust ecosystem of investors, entrepreneurs, and regulatory frameworks to thrive.\n\nVenture debt\n\nVenture debt is a type of debt financing provided to venture-backed companies that are typically in their early or growth stages.\n\nUnlike traditional bank loans, venture debt is tailored to startups and growth companies that may not yet be profitable or have sufficient assets to secure conventional loans.\nVenture debt is often provided by specialized venture debt funds or banks with venture lending arms.\nIt is used by companies as a complement to equity financing to extend their runway, finance growth initiatives, accelerate expansion, or manage cash flow without significantly diluting the equity of existing shareholders.\n\nVenture debt providers include specialized venture debt funds, banks with venture lending departments, and other non-bank financial institutions that focus on high-growth companies.\n\nThese lenders have a deep understanding of the unique challenges and opportunities faced by startups and growth companies.\n\nCharacteristics of Venture Debt\n\nCollateral: Unlike traditional loans, venture debt may not require physical assets as collateral. Lenders often rely on the company\u2019s intellectual property or future revenue potential as security.\nWarrants: Lenders may receive warrants in addition to interest payments. Warrants are rights to purchase equity in the company at a future date, at a predetermined price, providing a potential upside beyond the interest revenue.\nInterest Rates: Venture debt typically carries higher interest rates than traditional bank loans due to the higher risk associated with startups and growth companies.\nTerm: The repayment period for venture debt is usually shorter than traditional loans, often ranging from 12 to 48 months.\n\nUses of Venture Debt\n\nWorking Capital: To finance day-to-day operations without diluting ownership.\nCapital Expenditures: To purchase equipment or finance other long-term investments.\nAcquisitions: To finance the acquisition of other companies or assets.\nBridge Financing: To provide a bridge to the next equity round or to an exit event, such as an IPO or acquisition.\nAdvantages and Risks of Venture Debt\nLess Dilutive: Allows companies to raise capital without giving away as much equity, preserving the ownership stake of founders and existing investors.\nFlexibility: This can be used for a variety of purposes, offering startups flexibility in how they deploy capital.\nCost-Effective: Despite higher interest rates compared to traditional loans, venture debt can be more cost-effective than raising additional equity, especially if the company\u2019s valuation is expected to increase significantly.\n\nRisks of Venture Debt\n\nDebt Obligations: Companies must manage their cash flow carefully to meet debt service obligations, which can be challenging for startups with unpredictable revenue.\nSecurity and Covenants: Some venture debt arrangements require security against the company\u2019s assets and may include restrictive covenants that limit the company\u2019s operational flexibility.\nWarrants: The issue of warrants dilutes existing shareholders, although typically to a lesser extent than a new round of equity financing.\nConclusion\n\nVenture capital offers financial support to startups that lack access to stock markets and insufficient cash flow to incur debt. Because investors acquire stock in potential firms and businesses receive the funding they require to jumpstart their operations, this arrangement may be advantageous to both parties.\n\nVenture debt is a valuable financial tool for startups and growth-stage companies, providing a way to finance operations, growth, or strategic initiatives with less dilution than equity financing.\n\nIt is particularly useful for companies with strong venture capital backing and a clear path to profitability or exit. However, like any form of debt, it comes with obligations that must be carefully managed to avoid financial strain on the company.\n\nRelated article:\n\nStartup seed fund scheme\nInvestment models\nCrowdfunding\n\n-Article by Swathi Satish"

Factors like economic growth, inflation, and tax evasion influenced buoyant taxes during this period. Efforts to reform direct taxes, including moderating tax rates and broadening the base, also impacted the measure.\nPost-GST Implementation: The GST was expected to increase tax buoyancy by simplifying the tax structure, making it more transparent, and reducing the compliance burden on businesses. Initial years post-GST saw mixed results in terms of tax buoyancy, partly due to teething problems, changes in tax rates, and compliance issues. However, as the system stabilized, there was an anticipation of improved tax buoyancy reflecting better compliance and coverage.\nFactors Affecting Tax Buoyancy in India\nEconomic Growth: India\u2019s economic growth is a critical determinant of tax buoyancy. Periods of high growth have historically been associated with high buoyant taxes, reflecting increased tax collections from corporate and individual income taxes, as well as indirect taxes.\nTax Administration and Compliance: Efforts to streamline tax administration and enhance compliance, including through digitization (e.g., e-filing of tax returns, GSTN platform) and enforcement activities, impact buoyancy.\nPolicy Reforms: Tax policy reforms, including rationalization of tax rates, exemption reductions, and base-broadening measures, play a significant role in determining tax buoyancy. The introduction of the GST is a prime example of such reforms.\nInformal Economy: The size of the informal economy in India poses challenges to tax collection and affects tax buoyancy. Efforts to formalize the economy are expected to improve tax buoyancy over time.\nGlobal Economic Environment: External factors, including global economic trends and trade dynamics, can influence India\u2019s economy and, consequently, its tax buoyancy, given the impact on exports, imports, and foreign investment.\nSignificance\nEconomic Stability: High tax buoyancy indicates that the tax system can automatically stabilize the economy. During economic expansions, buoyant tax systems ensure that tax revenues increase, potentially limiting overheating. Conversely, during downturns, revenues fall, providing an automatic fiscal stimulus.\nFiscal Planning: The phenomenon is essential for government fiscal planning and budgeting. Understanding how tax revenues respond to economic growth helps in forecasting revenue and making informed decisions about spending, debt, and investment.\nPolicy Evaluation: It helps evaluate the effectiveness of the tax system and tax policy reforms. For instance, changes in tax buoyancy over time can indicate the impact of tax policy reforms on revenue generation capacity.\nAdjusting Tax Policies: A low buoyant tax could prompt governments to adjust tax policies, such as modifying tax rates or broadening the tax base, to ensure adequate revenue generation in line with economic growth.\nFactors Affecting Tax Buoyancy\nEconomic Structure: The composition of an economy (services vs. manufacturing, informal vs. formal sector) significantly influences the measure.\nTax Compliance and Administration: Efficient tax administration and high compliance rates can lead to high buoyancy by minimizing tax evasion and avoidance.\nTax Base Elasticity: The sensitivity of the tax base to economic growth affects buoyancy. For example, income taxes may be more buoyant in an economy where incomes are rapidly growing.\nTax Rate Structure: Progressive tax systems, where tax rates increase with the tax base, might exhibit higher buoyancy compared to flat or regressive systems.\nChallenges\nVolatile Revenues: Highly buoyant tax systems might lead to revenue volatility, complicating fiscal planning, especially in economies prone to frequent booms and busts.\nEquity Concerns: Ensuring that tax buoyancy does not disproportionately impact different income groups is crucial for maintaining fairness in the tax system.\nTax elasticity\n\nTax elasticity is a crucial concept in fiscal policy and economics, referring to the responsiveness of tax revenue to changes in the economic base that generates that revenue, without any alteration in tax rates.\n\nIt\u2019s a measure that helps governments and policymakers understand how tax revenues will change in response to economic growth or contraction.\nUnlike tax buoyancy, which accounts for changes in tax rates along with the tax base, tax elasticity focuses purely on the inherent responsiveness of the tax system to economic activity, holding tax laws constant.\nTax Elasticity vs Tax Buoyancy\n\nA tax is considered elastic if it is greater than 1, meaning tax revenues grow faster than the economy.\n\nConversely, a tax with an elasticity less than 1 is inelastic, indicating tax revenues grow more slowly than the economy.\nElastic taxes are sensitive to economic cycles, with revenues significantly increasing during economic booms and decreasing during recessions.\nInelastic taxes provide a more stable revenue stream across economic cycles.\n\nFormula for Tax Buoyancy\n\nIf it is greater than 1, tax revenues are growing at a faster rate than the economy, indicating a highly responsive tax system.\nIf it equals 1, tax revenues are growing at the same rate as the economy.\nIf it is less than 1, tax revenues are growing at a slower rate than the economy, suggesting a less responsive tax system.\nConclusion\n\nTax buoyancy is a vital concept for understanding the dynamics between tax revenue generation and economic growth.\n\nIt provides insights into the effectiveness of a tax system in responding to economic changes, assisting policymakers in fiscal planning and policy formulation.\n\nA well-designed tax system should aim for high buoyancy, ensuring stable and sustainable revenue generation aligned with economic growth while maintaining equity and efficiency.\n\nRelated articles:\u00a0\n\nTax transparency\nRetrospective taxation\nGlobal minimum tax\n\n-Article by Swathi Satish"

It is often measured using various metrics, such as the Gini coefficient or the ratio of income shares between different percentiles of the population. High levels of income inequality can have significant economic, social, and political implications. Read here to learn more.\n\nIncome inequality has declined in India with a higher tax base and a shift in taxpayers from lower income to higher income tax bracket, the Economic Research Department of the State Bank of India said in a report.\n\nAbout 36.3 percent of taxpayers have moved from lower income to higher income tax bracket resulting in 21.3 percent additional income, the report said adding that the top 2.5 percent of taxpayers\u2019 contribution in income declined from 2.81 percent in FY14 to 2.28 percent in FY21.\n\nTable of Contents\n\nWhat Is Income Inequality?\nFactors Contributing to Income Inequality\nConsequences\nHow to measure income inequality?\nConsiderations for Measurement\nAddressing Income Inequality\nConclusion\nWhat Is Income Inequality?\n\nSubscribe to the ClearIAS YouTube Channel for more informative videos on UPSC preparation, tips, and strategies.

The less equal the distribution, the greater the income inequality. Income inequality is often accompanied by wealth inequality, which is the uneven distribution of wealth.\n\n\ud83d\udc49 Which year are YOU targeting for success in the IAS/IPS/IFS Exam? \ud83d\ude80\n\n(1) \u21d2 UPSC 2025: Prelims cum Mains\n\n(2) \u21d2 UPSC 2026: Prelims cum Mains\n\n(3) \u21d2 UPSC 2027 Prelims cum Mains\n\nTip: Know more about ClearIAS Courses (Online/Offline)\n\nPopulations can be divided up in different ways to show different levels and forms of income inequality, such as income inequality by gender or race.\nDifferent measures, such as the Gini Index, can be used to analyze the level of income inequality in a population.\nFactors Contributing to Income Inequality\nWage Disparities: Differences in wages and salaries across occupations and industries contribute to income inequality. Certain professions or sectors may offer higher remuneration, leading to disparities.\nEducational Disparities: Educational attainment is often correlated with income. Individuals with higher levels of education tend to have access to better-paying jobs, creating income gaps based on educational disparities.\nTechnological Changes: Technological advancements can impact the demand for certain skills. Individuals with technical or specialized skills may see higher income gains, while those with less relevant skills may face wage stagnation.\nGlobalization: Global economic integration can affect income distribution. Some argue that globalization has led to the outsourcing of jobs and wage pressure on low-skilled workers in developed countries.\nLabor Market Trends: Changes in the labor market, such as the rise of gig economy jobs, part-time work, and non-standard employment arrangements, can influence income distribution.\nInheritance and Wealth: Intergenerational transfers of wealth and inheritance can contribute to the perpetuation of income inequality, as individuals born into affluent families may have advantages in terms of education and opportunities.\nTax Policies: Tax structures and policies can either exacerbate or mitigate income inequality. Progressive tax systems that tax higher incomes at higher rates can help reduce inequality, while regressive tax policies may widen the gap.\nConsequences\nEconomic Growth: Excessive wealth inequality can hinder economic growth by limiting the purchasing power of a significant portion of the population, which can, in turn, impact demand for goods and services.\nSocial Mobility: High-income inequality may impede social mobility, making it difficult for individuals from lower-income backgrounds to move up the economic ladder.\nHealth Disparities: Studies suggest a correlation between income inequality and health outcomes. Higher levels of income inequality are associated with poorer health outcomes for the overall population.\nEducation Disparities: Income inequality can affect access to quality education. Wealthier individuals may have better educational opportunities, exacerbating disparities in skills and qualifications.\nSocial Cohesion: Excessive income inequality can strain social cohesion and lead to social unrest. It may contribute to feelings of injustice and undermine the trust individuals have in social institutions.\nPolitical Influence: Disparities in income can translate into disparities in political influence, potentially skewing policy decisions in favor of the affluent.\nHow to measure income inequality?\n\nIncome inequality can be measured using various statistical tools and indicators. Here are some commonly used methods to measure income inequality:\n\nGini Coefficient:\nThe Gini coefficient is a widely used measure of income inequality. It calculates the extent to which the distribution of income among individuals or households within a country deviates from perfect equality. The Gini coefficient ranges from 0 (perfect equality) to 1 (perfect inequality).\nA Gini coefficient of 0 indicates that everyone has the same income, while a coefficient of 1 implies that one person or household has all the income, and others have none.\nTheil Index:\nThe Theil index is another measure of income inequality that considers both within-group and between-group inequalities. It breaks down total inequality into two components: inequality within groups and inequality between groups.\nThe Theil index is particularly useful when examining inequality among different subgroups within a population.\nPalma Ratio:\nThe Palma ratio is the ratio of the income share of the richest 10% of the population to the income share of the poorest 40%. It focuses on the relative income shares of the top and bottom segments of the income distribution.\nThe Palma ratio is especially relevant in assessing the concentration of income among the wealthiest and the distribution among the lower-income groups.\nPercentile Ratios:\nComparing income shares at different percentiles of the income distribution provides insights into how income is distributed across various segments of the population. Commonly used percentiles include the 10th, 20th, 50th (median), 80th, and 90th percentiles.\nExamining the ratio of income between the highest and lowest percentiles can offer a snapshot of the overall income distribution.\nLorenz Curve:\nThe Lorenz curve is a graphical representation of income distribution. It plots the cumulative share of total income received by the bottom x% of the population against the cumulative share of the population from the poorest to the richest.\nThe greater the distance between the Lorenz curve and the line of perfect equality, the higher the level of income inequality.\nDecomposition Analysis:\nDecomposition analysis involves breaking down overall income inequality into its components, such as inequality within regions, industries, or demographic groups. This helps identify the sources of inequality.\nDecomposition techniques include the Oaxaca-Blinder decomposition for gender wage gaps and other similar methods.\nAtkinson Index:\nThe Atkinson index measures inequality by assigning different weights to income differences at various parts of the income distribution. It reflects societal preferences regarding inequality aversion.\nThe Atkinson index is sensitive to changes in the distribution of income among the poor and the rich.\nCoefficient of Variation:\nThe coefficient of variation is a simple measure of relative income inequality. It is calculated as the ratio of the standard deviation of income to the mean income.\nA higher coefficient of variation indicates greater income inequality.\nIncome Shares by Quintiles:\nDividing the population into quintiles (20% groups) based on income and examining the share of total income held by each quintile provides a straightforward measure of income distribution.\nRelative Mean Deviation:\nThe relative mean deviation measures the average percentage deviation of individual incomes from the mean income. It provides information about the dispersion of income around the mean.\nConsiderations for Measurement\nPopulation Coverage: Ensure that the measurement includes the entire population or specific demographic groups.\nCurrency of Data: Use up-to-date income data to reflect current economic conditions.\nAdjusting for Cost of Living: Consider regional variations in the cost of living when assessing income inequality.\n\nChoosing the appropriate measure depends on the research question, data availability, and the specific characteristics of the population being studied. Combining multiple measures can provide a more comprehensive understanding of income inequality within a society.\n\nAddressing Income Inequality\nEducation and Skills Development: Investing in education and skills development programs to ensure that individuals have the tools to access higher-paying jobs.\nProgressive Taxation: Implementing progressive tax policies that tax higher incomes at higher rates.\nSocial Safety Nets: Establishing robust social safety nets to provide support for those facing economic challenges.\nLabor Market Policies: Implementing policies that promote fair wages, workers\u2019 rights, and job security.\nPromoting Inclusive Economic Growth: Designing economic policies that focus on inclusive growth, ensuring that the benefits of economic development are shared more equitably.\nAddressing Discrimination: Taking measures to address discrimination in the workplace, including gender and racial disparities in pay.\nWealth Redistribution: Exploring mechanisms for wealth redistribution, such as inheritance taxes or targeted social programs.\nConclusion\n\nReducing income inequality requires a multi-faceted approach that addresses the various factors contributing to disparities. Policymakers, businesses, and civil society play crucial roles in creating more equitable economic systems.\n\nRelated articles:\n\nGender Pay Parity\nInclusive growth\nEconomic and Social Development\nHuman Development in India\nCorporate driven Inequality\n\n-Article by Swathi Satish"

Such securities are short-term (usually called treasury bills, with original maturities of less than one year) or long-term (usually called Government bonds or dated securities with original maturity of one year or more).\nIn India, the Central Government issues both, treasury bills and bonds or dated securities while the State Governments issue only bonds or dated securities, which are called the State Development Loans (SDLs).\nG-Secs carry practically no risk of default and, hence, are called risk-free gilt-edged instruments.\nHow are the G-Secs issued?\n\nG-Secs are issued through auctions conducted by RBI.\n\nAuctions are conducted on the electronic platform called the E-Kuber, the Core Banking Solution (CBS) platform of RBI.\nCommercial banks, scheduled UCBs, Primary Dealers insurance companies, and provident funds, who maintain funds accounts (current accounts) and securities accounts (Subsidiary General Ledger (SGL) accounts) with RBI, are members of this electronic platform.\n\nExamples of government securities include:\n\nTreasury Bills (Short-Term G-Secs)\nDated Securities (Long-Term G-Secs)\nCash Management Bills (CMBs)\nState Development Loans\nTreasury Inflation-Protected Securities (TIPS)\nZero-Coupon Bonds\nCapital Indexed Bonds\nFloating Rate Bonds\nSavings Bonds\nTreasury Notes\nTreasury Bonds\nTypes of government securities\n\nTreasury Bills (T-Bills):\n\nShort-term debt instruments with maturities ranging from 91 days to 364 days.\nIssued at a discount to face value, and the return is the difference between the purchase price and the face value.\nT-Bills are essentially zero-coupon bonds, meaning they don\u2019t pay periodic interest. Investors earn returns through the difference in purchase and face value.\n\nCash Management Bills (CMBs):\n\nCash Management Bills are short-term government securities issued to manage temporary liquidity mismatches in the government\u2019s cash flows.\nThey have a maturity period of up to 91 days and are issued at a discount to their face value.\n\nGovernment Bonds:\n\nLong-term debt instruments with maturities ranging from 2 years to 30 years or more.\nPay periodic interest (coupon payments) to investors, and the principal is returned at maturity.\nMost government bonds in India are fixed-rate bonds, where the interest rate remains constant throughout the bond\u2019s life.\n\nDated G-secs:\n\nDated G-Secs are securities that carry a fixed or floating coupon (interest rate) which is paid on the face value, on a half-yearly basis. Generally, the tenor of dated securities ranges from 5 years to 40 years.\n\nState Development Loans (SDLs):\n\nSDLs are debt instruments issued by state governments to meet their financial requirements.\nSDLs function similarly to government bonds but are issued by individual states rather than the central government.\nLike government bonds, SDLs pay periodic interest to bondholders, and the principal is repaid at maturity.\n\nInflation-Indexed Bonds (IIBs):\n\nIIBs are designed to protect investors against inflation. The principal and interest payments are linked to the Wholesale Price Index (WPI) or Consumer Price Index (CPI).\nThese bonds offer a fixed real rate of return above inflation, providing investors with an inflation-adjusted income.\n\nTreasury Inflation-Protected Securities (TIPS):\n\nTreasury Inflation-Protected Securities (TIPS) are government securities designed to protect investors from inflation.\nThe principal amount of these securities is adjusted based on changes in the Consumer Price Index (CPI).\n\nFloating Rate Bonds:\n\nFloating rate bonds have interest rates that are linked to a benchmark, such as the government securities yield or other market rates.\nThe interest rate on these bonds is adjusted periodically, providing investors with a variable income stream.\n\nCapital Indexed Bonds:\n\nCapital-indexed bonds protect investors against fluctuations in real interest rates by adjusting the principal amount based on an inflation index.\nSimilar to IIBs, these bonds offer a fixed real rate of return above inflation.\n\nSovereign Gold Bonds:\n\nSovereign Gold Bonds are issued by the government and are linked to the price of gold.\nInvestors receive periodic interest payments, and the principal value is linked to the prevailing market price of gold.\n\nGreen Bonds:\n\nGreen bonds are issued to raise funds for environmentally sustainable projects, such as renewable energy, afforestation, or clean transportation.\nThese bonds attract investors interested in contributing to environmentally responsible initiatives.\nAdvantages of Investing in Government Securities\n\nInvesting in government securities offers several advantages, such as:\n\nSafety: Government securities are considered risk-free investments due to the government\u2019s creditworthiness and guarantee of repayment.\nRegular Income: These securities provide regular interest payments, offering a steady income stream to investors.\nDiversification: Government securities can diversify an investment portfolio by reducing overall risk.\nLiquidity: These securities can be easily bought and sold in the secondary market, ensuring liquidity for investors.\nTax Benefits: Certain government securities offer tax benefits, such as tax exemption on the interest earned.\nChallenges\n\nMarket Liquidity:\u00a0 Ensuring liquidity in the government securities market is an ongoing challenge. Illiquidity can affect the effectiveness of monetary policy transmission.\n\nParticipation of Retail Investors: Encouraging greater participation of retail investors in the government securities market remains a challenge.\n\nConclusion\n\nThe government securities market in India is expected to continue evolving with advancements in technology, changes in market structure, and the introduction of new financial instruments. The market\u2019s resilience and its ability to adapt to changing economic conditions will be crucial for maintaining stability in India\u2019s financial system.\n\nRelated articles:\n\nPublic Debt\nCapital Market\nFinancial Market\nMonetary Policy of India\nIndian Financial System\nWays and Means Advances\n\n-Article by Swathi Satish"

Shells, berries, wings of butterflies, and beetles were all used with great ingenuity.\n\nWith the advance of civilization, the materials changed to copper, ivory, agate, and semi-precious stones, and later to silver, gold, and diamonds.\n\nDuring the Indus Valley civilization, various ornaments like rings, head ornaments, brooches, and girdles were found, mostly they were melted or refined, molded or chiseled, designed, and cast.\nGreek and Hellenistic styles were found in the Gandhara period, archaeologists have found massive earrings, torques, and armlets incorporating bird or animal forms.\nCrest Jewel, crowns, studs, hoops, jimmikis, chains, chokers, ropes of pearls and beads, armlets, bangles, bracelets, nose rings, rings on fingers and toes, girdles and anklets were found during the golden age of India that is during the Gupta Empire.\nBy the time, when the Britishers ruled we could print all kinds of jewelry designs in a catalogue.\n\nThe country\u2019s rich and varied history has given rise to a wide array of jewelry styles, each reflecting the unique cultural and artistic expressions of different communities.\n\nJewelry in India is crafted from a variety of materials, including gold, silver, precious and semi-precious gemstones, and even beads. Techniques such as enameling, filigree work, Kundan setting, and meenakari (enameling on gold) are integral to Indian jewelry making.\nTemple jewelry, characterized by intricate motifs of deities and divine symbols, has its origins in South India. It is often used for classical dance performances and is inspired by the architecture of temples.\nKundan and Polki jewelry, known for their elaborate settings of uncut diamonds and precious gemstones, have been a traditional favorite in North India, particularly in states like Rajasthan.\nOriginating in the Mughal era, Jadau jewelry involves embedding gemstones into gold using a technique known as kundan setting. It is prevalent in regions like Rajasthan and Gujarat.\nDhokra is a traditional metal-casting technique, and Dhokra jewelry, with its rustic and tribal appeal, is crafted using this ancient art form.\nNavratna jewelry features nine gemstones representing the nine planets, each believed to have astrological significance.

It incorporates all institutional and functional parts of the market structure of the system and is driven by technical and financial factors.\n\nIt is the main method of moving agricultural products from farms to markets and a variety of urban neighborhoods.\nThe process of agricultural marketing entails acquiring, storing, preparing, shipping, and delivering various farmed supplies across the nation.\nAgricultural marketing, which is a part of the larger marketing system, refers to all of the actions, organizations, and regulations producers take to acquire farm inputs and transport agricultural products from farms to consumers, manufacturers, and exporters.\nIt should offer customers food of acceptable quality at prices they can afford, remunerative pricing for farmers, and sufficient margins for middlemen to ensure their continuing involvement in the trade.\nThe growth of the agricultural industry as a whole depends on agricultural marketing.\nPaying farmers fairly and profitably for their agricultural output gives farmers financial security.\nAdditionally, it guarantees that food goods are accessible and affordable to consumers, which lowers inflation.\nThe flow of agricultural goods from producer to consumer is handled by an extensive system known as agricultural marketing.\nAgriculture marketing is carried out in India through several central government agencies, including the Commission of Agricultural Costs and Prices, the Food Corporation of India, the Cotton Corporation of India, the Jute Corporation of India, etc.\nAdditionally, there are organizations dedicated to the marketing of rubber, tea, coffee, tobacco, spices, and vegetables.\nImportance of Transport and Marketing of Agricultural Produce\n\nAgriculture and transportation, Both of these sectors of the economy, are dependent on one another, as are these two industries.\n\n\ud83d\udc49 Which year are YOU targeting for success in the IAS/IPS/IFS Exam? \ud83d\ude80\n\n(1) \u21d2 UPSC 2025: Prelims cum Mains\n\n(2) \u21d2 UPSC 2026: Prelims cum Mains\n\n(3) \u21d2 UPSC 2027 Prelims cum Mains\n\nTip: Know more about ClearIAS Courses (Online/Offline)\n\nThe marketing of agricultural products is significantly impacted by dependable and effective transportation infrastructure.\nAgricultural products differ from industrial goods in that they have distinctive characteristics, making transportation availability and quality equally important.\nFor instance, agricultural products are bulky and perishable. Almost all of them are consumable goods.\nThe objects must be protected from damage during transit with proper packing and transportation.\nOn the other hand, the farmer may maximize his or her revenues if efficient transportation infrastructure is in place and agricultural output is handled with care.\nHowever, low unit pricing and a robust agriculture value chain may be maintained via an efficient transportation and marketing system.\nTransporting goods affordably allows producers to make a profit while also making them available to customers.\nContrarily, if transportation costs are high, not only will local marketing suffer but so will the possibility of exporting agricultural products to countries with more efficient transportation.\nTransport creates a market for agricultural goods, enhances communication between geographical and economic regions, and creates new areas of economic focus.\nOver 3 million employees will be created as a result of an investment of Rs 89,375 crore in the development of reliable post-harvest storage and transportation.\nLow-quality rural transportation will affect productivity, income, and level of living.\nThe primary focus of agricultural marketing is the purchase and sale of agricultural goods.\nAny agricultural product\u2019s ability to be sold depends on several variables, including the product\u2019s current demand and storage space accessibility.\nBetter marketing for farmers can guarantee higher pricing for the produce and protection from price swings.\nManufacturers want farmers to supply them with the most affordable, highest-quality produce possible so that they can sell it for a profit.\nThe best products and services from the manufacturer or farmer, at the most affordable pricing, are what traders and retailers seek.\nCustomers are looking for high-quality goods at reasonable pricing.\nA successful marketing strategy will lessen the need for government purchases at MSP, aiding in fiscal consolidation.\nTransportation constraints for agricultural produces\n\nThe main obstacles to moving agricultural products in India include a lack of infrastructure, support, and logistics connectivity to guarantee farmers\u2019 timely delivery of their yield to markets.\n\nIndia has very poor transportation facilities. Only a few villages are connected to mandies by railways and pucca roads.\nProduce must be transported on cumbersome conveyances like bullock carts.\nSuch transportation cannot be employed to convey products to locations too far away, so the farmer must discard his harvest in neighbouring marketplaces, even if the price he receives there is quite poor. With regards to perishable goods, this is much more true.\nLack of transportation choices that can go farther distances more quickly, but are highly expensive and time-consuming; lack of services like mobile cold storage for fresh perishable products that cannot be stored at production centres yet requires rapid transfer.\nGiven the perishable nature of the fruit, there have been restrictions on its marketing connected to direct marketing, assurance of greater returns, reliance on the weekly haat, and wholesale market known as mandi.\nActions Taken to Improve Transportation\n\nKisan rails are the first multi-commodity trains in the world.\n\nThese chilled freight trains will help in the quick delivery of perishable agricultural products like fruits and vegetables to markets.\nThese will make sure that agricultural products are transported across the entire nation.\nThe air transport of agricultural commodities proposed by Krishi Udan.\nAs a result, value realization (on agricultural items) would greatly increase, especially in the northeast and tribal areas.\n\nThe Transport and Marketing Assistance (TMA) programme aims to help with the marketing of agricultural products as well as the international portion of freight.\n\nKisan Rath mobile application (app) to allow transportation of foodgrains and perishables during the lockdown.\n\nConstraints of Transport and Marketing of Agricultural Produce\n\nThe primary flaws of the agricultural marketing system are addressed here.\n\nInsufficient Warehouses\nThe settlements lack adequate warehouse facilities. In order to store his goods, the farmer is forced to employ trenches, mud vessels, \u201cKutcha\u201d storehouses, etc. These illogical storage techniques result in a great deal of waste.\nThe amount of produce that goes bad and cannot be eaten by humans is about 1.5%. As a result, there is a significant increase in supply in the village market, which makes it difficult for the farmers to obtain a reasonable price for their goods.\nThe situation has improved to some extent after Central Warehousing Corporation and State Warehousing Corporation were established.\nLack of Standardization and Grading\nDifferent types of agricultural produce are not adequately graded. The \u201cDara\u201d sales practice, in which a large quantity of the produce of all grades is sold in a single lot, is the one that is most frequently used.\nAs a result, the farmer producing superior goods cannot be certain of receiving a higher price. Therefore, there is little motivation to use superior seeds or create superior kinds.\nExistence of a Large Number of Middlemen:\nThe agricultural market has a very extensive network of middlemen, which significantly reduces the share of farmers.\nMistakes in Unregulated Markets\nThe country still has a sizable number of unregulated markets. Arhatiyas and brokers take advantage of the farmers\u2019 ignorance and illiteracy to defraud them through unscrupulous methods.\nFarmers must pay the arhat (pledging charge) to the arhatiyas, the \u201ctulaii\u201d (weight charge) for weighing the produce, the \u201cpalledari\u201d (other miscellaneous types of allied work) to unload the bullock carts, the \u201cgarda\u201d (for impurities in the produce), and several other unspecified and undefined charges.\nLack of Market Information:\nIt is frequently impossible for farmers to learn the exact market pricing in various markets. As a result, they agree to pay whatever the traders offer.\nThe government often broadcasts market prices on radio and television to address this issue. The news publications also inform farmers of the most recent pricing adjustments.\nInadequate Credit Facilities:\nIndian farmers try to sell their products as soon as the crop is harvested even if the prices are quite low at that time due to their poverty.\nSteps taken to improve Transport and Marketing of Agricultural Produce\neNAM\n\nTo integrate all regulated wholesale produce marketplaces through a pan-India trade site, the government built the electronic national agriculture market (eNAM).\n\nAGMARKNET\n\nIt is an e-governance platform that makes it easier to generate and transmit pricing, as well as commodity arrival information from agricultural produce markets, and to swiftly and transparently disseminate such information online to farmers, consumers, dealers, and policymakers.\n\nKisan Credit Card Program\n\nTerm loans are offered for agricultural requirements.\n\nFormation and Promotion of Farmer Producer Organizations (FPOs)\n\nThis is to encourage specialization and better processing, marketing, branding, and export of agricultural produce. FPOs will be supported within the \u201cOne District One Product\u201d cluster.\n\nMIEWS Portal\n\nMarket Intelligence and Early Warning System to give farmers advice on how to avoid cyclical production and an early warning in cases of gluts.\n\nRead:\u00a0Agricultural Marketing Reforms: Model APMC Act and NAM\n\nRecent legislation related to the Storage, Transport and Marketing of Agricultural Produce\n\nRecent laws governing the storage, transportation, and marketing of agricultural products\n\nThe Centre recently passed three laws about agriculture, even though this is a State topic because trade and commerce are under its purview. As follows:\n\nFarm Services Act and Farmers (Empowerment and Protection) Agreement Act of 2020:\n\noutlines contract farming, in which farmers produce crops under contracts with corporate investors in exchange for a price that is mutually agreed upon.\n\nPromoting and Facilitating Farmers\u2019 Produce Trade and Commerce Act 2020 :\n\nliberates farmers by allowing them to sell wherever they want.\n\nAmendment to the Essential Commodities Act of 2020:\n\nto strike potatoes, onions, grains, pulses, oilseeds, and edible oils off the list of vital goods.\n\nConclusion\n\nThe largest industry in our nation is agriculture, followed by transportation. The national economy and these two businesses both rely on one another. Road transportation is essential for the distribution of agricultural products because it is the primary method of moving agricultural products from farms to markets and different urban neighborhoods. The farmer\u2019s earnings may be maximized if effective transportation infrastructure is in place and agricultural output is handled carefully.\n\nArticle written by: Aryadevi E S"

Government support for the production of renewable energy, organic farming, food processing, and product export promotion has already been observed. These all fall under the industrial policy.\n\nInstruments of Industrial Policy\u00a0\nTariffs, non-tariff barriers, and subsidies are used.\nTariffs are customs duty barriers used to shield a nation\u2019s domestic sector from outside competition. It unfairly inflates the price of imported goods while favoring domestic producers.\nSimilar to tariff barriers, quantitative restrictions (also known as non-tariff barriers) place limits on the number of imports by setting quotas. These two limits were rather tight before 1990.\u00a0\nNeed For an Industrial Policy\nIndustry knowledge spillover impacts the economy to a certain extent.

In other words, concentrating on one particular industry over time might lead to a whole industrial complex that benefits from mutual synergies and economies.\u00a0\n\u00a0When India gained its independence, the majority of its industries were nonexistent or in their infancy. They were unable to effectively utilize economies of scale or adopt new technologies. In this situation, early government protection is preferred so that a competitive industry can emerge afterward.\u00a0\nAn industry cannot exist or endure by itself. It needs other industries that supply it with raw materials at fair prices and levels of quality. The survival of this industry also depends on the existence of numerous other industries that will serve as consumers.\u00a0\n\u00a0A certain level of assurance in the future of the entire economy and that industry, in particular, is necessary for setting up an industry. Investors are reluctant since there is a legitimate risk involved. In the case of being the \u201cfirst mover\u201d in a recently opened sector, this risk and uncertainty are substantial.\u00a0\n\u00a0Contrarian arguments\nSpecial interests influence them in some way. In every economy, pressure organizations are vying for the government\u2019s resources. They attempt to persuade decision-makers to seize a larger than justifiable portion of natural and economic resources.\u00a0\nUncertainty exists in this regard.\u00a0Any industrial policy needs to anticipate future economic developments. Our experience has shown us that the economy is the hardest to anticipate, making planning and policymaking efforts frequently ineffective.\u00a0\nGovernment support affects pricing by distorting markets and production patterns. Prices serve as signals for both customers and producers, informing them of what to buy and make. Therefore, because of government protection and assistance, producers are unable to adopt new markets or technologies. This makes them uncompetitive.\u00a0\nAnother viewpoint, held by some notable economists, advocated for aiding India\u2019s traditionally labor-intensive handicraft industry and agro-economy (based on the Gandhian model). In this scenario, markets would handle heavy industries. However, the Mahalanobis model was chosen by the Congress government, and the discussion of this decision is still ongoing.\u00a0\nInstead, the Nehru Mahanaboli model required a lot of capital. At that period, there was a great attraction for heavy industry. Investment in heavy industry was encouraged by the development and high standard of living experienced by developed nations.\u00a0\nChanges in Industrial Policy\n\nBefore independence, India had no developed industrial sector. It was an agricultural nation where handicrafts gained an unparalleled level of supremacy. There are very few economic sectors that have grown into traditions that can be classified as having items made using the factory system in the 19th and 20th centuries.\n\nIn Independent India, the Parliament occasionally enacted different resolutions. Still, a historic change occurred in 1991 when India was obliged to open its economy to international competition and the government was forced to deregulate sectors to make room for private industry.\n\nHere are a few significant changes to the Indian industrial strategy.\n\nIndustrial Policy \u00a01948\n\nBoth the public and commercial sectors were involved in industrial growth in the 1948 Industrial Policy Resolution. As a result, the industries were split into four major groups:\n\n(a) Exclusive governmental monopoly \u2013 This pertains to the production of weapons and ammunition, the creation and management of atomic energy, as well as the ownership and operation of railway transportation.\n\n(b) Government Monopoly for New Units \u2013 This category includes coal, iron, and steel, shipbuilding, aircraft manufacturing, telegraph manufacturing, wireless device manufacturing (except radio receiving sets), mineral oils, and shipbuilding.\n\n(c) Regulation \u2013 This grouping includes sectors with such fundamental importance that the central government would consider it necessary to plan and regulate them.\n\n(d) Unregulated private enterprise: The private sector, both individual and cooperative, was allowed to operate in the industries in this category.\n\nResolution on Industrial Policy from 1956\n\nThis was done to give the mixed economy model and the socialist socialism doctrine a more tangible form. The entire industrial sector was divided into three Schedules by the Industrial Policy Resolution of 1956:\n\nSchedule A: The first category featured industries whose future development was solely the State\u2019s responsibility.\nSchedule B: Industries that were becoming increasingly state-owned and in which private firms were solely expected to support government initiatives were included in this category.\nSchedule C: The third group includes all industries that weren\u2019t listed in schedules A or B.\nSmall-Scale Sector: Several initiatives were suggested in the policy resolution to support the small sector.\nInvestment from abroad is permitted.\nThe 1969 Act Against Monopolistic and Restrictive Trade Practices\n\nThe controversial \u201clicense quota permit\u201d system was typified by this action. Before expanding or starting operations, companies with assets worth more than a certain amount were required to obtain approval or a license.\n\nIts goals were to:\n\nto forbid monopolistic and limiting business practices (except by the government)\nto avoid the monopolization of economic power by a select few\nto manage monopolies\nResolution on Industrial Policy from 1977\n\nThis resolution was the outcome of the center-level government shift. As a result, it placed more emphasis on cottage, small-scale, and village industries. This marked a shift in ideology from the Nehruvian-Mahalanobis school to the Gandhian school of economic growth.\n\nThis divided the tiny sector into the following three groups:-\n\na) Home and cottage enterprises, which offer several opportunities for independent work.\nb) A small industry with investments in industrial units with machinery and equipment up to Rs. 1 lakh that is located in towns with less than 50,000 residents\nc) Small-scale enterprises, which include industrial units with an investment of up to Rs. 10 lakh, and ancillaries with an investment of up to Rs. 15 lahks in fixed capital.\nResolution on Industrial Policy, 1980\n\nAfter making a comeback, Congress quickly reinstated its industrial strategy.\n\nThe main changes were:\n\nCertain goods designated for small-scale industries were taken from the reserve list.\nMany businesses and units were using more capacity than was permitted by law. These overflowing capacities were made regular.\nIt was possible to invest abroad with technology transfer.\nRegulations, licensing, and limits were loosened slightly, indicating a preference for the private sector.\n1991\u2019s New Industrial Policy\n\nThe industrial policy that has guided the nation\u2019s industrial growth since independence underwent a significant adjustment in 1991. The nation decided to adopt capitalism. According to the new system, planning shifted from \u201cimperative\u201d to \u201cindicative.\u201d\n\nL \u2013 Liberalization (Reduction of government control)\n\nP \u2013 Privatization (Increasing the role & scope of the private sector)\n\nG \u2013 Globalisation (Integration of the Indian economy with the world economy)\n\nThe New Industrial Policy\nIndustrial licensing policy \u2013 The New Industrial Policy abolished all industrial licensing, regardless of investment level, except a select group of 18 industries related to security and strategic concerns, social concerns, the use of hazardous chemicals, overriding environmental concerns, and luxury goods.\nPublic Sector Policy \u2013 The 1956 Resolution designated 17 industries as part of the public sector. This number decreased to 8 under the Industrial Policy of 1991. Currently, the government solely controls three sectors: 1) Atomic Energy 2) Atomic mineral mining 3) Rail Transportation\nReconstruction (BIFR), or other such high-level organizations developed for the purpose, of a social security mechanism will be established to safeguard the interests of workers who are likely to be impacted by such rehabilitation measures.\nPrivatization/disinvestment: The government declared its plan to offer mutual funds, financial institutions, the general public, and employees a portion of its ownership stake in public sector firms.\nLimitations on Monopolistic and Restrictive Trade Practices: All businesses categorized as MRTP firms under the Monopolistic and Restrictive Trade Practice Act have assets exceeding a particular threshold (Rs. 100 crores since 1985). Only certain industries were open to such firms, and even then, case-by-case clearance was required.\nPolicy on Technology Agreements and Foreign Investment: To automatically grant authorization for direct foreign investment up to 51 percent foreign equity, the New Industrial Policy identified a list of high technology and high investment priority industries.\nAbolishing Phased Manufacturing Programs for New Projects \u2013 These programs were designed to help develop indigenous technology.\nRemoval of Mandatory Convertible Provision \u2013 Before financial liberalization, the loan agreement with the borrower contained a mandatory convertible clause (industries in this case). This clause gave banks the freedom to turn any amount of their loans into equity at any time. This will change their status in that business from \u201clender\u201d to \u201cowner.\u201d The government utilized this clause as a tool to nationalize private businesses.\nRepercussions of New Policies\n\u201cLicense, Permit and Quota Raj\u201d was abolished in 1991 according to a new policy. Lowering administrative barriers to industrial expansion aimed to liberalize the economy.\nThe public sector\u2019s limited engagement lessened the burden on the government.\nThe policy included flexible licensing, the lifting of the asset cap on MRTP enterprises, easier access for foreign corporations, and privatization.\nAll of this led to more competition, which in turn led to decreased pricing for numerous things, including electronics. This led to both domestic and foreign investment in practically every industry that was made available to the private sector.\nSpecial export-boosting measures were made in the wake of the strategy. Export Export-oriented units, Export Processing Zones, Agri-Export Zones, Special Economic Zones, and most recently National Investment and Manufacturing Zones are ideas that have been used in the past. All these have benefitted the export sector of the country.\n\u00a0Limitations of\u00a0 India\u2019s industrial policies\nManufacturing Sector Stagnation: India\u2019s industrial policies haven\u2019t been able to boost the manufacturing sector, whose share of GDP has been hovering around 16% since 1991.\nIndustrial pattern distortions brought on by selective investment inflow: The slow pace of investment in many basic and strategic industries, such as engineering, power, machine tools, etc., is of concern.\nEmployment displacement Worker displacement resulted from the restructuring and modernization of industry as a result of the new industrial policy.\nLack of incentives to increase efficiency: Internal liberalization received more attention than trade policy reforms, which led to \u201cconsumption-led growth\u201d rather than \u201cinvestment- or export-led growth.\u201d\nVaguely defined industrial location policy: The New Industrial Strategy highlighted the negative impacts of environmental harm but failed to specify an industrial location policy that could guarantee the establishment of an industrial climate free from pollution.\nWay ahead\n\nSince 1991, industrial policies in India have shifted from being primarily socialist in 1956 to becoming capitalistic.\n\nIndia today has an industrial policy system that is much more liberalized, focusing on boosting foreign investment and reducing regulations.\nIn the 2018 World Bank Report on Doing Business, India was rated 77th. The Bankruptcy and Insolvency Act of 2017 and the Goods and Services Tax (GST) reforms are noteworthy and will benefit the manufacturing sector in the long run.\nMake in India and Startup India campaigns have improved the business environment in the nation.\nHowever, difficulties with lending, labor rules that result in high unit labor costs, political involvement, and other regulatory burdens remain obstacles to business expansion.\nA new Industrial Policy is required to strengthen the nation\u2019s manufacturing sector. The government should feel the necessity to unveil a new Industrial Policy that would serve as a guide for all commercial firms in the nation.\n\nArticle Written By: Atheena Fathima Riyas"

Levying and collecting direct taxes as well as developing other direct tax regulations fall within the purview of the Central Board of Direct Taxes.\n\nA taxpayer may be required to pay a direct tax to the government for several different reasons, including real estate taxes, personal property taxes, income taxes, asset taxes, gift taxes, capital gains taxes, and others. One of the government\u2019s two primary sources of income is direct taxation.\n\nThe other is indirect tax. Direct taxes generate around half of the government\u2019s revenue each fiscal year. The government sets fiscal year-specific goals for direct tax collection to raise income.\n\nExamples of Direct Tax\n\nExamples of direct tax include Income tax, corporation tax, minimum alternate tax, capital gain tax, securities transaction tax, commodities transaction tax, alternate minimum tax, estate duty, wealth tax, gift tax, and fringe benefit tax.\n\nINCOME TAX\nIncome tax is levied on individuals, Hindu undivided families, unregistered firms, and other groups of people.\nIn India, the income tax system is progressive.\nAll forms of income are aggregated and taxed by the individual\u2019s income tax brackets.\nDepending on the amount of net income, different rates of income tax are applied. For instance, if net taxable income is between Rs. 5 and 7.5 lakhs, an income tax of 10% is levied.\nThere is a 10% surcharge on income tax in cases when the total income is greater than Rs 50 lakh but not greater than Rs 1 crore.\n\nNote: Agricultural income is not subject to tax.\n\nCORPORATION TAX\nIt is a tax levied against the earnings of businesses and corporations. Additionally known as corporate tax.\nA company must pay a separate tax from its owner\u2019s income tax since it is recognized as a separate entity for tax purposes.\nBoth public and private companies that are registered in India under the Companies Act 1956 are required to pay corporation tax.\nAll domestic enterprises must pay corporation tax at a rate of 22% as of January 2022.\nMINIMUM ALTERNATE TAX\nBy utilizing the various incentives and exemptions made available by the Income-tax Act, businesses with high profits and sizable dividends to shareholders who were not paying corporate tax to the government were required to pay a set percentage of book profit as minimum alternate tax, according to the concept of Minimum Alternate Tax (MAT).\nAs a result, the government levies an advance tax on these companies called the Minimum Alternate Tax, or MAT. Businesses must therefore pay at least a specified amount of tax.\nAccording to the Income Tax Act, a portion of a company\u2019s booked earnings is automatically deemed taxable income, and tax is required if the company\u2019s taxable income is less than a specific percentage of those profits.\nThe rate of MAT is 15% as of January 2022.\nCAPITAL GAIN TAX\nAny profit or gain realized from the sale of a capital asset is referred to as a capital gain.\nTaxation is imposed on capital sale profits.\nCapital assets include things like land, structures, homes, jewelry, patents, and copyrights.\nA capital asset held for less than 36 months is referred to as a short-term capital asset.\nLong-term capital asset \u2013 An asset that has been held for longer than 36 months is referred to be a long-term capital asset.\nThe 36-month minimum for immovable property (land, buildings, and houses) has been lowered to 24 months as of FY 2017\u201318.\nFor instance, if you sell a house after owning it for 24 months, any income you receive if you do so after March 31, 2017, will be regarded as a long-term capital gain.\nTransportable items are free from this adjustment, though, including jewelry and mutual funds that invest in debt.\nThey will be categorized as long-term capital assets if held for some time greater than 36 months.\nDepending on the amount of income received, different capital gains taxes are applied to short- and long-term profits.\nSECURITIES TRANSACTION TAX\nGains on securities including shares, options, and futures traded on the domestic stock exchange are subject to a tax known as the securities transaction tax.\nIt is a direct tax that the federal government imposes and collects.\nDuring his tenure as finance minister, P. Chidambaram introduced the Securities Transaction Tax (STT) first in 2004.\nCOMMODITIES TRANSACTION TAX\nIn India, the exchange-traded non-agricultural commodity derivatives buyers and sellers are both subject to the commodity transaction tax.\nBased on the size of the contract, it is determined.\nCommodities covered by CTT include non-farm items including metals (gold, silver, and copper) and energy products (crude oil and natural gas).\nALTERNATE MINIMUM TAX\nAlternate Minimum Tax (AMT) is to limited liability partnerships what Minimum Alternate Tax (MAT) is to corporations.\nOther commercial entities, such as sole proprietorships, partnerships, and associations of people, are exempt from this tax.\nESTATE DUTY\nIt was initially presented in 1953. When a person passes away, it is imposed on all of their possessions.\nThe entire estate of the decedent is regarded as his wealth and is taxable.\nThe tax hasn\u2019t been in place since 1985.\nWEALTH TAX\nIt was initially shown in 1957.\nIndividuals, combined Hindu families, and companies with a surplus of net value were subject to it.\nWef 2015, the tax was abolished.\nGIFT TAX\nIt was initially released in 1958.\nThe only donations exempt from the gift tax were those made by public and private organizations that support charitable institutions.\nThe tax hasn\u2019t been collected since 1998.\nFRINGE BENEFITS TAX\nTo reduce the profit on booked entries, many businesses provide their staff with various bonuses and maintain them below their input cost.\nAs a result, there is less profit, which lowers government taxation.\nThe Fringe Benefits Tax (FBT), which is effectively a tax that an employer must pay instead of the benefits granted to his or her employees, was enacted by the government as a response to this.\nIt was an effort to tax all perks that were being used to avoid paying taxes.\nThe fringe benefits tax was eliminated in India\u2019s Union budget for 2009.\nAdvantages of Direct Tax\nEconomic Balance: To achieve economic and social balance, the government establishes tax brackets based on an individual\u2019s income and age. The tax rate is determined by the nation\u2019s economic situation. People are given exceptions to balance out economic inequalities.\nEnsures equality: For the government to help the poor and vulnerable in society, higher taxes must be paid by people and enterprises with higher profits. This keeps the economy in balance.\nGives Certainty: The direct tax gives both the government and the taxpayers confidence because both parties are aware of the exact amount of tax that must be paid and collected.\nAddresses inflation issues: In times of high inflation, the government boosts taxes to reduce demand for goods and services, which causes inflation to decline.\nMakes Government Accountable: People are aware that paying taxes is necessary. As a result, he or she is involved in the government\u2019s use of taxes and is aware of his or her rights. By doing this, accountability for the government is ensured.\nDisadvantages of Direct Tax\nCan be easily evaded: Not everybody wants to pay taxes. Some people are willing to file a false tax return to avoid paying taxes. These people can simply conceal their income since they are not subject to state law.\nTax slabs are arbitrary: If taxes are progressive, they are set at the Finance Minister\u2019s discretion. If it is proportional, it significantly burdens the underprivileged.\nObstructs growth: High taxes discourage people from investing and saving, which hurts the nation\u2019s economy. It harms enterprises and industries by impeding their expansion.\nInconvenience: A direct tax\u2019s major drawback is that it hurts the taxpayer. He senses that his hard-earned money has been stolen away when a large sum is taken from his pocket. Direct tax payment is therefore rather inconvenient.\nIndirect Tax\nIndirect taxes are levied against the party who will ultimately bear the financial burden of the tax through the use of an intermediary.\nThe taxpayer has the option to transfer it to another party.\nThe middleman creates a tax return and sends the government\u2019s tax revenue with it.\nIn this regard, an indirect tax is distinct from a direct tax, which is paid by the government directly to the people (whether legal or natural) who are subject to it.\nInstead of using a person\u2019s income, indirect taxes are calculated using their expenses.\nSuppliers of products and services are subject to indirect taxes, but consumers are ultimately responsible for paying them.\nExamples of Indirect Tax\n\nExamples of Indirect tax include customs duty, sales tax, excise duty, service tax, value-added tax, and dividend distribution tax.\n\nCUSTOMS DUTY\nCustoms duties are imposed as a tariff or fee when goods are transported across international borders.\nIts objective is to protect the nation\u2019s economy.\nUnder customs regulations, several different types of duties are levied, including Basic Duty, Countervailing Duty, Protective Duty, Anti-Dumping Duty, and Export Duty.\nImport taxes are used to control business as well as to bring in money for the government.\nAd valorem calculations are used in India to determine import taxes.\nA national indirect tax known as GST (Goods and Services Tax) is levied on the production, sale, and consumption of goods and services.\nAll indirect taxes imposed on products and services by the federal and state governments have been replaced by it.\nSALES TAX\nA sales tax in India is a sort of tax that the government imposes on the sale or purchase of a certain good inside the nation.\nBoth the federal government and the state governments impose a sales tax.\nIGST has since taken its place.\nEXCISE DUTY\nExcise duty is a commodities tax in the true sense of the word because it is levied on the production of goods rather than their sale in India.\nThe federal government levies a clear excise duty on all goods except alcoholic beverages and illegal drugs.\nCGST has since taken its position.\nSERVICE TAX\nAll rendered services in India are subject to a service tax.\nA service tax was introduced in 1994\u20131995 on three services: stockbroking, general insurance, and telephone services.\nSince then, the service net has been wider as new services are added every year. We now have an exclusion criterion known as a \u201cnegative list,\u201d where certain services are not included in the tax net.\nBefore being replaced by the Goods and Services Tax, the service tax rate in India was 15%.\nVALUE ADDED TAX\nBecause of the way it is designed, the VAT does away with distortions.\nAs a result, VAT has been imposed in all of India\u2019s states and union territories (except UTs of Andaman Nicobar and Lakshadweep).\nThe state determines the amount of the tax, which is levied on a range of goods sold in the state.\nState Sales Tax had been replaced with State VAT, which was in effect until July 1, 2017.\nSGST has since taken its position.\nDIVIDEND DISTRIBUTION TAX\nA dividend is a payment made from a company\u2019s profits in a certain year to its stockholders. Dividends are income in the eyes of the shareholders, hence they ought should ideally be taxable.\nThe amount of dividends given to shareholders is the basis for the tax that the Indian government imposes on Indian firms.\nWhen DDT was originally made available in 1997, it was governed under Section 115 O of the Income Tax Act.\nIn Budget 2020, the Finance Minister got rid of the Dividend Distribution Tax.\nNow that corporations are no longer required to pay dividend taxes, individuals must.\nAdvantages of Indirect Tax\nEveryone can contribute: Indirect taxes are levied on everyone who purchases a product, unlike income taxes, which are paid by some income groups but not by others. Tourists and persons from lower socioeconomic backgrounds who are not employed in India must pay it because they will buy items in some capacity.\nIndirect Taxes are convenient: They are quite practical when it comes to collecting indirect taxes. Customers do not feel forced to spend such small amounts even though taxes may be extremely cheap. Additionally, they are an affordable fee that is included in the cost of the goods sold.\nThey are unavoidable: Indirect taxes cannot be avoided because they are part of the product\u2019s price. Anyone who buys the good will therefore be liable for the tax.\nThey cover a wide range: The consumer will notice and suffer greatly if a service or product is heavily taxed on only one characteristic. Because they are applied to more products and are paid in smaller sums in this situation, indirect taxes may be favorable.\nDisadvantages of Indirect Taxes\nIndirect taxes have the potential to be regressive: It can be argued that it is unfair to the poor because everyone pays the same indirect tax. Indirect tax is imposed on all purchases, and while the wealthy may be able to pay it, the poor will also be responsible for it. Indirect taxes may therefore be viewed as regressive.\nThey are inflationary in effect: The precise percentage of tax that applies to every item that a seller sells might not always be possible to calculate and collect. To ensure that every customer pays the indirect tax, they purposely charge more than the tax amount. But over time, this drives up the cost of commodities.\nThey do not raise civic consciousness: Because they are buried in the price, millions of people who pay indirect taxes aren\u2019t even aware that they are doing it, which lowers civic consciousness.\n\nAlso read: Tax buoyancy\n\nDifference Between Direct and Indirect Taxes\n\u00a0 Parameter\n\t\nDirect Tax\n\t\nIndirect Tax\n\n\nMeaning\n\t\nLevied directly on the individuals or corporations.\n\t\nLevied on one entity but is passed on to the final consumer\n\n\nIncidence\n\t\nThe incidence and impact of the direct tax fall on the same person.\n\t\nThe incidence and impact of the tax fall on different persons.\n\n\nNature\n\t\nProgressive\n\t\nRegressive\n\n\nAdministrative Cost\n\t\nHigher\n\t\nLower\n\n\nTax Evasion\n\t\nPossible\n\t\nNot possible\n\n\nExamples\n\t\nIncome Tax, Wealth Tax, and Corporation Tax.\n\t\nExcise duty, VAT, entertainment tax, Customs Duty, GST\nCess and Surcharge\n\nThe Union Government imposes cess and surcharges as taxes to generate revenue for administrative costs. Even though cess and surcharge increase the government\u2019s revenue, they differ in many ways.\n\nCess\nIn its most basic form, a cess is a levy on tax.\nIt is crucial to keep in mind that a cess may only be used for the intended purpose.\nFor instance, the Indian government only utilizes money collected from an education cess for education.\nFurthermore, all taxpayers must pay this tax.\nTo the Consolidated Fund of India, cess taxes are paid.\nIn general, cess is anticipated to be levied up until the government has a strong enough reason to do so and to disappear after that reason has been achieved.\nSince a cess is imposed in addition to the present tax, it differs from other taxes like excise duty and income tax (tax on tax).\nFor instance, adding a 5% education tax to a 20% income tax will increase the entire tax to 21%. (20% base tax + an additional 5% cess).\nThe main cesses that are currently in effect are those for education, roads, infrastructure, clean energy, Krishi Kalyan, and Swachh Bharat.\nSurcharge\nIndividuals with net taxable salaries of more than Rs 1 crore are subject to a 10% surcharge on their tax obligations.\nIf net income is between Rs 1 crore and Rs 10 crore, domestic corporations must pay a surcharge of 5%. 10% of the net revenue over Rs 10 crore is subject to a surcharge.\nIf the net income is between Rs 1 crore and Rs 10 crore, a 2% surcharge is imposed on international firms.\nThe surcharge is raised to 5% if the net income surpasses Rs 10 cr. If the net income surpasses Rs 1 crore and Rs 10 crore, both domestic and foreign enterprises receive a margin of relief.\nA tax surcharge on income is a significant source of funding for the state.\nThe Union Government may use this money for any purpose it sees fit.\nIt\u2019s important to note that just the tax that must be paid, not the entire income, is covered.\nThe Consolidated Fund of India receives this payment, which may be used for any purpose.\n\nA 10 percent surcharge on a 30 percent income tax rate, for example, brings the tax burden to 33 percent.\n\nBenefits of Taxes\n\nDifferent types of taxes in India are intended to give the government money for expenditure while preventing inflation. Various types of income, including wages, business profits, rental income from real estate, and others, are subject to taxation.\n\nWealth taxes, sales taxes, property taxes, payroll taxes, value-added taxes, service taxes, and so on are additional taxes.\n\nTypes of taxes in India are used by the government for several things, including:\n\nPublic sector investment for infrastructure\nprojects for welfare and development\nDefense budget\nUsing data from scientific studies, public insurance\nGovernment and state workers get a range of pay.\nthe running of the public transportation network of the government\nUnemployment benefits\npension schemes\nthe application of the law\n\nExamples of public utilities include systems for managing garbage, water, electricity, and public health.\n\nConclusion\n\nDifferent types of taxes in India therefore have both benefits and drawbacks, but there is no denying that they are necessary to raise money. While the wealthy can pay direct taxes, the poor have the chance to make a small contribution through indirect taxes.\n\nThere is a lot of potential to change things by controlling these tax systems. These factors make a nation\u2019s taxation system crucial to its economy.\n\nRead:\u00a0Tax buoyancy\n\nArticle written by: Remya"

The country is improving access to clean water, sanitation, and affordable clean energy.\nIndia has also boosted access to social protection for vulnerable sections of society, especially during and after the pandemic, with a 9.8 percent increase in the budgetary allocation to the Social Services sector in 2021-22 over 2020-21.\nHuman Development in India\n\nHuman development in India remains a dynamic and evolving process. The government, civil society, and international organizations continue to work towards addressing disparities, enhancing access to basic services, and improving the overall well-being of its diverse population.\n\nChallenges such as poverty, healthcare access, and education quality require ongoing efforts and policy initiatives.\n\nHealth\n\nIndia has made significant progress in increasing life expectancy. Factors such as reduced child mortality rates and advancements in healthcare have contributed to longer life expectancies.\nChallenges in Healthcare: Despite progress, India faces challenges in providing equitable healthcare access to all citizens. Disparities in healthcare infrastructure and services exist between urban and rural areas.\nPublic Health Concerns: India faces health challenges related to communicable diseases (e.g., tuberculosis), non-communicable diseases (e.g., diabetes), and maternal and child health. Malnutrition remains a significant concern, particularly among children.\n\nEducation\n\nIncrease in Literacy Rates: India has made notable progress in increasing literacy rates, with a particular focus on improving female literacy. Government initiatives like \u201cSarva Shiksha Abhiyan\u201d have aimed to provide universal elementary education.\nQuality of Education: While there have been improvements in enrollment, concerns remain regarding the quality of education, school infrastructure, and access to higher education. Disparities in educational outcomes persist.\n\nEconomic development\n\nEconomic Growth: India has experienced rapid economic growth over the past few decades, contributing to increased income levels and reduced poverty rates.\nIncome Inequality: Income inequality remains a challenge, with significant disparities between urban and rural areas, and among different states and regions.\n\nGender equality\n\nWomen\u2019s Empowerment: There have been advances in women\u2019s empowerment, including increased participation in the workforce and political representation. Gender-based violence and discrimination, however, continue to be concerns.\nFemale Education: Promoting female education is considered a key factor in advancing gender equality.\n\nAccessibility\n\nClean Water and Sanitation: Efforts have been made to improve access to clean drinking water and sanitation facilities, but disparities still exist, particularly in rural areas.\nHousing and Infrastructure: Access to adequate housing and infrastructure services like electricity and roads varies widely across the country.\n\nCultural plurality\n\nIndia\u2019s rich cultural diversity and pluralism contribute to the country\u2019s human development. However, issues related to social exclusion, caste-based discrimination, and religious tensions persist.\n\nUrbanization\n\nRapid urbanization has posed both opportunities and challenges, with urban areas experiencing greater access to services and economic opportunities, but also facing issues like overcrowding and environmental pollution.\nGovernment programs like \u201cMGNREGA\u201d aim to improve rural livelihoods and infrastructure.\n\nSustainable development\n\nIndia is increasingly focusing on sustainable development, addressing environmental issues, and promoting renewable energy sources to combat climate change.\nEconomic development vs Human development\n\nEconomic development and human development are related but distinct concepts often used to assess a country\u2019s progress and well-being. In the case of India, both dimensions have seen significant advancements, but challenges remain.\n\nEconomic development primarily focuses on the growth of a nation\u2019s economy and the improvement of material well-being.\nHuman development goes beyond economic indicators and encompasses broader aspects of well-being, including health, education, and quality of life.\n\nThe disparity between human development and economic development in India is a complex issue with multiple contributing factors.\n\nWhile India has experienced significant economic growth in recent decades, improvements in human development indicators, such as education, healthcare, and living standards, have not kept pace.\n\nInequality: India grapples with high levels of income and wealth inequality. Economic growth has disproportionately benefited certain segments of the population, leading to a widening wealth gap. This inequality can limit access to quality education, healthcare, and other essential services for a large portion of the population.\nHealthcare Disparities: Despite economic growth, access to quality healthcare remains limited in many parts of India, especially in rural areas. High out-of-pocket healthcare expenses can push families into poverty, and preventable diseases continue to affect a significant portion of the population.\nEducation: While India has made strides in increasing literacy rates, the quality of education remains a concern. A large number of children attend schools with inadequate infrastructure, underqualified teachers, and outdated curricula. This affects the overall development and employability of the workforce.\nGender Disparities: Gender inequality continues to hinder human development in India. Discrimination against women and girls in terms of access to education, healthcare, and employment opportunities limits their contribution to the workforce and overall development.\nMalnutrition and Food Security: Malnutrition remains a critical issue in India, particularly among children. Poor nutrition during the early years of life can have long-term impacts on physical and cognitive development.\nSanitation and Clean Water: Access to clean drinking water and sanitation facilities is uneven across India. Poor sanitation and lack of access to clean water can lead to health issues and hinder human development.\nSocial and Cultural Factors: Deep-rooted cultural norms and social hierarchies can perpetuate disparities in access to education, healthcare, and economic opportunities. Discrimination based on caste, ethnicity, and religion can limit the development prospects of marginalized groups.\nRegional Disparities: India is a vast and diverse country with significant regional disparities in human development. States in the southern and western regions tend to have better human development indicators compared to states in the northern and eastern regions.\nGovernment Priorities: The allocation of government resources and policy priorities can affect human development outcomes. Shifts in public spending and policy focus are necessary to address disparities.\nInfrastructure Gaps: Inadequate infrastructure, including transportation, electricity, and digital connectivity, can limit economic opportunities and access to services in rural and remote areas.\nWay forward\n\nIndia\u2019s international contributions to sustainable development continue to grow.\n\nA leader of the International Solar Alliance and the Coalition for Disaster-Resilient Infrastructure, India is a champion of South-South cooperation and emerged as a major global supplier of COVID-19 vaccines and medicines.\nIndia\u2019s climate leadership is demonstrated by its ambitious targets and commitment to net zero by 2070.\n\nThe world\u2019s largest democracy is also fast-tracking the implementation and monitoring of the SDGs at the national and sub-national levels to meet the ambitious goals.\n\nAddressing the gap between economic development and human development in India requires a multifaceted approach that addresses the social, economic, and cultural factors contributing to disparities.\n\nIt involves targeted investments in healthcare, education, and social welfare programs, along with efforts to promote gender equality and reduce inequality. Additionally, regional and local disparities need to be addressed through tailored development strategies.\n\nPrevious year question\n\nQ.

From being considered a \u2018developing country\u2019 for decades, India has emerged as one of the world\u2019s fastest-growing major economies. The journey has been characterized by landmark reforms, robust GDP growth, and a shift from agrarian dominance to a diversified economy.\n\nWhen we study the economic development of India, we need to grasp the complexities of India\u2019s economic evolution. The 1991 economic liberalization marked a turning point, dismantling the License Raj and opening doors to foreign investment. This period underscores the significance of pragmatic policymaking, as it laid the foundation for subsequent growth.\n\nHowever, challenges such as poverty, unemployment, and income inequality persist. We must engage ourselves with evolving strategies to address these issues, such as the \u2018Make in India\u2018 initiative, the Goods and Services Tax (GST), and initiatives for financial inclusion like the Pradhan Mantri Jan Dhan Yojana.\n\nSocial Development: Empowering India\u2019s Diversity\n\nWhile economic progress is vital, sustainable development is incomplete without social inclusivity. We need to understand the intricacies of India\u2019s diverse social fabric is paramount.\n\nInclusive Governance\n\nThe Indian Constitution\u2019s emphasis on social justice has paved the way for transformative policies. Social development initiatives like the Mahatma Gandhi National Rural Employment Guarantee Act (MGNREGA) have provided a safety net for rural citizens, tackling both poverty and unemployment. Moreover, the Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes (Prevention of Atrocities) Act underscores the commitment to protecting marginalized communities.\n\nGender Equality\n\nPromoting gender equality is an integral part of India\u2019s social development narrative. Initiatives like the Beti Bachao, and Beti Padhao campaign aim to bridge gender gaps in education and employment. Additionally, the representation of women in local governance through Panchayati Raj Institutions showcases the role of grassroots democracy in empowering women.\n\nSynergy Between Economic and Social Development\n\nThe intricate interplay between economic and social development is undeniable. A growing economy provides the necessary resources to fund social welfare programs, while an empowered populace becomes a potent driver of economic growth.\n\nAdministrators must focus on improving the education system and skill development initiatives. The \u2018Digital India\u2019 campaign, coupled with the National Skill Development Mission, aligns with this vision, aiming to equip the youth with 21st-century skills.\n\nHealthcare forms the bedrock of a productive society. Schemes like Ayushman Bharat exemplify the integration of economic and social priorities, offering financial protection during medical emergencies while improving the overall health index of the nation.\n\nSustainable Development\n\nSustainable development is the compass guiding the nation\u2019s journey towards a future that balances economic progress with environmental stewardship and social inclusivity.\n\nAt its core, sustainable development is about meeting the needs of the present without compromising the ability of future generations to meet their own needs.\n\nIn India\u2019s context, it\u2019s an approach that seeks to balance economic growth with environmental protection and social equity.\n\nEnvironmental Conservation: A Prerequisite for Progress\n\nIndia\u2019s natural beauty and biodiversity are invaluable assets. Sustainable development recognizes the need to preserve these resources for current and future generations. Initiatives like afforestation, wildlife conservation, and renewable energy adoption reflect the nation\u2019s commitment to reducing its carbon footprint.\n\nSocial Inclusivity: Leaving No One Behind\n\nSustainability isn\u2019t just about protecting the planet; it\u2019s also about uplifting people. Inclusion lies at the heart of this endeavour. Programs that ensure access to education, healthcare, and economic opportunities for all segments of society contribute to a more equitable future.\n\nEconomic Growth with a Green Tint\n\nIndia\u2019s economic aspirations are intertwined with sustainability. The push for green technologies, clean energy, and circular economy practices is not just environmentally responsible; it\u2019s economically prudent.

India\u2019s path to prosperity is intricately linked with its commitment to preserving its environment, uplifting its people, and embracing responsible growth. By fostering a holistic approach that weaves together economic, environmental, and social well-being, India is sowing the seeds for a future where development thrives without compromising the planet or leaving anyone behind.\n\nRead more about sustainable development\u2026\n\nPoverty\n\nAmidst the vibrant colours, rich culture, and dynamic progress, India grapples with a persistent challenge: poverty.\n\nThere are families struggling to make ends meet, children missing out on education, and individuals lacking access to basic healthcare. Poverty transcends mere economics; it impacts human dignity and potential.\n\nCauses and Complexity\n\nPoverty rates are generally higher in rural areas compared to urban areas. Rural poverty is often linked to factors such as limited job opportunities and inadequate access to education and healthcare.\n\nPoverty\u2019s roots are deep and intertwined with various factors:\n\nUnemployment: Lack of job opportunities, especially in rural areas, leads to income instability.\nUnderemployment: Many are trapped in low-paying, unstable jobs that fail to provide a decent living.\nLack of Education: Illiteracy perpetuates poverty by limiting access to better job prospects.\nHealthcare Disparities: Poor health leads to decreased productivity and increased medical expenses.\nSocial Discrimination: Marginalized communities face limited opportunities due to societal biases.\nImpacts on Society\n\nThe impact of poverty extends beyond individual lives:\n\nEducation Gap: Poverty often denies children access to education, perpetuating the cycle.\nHealthcare Challenges: Poor living conditions and inadequate nutrition lead to health issues.\nCrime and Unrest: Poverty can contribute to social unrest and criminal activities.\nInequality: The gap between the rich and the poor widens, affecting social cohesion.\nGovernment Initiatives: A Ray of Hope\n\nThe Indian government recognizes the urgency of addressing poverty and has introduced several initiatives to tackle the issue:\n\nNational Rural Employment Guarantee Act (NREGA): Provides employment opportunities in rural areas, aiding income stability.\nPradhan Mantri Awas Yojana (PMAY): Aims to provide affordable housing for urban and rural poor.\nJan Dhan Yojana: Financial inclusion program to ensure access to banking services.\nMid-Day Meal Scheme: Provides nutritious meals in schools, boosting attendance and health.\nCivil Society and Non-Governmental Efforts\n\nNumerous NGOs and grassroots organizations work tirelessly to combat poverty. Their efforts include education programs, vocational training, healthcare initiatives, and community development projects.\n\nTowards a Brighter Future\n\nThe road to eradicating poverty is challenging, but progress is evident:\n\nEconomic Growth: India\u2019s growing economy can create more jobs and opportunities.\nEducation Focus: Emphasis on education can break the cycle of poverty.\nSocial Programs: Effective implementation of social welfare programs can uplift marginalized communities.\n\nPoverty is a complex issue that requires multidimensional solutions. India\u2019s journey towards prosperity involves addressing unemployment, inequality, and access to basic services. By weaving social and economic safety nets, fostering education, and supporting inclusive policies, we can create a society where every individual has the opportunity to escape the clutches of poverty and live a life of dignity and promise.\n\nRead more about poverty in India\u2026\n\nInclusion\n\nInclusion is the act of ensuring that every individual, regardless of their background, enjoys equal rights and opportunities.\n\nThe concept of inclusion forms the bedrock of India\u2019s ethos.\n\nIn this post, we delve into the concept of inclusion in the Indian context, exploring its significance, challenges, and strides forward.\n\nEqual Access to Opportunities\n\nIn a truly inclusive economy, everyone has an unobstructed path to opportunities. From education to entrepreneurship, access must be unrestricted by gender, caste, religion, or socio-economic background. When barriers are dismantled, a more diverse and skilled workforce emerges, propelling innovation and economic growth.\n\nFinancial Inclusion\n\nInclusion in the economic realm extends to financial accessibility. Programs like the Jan Dhan Yojana have brought millions into the formal banking system, giving them a chance to save, invest, and plan for the future. This empowerment contributes to poverty reduction and economic stability.\n\nSocial Cohesion\n\nInclusion in society fosters a sense of belonging and shared purpose. When individuals from different walks of life interact, understanding deepens, and prejudices weaken. This kind of cohesion is crucial in a country as diverse as India, where unity amidst diversity is a national strength.\n\nEmpowerment of Marginalized Communities\n\nInclusion takes on a transformative role when it empowers marginalized communities. Affirmative action policies and targeted programs uplift those historically left behind, creating a more equitable social landscape. Empowerment through education, skill development, and access to resources bridges gaps and drives social progress.\n\nGender Disparities\n\nDespite progress, gender disparities remain a challenge. Women\u2019s access to education, employment, and decision-making roles is often limited. Inclusive policies that promote gender equality are vital to harnessing the full potential of society and the economy.\n\nRural-Urban Divide\n\nThe rural-urban divide in India reflects uneven access to opportunities and services. Inclusive development means bridging this gap, ensuring that the benefits of progress reach every corner of the nation.\n\nEducation for All\n\nInclusion starts with education. Every child, regardless of background, deserves access to quality education. This prepares them to be active contributors to the economy and informed citizens in society.\n\nEmployment Opportunities\n\nPromoting inclusion in the economy involves creating job opportunities that accommodate diverse skill sets. Inclusive workplaces that value diversity foster innovation and productivity.\n\nInclusion isn\u2019t just a concept; it\u2019s a commitment to building a society and economy that leaves no one behind. As India marches towards its goals of economic growth and social progress, the thread of inclusion must be woven through every policy, program, and initiative.\n\nInclusion ensures that every voice matters, every talent is nurtured, and every dream is achievable. It\u2019s not just about unity in diversity; it\u2019s about unity in progress.\n\nRead more about inclusion\u2026\n\nDemographics\n\nIndia, a land of unparalleled diversity and cultural richness, is equally fascinating when it comes to its demographics.\n\nDemographics, the study of a population\u2019s composition, characteristics, and trends, unveils a vivid tapestry of people, languages, religions, and aspirations. In this post, we\u2019ll journey through India\u2019s demographics, exploring its unique features and the transformative shifts that shape its future.\n\nPopulation Diversity: Unity in Multiplicity\n\nIndia\u2019s population is a melting pot of various ethnicities, languages, religions, and traditions.

Read here to learn more about PPIs.\n\nThe RBI has been steadfastly trying to establish a digital payment system environment to attain a less cash-efficient economy ever since the enactment of the Payment and Settlement System Act in 2007.\n\nAlthough traditional bank products like debit cards, credit cards, and net banking have not been ignored in this process, the RBI has made a significant effort to promote prepaid payment instruments (PPI).\n\nPPI is a relatively newer category of payment instruments that are already well-accepted in many developed nations like the United States and Europe.\n\nTable of Contents\n\nPrepaid Payment Instruments (PPIs)\nTypes of Prepaid Payment Instruments\nClosed system\nSemi-closed system\nOpen system\nWho can issue PPIs?\nAdvantages of Prepaid Payment Instruments\nDrawbacks\nRecent news on PPIs\nConclusion\nPrepaid Payment Instruments (PPIs)\n\nPrepaid payment instruments, often known as prepaid cards or stored value cards, were first produced as paper gift cards or certificates in the USA in the 1970s.\n\nThe US telecom sector later used single-purpose (or closed loop/system) prepaid cards that were exclusively valid at a particular merchant location in the 1980s.\nLarge retail chains came after them in the early 1990s.\nBut up to that point, there were no indications of any prepaid cards with multiple uses.\n\nPrepaid Payment Instruments (PPIs), sometimes referred to as prepaid cards or stored value cards in several nations, are specific tools that make it easier to buy products and services using the money they have on hand.\n\n\ud83d\udc49 Which year are YOU targeting for success in the IAS/IPS/IFS Exam? \ud83d\ude80\n\n(1) \u21d2 UPSC 2025: Prelims cum Mains\n\n(2) \u21d2 UPSC 2026: Prelims cum Mains\n\n(3) \u21d2 UPSC 2027 Prelims cum Mains\n\nTip: Know more about ClearIAS Courses (Online/Offline)\n\nThe value kept in these instruments is the cash, a debit from the holder\u2019s bank account (via a debit card or net banking), or any credit card used to make the purchase.\nPPIs can come in the form of payment wallets, smart cards, magnetic chips, vouchers, mobile wallets, etc. Any instrument that can be used to access a prepaid amount is a PPI.\n\nRBI as per the guidelines provided under the Payment and Settlement Act, 2005 defined Prepaid Payment Instruments (PPIs) as instruments of payment that facilitate buying of goods and services, including the transfer of funds, financial services,s and remittances, against the value stored within or on the instrument.\n\nCash loading of PPIs is limited to Rs 50,000 per month.\nOnly those companies incorporated in India and have a minimum paid-up capital of Rs. 5 crore and minimum positive net worth of Rs. 1 crore are permitted to issue PPIs in India.\nTypes of Prepaid Payment Instruments\n\nAccording to the RBI, PPIs in the country can be issued under three systems. They are as follows:\n\nClosed system\n\nThe closed system is one in which a PPI is only valid when used for purchases made by the company that issued it in the first place.\n\nWhen a person tries to purchase goods or services from a different supplier, the usage of such a PPI will be invalid.\nAdditionally, this approach does not permit cash withdrawals about the PPI balance.\nThe issue of such PPIs does not require previous RBI permission since the RBI has not categorized this PPI system as a payment system.\nExamples of a closed system PPI are paper vouchers or gift vouchers and coupons; it also will include smart cards that can only be used in the establishments that issue them such as metro railcards and chips.\nSemi-closed system\n\nPPIs issued under the semi-closed system, as opposed to PPIs issued under the closed system, can be used at certain but not all institutions.\n\nUnder this structure, the RBI may only license non-banking entities or banking institutions to issue PPIs.\nWithout prior clearance or authorization from the RBI, PPIs cannot be issued.\nThey can be used for purchases, remittance services, and other transactions at a variety of clearly specified retailers, either by location or at particular businesses that have agreements with the PPIs\u2019 issuers to accept them as payment.\nSuch a contract does not have to be made directly between the issuer and the business taking PPI as a form of payment; it may instead be made through a payment aggregator or payment gateway.\nPPIs issued under the semi-closed system are not permitted to assist cash withdrawals, much like PPIs issued under the closed system. Whether a bank issued the PPI or not makes no difference.\n\nThere are further types of semi-closed PPIs:\n\nMinimum detail PPI is the type in that only the bare minimum details of the holder of the PPI are obtained. The maximum amount of money that may be loaded on the PPI is up to Rs 10,000.\nLoading only from a bank account where the PPI can only be loaded via the bank account and not through any other means such as cash etc.\nFull KYC PPI where full KYC of the PPI holder has been obtained and registered by the PPI issuer and the maximum limit of money that can be loaded onto the instrument increases to Rs 1 lakh.\nOpen system\n\nUnder this approach, only financial institutions that have received RBI approval may offer PPIs.\n\nThese tools may be used to make purchases, remit money, withdraw cash, etc. easier.\nDebit cards and credit cards are two instances of PPIs issued under this scheme.\nWho can issue PPIs?\n\nPPIs can be issued by banks and non-banks after obtaining approval from the RBI.\n\nThe following criteria must be satisfied by non-banking organizations, such as businesses, for them to be qualified to issue PPIs:\n\nThe business must be set up in India.\nThe company\u2019s minimum paid-up capital must be greater than Rs 5 crore.\nThere must always be a minimum of Rs 1 crore in positive net worth.\n\nAny financial institution that satisfies the eligibility requirements stipulated by the RBI is permitted to issue PPIs.\n\nBut only banks with the RBI\u2019s approval may introduce mobile-based PPIs when it comes to offering mobile banking transactions.\n\nNon-Banking Financial Institutions and other businesses are only permitted to issue PPIs in a closed or semi-closed system.\n\nMobile-based PPIs are included in this. The sole prerequisite for non-banking businesses to issue PPIs is that they must keep an escrow account with any designated commercial banks in the nation.\nAdvantages of Prepaid Payment Instruments\nPrepaid payment instruments are often supplied with the barest minimum of requirements.\nThese tools may be utilized effortlessly at merchant sites and come in the form of tangible coupons or plastic cards (like debit or credit cards).\nIt saves time at public spaces like metro ticket counters and grocery marts with quick payments.\nIt substitutes the need for physical cash.\nPrepaid travel cards which are some open system payment instruments are immensely helpful in case of cross-border travel as these are generally issued by international card companies in association with banks.\nDrawbacks\nA prepaid payment instrument is not a debit card and hence not linked to any bank account. As a result, the balance stored in it does not attract any interest.\nAs with any digital system, PPIs are also susceptible to hacking and related security threats.\nRecent news on PPIs\n\nAn RBI-appointed committee has recommended that RBI should examine the extension of Deposit Insurance and Credit Guarantee Corporation (DICGC) cover to Prepaid\u00a0Payment Instruments. Presently, it is available only for bank deposits.\n\nDICGC is an RBI subsidiary, that provides deposit insurance coverage to various types of deposits, including savings, fixed, current, recurring, and accrued interest.\nThe limit of insurance is up to a maximum of Rs 5 lakh for both principal and interest amounts held by them.\nCovers commercial banks i.e., local area banks, payments banks, small finance banks, regional rural banks, and cooperative banks.\nConclusion\n\nDemonetization has unexpectedly given all digital channels of commerce an impetus. Even after re-monetization, these instruments, and more especially PPIs (mostly semi-closed m-wallets), have continued to expand, which strongly shows that the Indian public is coming to embrace these payment methods.\n\nThis is because a variety of variables, such as various types of prepaid payment instruments, are speeding up the expanding acceptance of digital forms of transactions.\n\nTo create India a more cashless, digital economy, the government is acting very aggressively. A speedier adoption of all digital payment methods, including PPIs, has been made possible by the introduction of new instruments and the easing of current regulations.\n\nSecurity, however, appears to be a major concern for quality transactions.\n\n-Article written by Swathi Satish"

Like with any stock investment, foreign portfolio investors often expect to see a return on their funds very quickly.\nBecause securities are frequently traded, the liquidity of portfolio assets makes them easier to sell than direct investments.\nPortfolio investments are far more accessible to the average investor since they need substantially less investment capital and due diligence than direct investments.\n\nFPI is part of a country\u2019s capital account and is shown on its Balance of Payments (BOP).\n\nIn India, foreign portfolio investment is regulated by the Securities and Exchange Board of India (SEBI).\n\nFPI in India refers to investment groups or FIIs (foreign institutional investors) and QFIs (qualified foreign investors).\nSEBI has introduced the Foreign Portfolio Investors Regulations, 2019.\nFPIs also need to follow the Income-tax Act, of 1961 and the Foreign Exchange Management Act, of 1999.\n\nOne can register FPI in one of the below categories:\n\nCategory I (low risk): This includes investors from the Government sector. Such as central banks, Governmental agencies, and international or multilateral organizations or agencies.\n\nCategory II (moderate risk): Regulated broad-based funds such as mutual funds, investment trusts, and insurance/reinsurance companies. It also includes regulated banks, asset management companies, portfolio managers, investment advisors, and managers.\n\nCategory III (high risk): It includes those who are not eligible in the first two categories. It includes endowments, charitable societies, charitable trusts, foundations, corporate bodies, trusts, and individuals.\n\nAn individual must fulfill the following conditions to register as FPI:\n\nAs per the Income-tax Act 1961, the applicant should not be a non-resident Indian\nShould not be a citizen of a country that falls under the public statement of FATF.\nMust be eligible to invest in securities outside the country.\nTo invest in securities, he/she must have the approval of the MOA / AOA / Agreement.\nA certificate that grants the applicant holds an interest in the development of the securities market.\nIn case the bank is the applicant, it must belong to a nation whose central bank is a member of the Bank for International Settlements.\nFactors and Risks Related to FPI\n\nHere are some factors affecting Foreign Portfolio Investment:\n\nFuture Prospects: A nation\u2019s economy is key to attracting international investment. Investors are more likely to invest in a nation\u2019s financial assets if its economy is strong and expanding. Investors, on the other hand, tend to sell their investments if the nation experiences financial instability or a recession.\nRates of Interest: A high return on investment is what investors seek. As a result, investors like investing in nations with high-interest rates.\nRates of Tax: Capital gains are subject to taxation. The return on investment is decreased by higher tax rates. As a result, investors like investing in nations with lower tax rates.\n\nForeign Portfolio Investments have some risks associated with them \u2013 for both the investors and the destination country. Here are a few risks involved in it:\n\nExposure to Political Risk: Political risk might arise as a result of the altered political climate. As a result, economic policies, repatriation laws, and investment requirements all alter.\nLiquidity is low: Because of the frequently low levels of capital market liquidity in emerging nations, price volatility is generally higher.\nBenefits of Foreign Portfolio Investment\nForeign portfolio investments increase investor demand for a company\u2019s shares and aid in their ability to raise funds efficiently.\nThe secondary market\u2019s depth would significantly increase with the existence of FPI.\nFrom the standpoint of the investor, it enables them to diversify their holdings and gain from that diversification.\nChanges in currency rates might be advantageous to investors as well.\nInternational markets provide investors access to a larger market that is occasionally less competitive than their local market. This indicates that companies profit from less competition elsewhere.\nThe fact that FPI is liquid ensures that the investor is empowered and can act quickly when there are attractive opportunities.\nDifference between FPI and FDI\nWhen a direct commercial interest is developed abroad, the term Foreign Direct Investment (FDI) is used. This commercial interest may, for instance, be a manufacturing or storage facility.\nAn FDI includes the formation of a joint venture or a subsidiary and may result in the transfer of resources, knowledge, and money.\nFDI is larger and more long-term than foreign portfolio investment.\nInstitutions or venture capital firms invest in FDI. FPI just makes investments in the assets or securities of another nation.\nFPI entails purchasing shares or bonds that are made available on the exchange of the foreign nation. Since FPI is liquid, buying and selling it is simple.\nPassive investors are involved in FPI, whereas active investors are the focus of FDI. When compared to FDI, FPI is a less long-term kind of investment because it is not a direct investment.\nNew SEBI Proposal\n\nSEBI has identified several issues with FPIs:\n\nConcern over promoters of such corporate groupings or other investors working in concert is raised by concentrated investments made by some FPIs. These investors may be exploiting the FPI approach to get around regulatory constraints.\nAn entity of a nation having a land border with India may invest exclusively via the Government Route, although this restriction can be avoided by using the FPI route.\n\nSEBI\u2019s new proposal includes:\n\nFPIs may be further categorized as Low (Government and related entities), Moderate (Pension Funds or Public Retail Funds), and High Risk (All other FPIs).\nEnhanced transparency measures for fully identifying all holders of ownership, economic, and control rights may be mandated for certain objectively identified high-risk FPIs.\nFPIs with an exposure of more than 50% to a single group or with assets of over Rs 25,000 crore will be tagged as \u2018high risk\u2019 and will be required to provide additional information.\nDisclosures by FPIs must be unconstrained by any thresholds set by PMLA (Prevention of Money Laundering) rules and FPI regulations.\n\nAlso read: Masala Bonds: Concept Explained With Video\n\nWay forward\n\nInvestors that want to diversify their portfolios by investments in shares, bonds, mutual funds, or other assets or securities located abroad make international portfolio investments.\n\nFPIs are often higher in developing nations with large development potential. FPI is crucial since it fuels the stock markets and increases the liquidity of the host nation\u2019s capital markets.\n\n\u00ad-Article written by Swathi Satish"

They provided intentionally low LIBOR rates to maintain the rates at the traders\u2019 desired levels.\nThe purpose of the alleged wrongdoing was to increase the earnings of traders who had positions in financial securities dependent on LIBOR.\n\nBecause of doubts about LIBOR\u2019s dependability and integrity, the RBI is also abandoning it.\n\nThe LIBOR mechanism\u2019s main weakness is that it heavily relies on banks to disclose their borrowing rates honestly and accurately, disregarding their economic interests. Misconduct and manipulation are made possible by this.\nSome banks purposefully reduced their LIBOR filings during the 2008 financial crisis to provide a more favorable picture. Compared to other market measurements, panelists were reporting much-reduced borrowing costs.\n\nAlso read: Interest Coverage Ratio \u2013 Explained with Example\n\nNew system: SOFR\n\nThe new approach is intended to substitute actual transaction rates for the speculative interest rate thinking that predominated under LIBOR.\n\nIn 2023, LIBOR will be replaced by the secured overnight financing rate (SOFR).\n\nThe SOFR is a benchmark interest rate used for derivative contracts and loans with dollar-denominated principal.\nIn contrast to LIBOR, which relied on estimates of borrowing rates, SOFR is based on actual observed transactions in the U.S. Treasury market.\n\nWhile other nations are considering utilizing their version of a benchmark rate for when LIBOR is phased out, SOFR is most likely to be utilized in the U.S. and the U.K.\n\nThe Modified Mumbai Interbank Forward Outright Rate (MMIFOR), which took the place of the Mumbai Interbank Forward Outright Rate (MIFOR), was advised for use in new transactions in India.\n\nThe modified SOFR rates, which are compounded retroactively for various periods, are included in MMIFOR. These rates are derived, among other places, from the Bloomberg Index Services.\n\nTo lower the risks associated with LIBOR, SOFR, and MMIFOR were introduced to provide a more trustworthy and transaction-based benchmark for financial contracts.\n\nChallenges\n\nThe switch from LIBOR to an Alternate Reference Rate is difficult in terms of technological and regulatory considerations.\n\nThese difficulties included dealing with already-written contracts and modifying them as needed with counterparties, interbank organizations, and borrowers.\nEssential systemic and technological reforms must be made by banks. These adjustments entail figuring out the total exposure and identifying goods linked to LIBOR.\nCustomers must also be informed about the transition, backup provisions must be added to contracts to cover situations where the reference rate is unavailable, the impact on profit and loss statements must be evaluated, and required changes must be made to technological systems.\n\nAlso read: Monetary Policy of India \u2013 Everything You Should Know About\n\nWay forward\n\nThe interest rates on short-term loans made between banks were represented by the London Interbank Offered Rate, a benchmark used around the world.\n\nBut in 2012, when certain bankers were found to be manipulating the index for their gain, the index came under scrutiny.\n\nMost countries have since phased out LIBOR and many have proposed their regional variants.\n\nFor instance, Europe has the European Interbank Offered Rate (EURIBOR), Japan has the Tokyo Interbank Offered Rate (TIBOR), China has Shanghai Interbank Offered Rate (SHIBOR), and India has the Mumbai Interbank Offered Rate (MIBOR).\n\n-Article written by Swathi Satish"

Read here to learn about the history of banking in India.\n\nA nation\u2019s financial system supports its economic growth. The banking industry in India has seen significant changes during the past five centuries due to the state of the economy, the need for financial services, and the subsequent advances in technology.\n\nIt appears from historical accounts from Greece, Rome, Egypt, and Babylon that temples did more than just save money; they also lent it out. One reason temples were often looted during conflicts was that they frequently served as the financial hubs of their towns.\n\nSince the first coins were produced and wealthy individuals realized they required a secure location to put their money, banking has existed.

It was liquidated in 1830-32.\nIn 1786 General Bank of India was set up but it failed in 1791.\n\nCalcutta developed as a banking hub since it was India\u2019s busiest port for trade, mostly because of the British Empire\u2019s trade.\n\nThe British East India Company granted the Bank of Calcutta, Bank of Bombay, and Bank of Madras licenses to establish the three Presidency banks. For long years, they operated in India as if they were central banks.\nThe Bank of Calcutta established in 1806 immediately became the Bank of Bengal.\nThese three banks joined in 1921 to become the Imperial Bank of India.\nLater, in 1955, the Imperial Bank of India was nationalized in 1955 and was named The State Bank of India, which is currently the largest Public sector Bank.\nBefore the Reserve Bank of India was founded in 1935 under the Reserve Bank of India Act, of 1934, the presidency banks and their successors served as quasi-central banks for a long time.\nConsequently, the State Bank of India is the country\u2019s oldest bank.\n\nDuring this time, as many as 600 banks were founded.\n\nMany large banks were unable to function because of a lack of management expertise, equipment, and technology, which resulted in laborious procedures and mistakes made by humans, making Indian account holders vulnerable to fraud.\n\nA few banks have endured and are still around today like the Allahabad Bank (1865), Punjab National Bank (1894), etc.\n\nAs a result of the Swadeshi movement, various local merchants and politicians set up banks for the Indian population between 1906 and 1911. Numerous of these are still in use.\n\nThe financial sector saw rough periods from the First World War (1914\u20131918), till the conclusion of the Second World War (1939\u201345), and two years later, until India gained its independence. Many banks failed as a result of these chaotic times.\n\nHistory of Banking in India: Post-independence phase (1947-1991)\n\nThe Government of India (GOI) chose the strategy of a mixed economy with considerable market involvement in 1948 to develop the economy, continuing the evolution of the Indian banking sector post-independence.\n\nAfter being established in 1935, the Reserve Bank of India was nationalized in 1949 and given the authority to oversee, govern, and inspect all banks in India.\n\nAll of India\u2019s main banks were privately run at the time of independence, which raised concerns because rural residents were still reliant on moneylenders for financial support.\n\nThe then-Government chose to nationalize the banks to address this issue.\n\nAlso read: Unified Payment Interface (UPI): Made Simple\n\nNationalization of banks\n\nThe Government of India issued the Banking Companies (Acquisition and Transfer of Undertakings) Ordinance in 1969 and nationalized the 14 largest commercial banks in India at that time.\n\nAllahabad Bank\nBank of India\nBank of Baroda\nBank of Maharashtra\nCentral Bank of India\nCanara Bank\nDena Bank\nIndian Overseas Bank\nIndian Bank\nPunjab National Bank\nSyndicate Bank\nUnion Bank of India\nUnited Bank\nUCO Bank\n\nIn 1959, 7 subsidiaries of SBI were nationalized:\n\nState Bank of Patiala\nState Bank of Hyderabad\nState Bank of Bikaner & Jaipur\nState Bank of Mysore\nState Bank of Travancore\nState Bank of Saurashtra\nState Bank of Indore\n\nIn the year 1980, another 6 banks were nationalized, taking the number to 20 banks:\n\nAndhra Bank\nCorporation Bank\nNew Bank of India\nOriental Bank of Comm.\nPunjab & Sind Bank\nVijaya Bank\nPost-nationalization\n\nIn India, nationalizing banks marked a turning point toward financial stability, particularly in rural areas where there were no big banks. The efficiency of the financial sector in India was enhanced by the nationalised banks.\n\nThe step has a huge impact on the financial system of the country-\n\nWhen branches were established in the farthest reaches of the nation, bank access improved.\nSince more people had access to banks as a result of the opening of new branches, the average domestic saving increased by two times.\nA comparable rise in public deposits resulted from the expansion of banks\u2019 reach, which aided the expansion of export-related sectors, agriculture, and small businesses.\nImproved effectiveness and more public confidence were the results of greater accountability.\nThe economy expanded significantly as a result of the small-scale industries\u2019 boost.\nAfter being nationalised, RBI had already established a precedent by ranking among the biggest employers. As more banks followed the lead, this continued.\nBanks provide financing to marginal farmers at reasonable rates, which significantly boosted India\u2019s agricultural industry.\nLiberalization (1991)\n\nTo increase the involvement of private and foreign investors, the Government implemented economic liberalization in 1991, which resulted in a significant change in its economic policies.\n\nRead the following articles for a better understanding of liberalization:\n\nEconomic Reforms of 1991\nEffects of Liberalization on the Indian Economy\nConclusion\n\nThe history of banking in India has gone through numerous changes and is of the most mature financial systems.\n\nEven though the reach of banks has spread to rural areas also, the financial inclusion of the poor remains a challenge. Many initiatives like NABARD are being implemented to rectify this issue.\n\nIndian banking is walking hand in hand with technological advancement as well.\n\nThe National Payments Corporation of India (NPCI) and the Government of India together unveiled the UPI (Unified Payment Interface) System and BHIM in 2016, ushering in the era of digital payments and what is commonly referred to as mobile banking.\nFollowing technological developments, several fintech in the nation has advanced digital banking in collaboration with conventional banks to offer a wide range of financial services.\nFull-stack \u201cdigital banks,\u201d which will solely rely on the Internet to provide their services and not on their physical branches, were planned to be established by Niti Aayog in 2021.\nDigital banking in India is anticipated to undergo a revolution as a result.\n\nAlso read: Indian Financial System\n\n-Article written by Swathi Satish"

Space infrastructure furthermore contributes to monitoring the emission of greenhouse gases.\n\nCOVID-19 has highlighted the importance of digital connectivity for both economic development and social well-being. Despite considerable progress in the last decade, hundreds of millions of people in both high and lower-income countries still have no access to a fast and reliable fixed Internet connection.\n\nSatellite-based broadband is one of the technologies that could bring connectivity to areas where other terrestrial alternatives are not available or too expensive to deploy, and new services are underway.\n\nSpace technologies are increasingly used also for development assistance purposes. Space-related official development assistance (ODA) includes technical assistance in telemedicine, geographic information systems, etc\n\nSpace-related ODA projects support a range of different objectives, such as monitoring the environment and natural resources, improving food safety, supporting government services, or developing economic infrastructures.\n\nThe space sector has evolved and spread with astonishing speed in the last two decades, but challenges remain to realize the full benefits of public space investments. While some of these challenges can be addressed by space organizations themselves, more often they rely on close coordination and cooperation with other government services.\n\n-Article written by Swathi Satish"

What are the problems associated with it? Read further to know.\n\nThe Reserve Bank of India has released a discussion paper proposing the use of the expected credit loss (ECL) method for making provisions on bad loans, which could lead to increased capital requirements for banks, according to analysts.\n\nThe proposed approach would require banks to assess the likelihood of default at the outset and make provisions accordingly, in contrast to the current method of making provisions after a loan has defaulted.\n\nAs per the RBI, the increase in provisioning requirement on common equity tier-I (CET1) capital for loan loss, which will be incurred by scheduled commercial banks due to the transition to the expected credit loss (ECL) model, will be phased out in five years.\n\nThe proposed ECL approach is used in International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) 9 that has prescribed guidelines for loss provisioning by banks.\n\nTable of Contents\n\nWhat are the Loan Loss Provisions?\nFramework for Loan Loss Provisions\nStage 1\nStage 2\nStage 3\nBenefits of Loan Loss Provision Approach\nProblems Associated With This Approach\nConclusion\nWhat are the Loan Loss Provisions?\n\nThe RBI said that banks would be allowed to design and implement their own models for measuring ECL for the purpose of estimating loss provisions in line with the proposed principles.\n\nTo cover the losses partially or entirely, banks reserve a proportion of anticipated loan repayments from all the loans in their portfolio. In case of a loss, banks can use their loan loss reserves to cover it, rather than incurring a loss in their cash flows.\n\n\ud83d\udc49 Which year are YOU targeting for success in the IAS/IPS/IFS Exam? \ud83d\ude80\n\n(1) \u21d2 UPSC 2025: Prelims cum Mains\n\n(2) \u21d2 UPSC 2026: Prelims cum Mains\n\n(3) \u21d2 UPSC 2027 Prelims cum Mains\n\nTip: Know more about ClearIAS Courses (Online/Offline)\n\nSince not all loans are expected to become impaired, loan loss reserves usually have enough funds to cover the loss for any one or a few loans when needed.\n\nIn short, an increase in the balance of reserves is known as a loan loss provision. The level of loan loss provision is established to ensure the safety and soundness of the bank, based on the expected level.\n\nAs per the proposal, Regional rural banks and smaller cooperative banks (based on a threshold) will be kept out of the above framework.\n\nFramework for Loan Loss Provisions\n\nThe Reserve Bank of India has proposed a new framework for loan loss provisioning that requires banks to estimate expected credit losses based on forward-looking estimations. This shift moves away from the current method where loss provisions are made after a default.\n\nUnder the proposed framework, banks must classify financial assets into one of three categories: Stage 1, Stage 2, or Stage 3, depending on the assessed credit losses at the time of initial recognition and on each subsequent reporting date.\n\nStage 1\n\nStage 1 assets have low credit risk or have not had a significant increase in credit risk since initial recognition. For these assets, 12-month expected credit losses are recognized, and interest revenue is calculated on the gross carrying amount of the asset.\n\nStage 2\n\nStage 2 assets have had a significant increase in credit risk since initial recognition, but there is no objective evidence of impairment. Lifetime expected credit losses are recognized for these assets, but interest revenue is still calculated on the gross carrying amount of the asset.\n\nStage 3\n\nStage 3 assets have objective evidence of impairment at the reporting date. Lifetime expected credit loss is recognized for these assets, and interest revenue is calculated on the net carrying amount.\n\nBenefits of Loan Loss Provision Approach\n\nSignificant benefits of this approach are:\n\nThe Reserve Bank of India (RBI) stated in a discussion paper that the forward-looking expected credit losses approach is likely to enhance the banking system\u2019s resilience, which is in line with globally accepted norms.\nThe expected credit losses approach involves banks estimating the credit losses they may incur in the future based on forward-looking estimations.\nThis approach is an improvement over the incurred loss approach, where banks wait for credit losses to occur before making corresponding loss provisions.\nAccording to the RBI, the expected credit loss approach is likely to result in excess provisions as compared to the shortfall in provisions seen in the incurred loss approach.\nExcess provisions can help banks absorb potential future losses and maintain financial stability.\nThe RBI\u2019s statement emphasizes the importance of adopting a forward-looking approach to credit losses to enhance the banking system\u2019s resilience.\nProblems Associated With This Approach\n\nThe discussion paper proposing a shift to an expected credit loss (ECL) method for making provisions on bad loans could raise capital requirements significantly for banks, particularly government-owned banks. The probability of default over the last 5-10 years has been high for the banking sector, which could result in higher eventual ECL provisions.\n\nWhile the impact on individual banks is difficult to assess, some large banks with strong specific and contingent buffers could benefit from the ECL-based norms, while small private sector banks may have to accelerate provision buffers and even replenish capital levels faster than planned.\n\nThe model to calculate the expected credit loss is to be decided by individual banks but is subject to independent evaluation and a floor on provisions set by the regulator.\n\nDespite potential challenges, analysts at Emkay Global Research believe that this is an opportune time to introduce ECL norms for banks and strengthen their provision buffers before the next asset-quality shock.\n\nConclusion\n\nIn conclusion, the Reserve Bank of India\u2019s proposal to shift towards the expected credit loss (ECL) method for loan loss provisioning is a positive step towards enhancing the resilience of the banking system. By making provisions for potential future losses, banks can maintain excess provisions, which can help absorb any future losses and maintain financial stability.\n\nHowever, it remains to be seen how effectively banks will be able to design and implement their own ECL models and comply with the proposed framework. Nonetheless, the RBI\u2019s emphasis on adopting a forward-looking approach to credit losses is a step in the right direction toward ensuring the safety and soundness of the banking system.\n\nArticle Written By: Priti Raj"

Customers are compelled to act right away without even confirming the news.\nA bank that practices fractional reserve banking only keeps a percentage of the deposits made on the property. As a result, when several customers take their money at once, they forfeit the actual cash on hand. It causes a severe cash crisis, which forces the bank into bankruptcy.\nLosses on selling assets at lower prices can cause a bank to become insolvent. A bank panic occurs when multiple banks endure runs at the same time.\n\nWhen multiple banks confront the same situation simultaneously, bank panic ensues, resulting in an economic recession, economic instability, and a systemic banking crisis.\n\nPrevention and mitigation\n\nSome of the common practices adopted by banks and financial institutions to prevent bank runs are as follows:\n\nSelling assets to increase cash availability inside the facility\nImposing withdrawal limitations or prohibiting withdrawals entirely\nBorrowing more money from other banks, financial institutions, or the central bank.\nIf banks don\u2019t have enough cash on hand, they can borrow from other organizations. Huge loans could keep them from filing for bankruptcy.\nIn the event that a bank run is imminent, banks may decide to close for a while. This stops individuals from gathering in a line and withdrawing cash.\nPeople\u2019s concern often dissipates when they learn that the government insures their deposits.\nDeposit insurance is one such safety valve through which the losses of the so-called \u201cunsophisticated\u201d depositors of banks can be plugged, albeit to a stipulated limit, in case banks fail, and thereby help arrest the cataclysmic impact of bank runs.\n\nThe government may step in to prevent banks from defaulting in various ways, such as:\n\nSetting higher cash reserve requirements\nBailing out of banks\nImplementing oversight and regulation\nIntroducing deposit insurance schemes\nHistory of bank runs\n\nBank runs date back to the early days of banking when European goldsmiths in the 15th and 16th centuries would issue paper receipts payable for actual gold in excess of the stock they had.\n\nThis was a pioneering instance of fractional reserve banking, in which banks could print more paper money redeemable for gold than they really had on hand.\n\nThe Great Depression is frequently linked in contemporary history with bank runs.\n\nAmerican depositors started to fear after the 1929 stock market disaster and turned to storing actual cash for safety. In 1930, Tennessee had the first bank failure brought on by large-scale withdrawals.\n\nBank runs were a prominent response to the financial crisis of 2008\u20132009.\n\nThe sixth-largest financial institution in the United States at the time, Washington Mutual (WaMu), was shut down on September 25, 2008.\n\nIn 2022, the sanctions against Russia during the 2022 Russian invasion of Ukraine and the removal of Russian banks from the SWIFT system led to a banking panic across multiple Russian banks\n\nMeasures by RBI for bank stability\n\nRBI takes a series of actions to ensure the stability of banks in case of emergencies:\n\nReporting entails making reports, such as the Financial Stability Report, available to the public twice a year to lessen the likelihood of speculation and, consequently, bank runs.\nConsumers trust in the nation\u2019s monetary situation is also increased by initiatives like making the minutes of monetary policy committee meetings available to the public.\nUsing important reserve ratios to exercise control, such as CRR (Cash maintained separately with the RBI) and SLR (Cash, Gold or G-Secs kept with the banks).\nThey make sure that there is enough liquidity in the banks to fulfill the escalating demand.\nRestructuring assets to increase equity also increases bank capital and, as a result, improves Basel-III standards CAR values compliance.\nConclusion\n\nBank runs can bring down banks and trigger further systemic financial crises because they produce negative feedback loops.\n\nDue to the fact that a bank may only have 10% of the cash represented by all deposits on hand, if, say, 20% of customers want their money back, the bank will not have enough cash on hand to reimburse its depositors.\n\nBut, if the withdrawals were spaced out across time and at a slower rate, the bank might be able to find the money.\n\nWhile several regulatory mechanisms are now in place to mitigate bank runs, silent bank runs mediated by electronic transfers can make a run on the bank still possible.\n\n-Article written by Swathi Satish"

Most analysts as a practical definition of recession, define it as two consecutive quarters of decline in a country\u2019s real (inflation-adjusted) gross domestic product (GDP), the value of all goods and services a country produces.\n\nAlthough this definition is a useful rule of thumb, it has drawbacks.\n\nA focus on GDP alone is narrow, and it is often better to consider a wider set of measures of economic activity to determine whether a country is indeed suffering a recession.\nUsing other indicators can also provide a timelier gauge of the state of the economy.\n\nIn simpler terms, a recession is a significant, pervasive, and persistent decline in economic activity.\n\nThe length of a recession is calculated by counting from the top of the previous expansion to its bottom.\nAlthough a few months might pass between recessions, it can take years for the economy to reach its previous high.\nDespite some forecasted recessions not occurring, an inverted yield curve has correctly predicted each of the last ten recessions.\nMany people may perceive the early phases of a comeback as a continuing recession since unemployment frequently persists at high levels far into an economic recovery.\nTo reduce the dangers of a recession, countries adopt fiscal and monetary measures.\n\nThe National Bureau of Economic Research (NBER), a private research organization, which maintains a chronology of the beginning and ending dates of U.S. recessions, uses a broader definition and considers several measures of activity to decide the dates of recessions.\n\nBecause the United States is one of the world\u2019s largest economies and has strong trade and financial linkages with many other economies, most of these globally synchronized recession episodes also coincide with U.S. recessions.\n\nAn inverted yield curve has been viewed as an indicator of a pending economic recession.\n\nYield curve\nCourtesy: Britannica\n\nThe link between the short- and long-term interest rates of fixed-income securities issued by the U.S. Treasury is known as the yield curve.\n\nWhen short-term interest rates are higher than long-term interest rates, the yield curve is inverted.\nIn normal conditions, the yield curve is not inverted as loans with longer maturities normally carry higher interest rates than nearer-term ones.\nAs inverted yield curves are unique and longer-term debt should be riskier and have higher interest rates, they have effects on both investors and consumers.\nOne of the best predictors of an upcoming recession is an inverted Treasury yield curve.\n\nThe curves can be flat or steep depending on the money available in the market and the expected overall economic activity.\n\nTypically, short-term interest rates are lower than long-term rates, so the yield curve slopes upwards, reflecting higher yields for longer-term investments. This is referred to as a normal yield curve.\nWhen the spread between short-term and long-term interest rates narrows, the yield curve begins to flatten. A flat yield curve is often seen during the transition from a normal yield curve to an inverted one.\nWhy do economic recessions happen?\n\nUnderstanding the sources of recessions has been one of the enduring areas of research in economics. There are a variety of reasons recessions take place.\n\nSharp changes in the prices of the inputs used in producing goods and services.\nA recession can also be triggered by a country\u2019s decision to reduce inflation by employing contractionary monetary or fiscal policies.\nSome recessions are rooted in financial market problems. Sharp increases in asset prices and a speedy expansion of credit often coincide with the rapid accumulation of debt.\nIt can be the result of a decline in external demand, especially in countries with strong export sectors.\nA recession is an economic downturn that is not caused solely by the economic activity itself. Technological developments are also a factor in the recession.\nThe imbalance between production and consumption can also trigger a recession.\nAnother indication is when the value of a country\u2019s imports is greater than its exports. This can affect the state budget deficit and a decrease in national income.\n\nBecause recessions have many potential causes, it is a challenge to predict them.\n\nThe behavioral patterns of numerous economic variables including credit volume, asset prices, and the unemployment rate around recessions have been documented.\n\nBut although they might be the cause of recessions, they could also be the result of recessions or in economic parlance, endogenous to recessions.\nEven though economists use a large set of variables to forecast the future behavior of economic activity, none has proven a reliable predictor of whether a recession is going to take place.\nCharacteristics of recession\n\nAlthough each recession has unique features, recessions often exhibit several common characteristics:\n\nThey typically last about a year and often result in a significant output cost. In particular, a recession is usually associated with a decline of 2 percent in GDP. In the case of severe recessions, the typical output cost is close to 5 percent.\nThe fall in consumption is often small, but both industrial production and investment register much larger declines than that in GDP.\nThey typically overlap with drops in international trade as exports and, especially, imports fall sharply during periods of slowdown.\nThe unemployment rate almost always jumps and inflation falls slightly because overall demand for goods and services is curtailed.\nAlong with the erosion of house and equity values, recessions tend to be associated with turmoil in financial markets.\nTypes of economic recession\n\nThere can be several factors causing recession and concerning them and the recoveries, recession can be classified into four or five basic types:\n\nBoom and bust recession\n\nMost economies bounce up and down while their overall growth increases.\n\nAn economy that \u201cbooms,\u201d or expands faster than planned over the long term, frequently face inflation.\n\nA central bank or other government supervisory body frequently implements measures to \u201ccool\u201d the economy and avoid overheating to manage inflation.\n\nOften, these measures involve boosting taxes, decreasing government expenditure, or increasing interest rates.\nThis might limit general spending and shift consumer preferences to conserving money and paying off debts, which can produce a recession, or \u201cbust.\nBalance sheet recession\n\nRichard Koo, an economist, coined the phrase \u201cbalance sheet recession,\u201d which often occurs when an economy is overextended with debt.\n\nIn typical times, financial institutions lend out the money that people and corporations save with them to other people and companies, keeping the economy moving.\nAs consumer and company spending patterns change as a result of worries about debt levels, everyone starts to cut down on spending at the same time to \u201cclean up their balance sheets.\u201d\nDepression\n\nThere is no formal definition of depression, but most analysts consider depression to be an extremely severe recession in which the decline in GDP exceeds 10 percent.\n\nThere have been only a handful of depression episodes in advanced economies since 1960.\n\nDuring the Great Depression of the 1930s, policies like the New Deal restructured how the economy functioned and many regulations from that time are still in use today.\nSupply-side shock\n\nGlobal events, like wars, natural disasters, or public health crises, can cause a large shock to domestic or international supply chains and push an economy into a recession.\n\nThese sorts of recessions may not continue long if the supply is replenished soon.\nYet if not, the impacts of the supply shock might last for years, as is the case with the ongoing supply problems brought on by the COVID-19 pandemic.\nThey can also result in a long-term movement towards supply chain diversification or changing how products are utilized, such as an increase in investments in alternative fuels like natural gas or solar energy as a result of an oil crisis.\n\nRead here: Economic recoveries\n\nImpact of the economic recession 2023 on the world\n\nThe economic outlook for 2023 will feel different depending on where you are in the world, according to the World Economic Forum.\n\nThe majority of chief economists expect moderate or strong growth in the Middle East and North Africa and South Asia.\nWhile most of them predict that the growth will be weak in the US and Europe.\n\nIn the latest International Monetary Fund (IMF) predictions, the outlook for global growth was trimmed by 0.2 percentage points, while the forecast for the eurozone was revised down dramatically to 0.5% from 1.2%.\n\nOn the other side, the Middle East and North Africa, and South Asia were seen as the strongest performers.\n\nSome economies in that region, including Bangladesh and India, were seen as benefiting from a global trend diversifying away from China.\n\nWhile the outlook is generally gloomy and uncertain, potential bright spots include the easing of inflationary pressures and the possibility for consumer sentiment to stabilize and improve.\n\nSoaring food costs will disproportionately affect low-income countries, with many more people facing food insecurity.\nWeak global demand was seen as the biggest challenge for businesses to overcome in 2023, followed by the high cost of borrowing, high input costs, and talent shortages.\nThe fall of the cryptocurrency sector is expected to have relatively little spillover into wider financial markets.\nThe majority of chief economists do not expect further economic disruption from COVID-19.\nConclusion\n\nThe shape, length, and subsequent recoveries of recessions can be influenced by a wide range of various factors. These factors might include supply or economic shocks, natural disasters, or public health emergencies.\n\nA firm or nation may better prepare for a specific recession by understanding the similarities and differences between the many types of recessions and their recoveries.\n\nThese variables may include consumer confidence, interest rates, pricing, and supply chain problems. These insights may help a firm plan for the recovery, whatever shape it takes.\n\n\u00ad-Article written by Swathi Satish"

But some economists have expressed doubts over the extent and durability of the economic recovery mainly due to weak demand and investment.\n\nRecently, the Chief economic advisor mentioned that it is wrong to describe India\u2019s urban and rural recovery as a K-shaped recovery.\n\nPost-pandemic, India\u2019s urban and rural areas have seen different growth rates with urban recovery proceeding at a faster pace than rural recovery.\nK-shape recovery denotes a situation of inequality, following a recession, with different parts of the economy recovering at different rates, times, or magnitudes.\nUnder it, some sectors experience growth while others continue to decline. levels.\nThe CEA said that urban recovery is proceeding at a faster pace than rural recovery.\n\nIndia\u2019s economy grew at a weaker-than-expected 4.4 percent in Q3 amid wide revisions to earlier GDP figures, as manufacturing output contracted for the second consecutive quarter and consumer demand slowed.\n\nThe CEA said there was still pent-up demand in the system, as, in the past three years, India had been growing below potential.\n\nShapes of economic recovery\n\nEconomists employ recovery shapes to describe various recessions and the recovery that follows.\n\nThe letters V, U, W, L, and K used to represent the shapes are called by the way each recovery appears on a graph that measures the state of the economy as a whole.\n\nPeople may easily debate and predict the intricacies of an economic slump and how long it could take to recover by using recovery shapes.\n\nV-shaped recovery\nCourtesy: Business Insider\n\nIn a V-shaped recovery, the economy experiences a sharp decline but then bounces back almost immediately to its pre-recession level.\n\nThe period in which the economy remains at a low point (the bottom of the V) is extremely brief.\nThis may happen if the downturn in the economy that triggered it doesn\u2019t continue very long.\nThere can be a seasonal slowdown where firms are holding positions for momentarily unemployed customers.\nPerhaps if quick and innovative fiscal and monetary measures successfully lessen the effects of the recession.\n\nA V-shaped recovery is a best-case scenario, where the economy bounces back immediately bolstered by appropriate fiscal and monetary policies.\n\nU-shaped recovery\nCourtesy: Business Insider\n\nIn a U-shaped recovery, commonly known as the \u201cNike Swoosh\u201d recovery, the economy undergoes prolonged stagnation following a downward trend.\n\nIt then gradually climbs to its earlier peak. This prolongs the recession, which results in job losses and the depletion of reserves.\n\nIt is less ideal than the V-shaped recovery but much better than the worst-case scenario.\nIt doesn\u2019t necessarily mean that the recession is more severe in terms of the loss in GDP, but it does mean that it lasts longer.\nW-shaped recovery\nCourtesy: Business Insider\n\nA W-shaped recovery, also known as a double-dip recession, occurs when the economy briefly recovers and people believe they will have a V-shaped rebound before the economy declines once more.\n\nAs it is effectively two recessions in one, the first\u2019s effects are prolonged and consumer confidence may be destroyed.\nThe economy might occasionally enter a second recession due to the nature of global events.\nIt can also do so as a result of fiscal and monetary measures taken to ease the previous one.\nL-shaped recovery\nCourtesy: Business Insider\n\nThe L-shaped recovery represents the worst-case situation. Even after several years, the economy in this case is unable to reach its peak GDP. It\u2019s sometimes called \u2018depression\u2019.\n\nOf all forms, this has the longest recessionary time. Sometimes the decline and the gradual recovery persist eternally.\nIt can take years for the economy to get back to where it was pre-downturn, and in some cases, this slow revival drags on indefinitely.\nK-shaped economic recovery\nCourtesy: Business Insider\n\nThe K-shaped recovery differs from the others in a small way. It\u2019s a relatively new phrase coined to explain what economists believe the COVID-19 epidemic would bring about.\n\nIn this scenario, one sector of the economy has a recovery that is more V-shaped or U-shaped, while another either continue to decline or recovers considerably more slowly, as in the case of the L-shaped recovery.\nThe two diagonal lines of the letter K represent this separation between two distinct economic groupings.\nIndustries and people are both impacted groups.\nHigh-tech and e-commerce are two examples of sectors that were able to continue operating or even prosper throughout the pandemic, whereas other industries had significant slowdowns or were essentially unable to function (i.e., travel and hospitality, arts and entertainment).\nCertain sections of the economy will recover more quickly due to large-cap corporations and public-sector organizations that have access to government aid and central bank stimulus programs.\nBlue-collar employees and small and medium-sized businesses are excluded from the recovery process.\nThe two diagonal lines of the letter K signify the split between these two groupings.\nSuch a rebound occurs when several sectors of the economy improve at wildly dissimilar speeds.\nConclusion\n\nThe most typical recoveries are V-shaped and U-shaped, while the other forms are not unusual.\n\nThe shortest time spent in the recession\u2019s trough makes a V-shaped rebound the best-case scenario, while an L-shaped recovery is a worst-case scenario since it has the longest recovery.\n\nThese letters only provide a portion of the tale, though. The length and character of the economic recovery are described, but the depth of the recession that preceded it is not.\n\nIt is impossible to determine the type of shape of economic recovery when in the middle of a recession. Economists can provide educated predictions once the key economic indicators such as GDP, employment, and inflation (price increases, due to growing demand) begin to respond.\n\nThe shape of economic recovery is not an exact science, but the predictions help governments, investors, and consumers alike in planning monetary policies and investments.\n\n\u00ad-Article written by Swathi Satish"

Hence, the investors have to rely on the credit ratings of the issuing company as security.\n\nFixed deposits:\n\nFixed deposits (FDs) are one of the most popular investment products as they are versatile and flexible.\nBanks, certain Non-Banking Finance Companies (NBFCs), and even post offices issue fixed deposits.\nThey are popular due to their ease of investment, liquidity (except in tax-saving FDs), and uncomplicated nature.\n\nDebt mutual funds:\n\nDebt Mutual funds invest the pooled money in fixed-income products like government securities, corporate bonds, and some part in money market instruments.\nDebt funds, also known as fixed-income funds, are considered less volatile than equity funds as they invest in fixed-income products. They also have a low-cost structure.\n\nCertificates of deposit\n\nCertificates of Deposit (CDs), introduced in India in 1989, are short-term debt instruments.\nBanks and Financial Institutions issue CDs in dematerialized form against the funds that an investor deposits for a specific term.\nThe Reserve Bank of India lays down guidelines from time to time for their issue and operation.\nBanks must maintain the cash reserve ratio (CRR) and statutory liquidity ratio (SLR) on the price of CDs.\nAll individual residents in India are eligible to buy certificates of deposit. The minimum duration of a CD issued by a bank is seven days and goes up to one year\n\nPublic provident fund:\n\nThe Public Provident Fund (PPF) scheme is a popular long-term investment product. PPFs have been around since 1968.\nIn this investment option, you put aside a small sum of money regularly to create wealth in the long term.\nInterest rates are fixed by the government quarterly. And the Investment and returns are tax-exempt.\nPublic debt\n\nPublic debt is the total amount borrowed by the government of a country when the government\u2019s revenue from taxes and other sources falls short of its spending requirements.\n\nIn India, public debt includes the total liabilities of the Union government that have to be paid from the Consolidated Fund of India (Article 292).\n\nIt is further classified into internal & external debt. Internal debt is categorized into marketable and non-marketable securities.\n\nMarketable government securities include G-secs and T-Bills issued through auction.\nNon-marketable securities include intermediate treasury bills issued to state governments and special securities issued to national Small Savings Fund among others.\n\nSometimes, the term is also used to refer to the overall liabilities of the central and state governments.\n\nHowever, the Union government clearly distinguishes its debt liabilities from those of the states.\nIt calls the overall liabilities of both the Union government and state General Government Debt (GGD) or Consolidated General Government Debt.\n\nThe internal debt comprises loans raised in the open market.\n\nIt also includes borrowings through treasury bills including treasury bills issued by state governments, commercial banks, and other investors.\nIt also includes non-negotiable, non-interest-bearing rupee securities issues to international financial institutions.\n\nThe part of a nation\u2019s debt that is borrowed from foreign lenders, such as commercial banks, governments, or international financial institutions, is referred to as its external debt.\n\nThese loans must typically be repaid in the currency used to make the loan, plus any applicable interest.\nThe borrowing nation may sell and export items to the lending nation to get the required cash.\n\nThe amount of the government\u2019s debt is crucial since a sizable portion of annual payments (around 25%) are made merely to cover the interest on the previous debt. For the current fiscal year, the government\u2019s debt is predicted to be about 62% of GDP.\n\nThe debt-to-GDP ratio shows how probable it is that the nation will be able to pay off its debt. Investors frequently use the debt-to-GDP ratio to determine the capacity of the government to finance its debt. Global economic crises have been fueled by higher debt-to-GDP ratios.\n\nAlso read: Budget Documents Made Simple\n\nPublic debt management\n\nSovereign or public debt management is the process of establishing and executing a strategy for managing the government\u2019s debt to raise the required amount of funding.\n\nIt aims to achieve its risk and cost objectives and to meet any other sovereign debt management goals the government may have set, such as developing and maintaining an efficient market for government securities.\n\nIn 2015, the creation of a statutory body called Public Debt Management Agency (PDMA) was envisaged in India.\n\nAs the RBI set interest rates and conducted the purchase and sale of government bonds, it raised issues of conflict of interest.\nTill the time a PDMA comes into place, the government created an interim arrangement that deals with the management of public debt called the Public Debt Management Cell.\nPublic Debt Management Cell\n\nPublic Debt Management Cell is an interim arrangement before setting up an independent and statutory debt management agency namely the Public Debt Management Agency (PDMA).\n\nPDMC has the following advisory functions to the Government:\n\nPlan borrowings of the Government, including market borrowings, other domestic borrowings, SGBs\nManage Central Government\u2019s liabilities including NSSF, and contingent liabilities.\nMonitor cash balances of the Government, improve cash forecasting, and promote efficient cash management practices.\nAdvise other Divisions in DEA on matters related to External Debt involving external borrowings through MI, Bilateral cooperation, and other possible sources, in terms of cost, tenure, currency, hedging requirements, etc., and monitor developments in foreign exchange markets.\nFoster a liquid and efficient market for Government securities\nDevelop interfaces with various stakeholders/agencies in the regulatory/financial architecture etc. to carry out assigned functions efficiently.\nAdvice on matters related to investment and capital market operations.\nUndertake research work related to new product development, market development, risk management, debt sustainability assessment, other debt management functions, etc.\nDevelop a database system for collecting and maintaining a comprehensive database of Government of India liabilities on a near real-time basis and shall be responsible for the publication of relevant information.\nCarry out Preparatory work for independent PDMA.\nConclusion\n\nAn excessive level of public debt can result in higher interest rates, which has a crowding effect on the amount of private investment in the economy and the rate of economic expansion as a whole.\n\nAlthough it temporarily boosts overall demand, if left unchecked it can cause a country\u2019s economy to experience spiraling losses.\n\n-Article written by Swathi Satish"

A commonly used narrow definition of public debt covers the budgetary central government.\nA broader definition is the general government (budgetary central government, state, and local government, extrabudgetary units, and social security funds).\n\nTo properly assess a country\u2019s debt sustainability, it is important to cover all types of debt that pose a risk to a country\u2019s public finances.\n\nIn advanced economies and emerging markets, debt sustainability analysis frequently focuses on the general government.\n\nHowever, in low-income countries nearly complete coverage of both public and publicly guaranteed debt is standard.\n\nAssessments of debt sustainability carried out by the IMF and World Bank cover both domestic and external public sector debt.\n\nBut sovereign credit rating agencies that focus on the risk of debt distress typically concentrate on market-based external public sector debt.\n\nAlso read: US Debt Ceiling Crisis and US Federal Government Shut down Explained\n\nDebt sustainability analysis\n\nThe World Bank Group and the IMF work with low-income countries to produce regular Debt Sustainability Analyses, which are structured examinations of developing country debt based on the Debt Sustainability Framework.\n\nThis area of work has three goals:\n\nEnsure that countries that have received debt relief are on a sustainable development track.\nAllow creditors to better anticipate future risks and tailor their financing terms accordingly.\nHelp client countries balance their needs for funds with the ability to repay their debts.\n\nThe objective of this analysis is to support efforts by low-income countries to achieve their development goals while minimizing their risk of experiencing debt distress.\n\nDebt crises are costly to debtors, creditors, and the international monetary and financial system.\nDebt sustainability analysis plays a critical role in guiding borrowing and lending decisions.\n\nAlso read: Budget Documents Made Simple\n\nChallenges to Developing Country Debt Sustainability\n\nSince the global financial crisis, economies around the world have become dependent on debt for their growth.\n\nThis has encouraged unprecedented global indebtedness, particularly in emerging markets and developing countries which have little control over global trends.\n\nWithin the global financial system, developing countries have a limited number of choices, and proposals for regional and inter-regional monetary and financial cooperation and reliance on directed development banking are set out as a place to start.\nIn recent years, developing countries have faced renewed financial stress due to increased and premature connectivity to international financial markets.\nThe constraints imposed by a world with policy parameters shaped by unregulated international financial markets are particularly binding on developing countries.\nUnregulated capital inflows can lead to exchange rate appreciation, reducing the competitiveness of the domestic industry and hurting export earnings.\n\nThe challenge for the Governments of increasingly vulnerable economies is finding room to maneuver to manage debt sustainably while ensuring growth-inducing expenditure to enhance development.\n\nWhat developing countries require most is long-term access to foreign demand, and thus reliable export markets to support their emergent domestic growth, and investment to repay external debt.\n\nDeveloping countries have expanded and opened their domestic financial markets to non-resident investors, foreign commercial banks, and financial institutions prematurely\n\nThey have also allowed their citizens to invest abroad and, many developing country Governments are engaged in raising finance in developed country financial markets.\nIndia\u2019s debt sustainability\n\nThe sustainability of public debt is one of the critical issues from the point of view of policymakers.\n\nBefore Independence, the borrowing needs of Indian princely states were largely met by indigenous bankers and financiers.\nThe concept of borrowing from the public was pioneered by the East India Company to finance the Anglo-French wars during the 18th century.\nThe First World War saw a rise in India\u2019s public debt due to the country\u2019s contribution to the British exchequer.\nThe provinces of British India were allowed to float loans for the first time in 1920 when the local government borrowing rules were issued under the Government of India Act, of 1919.\n\nIndia\u2019s public debt (combined liabilities of the Central and State governments) to gross domestic product (GDP), at constant prices, increased to a record high of 100.86 percent in 2020.\n\nHow to make public debt sustainable?\n\nThe following measures may be adopted by the government to make public debt sustainable in the medium to long term:\n\nThe government may think of privatizing loss-making public sector undertakings (PSUs).\nThe government may run any business if it is socially relevant, technologically feasible, environmentally friendly, economically viable, politically acceptable, legally unassailable, and ethically right.\nIt is the government\u2019s responsibility to control fiscal wastefulness and to achieve long-term macroeconomic sustainability through the effective conduct of monetary policy and prudential debt management in a transparent manner.\nAs part of better fiscal deficit management, and maintaining enhanced transparency and accountability, the Public Financial Management System (PFMS) should be leveraged to the maximum.\nThe government may think of the public-private partnership (PPP) model in social schemes.\nThe government needs to focus on investment in infrastructure and human capital.\nGST needs to be harmonized and expanded to other areas to reach a national consensus to improve the tax-GDP ratio.\nThe government should create an investor-friendly environment for additional sources of financing to replace the high public debt.\nThe government should enhance the efficiency of public debt management by adhering to low cost, risk mitigation, and market development.\nThrust on renewable energy can push the Indian economy to 5 trillion dollars by 2025. It is pertinent to reduce reliance on fossil fuels which will save foreign exchange.\nIn news\n\nThe first G20 finance ministers and central bank governors (FMCBG) meeting concluded recently to address debt vulnerabilities.\n\nThe steps agreed upon at the meeting were:\n\nStraightening multilateral coordination by official bilateral and private creditors.\nPredictable and coordinated implementation of a Common framework for debt treatments beyond the Debt service suspension initiative of the world bank.\nTo enhance macro policy cooperation and support the progress towards the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development.\nTo develop a globally fair, sustainable, and modern international tax system fit for purpose for the 21st century.\nWay forward\n\nGlobal growth remains slow, and downside risks to the outlook persist, including elevated inflation, a resurgence of the pandemic, and tighter financing conditions that could worsen debt vulnerabilities in many Emerging Market and Developing Economies (EMDEs).\n\nThe governments should make the public debt sustainable by carefully building their strategy in lines of growth achieved through financial stability.\n\nThe global focus should be to assist developing countries in attaining long-term debt sustainability through coordinated policies aimed at fostering debt financing, debt relief, and debt restructuring, as appropriate, and addressing the external debt of highly indebted poor countries to reduce debt distress.\n\nSustainable finance is critical in achieving sustainable, resilient, inclusive, and equitable economic growth which meets the needs of the present without compromising the ability of future generations to meet their own needs.\n\nThe need of the hour is for the international community to step up its efforts to effectively combat money laundering, terrorism financing, and proliferation financing to enhance the integrity and resilience of the international financial system.\n\n-Article written by Swathi Satish"

China is the source of imports for 80% of APIs.\nIndia is thus at the mercy of erratic price changes and supply interruptions. To stabilize supply, it is required to implement infrastructure improvements in the area of internal facilities.\nSince 2009, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has conducted the most inspections in India; as a result, continuing investments in raising quality standards would divert money away from other areas of growth and development.\nDue to the difficulty posed by India\u2019s frequent and unforeseen adjustments to its domestic pricing policies;

What are the causes and how these differences can be minimised?\n\nDespite the existence of the Equal Remuneration Act of 1976, neither the law nor the courts have been able to preserve a fundamental human right of gender equality that is guaranteed by the Constitution.\n\nIndia wants more women to participate in its public and economic life, but it is unable to shield them from unfair wages and discriminatory employment possibilities.\n\nIn this light, let us discuss gender pay parity in detail.\n\nTable of Contents\n\nWhat is Gender Pay Parity?\nThe Gender Pay Gap is Not the Same as Equal Pay\nWhy and Where the Country is Lacking?\nWhat Causes the Gender Pay Parity?\nHow Can We Reduce Gender Pay Parity?\nWhat Needs to be Done to Arrest This Decline?\nWhat is Gender Pay Parity?\n\nThe Gender Pay Parity or Gender Wage Gap is defined as the average difference between the remuneration for working men and women. Recently it was in the news because the Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI) announced to provide equal pay to men and women cricketers in international cricket which is a historic move.\n\nAs per International Labour Organization (ILO), women on average continue to be paid about 20 per cent less than men across the world. In some countries, the difference is as high as 45 per cent. As a result, there\u2019s a lifetime of income inequality between men and women and more women are retiring into poverty.\n\nAccording to a report on time use, published by National Sample Survey (NSS) in 2019, women spend 299 minutes a day on unpaid domestic services for which men spend only 97 minutes. Only 22% of women aged 15-59 years were engaged in paid work in comparison to nearly 71% of men. Consequently, women\u2019s productivity is grossly under-represented in India\u2019s GDP.\n\n\ud83d\udc49 Which year are YOU targeting for success in the IAS/IPS/IFS Exam? \ud83d\ude80\n\n(1) \u21d2 UPSC 2025: Prelims cum Mains\n\n(2) \u21d2 UPSC 2026: Prelims cum Mains\n\n(3) \u21d2 UPSC 2027 Prelims cum Mains\n\nTip: Know more about ClearIAS Courses (Online/Offline)\n\nDespite the fact that actual labour may involve a comparable amount of effort and skill, it is less regarded and compensated. The disparity widens among mothers, immigrant women, and women of colour. The so-called \u201cmotherhood penalty,\u201d which forces women into the informal sector, casual employment, and part-time employment, is more prevalent in developing countries than it is in developed countries.\n\nThe Gender Pay Gap is Not the Same as Equal Pay\n\nEqual pay is when men and women are paid equally for performing the same role or different work of equal or comparable value.\n\nSince 1969, this has been a legal requirement in Australia.\n\nGender pay gaps are not a comparison of like roles.\u00a0Instead, they show the difference between the average pay of women and men across organisations, industries and the workforce as a whole.\n\nRead: Income inequality\n\nWhy and Where the Country is Lacking?\n\nIndia ranks lowest in Health and Survival, and Economic Participation and Opportunity. Recently, the World Economic Forum (WEF) ranked India at\u00a0135 out of 146 countries\u00a0in its Global Gender Gap (GGG) Index for 2022.\n\nIndia has consistently scored poorly and ranked poorly in several categories. According to the report, the rank in the former has been low, owing to the low sex ratio at birth.\n\nAccording to the most recent National Family Health Survey (NFHS), the sex ratio at birth was 929 females to 1,000 males for children born in the last five years. However, the natural sex ratio at birth, according to the World Health Organization (WHO), is approximately 952 females to every 1,000 males.\n\nIf we talk about Economic Participation and Opportunity, according to the Periodic Labour Force Survey\u2019s 2020-21 annual report, the labour force participation rate among Indian women is just 23.15 per cent, in contrast to 57.75 per cent in men.\n\nAccording to NFHS 2019-21, just 25.2% of the surveyed women had jobs at the time, compared to 74.8% of the surveyed men.\n\nAccording to the Gender Gap Report, \u201cthe most unequal economies with less than 65% of wealth equity are Nigeria, Argentina, Mexico, Turkey, and India.\u201d This indicates that on average, women in these nations only assemble less than 65% of the wealth that men do by the time they retire. India received a score of between 60% and 64%.\n\nAlso read: Global Gender Gap Report\n\nWhat Causes the Gender Pay Parity?\n\nThe gap between women\u2019s and men\u2019s average earnings is the result of social and economic factors that combine to reduce women\u2019s earning capacity over their lifetime.\n\nThese factors include:\n\nConscious and unconscious discrimination and bias in hiring and pay decisions\nUnder-representation in leadership\nWomen and men working in different industries and different jobs, with female-dominated industries and jobs attracting lower wages\nWomen more than men are more likely to take career breaks from their employment in order to raise children. That makes them\u00a0likely to have fallen behind in advancement and in remuneration.\nLack of workplace flexibility to accommodate caring and other responsibilities, especially in senior roles\nHigh rates of part-time work for women\nWomen\u2019s greater time out of the workforce for caring responsibilities impacts career progression and opportunities\nIt can be challenging for them to obtain and maintain a job in science, technology, engineering and mathematics (STEM) disciplines because they are traditionally male-dominated.\nHow Can We Reduce Gender Pay Parity?\n\nTo remove the obstacles preventing women from participating fully and equally in the workforce, a cultural shift is necessary to close the gender wage gap.\n\nSome of the ways to reduce the gender pay gap include:\n\nConducting an audit to understand the size of the gender pay gap\nReporting the findings to management and employees\nPromoting a gender-inclusive business culture while adopting a holistic approach to equal remuneration for women and men for work of equal value.\nTaking action to increase the number of women in leadership positions\nEncouraging men to access flexible work arrangements and leave entitlements.\nMaking jobs more flexible so that more women access higher-level jobs and, therefore, higher pay.\nMaking equitable salary offers to men and women.\nEncouraging women\u2019s participation in leadership roles as well.\nWomen\u2019s education must be promoted.\nWhat Needs to be Done to Arrest This Decline?\n\nThe report criticises the rising inequality in the number of women holding offices in India. This scenario could be improved by passing the Women\u2019s Reservation Bill, which would reserve 33% of all seats in the Lok Sabha and all State legislative assemblies for women. Also, steps could be taken to close the gender wage gap in all industries.\n\nAccording to estimates from the World Inequality Report 2022, men in India make up 82% of the labour force while women make up 18%. Also, there is room to increase funding for the gender budget, which strives to guarantee that women have equal access to socioeconomic advantages as men.\n\nArticle Written By: Priti Raj"

Read further to know more.\n\nThe government has announced the National IPR policy to advance the IPR regime.\n\nThe strategy will promote entrepreneurship, creativity, and innovation in India.\n\nLet us discuss more on India\u2019s IPR policy.\n\nTable of Contents\n\nRegarding the Policy\nGoals of the IPR policy\nRequirement of an IPR Policy\nDetails of IPR policy\nBenefits of IPR policy\nDisadvantages\nMajor outcomes of the new National IPR policy\nConclusion\nRegarding the Policy\n\nThe policy\u2019s slogan is \u201cCreative India, Innovative India\u201d. The main aim is to discourage the production and selling of fake goods and to encourage entrepreneurship, creativity, and innovation.\n\nThe intellectual property encourages advancement in S&T, art and culture, traditional knowledge, and biodiversity resources; knowledge is the primary driver of development, and knowledge owned is transformed into knowledge shared. This promotes an India where creativity and innovation are encouraged by IP for the benefit of all.\nIt establishes a formal system for implementation, oversight, and evaluation. It tries to adapt and modify best practices from around the world for the Indian context.\nIPRs in India are being implemented and will continue to develop under the direction of the Department for Promotion of Industry and Internal Trade (DPIIT), Ministry of Commerce, Government of India.\nThe WTO\u2019s agreement on Trade-Related Aspects of Intellectual Property Rights is upheld by India\u2019s IPR regime (TRIPS).\nThe National IPR Policy\u2019s goals are to be carried out by the \u201cCell for IPR Promotion & Management (CIPAM),\u201d which was established under the supervision of DPIIT.\nGoals of the IPR policy\n\nThere are seven main goals:\n\nIPR, outreach, and promotion\u2014raising public understanding of IPRs\u2019 positive effects on the economy, society, and culture.\nEncourage the creation of IPRs by cultivating an environment that is inventive and innovative.\nReplace obsolete rules with strong, effective IPR laws that combine the rights holders\u2019 interests with the broader public interest.\nHuman Capital Development for Intellectual Property Education, Research, and Skill Building Human resources, institutions, and capacities are strengthened and expanded by rights.\nModernize and improve service-oriented IPR administration through the administration and management of innovation\nIPR commercialization \u2013 Commercialization can be used to maximise IPR value.\nStrengthening the enforcement and adjudicative processes to combat IPR infringements\n\nThe policy established a legal framework that will support the IPR regime and shorten the time it takes for a trademark to be approved by the government to one month. At the moment, the procedure takes longer than a year.\n\n\ud83d\udc49 Which year are YOU targeting for success in the IAS/IPS/IFS Exam? \ud83d\ude80\n\n(1) \u21d2 UPSC 2025: Prelims cum Mains\n\n(2) \u21d2 UPSC 2026: Prelims cum Mains\n\n(3) \u21d2 UPSC 2027 Prelims cum Mains\n\nTip: Know more about ClearIAS Courses (Online/Offline)\n\nRequirement of an IPR Policy\nIt is crucial for the government to offer incentives in the form of tax breaks in order to promote research and development.\nThe US Trade Representative (USTR) kept India on its \u201cPriority Watch List\u201d in its annual Special 301 Report (on the Global State of IPR Protection and Enforcement) for the 2016 edition.\nTo protect innovations so that there are fewer legal disputes in this area.\nIt will aid in preserving Indian traditional knowledge.\nIt will contribute to the improvement of the Startup, Make In India, and Digital India programs.\nDetails of IPR policy\n\nThe IPR policy was developed, following extensive stakeholder consultation with close to 300 organizations and people by an IPR Think Tank, as well as with 31 departments of the Government of India.\n\nApproved by the Indian government on May 12th, 2016.\nIn order to create and utilise synergies between all types of intellectual property (IP), relevant statutes, and agencies, a vision statement that embraces and unifies all IPRs must take into account all interlinkages within the Indian IP ecosystem.\nAttempts to incorporate and adapt international best practices to the Indian situation by establishing an institutional system for implementation, monitoring, and review.\nReiterates India\u2019s adherence to the TRIPS agreement and the Doha Development Agenda\nRecognizes that India has a solid legislative, judicial, and administrative framework for protecting IPRs that comply with TRIPS.\nBalances the greater public interest with the rights holders\u2019 interests\nIn order to assure the monetization of India\u2019s \u201cfrugal engineering\u201d strength, it is necessary to raise awareness about IPRs as a marketable financial asset and economic tool.\nEnsures that the IP regime in India is characterised by a single-mindedness of goal and direction, serving as a guide for the IPR regime in India for times to come.\nPositions India as an innovation-friendly country and allows for the effective use of the strengths of all stakeholders.\nTo promote innovation and creativity by presenting the world with a dynamic and predictable IP regime that includes a stable, transparent, and service-oriented IPR administration.\nFive-year reviews of the IPR Policy will be conducted by a committee under the Secretary of the DIPP.\nBenefits of IPR policy\n\nThe proposed IPR policy regime has the following benefits:\n\nIt is a vision plan that seeks to build connections among all types of intellectual property, relevant laws, and government organisations.\nIt would harmonise India\u2019s IP regime with international standards and raise India\u2019s Ease of Doing Business score on the World Bank.\nThe policy promotes investments in India by potential investors and strategic partners while ensuring credibility.\nIt will decrease the amount of time needed to process the backlog of IPR applications.\nIt works to improve access to healthcare, food security, and environmental protection while preventing the piracy of movies and music.\nA stable, open, and service-oriented IPR administration in the nation is made possible by policy, which also encourages creativity and innovation across industries.\nIt will raise awareness, which will contribute to creating a culture that supports innovation and creativity and produce commercially viable, protectable intellectual property.\nIndustry and people would gain from the Copyright Act and Semiconductor Integrated Circuits Layout-Design Act being brought under DIPP.\nDue to better administrative convergence, the commercial relevance of IPRs will be better affected when they are housed under one roof.\nAll facets of society are to be made aware of the social, economic, and cultural benefits of IPRs.\nDisadvantages\n\nThe proposed national IPR policy also has some disadvantages like the following.\n\nThe Doha Declaration on World Trade Organization (WTO) TRIPS (Trade-Related IPR Agreement) and Public Health is a commitment made by India, according to the IPR Policy. However, there was some concern that the inclusion of the Doha Declaration and flexibility would lead to attempts to undermine TRIPS in order to benefit pharmaceutical firms.\nIn the absence of financing and programmes to enable universal access to healthcare, any change in the legal system would be detrimental to both the generic industry and the Indian populace.\nTraditional knowledge and the informal creativity/innovations based on it are not addressed in the policy.\nAbsence of proof supporting the value of current trade secret and utility model legislation in fostering unofficial innovation.\nEven while it claimed that the primary responsibility for securing IP rights was on the IP owner, it envisions significant government investment in protecting and promoting foreign IP in India.\nFurthermore, the mention of State laws in the context of copyright protection demonstrated how the policy was biased in favour of IP owners rather than society.\nFew experts believe that the National IPR strategy is insufficient for promoting innovation since it lacks specificity.\nIt presupposes that greater IP leads to greater innovation. It fails to comprehend that IP is merely a means to an end and not an end in and of itself.\nThe policy urges that all knowledge be turned into IP.\nCorporates have also acknowledged that certain technical industries, where a free flow of open knowledge is more appropriate, do not work well with IP.\nExperts are also dubious about the policy\u2019s application to the rural informal economy.\nBecause rural economies and creativity are not well understood. In rural places, adopting a formal IP policy may cause more harm than good.\nLastly, making violations of the Indian Cinematograph Act illegal is excessively harsh and unjust. IP wrongs are essentially civil wrongs, so they shouldn\u2019t be made illegal.\nMajor outcomes of the new National IPR policy\n\nThe following are the major outcomes of the new IPR policy.\n\nIndia\u2019s position in the WIPO-issued Global Innovation Index (GII) rose from 81st in 2015 to 48th in 2020.\n\u00a0Compared to the same period in 2017\u201318, patent filings climbed by about 7% in the first eight months of 2018\u201319. Over this time, there has been an almost 28% increase in trademark filings.\nEnhancing institutional mechanisms for promoting and protecting IP\nThe government\u2019s increase in technical manpower has led to a significant decrease in the amount of time that IP Applications are pending.\nAnother innovation is the automatic issuance of the electronically created patent and trademark certificates.\nProcesses have been streamlined and made more user-friendly in accordance with the IP Process Re-engineering Patent Rules, 2003. Trademarks Rules have been updated and announced in 2017.\nIPR Awareness-Building IPR Awareness seminars have been carried out for businesses, law enforcement, the judicial system, and even rural schools using satellite communication.\nCenters for Technology and Innovation Support (TISCs) have been set up in numerous universities across various states in conjunction with WIPO.\nConclusion\n\nThe IPRs policy would go a long way toward encouraging the Indian sector to develop as well as to preserve and enforce their innovations, but other areas still need more examination, such as the idea of information sharing and knowledge access.\n\nThe expansion of the innovation ecosystem with improved IPR protection is necessary for the success of India\u2019s flagship initiatives, Make in India and Startup India. The expansion of the protection to include items that are in the public domain is also causing some worry. More foreign investment in the nation could be attracted with better policy enforcement.\n\nIt appears that the policy\u2019s approach to copyrights and trademarks is designed to meet the interests of foreign businesses. They will be more motivated if rights are granted more quickly and are strictly enforced. The policy\u2019s approach to digital piracy, which suggests harsher measures for addressing the problem, is one of its main features.\n\nArticle Written By: Atheena Fathima Riyas"

Read further to know more about Credit Rating in India.\n\nIn today\u2019s financial world, credit rating is an essential factor that plays a crucial role in determining the creditworthiness of an individual or a business entity.\n\nWith the advent of globalization, credit rating has become increasingly important in India, as it directly affects the access to finance and the cost of borrowing.\n\nIn this article, we will explore the credit rating system in India, its significance, and the factors that affect it.\n\nTable of Contents\n\nWhat is Credit Rating?\nWho Evaluates Credit Ratings in India?\nHow do Credit Rating Agencies Work in India?\nTypes of Credit Rating\nUsers of Credit Ratings\nSignificance of Credit Rating\nWhat\u2019s the Difference Between Credit Rating and Credit Score?\nFactors Affecting Credit Rating in India\nFactors Affecting Credit Scores in India\nConclusion\nWhat is Credit Rating?\n\nA credit rating is an evaluation of a borrower\u2019s creditworthiness, either generally or in relation to a specific debt or financial obligation.\nAny organisation looking to borrow money, whether it be a person, business, state or local authority, or sovereign nation, can be given a credit rating.\n\nCredit rating companies assign ratings to entities after evaluating their financial and business risk. After considering additional variables like the ability to repay the loan, the firms compile a thorough report.\n\nWho Evaluates Credit Ratings in India?\n\nAn Indian credit agency assesses the borrower\u2019s credit rating by looking at both their quantitative and qualitative characteristics. The credit rating agency examines a variety of data, including financial statements, annual reports, analyst reports, news articles, industry analyses, and projections for the upcoming quarter, which ultimately aids them in deciding what grade to assign the organisation.\n\n\ud83d\udc49 Which year are YOU targeting for success in the IAS/IPS/IFS Exam? \ud83d\ude80\n\n(1) \u21d2 UPSC 2025: Prelims cum Mains\n\n(2) \u21d2 UPSC 2026: Prelims cum Mains\n\n(3) \u21d2 UPSC 2027 Prelims cum Mains\n\nTip: Know more about ClearIAS Courses (Online/Offline)\n\nCredit Rating Information Services of India Limited (CRISIL), ICRA Limited, Credit Analysis and Research Limited (CARE), India Rating and Research Private Limited, etc. are a few of the leading credit rating agencies in India.\n\nThe SEBI (Credit Rating Agencies) Regulations, 1999 of the Securities and Exchange Board of India Act, 1992 govern all credit rating agencies in India.\n\nHow do Credit Rating Agencies Work in India?\n\nEach rating agency uses a different formula to determine credit ratings. Companies, state governments, non-profit organisations, nations, securities, special purpose entities, and local governmental bodies are all rated by agencies.\n\nBefore evaluating a business, credit rating agencies analyze a number of variables, including the financial statements, level and kind of debt, lending and borrowing history, capacity to repay debt, and previous debts of the entity. After a credit rating agency rates the entities, it gives the investor additional information, which the investor then analyses and uses to make wise investment decisions.\n\nThe entities\u2019 credit ratings are used as a standard for financial market regulations. It should be highlighted, though, that the ratings should not be viewed as investment advice but rather as a tool for making wise choices.\n\nAlso read: Indian Economy Statistics: Know India Better\n\nTypes of Credit Rating\n\nAll credit agency businesses use a variety of terminologies to generate credit scores. Therefore, ratings are divided into two categories: \u201cInvestment-grade\u201d and \u201cSpeculative grade.\u201d\n\nInvestment Grade: Investment-grade ratings indicate a safe investment with a high probability that the issuer will adhere to the terms of the repayment. These investments cost less than investments of a speculative grade.\nSpeculative Grade: These assets are rated as speculative because of their high risk. Therefore, they have higher interest rates.\nUsers of Credit Ratings\nInstitutional and Individual Investors: Both institutional and retail investors utilize credit ratings to determine the portfolio-level risk associated with investing in a particular issuance.\nIntermediaries: Investment bankers fall under the category of intermediaries since they utilize credit ratings to assess credit risk and determine how much debts should cost.\nDebt Issuers: Debt issuers, which include municipalities, corporations, and governments, utilize credit ratings to determine their creditworthiness. They also consider the credit risk connected to the issue of debt. The ratings might also provide potential investors with a sense of the instrument\u2019s quality.\nCorporations and Businesses: They try to assess the risk connected with a counterparty transaction. Credit ratings assist organizations in assessing the viability of joint ventures and business partnerships with other firms.\nSignificance of Credit Rating\nA borrower\u2019s creditworthiness is evaluated both qualitatively and quantitatively through credit rating.\nAfter considering the risk factor and prior repayment behaviour, it enables investors to make a wise investment choice. To put it another way, it creates a connection between risk and reward.\nIn the case of companies, credit ratings assist them in enhancing their brand. Particularly for unpopular companies, it is helpful.\nCredit rating serves as both a marketing tool and a resource for businesses when they are trying to raise capital. It lowers the cost of borrowing and aids in business growth.\nIf an organization has a better credit rating, lenders like banks and financial institutions would give loans at a reduced interest rate. On the other side, a decreased credit rating implies that the company\u2019s ability to make payments has diminished.\nImproved financial information, thorough information sharing, and better accounting practices are all encouraged by credit ratings.\nWhat\u2019s the Difference Between Credit Rating and Credit Score?\n\nAfter determining a company\u2019s or organization\u2019s capacity to pay back the borrowed sum, credit rating firms issue that entity a credit rating. In the meanwhile, credit bureaus calculate a credit score after taking into account a number of variables, including credit history and payback behaviour.\n\nFactors Affecting Credit Rating in India\n\nSeveral elements that could have an impact on a company\u2019s credit rating in India include:\n\nHistory of the Company: The credit rating agency examines the company\u2019s prior performance, including its history of borrowing and when it has repaid its debts. If a corporation makes late payments or defaults on loans, this can have a negative impact on its credit rating.\nFuture Commercial Potential of the Company: A company\u2019s credit rating is also based on its potential for the future. The credit rating will give the company a good rating if projections, present performance, and other factors indicate that it will become profitable soon; alternatively, a negative rating will be issued if the future projections do not appear promising.\nFactors Affecting Credit Scores in India\n\nSeveral things can have an impact on your credit score, including:\n\nNot Paying Your Bills on Time: If you don\u2019t pay your credit card bills or loan payments on time, your credit score may suffer. Therefore, to maintain a good credit score, constantly be sure to pay your bills by the due date.\nCredit Utilization Ratio: To keep your credit score high, you should preferably keep your credit utilization ratio at 30% or less. Don\u2019t use your credit card for more than 30,000 rupees, for instance, if your credit card\u2019s limit is Rs. 1 lakh.\nDelayed Loan and Bill Payments: Your credit score increases if you pay all of your bills on time and repay your loan. You could have the option of making minimum payments, but this won\u2019t assist your credit score over time. Therefore, in order to maintain a good credit score, make sure you pay off all of your loans and credit card bills on time before applying for a new one.\nFrequently Applying for Loans and Credit Cards: The lender runs a credit investigation whenever you apply for a loan or credit card. Avoid applying for loans and credit cards frequently because doing so will lower your credit score because of too many credit inquiries.\nIncreasing Your Credit card Limit Frequently:\u00a0Increasing your credit card limit repeatedly may indicate that you rely significantly on credit to pay for your expenses, which might lower your credit score and make future loan offers from lenders unlikely. Increase your credit limit only if you are confident in your ability to pay the past-due account in a timely manner.\nNot Regularly Reviewing Your Credit Score: At a minimum, check your credit score every quarter. Your credit score could occasionally contain a little inaccuracy, which could then have an impact. If you discover a mistake, contact the credit bureau right once to have it corrected.\nHaving a Bad Credit Mix: Don\u2019t apply for only one kind of good. Don\u2019t, for instance, submit a personal loan application every time. Having a variety of loans demonstrates your ability to manage your finances, which raises your credit score. It should go without saying that you must make your loan payments on time to keep a good credit score.\nConclusion\n\nThe credit rating system in India plays a crucial role in the financial market by providing investors with information on the creditworthiness of debt securities. It helps in determining the risk associated with investing in a particular security and aids in making informed investment decisions. Overall, the credit rating industry in India has shown steady growth and improvement in recent years, with increased regulation and transparency. However, challenges such as conflicts of interest and limited coverage of certain segments of the market remain to be addressed.\n\nArticle written by: Aryadevi E S"

The majority of secondary, tertiary, and quaternary care facilities are run by the private sector.\n\n\ud83d\udc49 Which year are YOU targeting for success in the IAS/IPS/IFS Exam? \ud83d\ude80\n\n(1) \u21d2 UPSC 2025: Prelims cum Mains\n\n(2) \u21d2 UPSC 2026: Prelims cum Mains\n\n(3) \u21d2 UPSC 2027 Prelims cum Mains\n\nTip: Know more about ClearIAS Courses (Online/Offline)\n\nIndia has 1.3 beds per 1,000 people, 0.5 pharmacists per 1,000 people, and 0.8 physicians per 1,000 people, which are all less than half the global average.\n\nQuality of Health Care Services\n\nIndia is ranked 145th out of 180 nations in terms of the accessibility and quality of healthcare, according to the Economic Survey (Global Burden of Disease Study 2016)\n\nDoctors\n\nTo achieve an ideal doctor-to-population ratio of 1:1000 by 2030, India will require an additional 2 million doctors.\n\nDisease Burden\n\nDespite having 17% of the world\u2019s population, India bears a disproportionately large portion of the global disease burden (20%).\n\nFunding\n\nIndia\u2019s public healthcare spending was 2.1% of GDP in 2021\u20132022, up from 1.8% in 2020\u20132021, according to the\u00a0Economic Survey of 2022.\n\nChallenges in Health Sector\n\nAlthough India\u2019s health sector has made significant progress in terms of health indicators, it still has some serious flaws in service delivery due to inadequate healthcare infrastructure.\n\nInadequate Accessibility\n\nInsufficient access to basic healthcare services to all, due to a shortage of medical professionals, a lack of quality assurance, and insufficient health spending.\n\nInsufficient Funding\n\nOne of the major concerns is the administration\u2019s lack of financial resources and insufficient funding for research and development.\n\nIndia\u2019s government will only spend 2.1% of its GDP on healthcare in 2021\u201322, compared to 10% for Japan, Canada, and France.\n\nNo focus on Preventive Care\n\nDespite being shown to be quite beneficial in alleviating a variety of difficulties for patients in terms of unhappiness and financial losses, preventive care is undervalued in India.\n\nShortage of Medical Workforce\n\nDoctors, nurses, and other healthcare professionals are in short supply in India. According to a minister\u2019s study presented in Parliament, India is short 600,000 doctors.\n\nLack of Infrastructure\n\nPrivate hospitals are expensive, whereas Government hospitals are either inadequate or lacking in basic facilities for the Indian population.\n\nOptimal Insurance\n\nThe concept of health insurance is still unclear in India, and the market is underdeveloped.\n\nPolicymaking\n\nPolicymaking is undeniably important in providing effective and efficient healthcare services. The problem in India is one of supply rather than demand, and policy can help.\n\nPotential in Health Care Sector in India\n\nDespite the challenges, there were opportunities. The Indian healthcare system has a unique opportunity to advance while taking stock of the past and getting ready for the future while keeping the welfare of its people in mind.\n\nStrong Demand\n\nAccording to Aspire Circle, the Indian healthcare sector is expected to reach $744 billion by 2030, driven by greater access to insurance, better health awareness, lifestyle diseases, and rising income.\n\nInnovative Technologies\n\nAs part of the National Digital Health Mission (NDHM), the digital Health ID will be introduced, which will save patient data. It would aid in effective policymaking, and private firms would benefit from a competitive advantage in the market introduction of innovative technology.\n\nWith the advent of information technology and big data, it would be simple for private players to spend strategically.\n\nRising Manpower\n\nThe abundance of highly qualified medical personnel in India is a competitive advantage. With 4.7 million workers as of 2021, the Indian healthcare industry is one of the country\u2019s largest employers.\n\nFrom 0.83 million in 2010 to 1.3 million in November 2021, the number of allopathic doctors with recognised medical qualifications (under the I.M.C Act) registered with state medical councils/national medical council\n\nCost Competent\n\nIndia\u2019s costs are competitive with those of its countries in Asia and the West. Surgery in India costs roughly a tenth of what it does in the US or Western Europe.\n\nAttractive Opportunities\n\nTwo vaccines Bharat Biotech\u2019s Covaxin and Oxford-Covishield, AstraZeneca\u2019s both made by SII were critical in protecting the Indian population from COVID-19.\n\nIndia has emerged as a hub for R&D activities for international players due to its relatively low cost of clinical research.\n\nWith the help of the government and private stakeholders, a climate conducive to start-ups and entrepreneurship can be created in this field.\n\nHub of Medical Tourism\n\nIndia is already one of the world\u2019s most popular medical tourism destinations, and this industry has significant potential in the coming years.\n\nThe low cost of medical services has resulted in a rise in the country\u2019s medical tourism, attracting patients from across the world.\n\nIndia possesses all the necessary factors for this industry to grow rapidly, including a sizable population, a strong pharmaceutical and medical supply chain, more than 750 million smartphone users, the third-largest global start-up pool with simple access to Venture Capital funding, and innovative tech entrepreneurs looking to address global healthcare issues.\n\nMeasures Required in the Health Sector\n\nThese are the following major measures for improving the health sector in India:\n\nStrengthening the Infrastructure: Because of India\u2019s large population, there is an urgent need to improve the infrastructure of public hospitals, which are overburdened.\nEncourage Private Hospitals: The government should support private hospitals because they contribute significantly to the Indian Health sector. The challenges are severe and cannot be addressed solely by the government, the private sector must also participate with Government for the public good.\nIncreased efficiency: More medical personnel must be hired in order to improve the sector\u2019s capabilities and efficiency.\nUtilization of Technology: Technology must be used to connect the dots in the health system. Medical devices in hospitals and clinics, mobile health apps, wearables, and sensors are just a few examples of technology that should be considered.\nImproving Mental Health Care Services: Increasing financing for mental health services, educating healthcare professionals on how to effectively treat mental health issues, and lowering the stigma attached to mental illness are all part of improving mental health services.\nAddressing the Root Causes of Health Disparities: To address the social determinants of health and reduce overall health inequities, the healthcare system should collaborate with other sectors, such as education, housing, and sanitation.\nSustainable Health governance: To promote more effective and efficient healthcare services, sustainable health governance may involve implementing better management systems, bolstering healthcare regulatory organisations, and developing independent oversight mechanisms.\nMake Public Awareness: People should be made aware of the value of early detection and prevention. It would also help them save money on out-of-pocket expenses.\nOne Health Approach: The need for communal health programmes that address a healthy environment, healthy animals, and healthy people is urgent. This is known as the \u201cone health approach,\u201d and it aims to address these connections between human and animal health.\n\nAlso read: Medical Device Sector in India\n\nMajor Steps Taken by the Government\n\nDespite the fact that health is a state issue, the Central Government assists state governments in providing health services through a variety of primary, secondary, and tertiary care systems.\n\nIn the Union Budget 2023-24:\n\nRs. 89,155 crore was allocated to the health sector, an increase of over 13% from the previous budget.\nAllocated Rs. 6835 crore for establishing 22 new \u00a0All India Institute of Medical Sciences (AIIMS).\nAdditionally, the National Health Mission\u2019s budget allocation increased from Rs. 28,974 crore in the preceding years to Rs. 29,085 crore in the current 2023\u201324 budget.\nBudgetary support for the National Digital Health Mission increased from the previous year\u2019s Rs. 140 crore to the current Rs. 341 crore.\nThe funds allotted for autonomous bodies were also scaled up, going from Rs. 10,348 crore in the previous budgeted allocation to Rs. 17,322 crore at the moment.\n\nIn order to promote medical tourism in the country, the government of India is extending the e-medical visa facility to the citizens of 156 countries.\n\nPrime Minister Mr. Narendra Modi introduced the Ayushman Bharat Digital Mission in September 2021. The endeavour will link the digital health solutions of hospitals across the country. Every citizen will now have access to a digital health ID, and their medical records will be safeguarded online.\n\nIn July 2021, the Ministry of Tourism established the \u2018National Medical & Wellness Tourism Board\u2019 to promote medical and wellness tourism in India.\n\nIn July 2021, the Union Cabinet approved the continuation of the National Ayush Mission, responsible for the development of traditional medicines in India, as a centrally sponsored scheme until 2026.\n\nIn July 2021, the Union Cabinet approved the MoU between India and Denmark on cooperation in health and medicine. The agreement will focus on joint initiatives and technology development in the health sector, with the aim of improving public health status of the population of both countries.\n\nConclusion\n\nIndia is a land full of opportunities for Health Care and Services. Along with being one of the top places for high-end diagnostic services, the nation has made significant capital investments in advanced diagnostic facilities to serve a larger proportion of the population.\n\nFuture demand for healthcare services is anticipated to increase due to factors such as advancing income levels, an ageing population, rising health awareness, and shifting attitudes toward preventative healthcare.\n\nA comprehensive strategy is required to address issues in India\u2019s healthcare industry. This necessitates active collaboration between all stakeholders, including the public, private, and individual sectors.\n\nIn 2023, India\u2019s approach to social determinants of health (SDH) could be consolidated and expanded. As a major economic pillar, India must now maintain its existing interest in strategic health policy.\n\nRead:\u00a0\n\nClimate Resilient Health\u00a0Systems\nViolence against healthcare workers (VAHCW) in India\n\nArticle written by: Aryadevi E S"

What are Multi-Modal Logistics Parks (MMLP)? What is its focus? How is it designed? Read further to read about Multi Modal Logistics Parks.\n\nA government program called Multi-Modal Logistics Parks (MMLPs) aims to create these parks throughout the nation\u2019s many logistics hubs.\n\nThe National Highways Authority of India and National Highways Logistics Management Limited, both part of the Ministry of Road Transport and Highways (MoRTH), are in charge of the initiative (NHAI).\n\nTable of Contents\n\nMulti-Modal Logistics Park\nAbout Multi-Modal Logistics Park\nFocus of MMLP\nDesign of Multi-Modal Logistics Parks\nA tripartite agreement under Bharatmala Pariyojna\nMMLP advantages\nNeed for \u00a0the MMLPs\nConclusion\nMulti-Modal Logistics Park\n\nThe upgraded version of a logistics park, MMLP offers a variety of value-added services in addition to rail and road transportation. Nowadays, supply management is a widely recognised concept that goes by various names across the globe. India has never before had a comprehensive strategy for creating logistic parks.\n\nThe MMLPs was designed to provide several capabilities, including freight gathering and distribution, and to provide seamless intermodal freight transportation. Users will also receive value-added services including custom clearances and IT services, as well as storage and warehousing solutions.\n\nAbout Multi-Modal Logistics Park\n\nThe MMLP will combine several types of freight transportation through highways, railroads, and inland waterways. It was developed using a \u201cHub and Spoke\u201d paradigm. To enhance the nation\u2019s freight logistics industry, these MMLPs will be created using a hub-and-spoke network, which connects every location through a single intermediary point known as a hub.\n\nThe development of the MMLP is anticipated to have a major positive impact on the transportation industry. These include decreased warehousing expenses, decreased traffic congestion and pollution, improved tracking and traceability of transit shipments, and lower overall freight prices.\n\n\ud83d\udc49 Which year are YOU targeting for success in the IAS/IPS/IFS Exam? \ud83d\ude80\n\n(1) \u21d2 UPSC 2025: Prelims cum Mains\n\n(2) \u21d2 UPSC 2026: Prelims cum Mains\n\n(3) \u21d2 UPSC 2027 Prelims cum Mains\n\nTip: Know more about ClearIAS Courses (Online/Offline)\n\nThrough interventions in infrastructure, procedures, and information technology, all of these are feasible in various ways. The MMLPs also offer auxiliary services including storage, warehousing options, value-added services like custom clearances, and IT services.\n\nA one-stop shop for all services linked to cargo movement, such as warehousing, customs clearance, parking, truck repair, etc., the Multi-Modal Logistic Park project is prepared to construct cutting-edge large-scale warehouse facilities for all types of commodities.\n\nIt will feature all the necessary amenities, including warehouses, rail sidings, cold storage, a customs clearing house, yard space, workshops, gas stations, truck parking, office space, boarding houses, restaurants, a water treatment facility, etc.\n\nFocus of MMLP\n\nThe MMLPs\u2019 deployment of a cutting-edge freight management system will be driven by technology. These projects will include many value-added services, including packaging, repackaging, and labelling. Along with other related facilities, MMLP will be a freight-handling facility for automated material handling and value-added services.\n\nDesign of Multi-Modal Logistics Parks\nIn October 2017, the Cabinet Committee on Economic Affairs (CCEA) gave MoRT&H permission to build 35 Multi-Model Logistics Parks (MMLP) across the nation. These 35 MMLPs, which are being implemented by MoRTH, will be made using the Design, Build, Finance, Operate, and Transfer (DBFOT) model of Public Private Partnership (PPP).\nThe majority of the projected MMPLs will be built through public-private partnerships (PPPs), according to the National Highways and Logistics Management (NHLML), an SPV that is completely owned by the National Highways Authority of India (NHAI). The funding strategy for the parks will be 50:50.\nA total of 35 multi-modal logistics parks with a capital budget of Rs 50,000 crore are planned for the country. The 35 MMLPs being planned are at North Gujarat, Jaipur, Kolkata, Ambala, Jagatsinghpur, Nashik, Kota, Panaji, Hisar, Visakhapatnam, Bhopal, Sundargarh, Bhatinda, Solan, Rajkot, Raipur, Jammu, Kandla, Cochin, Delhi-NCR, Bangalore, Indore, Mumbai, Hyderabad, Coimbatore, Pune, Surat, Sangrur, and Delhi-NCR.\n\nFor the quick creation of contemporary Multi Modal Logistics Parks (MMLP), the Government of India recently signed a tripartite agreement under Bharatmala Pariyojna.\n\nA tripartite agreement under Bharatmala Pariyojna\n\nThe goal is to consolidate freight centrally and lower logistics spending from 14% of GDP to less than 10%, in line with international standards.\n\nThe Inland Waterways Authority of India (IWAI), National Highways Logistics Management Limited (NHLML), and Rail Vikas Nigam Limited inked the trilateral agreement.\nIt is a 100% publicly owned company that reports to the Ministry of Railways.\nThe agreement highlights the three organisations\u2019 concepts of collaboration and cooperation for achieving efficiency in domestic logistics movement.\nBy ensuring that cargo is switched/shifted from and to waterways, dedicated freight corridors, and road transport, it will provide a seamless modal shift.\nMMLP advantages\nThe government hopes to lower logistic expenditures from the present 14\u201316% of the nation\u2019s gross domestic product (GDP) to roughly 9% with the 53 MMLPs that are planned overall.\nAdditionally, it believes that these mega logistic parks would result in the development of manufacturing or assembly clusters close to these facilities, which will significantly reduce the expense and duration of freight transportation.\nThe programme also emphasises on the effectiveness of freight and passenger transportation across the nation by filling up important infrastructure gaps with practical solutions like economic corridors and multi-modal integration using roads, logistic parks, ports, and ropeways among others.\nIn addition to offering effective trans-shipment and processing facilities, the series of MMLPs has a complete plan in place to meet every aspect of the logistics industry.\nNeed for \u00a0the MMLPs\n\nThe Asian Development Bank (ADB) claims that India\u2019s logistics industry is less efficient and more expensive than that of other nations. As a result, the economy\u2019s general efficiency has decreased, and the cost structure of all commodities has climbed.\n\nRoad freights are more expensive in India than in other nations, yet freight vehicle average speeds are around 50% to 60% slower. According to the ADB, the following variables have a negative impact on freight movement in India.\nA skewed mix of modes of transportation. 60% of freight in India is transported by road, which is a much higher percentage than in many other economies. Inland rivers and coastal transport are still in their infancy\nDespite being 45% less expensive per ton-km than roads, rail transportation is only negligible because of unfair pricing and rake booking practises, as well as a lack of intermodal infrastructure to facilitate the simple transfer.\nInfrastructure for material handling is underdeveloped. Due to the prevalence of several tiny, private, disorganised warehouses that offer little to no value-added services, the warehousing environment is very disorganised.\nIn contrast to more efficient line haul freight, more point-to-point freight movement on smaller trucks occurs when logistical hubs are not present to serve as zones for freight consolidation and disaggregation.\nIneffective and outdated service model.\nEfficiency is also hampered by the fact that many businesses compete on the basis of hiring low-skilled labour at low salaries, forgoing investments in information technology and equipment technology, and thereby giving up productivity increases and service quality.\nThe institutional and governmental structure is fragmented. Different ministries presently oversee various facets of the logistics value chain. Leading nations with efficient logistics, including Malaysia, Germany, Japan, and the Republic of Korea, adopt a fully integrated approach to logistics, and the government coordinates control of the entire logistical value chain.\nConclusion\n\nCosts associated with logistics are now more precise than they were before the deregulation of diesel pricing. Numerous programs, like Bharatmala and Sagarmala, aim to enhance the nation\u2019s logistics industry. Creating specialized freight corridors, such as the east-west and north-south Dedicated Freight Corridors. GST implementation, which resulted in a decrease in regulatory compliance.\n\nThis would guarantee a change in the location of the warehouse facilities and lower the cost of transportation. The manufacturing industry, which is heavily dependent on transportation, is the focus of the Make-in-India initiative.\n\nArticle Written By: Atheena Fathima Riyas"

ClearIAS Courses (Online/Offline)\n\nThe three basic methods of disinvestment are:\n\nmajority disinvestment\ncomplete privatization\nminority disinvestment\n\nWhen minority disinvestment takes effect, the government keeps a majority stake in the business (typically more than 51%) ensuring managerial control.\n\nIn the case of a majority divestiture, the government transfers control to the acquiring corporation while holding onto a portion of the company, whereas, in the case of a complete privatization, the buyer receives complete ownership of the business.\n\nThe main goal of disinvestment is to maximize the return on investment (ROI) related to capital goods, labor, and infrastructure, regardless of whether this entails divestiture or a reduction in funding.\n\nDisinvestment is carried out for a variety of reasons, such as strategic, political, or environmental.\n\nMeans of Disinvestment\n\nDisinvestment of a minority stake in a government-owned entity is done in one of the following ways:\n\nInitial Public Offering (IPO)\nFollow On Public Offer (FPO)\nOffer For Sale (OFS)\nInstitutional Placement: Government stake is auctioned off to select financial institutions\nExchange-Traded Funds (ETFs): Monetize shareholding simultaneously across multiple sectors and companies that form a constituent of the ETF.\nCross-holding: Listed PSUs are allowed to buy a government stake in another PSU\nDisinvestment in India\n\nIn India, the Department of Investment and Public Asset Management (DIPAM) deals with all matters relating to the management of Central Government investments in equity including disinvestment of equity in Central Public Sector Undertakings.\n\nThe Department of Disinvestment was set up as a separate Department in 1999 and was later renamed as Ministry of Disinvestment in 2001.\nSince 2004, the Department of Disinvestment falls under the Ministry of Finance.\nThe Department of Disinvestment was renamed as Department of Investment and Public Asset Management (DIPAM) in 2016.\n\nThe four major areas of its work related to:\n\nStrategic Disinvestment\nMinority Stake Sales\nAsset Monetisation\nCapital Restructuring\n\nIt also deals with all matters relating to the sale of Central Government equity through an offer for sale private placement or any other mode in the erstwhile Central Public Sector Undertakings.\n\nDIPAM is working as one of the Departments under the Ministry of Finance.\n\nAlso read: Privatisation of Air India \u2013 Should India\u2019s Public Sector Airline be

Disinvestment along with transfer of management control.\n\nStrategic disinvestment of CPSEs lies at the heart of the disinvestment policy.\nStrategic disinvestment would imply the sale of a substantial portion of the Government shareholding of a central public sector enterprise (CPSE) of up to 50% or such higher percentage as the competent authority may determine, along with transfer of management control.\nMinority stake sales\n\nMinority Stake Sale happens when the Government intends to sell a part of the PSU from its overall shareholding, given that post-stake sale the GOI ownership is still above 51%.\n\nPost the sale control over management is retained by the Government of India.\nHistorically, Minority Stake Sales have been auctioned off to institutions or offloaded to the public by means of an Offer for Sale.\nPresently, government policy states that all disinvestments would only be minority disinvestments via Public Offers.\n\nAs per the present Allocation of Business Rules, the mandate of the DIPAM is as follows:\n\nAll matters relating to the management of Central Government investments in equity including disinvestment of equity in Central Public Sector Undertakings.\nAll matters relating to the sale of Central Government equity through offer for sale or private placement or any other mode in the erstwhile Central Public Sector Undertakings.\nDecisions on the recommendations of Administrative Ministries, NITI Aayog, etc. for disinvestment including strategic disinvestment.\nAll matters related to Independent External Monitor

investment in the said Enterprises through the capital market.\nThe Unit Trust of India Act, 1963 (52 of 1963) along with subjects relating to Specified Undertaking of the Unit Trust of India (SUUTI).\n\nThe vision of the Department of Disinvestment is:\n\nPromote people\u2019s ownership of Central Public Sector Enterprises to share in their prosperity through disinvestment.\nEfficient management of public investment in CPSEs for accelerating economic development and augmenting the Government\u2019s resources for higher expenditure\n\nMission includes:\n\nList CPSEs on stock exchanges to promote people\u2019s ownership through public participation and improve efficiencies of CPSEs through accountability to its shareholders.\nTo bring operational efficiencies in CPSEs through strategic investment, ensuring their greater contribution to the economy.\nAdopt a professional approach for the financial management of CPSEs in the national interest and investment aimed at expanding public participation in ownership of CPSEs.\nNational Investment Fund (NIF)\n\nThe government had constituted the National Investment Fund (NIF) in November 2005 into which the proceeds from the disinvestment of Central Public Sector Enterprises were to be channelized.\n\nThe corpus of NIF was to be of a permanent nature and NIF was to be professionally managed to provide sustainable returns to the Government, without depleting the corpus.\n\nSelected Public Sector Mutual Funds, namely UTI Asset Management Company Ltd., SBI Funds Management Private Ltd., and LIC Mutual Fund Asset Management Company Ltd. were entrusted with the management of the NIF corpus.\n\nAs per this Scheme, 75% of the annual income of the NIF was to be used for financing selected social sector schemes that promote education, health, and employment.\nThe residual 25% of the annual income of NIF was to be used to meet the capital investment requirements of profitable and revivable PSUs.\nDisinvestment Plan 2023-24\nThe list of CPSEs to be divested in 2023\u20132024 will not be expanded by the Center with any more enterprises.\nThe government has chosen to proceed with the privatization of State-owned enterprises which was previously stated and planned.\nThe Container Corporation of India Ltd. (Concor), NMDC Steel Ltd., BEML, HLL Lifecare, and IDBI Bank are a few examples.\nInterestingly, the government had approved the disinvestments of Bharat Petroleum Corporation Limited, SCI, and ConCor in 2019, but they have not yet taken place.\nAdvantages of disinvestment\nThe government may reduce spending or make up for a year\u2019s worth of lost revenue by disinvesting.\nDisinvestment also promotes open market trading and private asset ownership.\nAs private sector ownership and management can introduce new ideas and a more market-oriented attitude, the government can increase the efficiency and competitiveness of these businesses by divesting from public sector corporations.\nThe government can reallocate the funds made available by disinvestment to support other objectives like infrastructure and social advancement.\nSince private ownership and management can result in more rigorous financial and operational reporting, disinvestment can increase openness and accountability in the operation of public sector firms.\nChallenges\nPolitical parties and labor organizations who oppose the sale of public sector firms have frequently resisted disinvestment, which is a contentious subject in India.\nBecause of their bureaucratic and non-market-oriented architecture, public sector businesses may not be able to compete successfully in the market, making their valuation a difficult task.\nDisinvestment can also result in labor-related problems because employees of public sector businesses may worry about losing their jobs or seeing their pay decrease once these businesses are sold.\nIn some instances, the government may have trouble selling its holdings in public sector companies, particularly if they are not doing well financially.\nA number of rules and approval procedures must be followed during the disinvestment process, which can cause delays and increase complexity.\nAs litigants may contest the legality of the transaction or the terms and conditions under which it was performed, the process of disinvestment may also be contested in court.\nConclusion\n\nDisinvestment is regarded as a crucial instrument for fostering economic development and prosperity in India.\n\nThe goal of the Indian government\u2019s disinvestment policy is to increase revenue, boost public sector enterprise productivity, encourage economic growth, and contribute to the development of a more vibrant and sustainable economy.\n\n-Article written by Swathi Satish"

It is found in the study that the System of Rice Intensification (SRI) technique is significant in terms of water saving, input costs, plant growth, and other social impacts.\n\nSRI was first introduced in the 1980s in Madagascar by Father de Laulani\u00e9 then its potential went under testing in India as well along with several other countries. Father de Laulani\u00e9 observed that SRI is an amalgamation of multiple beneficial practices.\n\nSRI is not a standardized technique, instead, it is a set of ideas that helps in reducing resource waste and increases productivity using land, seed, water, nutrients, and human labor.\n\nTechnique of System of Rice Intensification\n\nThe Rice Intensification technique for cultivation involves the use of as much organic manure as possible, planting young seedlings in a square pattern at wide spacing, and irrigation intermittently with irrigation that keeps the soil moist but not swamped.\n\nHow Rice Intensification is Beneficial for India?\n\nAs we know, Agriculture plays a vital role in the Indian economy, and the average land-holding size in India is 1.08 hectares. Out of which, the average land holding of marginal farmers (Which constitute around 65% of total farmers in India), is less than one acre (0.4 hectares).\n\n\ud83d\udc49 Which year are YOU targeting for success in the IAS/IPS/IFS Exam? \ud83d\ude80\n\n(1) \u21d2 UPSC 2025: Prelims cum Mains\n\n(2) \u21d2 UPSC 2026: Prelims cum Mains\n\n(3) \u21d2 UPSC 2027 Prelims cum Mains\n\nTip: Know more about ClearIAS Courses (Online/Offline)\n\nThe above data clearly indicates that India constitutes a large number of small and marginal farmers.\n\nIt is beneficial in the context of India because:\n\nSRI paddy cultivation requires less quantity of seed per hectare. Mainstream paddy cultivation requires 20 kg of seed per acre but the System of Rice Intensification requires just 2 kg of seed per acre.\nThe requirement of seed comes down as the seed is sown in a square pattern at wider spacing. In the traditional method of cultivation, it requires approx 792,000 no. of plants per acre which will come down to 64,000 only in the System of Rice Intensification.\nThe area under rice cultivation has increased over the year but paddy is a water-intensive field that restricted its growth to several areas of the country and discourages its growth in less irrigated or not properly irrigated areas. SRI requires 15 to 20% less water for paddy production. So, SRI makes it viable for more areas to get indulge in rice cultivation.\nThis makes SRI cost-effective and most sustainable for small and marginal farmers.\nAdvantages of System of Rice Intensification\n\nSRI has several advantages:\n\nIt requires more organic manure, so dependency on chemicals will reduce, and due to lesser use of chemicals farmers\u2019 health will also improve.\nSoil health will also increase with time through biological activity.\nSRI provides Higher yield production of rice.\nMaturity time will be reduced by 10 days.\nLess water is required for SRI. Approx 15 to 20% of the water will be saved.\nit is less capital oriented so it will increase the income security of farmers.\nGrain weight increased without a change in grain size.\nDecreases dependency on chemical fertilizers and pesticides.\nResists insects because it allows rice to absorb soil nutrients naturally.\nThe SRI technique will help in the improvement of the food security of the country.\nDisadvantages of System of Rice Intensification\n\nThe technique of System of Rice Intensification (SRI) has several disadvantages:\n\nSRI is initially more labor-intensive.\nIt requires 50% more man-days for transplanting and weeding.\nInitially, it is difficult to acquire the necessary skills to master SRI.\nRequires some amount of irrigation, so it is not suitable for no irrigation areas.\nComparison Between Traditional Method and SRI\nIn the SRI technique, 22.34% more yield of rice is witnessed as compared to the traditional methods/other methods.\nNet total return per acre is higher in SRI as compared to other methods.\n15-20% less water is used during the production process.\nRice Cultivation in India\n\nRice is a Kharif crop and is a staple food of India. Over half of the world\u2019s population i.e, over 3 billion people consume rice every day.\n\nIndia is the second-largest producer and the largest exporter of rice.\n\nIn India, West Bengal is the largest producer of Rice followed by Uttar Pradesh.\n\nRice- Favourable Climatic Conditions\nIn India, rice is cultivated in a wide range of climatic conditions and at various altitudes.\nA hot and humid climate with an extended period of sunshine and water supply.\nThe growth pattern and yield of rice crops are all significantly influenced by temperature.\nIt requires an average temperature of 21 to 37 degrees Celsius.\nAlong with that, it requires an annual rainfall of between 150 to 300 cm.\n\nArticle Written By: Priti Raj"

Ever since its issuance, the Green Bond Market experienced an insane spike.\n\nGreen Bonds continue to be the most prevalent of the sustainability, social, and green bond-set among issuers worldwide.\nSocial bonds were displaced by sustainability bonds as the second most common type of bond issued this year in terms of dollars.\n\nCompanies, nations, and international organizations all offer green bonds, which guarantee fixed-income payments to investors while only funding initiatives that benefit the environment or the climate.\n\nThe initiatives could involve, among other things, green buildings, sustainable transportation, and renewable energy.\nThese bonds\u2019 earnings are designated for environmental projects. This is different from regular bonds, which allow the issuer to use the proceeds for a variety of things.\nWhat distinguishes green bonds from conventional bonds?\nThe revenues of regular bonds may be used for a variety of reasons at the issuer\u2019s discretion, whereas the proceeds of green bonds may only be used for environmental projects.\nGreen bond issuers are also required to provide details about the project they seek to fund, as well as any anticipated effects on the environment and the climate.\n\nAlso read: Electoral Bond Scheme\n\nSovereign Green Bonds Framework of India\n\nThe Framework closely follows India\u2019s \u201cPanchamrit\u201d pledges at the Conference of Parties (COP) 26 in Glasgow in November 2021.\n\nThrough this India\u2019s dedication to its Nationally Determined Contribution (NDC) targets, set forth under the Paris Agreement, would be further strengthened.\n\nTo approve important choices for the issuing of Sovereign Green Bonds, the Green Finance Working Committee (GFWC) was established.\n\nThe framework has received a \u201cGood\u201d governance score and a \u201cMedium Green\u201d rating from the independent second opinion provider CICERO in Norway.\n\nThe project or solution is given the \u201cMedium Green\u201d classification if it \u201crepresents important progress towards the long-term objective, but is not quite there yet.\u201d\n\nThe government said the green bonds\u2019 proceeds would be used for green projects that-\n\nEncourage energy efficiency\nReduce carbon emissions and greenhouse gases\nPromote climate resilience and adaptation\nImprove natural ecosystems and biodiversity, especially by the principles of sustainable development goals.\n\nThe framework listed investments in solar, wind, biomass, and hydro energy projects, urban mass transportation projects such as metro rail, green buildings, pollution prevention, and control projects.\n\nAll fossil fuel-related projects have been kept out of the framework, along with biomass-based renewable energy projects that rely on feedstock from protected areas.\nThe government also excluded projects such as nuclear power generation, and direct waste incineration.\n\nThe eligible expenditure is limited to government spending that occurred not more than 12 months before issuance.\n\nThe proceeds should be allocated to projects within 24 months of issuing the bonds.\nIf an eligible green project is postponed or canceled, it will be replaced by another eligible green project.\nBenefits of sovereign green bonds\n\nGovernments and authorities are sent a strong signal of intent about climate change and sustainable development by sovereign green issuance.\n\nIt will spur the growth of the local market and provide institutional investors with a boost.\nIt will facilitate the expansion of a local market by offering benchmark pricing, liquidity, and a demonstration effect for local issuers.\nSovereign issuance can help jump-start these significant capital inflows, with the IEA\u2019s World Energy Outlook 2021 projecting that 70% of the additional USD 4 trillion spending to reach net zero is necessary for emerging/developing nations.\n\nBenefits for investors are also manifold:\n\nDepending on the issuer and the location, tax incentives may include tax credits and tax exemptions.\nFacilitating direct investment in initiatives to enhance society and greening brown industries\nIncreased accountability and transparency regarding the use and management of income, which led to the creation of a new risk management instrument\nComparable financial gains plus benefits to society or the environment\nInvestors in Green Bonds would thereby gain additional tax advantages in addition to investment security.\nChallenges\n\nMaintaining liquidity and enabling trade in these bonds is the first challenge.\n\nAccording to the RBI, statutory liquidity ratio and repo transactions will be open to green bonds. These actions will support the preservation of liquidity and facilitate the trading of these bonds.\nTo assure liquidity, twin bonds can also be issued, as Denmark did. Two comparable and interchangeable bonds are issued under this arrangement, allowing investors to move between them and promoting increased trade and liquidity.\nBased on the twin bond strategy, the government and RBI previously issued market stabilization bonds.\n\nThe interest rate on these bonds is the second issue.\n\nWill investors pay more or less for green bonds of comparable maturity compared to regular bonds?\nMarket participants refer to the price differential between green bonds and regular bonds as \u201cgreenium.\u201d\nResearch by US Federal Reserve economists shows that corporate green bonds have a yield spread that is 8 basis points lower relative to conventional bonds.\nBefore investing, investors will require additional details about the green projects.\nGiven that investors will initially be unsure about factors like liquidity and tradability, there may initially be a \u201cgreen discount.\u201d\n\nThe third challenge is to make sure that green bonds continue to be a component of the budget and the broader borrowing program.\n\nSuch thematic bonds are frequently employed by the government off the balance sheet, which causes the total borrowings and deficits to be underestimated.\n\nAlso, investors worry about greenwashing as well.\n\nInvestors want to be sure that their resources are being allocated to projects that make a difference and have positive impacts.\nIn addition, financial factors such as macroeconomic outlook, credit profile, and political risks are relevant for investors when evaluating thematic bonds.\nSovereigns should take these factors into account when planning such green bond issuances.\nWay forward\n\nInterest in sovereign green bonds from countries and investors is growing. Considering the potential of this market, the World Bank surveyed emerging market trends and international investors to understand the prospects for such transactions which reiterated the trend.\n\nChallenges related to establishing governance arrangements to manage and track proceeds, knowledge of international standards and investor expectations, and the limited pool of eligible projects constrain the supply of emerging market sovereign thematic bonds.\n\nThe need for sovereigns to issue green bonds remains because of significant funding needs to implement actions related to climate, environment, and SDGs, yet challenges must be addressed.\n\nUnlocking the potential for sovereign thematic bonds in emerging and developing markets can only be achieved by clarifying market expectations and overcoming the knowledge gap.\n\nRelated article:\u00a0Social Impact Bonds\n\n-Article written by Swathi Satish"

India\u2019s finished steel consumption is anticipated to increase manifold in 2030-31. Read here to know the history and growth of the steel industry in India.\n\nMetal consumption has been one of the main driving causes behind industrialization.\n\nSteel has long held the top position among metals. Steel is both a raw material and an intermediary product, therefore its production and consumption are commonly used as indicators of a nation\u2019s economic success.\n\nTherefore, it would not be overstating the case to say that the steel industry is the backbone of any economy and has always been at the forefront of industrial advancement.\n\nThe steel industry in India is divided into three groups: primary producers, secondary producers, and large producers.\n\nTable of Contents\n\nHistory of the Steel industry in India\nIndian Steel Industry after independence\nSteel Industry in India\nChallenges\nGovernment initiatives for the steel sector\nRecent developments\nWay forward\nHistory of the Steel industry in India\n\nIndia was one of the first countries to practice manufacturing metals, as early as 1600 BCE. During the first millennium BCE, India experienced significant advancements in iron metallurgy.\n\n\ud83d\udc49 Which year are YOU targeting for success in the IAS/IPS/IFS Exam? \ud83d\ude80\n\n(1) \u21d2 UPSC 2025: Prelims cum Mains\n\n(2) \u21d2 UPSC 2026: Prelims cum Mains\n\n(3) \u21d2 UPSC 2027 Prelims cum Mains\n\nTip: Know more about ClearIAS Courses (Online/Offline)\n\nDuring this time of tranquil settlements, iron metallurgy was mastered and technology advanced.\n\nDuring the politically stable Maurya period (322\u2013185 BCE), major technological developments in the field of metallurgy were made. The first mention of iron use in India that was written in the West was by the Greek historian Herodotus (431\u2013425 BCE).\n\nHowever, the Iron and Steel industry did not establish its foundation in India until the year 1907.\n\nIn the early 1800s, efforts were launched in earnest to construct iron and steel production facilities.\n\nThe first attempt, made in 1808 by Mr. Duncan of the East India Company, failed miserably.\nJosiah Marshall Heath launched a second attempt in 1830 when he built the world\u2019s first iron and steel facility in Porto Novo, Madras. However, this plant was unable to succeed and was closed in 1860.\n\nThe Bengal Iron Company Ltd was established in 1926 and took over the Bengal Iron Works established in 1870. The company with the usage of better iron ore saw the first profits in the industry.\n\nJamsedji Nusserwanji Tata founded the modern-day Tata Steel, formerly known as TISCO, in Jamshedpur in the year 1907.\n\nTISCO was running the largest steel mill in the entire British Empire by 1939.\nCurrently, this corporation ranks as the seventh-largest steel manufacturer in the world and the top iron and steel producer in India.\nThe IISCO plant was set up in 1919 at Burnpur and in 1930 the Bengal Iron Company merged with IISCO.\n\nAlso read: Superconductivity\n\nIndian Steel Industry after independence\n\nPost-Independence India\u2019s steel industry has flourished tremendously. India produced an estimated 16.9 lakh tonnes of pig iron between 1950 and 1951.\n\nThe three major actors in the private sector under the first plan for iron and steel in India were TISCO, IISCO, and Mysore State Iron and Steel Works.\n\nThe Hindustan Steel Limited (HSL), a government-owned company, set up 3 plants in 1950. This company came into being through the efforts of Prime Minister Jawaharlal Nehru.\n\nHindustan Steel Limited was set up on January 19, 1954.\nHindustan Steel (HSL) was initially designed to manage only one plant that was coming up at Rourkela.\n\nHSL comprised four plants:\n\nBhilai Steel Plant\nRourkela Steel Plant\nDurgapur Steel Plant\nAlloy Steel Plant\n\nThe Steel Authority of India (SAIL) was launched in the year 1973. It is a government organization that manages all the major steel plants in India like Bhilai, Bokara, Rourkela, and Burnpur. This organization started managing Iron and Steel in 1976.\n\nThe Ministry of Steel and Mines drafted a policy statement to evolve a new model for managing industry in 1972.\nOn this basis, the concept of creating a holding company to manage inputs and outputs under one umbrella was mooted. This led to the formation of the Steel Authority of India Ltd.\nThe company, incorporated on January 24, 1973, was made responsible for managing five integrated steel plants at Bhilai, Bokaro, Durgapur, Rourkela, and Burnpur, the Alloy Steel Plant, and the Salem Steel Plant.\nIn 1978 SAIL was restructured as an operating company.\n\nThe growth in the Indian steel sector has been driven by the domestic availability of raw materials such as iron ore and cost-effective labor. Consequently, the steel sector has been a major contributor to India\u2019s manufacturing output.\n\nSteel Industry in India\nCourtesy: Maps of India\n\nIn the past 10\u201312 years, India\u2019s steel sector has expanded significantly. Production has increased by 75% since 2008, while domestic steel demand has increased by almost 80%. The capacity for producing steel has grown concurrently, and the rise has been largely organic.\n\nIndia is home to the fifth-highest reserves of iron ore in the world.\nAs of April 2022, India was the world\u2019s second-largest producer of crude steel.\nIn FY22, India\u2019s export rose by 25.1%, compared with 2021.\n\nThe steel industry and its associated mining and metallurgy sectors have seen major investments and developments in the recent past.\n\nIndia was the largest producer of Direct Reduced Iron (DRI) or Sponge Iron in the world in 2021.\nIndia is the 2nd largest consumer of finished steel preceded by China as the largest steel consumer as per the World Steel Association.\n\nIn September 2022, Steel Authority of India Limited (SAIL), a Maharatna PSU, supplied 30,000 tonnes of the entire DMR grade specialty steel for the nation\u2019s first indigenously built Aircraft Carrier INS Vikrant.\n\nChallenges\n\nThe secondary steel sector in India currently contributes over 40% of the total capacity and it will need to play a crucial role for India to reach 300 MT capacity.\n\nThe need is to identify challenges to capacity expansion in the country with a special focus on secondary steel and to correspondingly discuss suggestions on alleviating these.\n\nDespite being the 3rd largest steel consumer in the world, India has per capita steel consumption that is only one-third of the world\u2019s average.\nLow per capita consumption due to overall poverty compared to the world average decreases the incentive to set up huge plants to take advantage of economies of scale.\nDespite being a small share of imports by quantity, alloy, and stainless steel contribute disproportionately to the import bill by value.\nFew Indian entities can establish large factories to benefit from economies of scale utilizing the equity route because of their limited resources due to low per capita incomes. As a result, the majority of factories rely on borrowing and debt finance.\nIndia invests significantly less than the rest of the world in technology, research, and development. The same holds for the production and consumption of steel, as it has for many years.\nThe technology utilized in India up until recently needed a lot of power, was very dirty, and used a lot of water.\nIndia is at a disadvantage when it comes to producing steel the way it wants to due to a lack of electricity. With the correct balance of thermal and renewable energy, there might be some relief.\nFor every tonne of iron ore extracted, there is a lot less coal available, necessitating coal imports to maintain captive power plants. India receives coal primarily from Australia and Indonesia. Australia has been increasing its coal costs, which has a direct impact on the cost of iron and steel in India.\nGovernment initiatives for the steel sector\n\nSome of the recent Government initiatives in this sector are:\n\nNational Steel Policy (NSP) 2017: The new Steel Policy enshrines the long-term vision of the Government to give impetus to the steel sector.\n\nIt seeks to enhance domestic steel consumption and ensure high-quality steel production and create a technologically advanced and globally competitive steel industry.\nThe policy also envisages domestically meeting the entire demand for high-grade automotive steel, electrical steel, special steels, and alloys for strategic applications and increasing domestic availability of washed coking coal to reduce import dependence on coking coal from about 85% to around 65% by 2030-31.\n\nThe Government has also announced a policy for providing preference to domestically manufactured Iron & Steel products in Government procurement.\n\nThe government has also approved a Production-linked Incentive (PLI) Scheme for Specialty Steel. It is expected that specialty steel production will become 42 million tonnes by the end of 2026-27.\nThe Ministry of Steel is facilitating the setting up of an industry-driven Steel Research and Technology Mission of India (SRTMI) in association with the public and private sector steel companies to spearhead research and development activities in the iron and steel industry.\nThe Government of India raised import duty on most steel items twice, each time by 2.5%, and imposed measures including anti-dumping and safeguard duties on iron and steel items.\nRecent developments\n\nIndia\u2019s 1st Green Hydrogen Plant in the Stainless Steel Sector, located at Jindal Stainless Limited, Hisar was inaugurated in March 2024.\n\nIt will be the\u00a0world\u2019s first off-grid Green Hydrogen plant\u00a0for the\u00a0stainless steel industry\u00a0and the\u00a0world\u2019s first Green Hydrogen plant\u00a0with\u00a0rooftop & floating solar.\nThis project is also a state-of-the-art green hydrogen facility with a target to reduce carbon emissions considerably by around\u00a02,700 Metric Tonnes per annum\u00a0and\u00a054,000 tons of CO2 emissions over the next two decades.\nWay forward\n\nGiven the importance of a wide range of sectors on steel production as India strives to become a manufacturing powerhouse through governmental initiatives like Make in India, the steel industry in India has emerged as a key emphasis area.\n\nIndia ranks as the world\u2019s second-largest producer of steel and is on track to surpass China as the world\u2019s second-largest consumer of steel, with the sector contributing around 2% of the country\u2019s GDP.\n\nIndia continues to employ concrete in the majority of its structures, despite its enormous population and several incentives to experiment with different methods.\n\nSteel is used far more frequently to construct columns and buildings in the West, the Gulf, and other settled areas.\nUsing steel van produce higher skyscrapers, requires considerably less time to assemble, requires much less maintenance, and helps lower the weight of projects.\nThere are numerous examples, including the Empire State Building in New York, the Taipei 101 Tower in Taiwan, the U.S. Steel Tower in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, the Shun Hing Square Tower in Shenzhen, China, and the Burj Khalifa in Dubai, which is the most well-known of them all.\n\nIndia\u2019s export production capability and industry both have the potential to aid the country in regaining a favorable steel trade balance.\n\nIndia\u2019s relatively low per capita steel consumption and the anticipated increase in demand due to rising infrastructure construction and the flourishing automobile and railroad sectors present enormous growth potential.\n\nRead:\u00a0Green steel\n\n-Article written by Swathi Satish"

What are the difficulties of charging agricultural Income Taxation in India? Read further to know more.\n\nNearly all nations, especially developing ones where agriculture is still a large industry and provides employment and a means of subsistence for a sizable portion of the population.\n\nIn India, agriculture is regarded to be the Country\u2019s main occupation. India\u2019s sizable rural population frequently serves as their sole source of income. For its basic food needs, the nation as a whole is totally dependent on agriculture. The government has implemented several programs, laws, and other steps to encourage expansion in this industry.\n\nUntil now, governments have resisted efforts to impose taxes on farmers\u2019 income.\n\nTable of Contents\n\nCurrent status\nWhy Should Agriculture Income be Taxed?\nRecommendations to Tax Agricultural Income\nDifficulty in Taxing Agriculture Income\nProposal to Raise Agriculture Tax\nWay Forward\nConclusion\nCurrent status\n\nAgricultural income is not taxable under Section 10 (1) of the Income Tax Act since it is not included in a person\u2019s total income. However, if agricultural revenue surpasses Rs.5,000 per year, the state government may levy a tax on it. It is classified as a legal source of income and essentially refers to revenue from sources including commercial agricultural produce, structures on or connected to the agricultural property, and agricultural land itself.\n\nWhether or not agricultural income should be taxed is a matter of debate and can depend on a variety of factors such as the size and profitability of the farm, government policies and economic conditions.\n\n\ud83d\udc49 Which year are YOU targeting for success in the IAS/IPS/IFS Exam? \ud83d\ude80\n\n(1) \u21d2 UPSC 2025: Prelims cum Mains\n\n(2) \u21d2 UPSC 2026: Prelims cum Mains\n\n(3) \u21d2 UPSC 2027 Prelims cum Mains\n\nTip: Know more about ClearIAS Courses (Online/Offline)\n\nSome argue that taxing agricultural income could discourage small farmers and lead to a concentration of ownership, while others argue that it would create a more level playing field for businesses and generate revenue for government programs.\n\nUltimately, the decision on whether or not to tax agricultural income is typically made by the government and can be influenced by various factors.\n\nWhy Should Agriculture Income be Taxed?\nEven in the 1980s, there was discussion in India about how to properly tax the agricultural industry because many farmers earn more money than non-agriculturalists who pay income tax.\nThe excess produced in the regions where the Green Revolution took place is frittered away on ostentatious expenditure. Therefore, the government must utilize taxation to collect a portion of these surpluses.\nProper taxation of agriculture is required for better land utilization. Progressive taxation of agricultural land or agricultural revenue is anticipated to result in a decline in land values.\nThe numerous agricultural development projects being implemented require a significant financial investment. India\u2019s agriculture has undergone significant modernization, and there is taxable capacity as well as increased output has occurred.\nThere is underutilized taxable capacity in the agricultural industry as a result of improved inter-sectoral terms of trade.\nFarm taxes would encourage financial stability and gradually include more and more areas in the monetized sector.\nJapan derived a significant portion of its industrialization resources from agriculture. China and the Soviet Union also did.\nUtilize resources from this industry to mobilize the supplies needed to hasten the expansion of agricultural output.\nTaxing agricultural income might increase a big portion of farmers\u2019 access to financing because verified income tax returns can give a reliable indication of a farmer\u2019s future earnings.\nSmall and marginal farmers will demand improved services, infrastructure, and facilities if agricultural income is taxed.\nAdditionally, it will provide farmers in this nation a strong incentive to form associations, demand accountability, and try to influence development debates rather than just accept their status as beneficiaries.\nFarmers in the nation will be able to form the habit of saving for their bright future in the years to come if income tax is collected on agricultural income, particularly because the income-tax provision gives tax deductions on specific investments etc.\nRecommendations to Tax Agricultural Income\n\nDr. K.N. Raj presided over the Committee on Agriculture Taxation in 1975. The committee\u2019s recommendation was to tax wealthy individuals\u2019 agricultural revenue.\n\nDr B.D. Ambedkar, a man of imposing personality and profound vision, supported taxing agricultural revenue with his persuasive arguments.\n\nDifficulty in Taxing Agriculture Income\nFamily labour plays a significant role in the revenue-generating process in agriculture, which is typically a sole proprietorship. The issue of depreciation and capital replacement is more difficult to solve.\nLarge annual revenue fluctuations, a lack of monthly periodicity in collections, and the integration of production, transportation, and sale of products make it challenging to develop an agricultural income tax.\nWhen considering taxing agricultural income in light of the rising suicide rate among agriculturalists, some may be concerned that this will lead to an increase in agriculturalist suicides.\nAssessing an Indian farmer\u2019s true income or income-earning potential becomes difficult because a large portion of them are illiterate or semi-literate and do not keep systematic books of accounts regarding their production and income.\nIt is also possible to worry that the imposition of tax will result in credit only going to large farmers because they have more income to demonstrate.\nProposal to Raise Agriculture Tax\n\nTax officials specifically recommended that the government think about taxing agricultural revenue, albeit only partially.\n\nPeople with agricultural income and regular income who earn more than a particular amount can be brought into the tax system.\n\nFix a progressive tax for other farmers and exclude 71% of farmers who have 5 acres or less from land revenue.\n\nAdditionally, the government may not tax agricultural income that is produced from the cultivation of rice, wheat, and vegetables.\n\nLet the government begin collecting agricultural revenue, particularly that of wealthy farmers, and then let it examine the impact, the tax collection, and the issues before coming up with a change to agricultural tax income.\n\nIt is true that taxing agricultural income is a State issue, but just as the Government debated the GST with the States, it is time for it to do the same with taxing agricultural income.\n\nIt is highly believed that if agricultural income is taxed and if the taxation policy is created in a very rational manner, it will not negatively affect the average farmer.\n\nThe government should invest all income-tax proceeds from taxing agricultural revenue towards the expansion of agricultural operations in the first two to three years.\n\nWay Forward\n\nIn order to debate and examine the issues surrounding the taxes on agricultural income in India, it is necessary for all political parties and Chief Ministers to arrange a conclave.\n\nThe focus of the conversation should be on the direction of the country, not on one person\u2019s personal interests or those of a certain political party.\n\nIf there is this kind of debate or discussion in the nation, then policymakers may be able to determine that after decades of agricultural revenue being exempt from taxation, it is now time for agricultural income to be taxed like any other normal income of the taxpayer.\n\nTaxing the product is one solution, which is currently also being done in some States through a mandi tax or another mechanism.\n\nThe consumer will ultimately pay more for the product as a result of this tax being passed forward to them.\n\nBy taking this action, it will be made sure that the tax does not interfere with the farmer\u2019s revenue. In a strict sense, this would be an indirect tax on goods, similar to an excise or sales tax, which will be incorporated into the GST. The farmer\u2019s income will continue to be exempt from income tax.\n\nBefore there is even consideration of including the sector in the income tax net, the procurement policy, price policy, and public distribution system must be taken into account.\n\nDeveloping a technique that considers agricultural income above a particular threshold is necessary.\n\nRegardless of whether one is a farmer, income taxes are required to be paid if one\u2019s income exceeds a certain threshold. Regardless matter whether they are in agriculture, the poor should be exempt.\n\nAlso read: Pulses Production in India; Agriculture export policy\n\nConclusion\n\nRich farmers would be obliged to pay income tax if the government decided to tax agricultural income, which would enhance government revenue, boost the country\u2019s GDP ratio, and ultimately aid in the overall development of the nation.\n\nEvery political party should keep in mind that the nation comes first, not simply vote politics if they truly wish to tax agricultural income in India.\n\nCurrently, farmers in India are exempted from paying income tax to the government. However, if agricultural revenue surpasses Rs.5,000 per year, the state government may levy a tax on it. It is classified as a legal source of income. I think it is a good decision taken by the government to support low-income farmers and reduce their burden of taxation, However, the Government should be ready to levy tax on farmers who earn higher incomes from Agriculture.\n\nFor More Related Notes: Click Here\n\nArticle written by Aryadevi E S"

Read further to know more.\n\nTo achieve the goals of openness & investor friendliness in the business environment of the nation, the Central Government recently modified the regulations related to Nidhi corporations under the Companies Act, 2013, and the Rules.\n\nNidhi firms were founded to encourage members to practise thrift and save money, as well as to accept deposits and lend money to them only for their mutual advantage.\n\nTable of Contents\n\nWhat are Nidhi Companies?\nRestrictions for Nidhi Company\nNidhi Vs NBFC Vs RBI\nMandatory requirements to form/incorporate a Nidhi company\nGoverning laws:\nNew Amended Rules\nBenefits\nChallenges in India\nConclusion\nWhat are Nidhi Companies?\nA Non-Banking Financial Company (NBFC) recognised under section 406 of the 2013 Companies Act is the Nidhi Company. It was established to lend and borrow money from its members.\nNidhis are also categorised as Non-Banking Financial Companies because they mostly operate in the unorganised money market.\nThey are also referred to as Mutual Benefit Companies, Benefit Funds, Mutual Benefit Funds, and Permanent Funds. They are governed by the Ministry of Corporate Affairs, which has the authority to provide them with instructions about their deposit acceptance operations.\nBefore the Corporations Act of 2013, Nidhi already existed. These businesses primarily operate in the southern region of the nation. Tamil Nadu is home to 80% of Nidhi businesses.\nIts name should end with \u201cNidhi Limited\u201d since it is registered as a public business.\nNidhi corporations can only have individual members, and they are not permitted to lend money to other businesses.\nSome examples of Nidhi companies include Maben Nidhi Ltd, Mini Muthoot Nidhi kerala Ltd etc\nRestrictions for Nidhi Company\n\nA Nidhi Company shall not:\n\nConduct chit fund, hire purchase, leasing, insurance, or securities acquisition operations by any body corporate.\nIssue debt instruments or preference shares.\nOpen any current account with its participants.\nAcquire any company by way of purchase of securities or controlling the composition of directors unless approval has been taken from the regional director.\nEngage in any activity other than the name-giving business of borrowing and lending.\nOther than its members, accept deposits from and lend to anyone else.\nAccept deposits from or extend credit to any corporation.\nEngage in any type of cooperation agreement when it comes to borrowing or lending.\nSend out a solicitation for the deposit in an advertisement.\nPay any commission or incentive for obtaining member deposits or for approving loans.\nImpose a fee for the issuance of its shares or only issue up to 10 shares per depositor.\nGrant loans to members who exceed the cap by the 2014 Nidhi guidelines.\nInterest rates that are higher than 7.5 per cent.\nNot declare a dividend that is higher than 25%.\nNidhi Vs NBFC Vs RBI\n\nThe NBFC Company is a business that was created under the Companies Act of 2013 to offer consumers long-term and specialised credit facilities. When it comes to supplying the financial needs of businesses and the less fortunate members of society, NBFC functions much like a bank. Without acquiring an NBFC registration from the RBI, NBFC cannot start its business.\n\nNidhis are under one kind of NBFC, hence RBI has the authority to provide them with instructions on their deposit acceptance activities. However, the RBI has exempted the notified Nidhis from the basic requirements of the RBI Act and other directives applicable to NBFCs in recognition of the fact that these Nidhis only interact with its shareholder-members.\n\n\ud83d\udc49 Which year are YOU targeting for success in the IAS/IPS/IFS Exam? \ud83d\ude80\n\n(1) \u21d2 UPSC 2025: Prelims cum Mains\n\n(2) \u21d2 UPSC 2026: Prelims cum Mains\n\n(3) \u21d2 UPSC 2027 Prelims cum Mains\n\nTip: Know more about ClearIAS Courses (Online/Offline)\n\nMandatory requirements to form/incorporate a Nidhi company\nIn contrast to other forms of financial companies like NBFC, which need an RBI licence to launch, Nidhi company registration is less complicated and more straightforward.\nShould have a minimum paid-up capital of Rs. 5 lacs and be a public company.\nwon\u2019t be issuing preference shares.\nShall include \u201cNidhi Limited\u201d in its name as a final word.\nA minimum of three directors must be Nidhi Company members.\n7 shareholders are required.\nGoverning laws:\nThe Nidhi Rules, 2014 govern Nidhi institutions. As a result of its incorporation as a public limited company, they are required to abide by two sets of rules: the Nidhi rules of 2014 and the public limited company requirements under the Companies Act of 2013.\nThe RBI has specifically exempted this category of NBFC in India from complying with its basic provisions, including registration with the RBI, hence no clearance from the RBI is required to register the company.\nEvery Nidhi organisation must make sure that it has 200 members or more within a year of its founding.\nNew Amended Rules\n\nThe government has altered the regulations governing Nidhi enterprises to safeguard the public\u2019s interests, making certain firms\u2019 prior declarations necessary before they begin receiving deposits.\n\nRegistration: The entity must initially register as a public limited company, which has higher disclosure obligations than a private limited company, to become a Nidhi.\nDeclaration: A public company that has a share capital of one million must first apply to the Union government to be recognised as a Nidhi.\nThe Central Government may proclaim a company a Nidhi company in the official gazette after receiving an application from a public corporation that is certain the company has complied with all rules.\nAccording to Section 406 of the revised Firms Act and the Nidhi regulations, Nidhi companies must submit Form NDH-4 requests to the Central Government for updates to their status as Nidhi Companies.\nMembership: This can be accomplished by applying within 120 days of the organization\u2019s creation that demonstrates a minimum membership of 200 and net owned funds of 2 million.\nThe promoters and directors of the company must adhere to the regulations\u2019 definition of a fit and proper person.\nConcept of deemed approval: In other words, approval would be assumed granted if the company does not get word of the application\u2019s outcome within 45 days of applying.\nNo Loans to companies: It is only permitted to have individual members and cannot lend money to businesses.\nBenefits\nVery Easy formation: The process of forming a Nidhi firm is relatively straightforward, and it is considerably less complex than forming an NBFC or another type of financial institution.\nCost-Efficient Registration:\u00a0 The cost of signing up with Nidhi Company is reasonable. You can invest the Rs 5,00,000 lakh required as minimum capital for Nidhi Company registration within two months of registering your Nidhi Company.\nNo RBI Regulations \u2013 less compliance: Nidhi Company is not required to adhere to strict compliances by the RBI.\nMore Certainty in Nidhi company: Everyone in India enjoys saving money, from men in their 60s to toddlers as young as six. Additionally, the company\u2019s major goal is to encourage its members to save regularly, therefore it is certain to remain in business as long as its members continue to do so.\nLess level of Risk \u2013 Non-payment loans:\u00a0 It is the most secure method of loan distribution, and the rates charged on loans to members are extremely cheap when compared to those charged by other lenders, further increasing member savings.\nNet owned fund- Invest one gets twenty: The owner\u2019s capital investment in the company to raise funds is referred to as the net owned fund. You invest one rupee and raise the deposit of twenty, according to the net owned fund ratio of 1:20.\nChallenges in India\nMember specificity: As previously mentioned, Nidhi Companies can only accept deposits from and lend money to its shareholders and members.\nNo outsider can deposit money: This will restrict the amount of money a Nidhi Company can raise. The amount received by Nidhi Companies from their members, if less, restricts the Company\u2019s ability to lend money to its members because Nidhi Companies does not accept deposits from parties other than its members and shareholders.\nlimited lending capacity: If a Nidhi Company\u2019s lending capability is constrained, the entire purpose of the Nidhi Company\u2019s establishment is defeated.\nNo advertisement: Nidhi Companies are prohibited from publicising their depositing plans, unlike other financial institutions. Only among its members are Nidhi Companies permitted to run advertisements.\nSingle ownership: Nidhi Companies are only allowed to conduct lending and borrowing activities under their names only.\nTime boundness: A Nidhi is only permitted to operate its deposit plans for a maximum of five years.\nConclusion\n\nNidhi Companies as well as some limits connected with it, it may be determined that Nidhi Companies\u2019 advantages unquestionably outweigh their disadvantages. Nidhi Companies have recently been popular in the financial markets due to the range of advantages they offer.\n\nEven those with middle-class incomes can afford the capital needed to form a Nidhi. Furthermore, compared to other financial institutions, the registration process for a Nidhi Company is extremely simple and necessitates less paperwork.\n\nArticle written by Aseem Muhammed"

The investment models can speak about how to put the money in assets.\n\nInvesting in productive assets can be in the form of Public Sources (Government), Private Sources (Corporate) or Combined Sources (Public Private Partnership or PPP).\n\nTable of Contents\n\nWhat is Public-Private Partnership (PPP)?\nAdvantages of Public-Private Partnership (PPP)\nPublic-Private Partnership (PPP) models\nBOT (Build\u2013Operate\u2013Transfer):\nBOO (Build\u2013Own\u2013Operate):\nBOOT (Build\u2013Own\u2013Operate\u2013Transfer):\nBLT (Build-Lease-Transfer):\nBOLT (Build\u2013Own\u2013Lease\u2013Transfer):\nDBFO (Design\u2013Build\u2013Finance\u2013Operate):\nLDO (Lease\u2013Develop\u2013Operate):\nDCMF (Design\u2013Construct\u2013Manage\u2013Finance):\nOMT (Operate\u2013Maintain\u2013Transfer):\nSome other types of Public-private-partnership (PPP) Models\nManagement Contract Model\nLease Contract Model\nBOT Annuity\nEngineering-Procurement-Construction(EPC) Model\nHybrid Annuity Model (HAM)\nVijay Kelkar Committee Report on Revisiting and Revitalising Public-private-partnership (PPP) Model\nConclusion\nWhat is Public-Private Partnership (PPP)?\n\nA public-private partnership (PPP) unites the public and private sectors to carry out a project or offer a service that is typically handled by the public sector.\n\nPublic-private partnerships (PPPs) come in a variety of shapes and sizes, depending on the private party\u2019s level of involvement and risk tolerance. Normally, the conditions of a PPP are outlined in a contract or agreement to specify the obligations of each partner and allocate risk.\n\nWhen private-sector technology and creativity are combined with public-sector incentives to finish projects on schedule and within budget, these collaborations are successful.\n\nAdvantages of Public-Private Partnership (PPP)\nThe benefit of a PPP is that when appropriate cooperative agreements between the public and private sectors are employed, the management abilities and financial savvy of private enterprises may result in better value for money for taxpayers.\nWhen a project is funded through a public-private partnership, it can either be completed sooner or become feasible because investments are made by the private sector entity for a predetermined amount of time.\nPublic services may become more effective, efficient, and competitive as a result of PPP. In a situation when there are budgetary constraints, it can raise additional funding and supplement the limited public sector capacities.\nPPP does not constitute privatisation because it entails the government\u2019s complete retention of responsibility for delivering the services. The division of risk between the public institution and the private sector is clearly defined.\nThe private company is chosen through an open, competitive bidding process and is compensated depending on performance.\nIn developing nations when governments are constrained in their ability to borrow money for significant projects, the PPP approach may be an alternative.\nIt may also provide the necessary knowledge for large-scale project planning or execution.\nPublic-Private Partnership (PPP) models\n\nCommonly adopted models of PPPs include Build-Operate-Transfer (BOT), Build-Own-Operate (BOO), Build-Operate-Lease-Transfer (BOLT), Design-Build-Operate-Transfer (DBFOT), Lease-Develop-Operate (LDO), Operate-Maintain-Transfer (OMT), etc.\n\n\ud83d\udc49 Which year are YOU targeting for success in the IAS/IPS/IFS Exam? \ud83d\ude80\n\n(1) \u21d2 UPSC 2025: Prelims cum Mains\n\n(2) \u21d2 UPSC 2026: Prelims cum Mains\n\n(3) \u21d2 UPSC 2027 Prelims cum Mains\n\nTip: Know more about ClearIAS Courses (Online/Offline)\n\nThese models are different on the levels of investment, ownership control, risk sharing, technical collaboration, duration, financing etc.\n\nBOT (Build\u2013Operate\u2013Transfer):\nIt follows a standard PPP paradigm where the private partner is in charge of designing, constructing, operating (during the agreed-upon period), and handing back the facility to the public sector.\nThe project\u2019s private sector partner must provide the funding and assume responsibility for its construction and upkeep (usually a greenfield project).\nThe public sector will permit business partners to charge users for services.\nA key illustration of the BOT concept is the national highway projects that NHAI has leased out under the PPP form.\nBOO (Build\u2013Own\u2013Operate):\nAccording to this approach, a private entity will retain ownership of the newly constructed facility.\nThe public sector partner consents to \u201cbuy\u201d the goods and services delivered by the project on mutually acceptable terms and circumstances.\nBOOT (Build\u2013Own\u2013Operate\u2013Transfer):\nIn this BOT form, the project is turned over to the government or a private operator after the agreed-upon period.\nHighway and port construction utilises the BOOT concept.\nBLT (Build-Lease-Transfer):\nThe asset is leased to the public entity for a medium duration and is owned by the private company.\nIn this case, the public entity is in charge of financing the investment.\nBOLT (Build\u2013Own\u2013Lease\u2013Transfer):\nIn this strategy, the government grants a building concession to a private company (and possibly designs it as well).\nThe facility may be owned by a private business, which may then lease it to the public sector and transfer ownership of the facility to the government after the lease term.\nDBFO (Design\u2013Build\u2013Finance\u2013Operate):\nAccording to this approach, the private party is solely responsible for the project\u2019s design, building, financing, and operation throughout the concession period.\nLDO (Lease\u2013Develop\u2013Operate):\nIn this kind of investment arrangement, the public sector organisation or the government keeps ownership of the newly built infrastructure facility and receives payments under the conditions of a lease with the private promoter.\nIt is primarily used for developing airport facilities.\nA private partner is in charge of designing, constructing, operating (during the agreed-upon period) and handing over the facility to the public sector. This is a typical public-private partnership model.\nDBOT is a variant of the build-operate-transfer (BOT) contract model where the contractor is responsible for both the project\u2019s design and construction. Because it identifies a single point of accountability for delivering the project and seeing it through to operation, this approach may be appealing to some clients.\nThe DBOT contract is different from a design build finance and operations (DBFO) contract, in which the contractor also finances the project and leases it to the client for a predetermined amount of time (perhaps 30 years), after which the development reverts to the customer.\nDCMF (Design\u2013Construct\u2013Manage\u2013Finance):\nIn this case, the asset is constructed and run by the private sector for a predetermined time. This time frame can range from 20 to 50 years. For renting out the asset at that time, the Government pays the contractor.\nBy diverting public spending from significant infrastructure development projects, this model may help establish funding sources for other public initiatives.\nThe following are some examples of DCMF PPP models: jails, courts, public hospitals, etc.\nOMT (Operate\u2013Maintain\u2013Transfer):\nThe OMT model is comparable to the BOT model, with the exception that, unlike the BOT model, OMT does not call for the concessionaire for a project.\nFor a predetermined amount of time, the concessionaire is responsible for maintenance under the OMT model.\nSome other types of Public-private-partnership (PPP) Models\n\nDifferent types of PPP include Concessions, Leases / Affermage, Full Divestiture, Contract Plans, and Performance Contracts.\n\nManagement Contract Model\nIn this model, a public facility or service is managed, either entirely or in part, by a private organisation.\nIn this approach, the public body (government) retains ownership of the asset or facility, but a private firm takes over the day-to-day management of the facility.\nThe private entity\u2019s risk exposure is minimal because it is not obligated to make any capital expenditures and is permitted to charge a set fee.\nLease Contract Model\nAccording to this concept, the asset is leased, depending on the circumstance, to either a private organisation or a public entity.\nThe private organisation is permitted to generate income through operations.\nBOT Annuity\nThis technique is used to construct roadways, mostly for NHAI projects where the possibility for revenue generation is low.\nThe asset must be designed, constructed, managed, and maintained by the private business. The private entity\u2019s risk is minimal, though, as it consistently receives a fixed amount as an annuity from the public entity throughout the contract.\nEngineering-Procurement-Construction(EPC) Model\nIn this model, the asset is designed, financed, and constructed by the private entity.\nThe public agency that built the asset eventually receives ownership of it. The public entity pays the private entity a lump amount in exchange for playing the role; the private business is not responsible for operations and management.\nThe NHAI is constructing highways with the use of this model.\nHybrid Annuity Model (HAM)\nIn this arrangement, the private company is required to invest the remaining 40% of the project cost after paying 40% of it from the public entity.\nThe public company continues to be in charge of ownership and operations; the private business is simply required to contribute engineering knowledge.\nVijay Kelkar Committee Report on Revisiting and Revitalising Public-private-partnership (PPP) Model\nIn the Union Budget 2015\u201316, the Finance Minister stated that the PPP method of infrastructure development has to be reviewed and reinvigorated.\nIn response to this declaration, Dr Vijay Kelkar served as the chair of the Committee on Revisiting & Revitalizing the PPP Model of Infrastructure Development.\nConclusion\n\nThe Government of India defined the public-private partnership (PPP or 3P) as a commercial legal relationship in 2011. The User-fee based BOT model, Performance-based management/maintenance contracts, and Modified design-build (turnkey) contracts are three examples of PPPs that are recognised by the Indian government.\n\nNumerous PPP projects are now being implemented across the nation at various stages. PPPs are actively being promoted by the Indian government in many different economic sectors.\n\nArticle written by Aseem Muhammed"

The government envision a prosperous and inclusive India, in which the fruits of development reach all regions and citizens, especially our youth, women, farmers, OBCs, Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes.\n\nIn the 75th year of our Independence, the world recognised the Indian economy as a \u2018bright star\u2019. Our current year\u2019s economic growth is estimated to be at 7 per cent. It is notable that this is the highest among all the major economies.\n\n\ud83d\udc49 Which year are YOU targeting for success in the IAS/IPS/IFS Exam? \ud83d\ude80\n\n(1) \u21d2 UPSC 2025: Prelims cum Mains\n\n(2) \u21d2 UPSC 2026: Prelims cum Mains\n\n(3) \u21d2 UPSC 2027 Prelims cum Mains\n\nTip: Know more about ClearIAS Courses (Online/Offline)\n\nThis is in spite of the massive slowdown globally caused by Covid-19 and the war. The Indian economy is therefore on the right track, and despite a time of challenges, heading towards a bright future.\n\nToday, as Indians stands with their head, held high, and the world appreciates India\u2019s achievements and successes, we are sure that elders who fought for India\u2019s independence, will with joy, bless us in our endeavours going forward.\n\nSeven Key Priorities\n\nThe Budget adopts the following seven priorities. They complement each other and act as the \u2018Saptarishi\u2019 guiding us through the Amrit Kaal.\n\nInclusive Development\nReaching the Last Mile\nInfrastructure and Investment\nUnleashing the Potential\nGreen Growth\nYouth Power\nFinancial Sector\nPriority 1: Inclusive Development\n\nThe Government\u2019s philosophy of Sabka Saath Sabka Vikas has facilitated inclusive development covering in specific, farmers, women, youth, OBCs, Scheduled Castes, Scheduled Tribes, divyangjan and economically weaker sections, and overall priority for the underprivileged (vanchiton ko variyata). There has also been a sustained focus on Jammu & Kashmir, Ladakh and the Northeast. This Budget builds on those efforts.\n\nAGRICULTURE AND COOPERATION\n\nThe following are the important initiatives in this regard\n\nDIGITAL PUBLIC INFRASTRUCTURE FOR AGRICULTURE\n\nDigital public infrastructure for agriculture will be built as an open source, open standard and interoperable public good. This will enable inclusive, farmer-centric solutions through relevant information services for crop planning and health, improved access to farm inputs, credit, and insurance, help for crop estimation, market intelligence, and support for the growth of the agri-tech industry and start-ups.\n\nAGRICULTURE ACCELERATOR FUND\n\nAn Agriculture Accelerator Fund will be set up to encourage Agri startups by young entrepreneurs in rural areas. The Fund will aim at bringing innovative and affordable solutions for challenges faced by farmers. It will also bring in modern technologies to transform agricultural practices and increase productivity and profitability.\n\nENHANCING THE PRODUCTIVITY OF COTTON CROP\n\nTo enhance the productivity of extra-long staple cotton, we will adopt a cluster-based and value chain approach through Public Private\nPartnerships (PPP).

Read further to know more.\n\nThe goal of the Gold Monetization Scheme is to mobilise the country\u2019s idle gold that is held in homes, institutions, corporations, and temple trusts, make it easier to employ it for productive purposes, and ultimately lessen the country\u2019s dependency on gold imports.\n\nTable of Contents\n\nWhat is the Gold Monetization Scheme?\nObjectives of the Gold Monetization Scheme\nBenefits of the Gold Monetization Scheme\nSome of the key features of the Gold Monetization Scheme\nCharacteristics of the Gold Monetization Scheme\nDeposit flexibility\nDeposit quantity flexibility\nA tenure that is convenient for you\nAttractive interest rates\nCalculating interest in Gold Monetization Scheme\nWithdrawal of the deposit\nVerification of purity\nWhat are the setback factors of the scheme?\nSolution\nWhat is the Gold Monetization Scheme?\nOn November 5, 2015, the Indian government unveiled the Gold Monetization Scheme (GMS), a programme designed to monetize the gold that is currently stored in Indian households and put it to useful use.\nThe Gold Monetization Scheme makes it possible for gold depositors to receive interest payments on their metal accounts. The gold begins to earn interest as soon as it is placed in the metal account.\nA depositor who makes a short-term deposit of between one and three years will receive 2.25% interest yearly under the plan. The interest rate for medium- and long-term deposits is 2.5 per cent.\nThe government also announced the launch of the Sovereign Gold Bond Scheme and the creation of the Indian Gold Coin in addition to the Gold Monetization Scheme.\n\nAlso read: Coinage of India: Coins used in Ancient India\n\nObjectives of the Gold Monetization Scheme\n\nThe Gold Monetisation Scheme (GMS) is an initiative by the Government of India to mobilise the gold held by households and institutions in the country to put this gold into productive use and, in the long run, to reduce the current account deficit by reducing the country\u2019s reliance on gold imports to meet the domestic demand.\n\nThe following are some of the main goals of the Gold Monetization Scheme:\n\nmobilisation of the gold that is held by the country\u2019s numerous households.\nto lessen gold imports to supply domestic demand.\nto provide gold loans from banks to assist and enhance the gold and jewellery sectors.\nto give depositors certificates stating the quantity and purity of gold they have placed.\n\nAlso read: Ambergris: The Floating Gold\n\nBenefits of the Gold Monetization Scheme\nThe Gold Deposit Scheme (GDS), which had been in place since 1999, was replaced by the Gold Monetization Scheme. The programme enables gold depositors to receive interest at a rate of 2.25% per year on short-term deposits between one and three years.\nFor medium- and long-term deposits, the depositors receive an interest rate of 2.5 per cent. The programme, which was introduced in 2015, guarantees the mobilisation of gold owned by various Indian families and institutions.\nThe gold monetization plan\u2019s profits are exempt from capital gains tax. Wealth and income taxes are not applied to capital gains.\nLarge Indian families have a tremendous opportunity to profit from outdated jewellery kept away in safe deposit boxes and bank vaults thanks to the Gold Monetization Scheme. This method can be used by businesses, trusts, jewellers, and gold hoarders to profit from their precious metals.\nBut be aware that you won\u2019t get your jewellery back in the exact condition that you gave it to us; instead, you\u2019ll get cash or gold coins and bars that you may use to buy things later.\nSome of the key features of the Gold Monetization Scheme\nThe programme offers no maximum investment limit for short-term bank deposits (1-3 years), medium-term deposits (5-7 years), and long-term government deposits (12-15 years).\nUnder this programme, a gold bar, coin, or piece of jewellery weighing no less than 30 grammes of raw gold may be deposited.\nThe programme permits early withdrawal following a required lock-in period. It does, however, impose a fee for such withdrawals.\nThe Gold Monetization Scheme offers an interest rate of 2.50% annually, which is higher than the rates provided by earlier gold investments.\nThe programme also provides the option to redeem short-term deposits for gold or dollars at the going rate.\n\nAlso read: Bureau of Indian Standards\n\n\ud83d\udc49 Which year are YOU targeting for success in the IAS/IPS/IFS Exam? \ud83d\ude80\n\n(1) \u21d2 UPSC 2025: Prelims cum Mains\n\n(2) \u21d2 UPSC 2026: Prelims cum Mains\n\n(3) \u21d2 UPSC 2027 Prelims cum Mains\n\nTip: Know more about ClearIAS Courses (Online/Offline)\n\nCharacteristics of the Gold Monetization Scheme\n\nThe following are its characteristic features.\n\nDeposit flexibility\n\nYou can deposit your gold in any manner. In gold bars, cash, or even jewellery, for example. On the other hand, gold jewellery encrusted with gems is not permitted to be deposited in this plan.\n\nDeposit quantity flexibility\n\nIn a gold monetization strategy, 30 grammes of any purity are the required minimum deposit. No such thing as a maximum limit exists.\n\nA tenure that is convenient for you\n\nThere are three term-deposit alternatives available under the Gold Monetization Scheme:\n\n1 to 3 years is the short-term option\n5 to 7 years in the medium-term option\n12 to 15 years in the long-term option\nAttractive interest rates\n\nFor a product that typically remains unused in homes and lockers, the precious metal can profit you anywhere between 0.5 per cent and 2.5 per cent each year, depending on the deposit duration.\n\nCalculating interest in Gold Monetization Scheme\n\nThe short-term bank deposit for the Gold Monetisation Scheme does not pay cash interest. You receive gold in grammes as a form of interest from it. You will receive 1 gramme on 100 grammes if the interest rate is 1% annually.\n\nWithdrawal of the deposit\n\nWhen you deposit, you can choose whether you want your returns for short-term plans to be in the form of cash or gold itself. You will get 995 fine gold coins or bars if you wish to get your refunds in actual gold.\n\nVerification of purity\n\nOver 330 Collection and Purity Testing Centres have been granted licences across the nation to test and certify the purity of the gold that is being deposited.\n\nWhat are the setback factors of the scheme?\nFew people desire to store their gold in banks for interest rates of 2% to 3%.\nInadequate knowledge of or comprehension of the gold monetization system.\nIndians do use their gold as security for loans, despite their apparent reluctance to part with it in exchange for interest.\nA significant portion of India\u2019s gold reserves\u2014nearly three-fourths\u2014are preserved as sentimental jewellery.\nThe gender aspect of gold in jewellery gives women some degree of control over inheritance and ownership.\nSolution\n\nAccording to the reports, urban households spent more money on the gold than their rural counterparts did. If the urban population is unaware of the scheme, how would the rural population react? It is necessary to increase awareness of the programme.\n\nSecurity, potential capital gains, and liquidity are the three key reasons people hold gold, hence the investors in the programme require immediate liquidity.\n\nIndian authorities ought to be successful in identifying and correcting the problems that led to the failure of the project.\n\nRead:\u00a0Gold loans: why is the RBI keeping an eye on them?\n\nArticle written by Aseem Muhammed"

            "[CONTENT]": "The term Dollarization has been used loosely in reference to how foreign money replaces domestic money in any of its functions. The influence of the dollar in the domestic market is also termed dollarization. The Indian central bank has raised concern about the dollarization of the Indian economy by dollar-dominated cryptocurrencies. Read here to learn more.\n\nThe use of a foreign currency in addition to or instead of a domestic one is known as currency substitution. \u00a0When the foreign currency is the dollar or the euro, respectively, the practice is also known as \u201cdollarization\u201d or \u201ceuroization.\u201d\n\nFull or partial currency replacement is possible. Following a severe economic catastrophe, full currency substitution can take place, as it did in Zimbabwe, El Salvador, and Ecuador.\n\nSome smaller economies, for whom maintaining a separate currency is impractical, utilize the currencies of their larger neighbors; Liechtenstein, for instance, uses the Swiss franc.\n\nTable of Contents\n\nDollarization\nHow did it originate?\nDollarization of the Indian economy\nDe-dollarization of economy\nWay forward\nDollarization\n\nThe term Dollarization has been used loosely in reference to how foreign money replaces domestic money in any of its functions.\n\nThree different concepts of dollarization are:\n\n\ud83d\udc49 Which year are YOU targeting for success in the IAS/IPS/IFS Exam? \ud83d\ude80\n\n(1) \u21d2 UPSC 2025: Prelims cum Mains\n\n(2) \u21d2 UPSC 2026: Prelims cum Mains\n\n(3) \u21d2 UPSC 2027 Prelims cum Mains\n\nTip: Know more about ClearIAS Courses (Online/Offline)\n\nAsset Dollarization: The term Asset Dollarization refers to the use of foreign currency in any of the three functions of money: unit of account, means of exchange, and store of value\n\nCurrency Substitution refers to the use of foreign money only as means of exchange. Thus, an economy can be highly dollarized, but not subject to currency substitution. Domestic currency may still be used for transactions.\n\nLiability Dollarization: A key point that has emerged in the recent literature on currency and banking crises in emerging markets is that either the domestic banking system or the government can have relatively large foreign currency debt obligations. This concept is called liability dollarization.\n\nTherefore, a country can be scarcely dollarized on the asset side, but the loans made by the banking system can be mostly in foreign currency.\n\nPartial and Full Dollarization: Full Dollarization is a situation in which a country abandons its currency and adopts another country\u2019s currency as a means of payment and unit of account e.g., Panama. Few countries in the world have dollarized completely.\n\nHow did it originate?\n\nFollowing the Bretton Woods Conference after World War II and the abandonment of the gold standard at the start of World War I, several nations sought exchange rate regimes to advance global economic stability and, by extension, their prosperity.\n\nMost nations link their currency to a significant convertible currency. In contrast to \u201csoft pegs,\u201d which are more flexible and floating exchange rate regimes, \u201chard pegs\u201d are exchange rate regimes that show a deeper commitment to a fixed parity (such as currency boards) or give up sovereignty over their currency.\n\nCurrency substitution became a significant policy concern in the late 1990s after \u201csoft\u201d pegs in Southeast Asia and Latin America failed.\n\nThe decision about which exchange rate system to adopt became more difficult as world trade and capital markets became more integrated.\n\nThe newest of the solutions was full dollarization, under which a country officially abandons its currency and adopts a more stable currency of another country- most commonly the U.S. dollar -as its legal tender.\n\nThe main attraction of full dollarization is eliminating the risk of a sudden, sharp devaluation of the country\u2019s exchange rate. This may allow the country to reduce the risk premium attached to its international borrowing.\nDollarized economies could enjoy a higher level of confidence among international investors, lower interest rate spreads on their international borrowing, reduced fiscal costs, and more investment and growth.\nDollarization of the Indian economy\n\nMost developing countries as well as transitional economies just adopting market mechanisms already have a limited, unofficial form of dollarization.\n\nTo a greater or lesser degree, their residents already hold foreign currency and foreign currency-denominated deposits at domestic banks.\nIn high-inflation countries, dollars or some other hard currency may be in widespread use in daily transactions, alongside the local currency.\n\nThe Indian economy has the possibility of becoming \u201cdollarized\u201d as a result of cryptocurrencies, according to RBI officials.\n\nCryptocurrencies are mostly issued by international private companies and are denominated in dollars.\n\nOnly 5% of Indian imports and 15% of its exports are from the US, but 86% of imports and exports are invoiced in dollars.\n\nIt was recognized that large-scale dollar-denominated assets within a country can disrupt the economy by creating the potential for destabilizing flows.\n\nIndia does not allow dollar-denominated transactions between residents. Exchange earners\u2019 foreign currency accounts can be used only for external payments and if such balances have to be used for local payments, they have to be converted into rupees.\n\nThe counterpart of dollarisation is the internationalization of the domestic currency.\n\nFor example, there are instances when a currency of a developing country could be officially traded outside the country without any underlying trade or investment transactions.\nWhen such currencies are held increasingly outside the country and there is a multiplication of such holdings, any expectation that there will be a fall in the currency due to fundamentals or contagion leads to widespread sales which results in a very sharp fall in the currencies especially when the local markets are not well developed.\nIndia does not permit the rupee to be transacted offshore, i.e., the Rupee is not allowed to be officially used as an international means of payment or store of value.\nIndian banks are not permitted to offer two-way quotes to NRIs or non-resident banks.\n\nA highly conservative approach is adopted to the dollarization of the domestic economy and the internationalization of the domestic currency.\n\nIn July 2022, the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) unveiled a rupee settlement system for international trade by allowing special vostro accounts in designated Indian banks, a step towards internationalizing the rupee.\n\nAlso read: Effects of Liberalization on the Indian Economy\n\nDe-dollarization of economy\n\nDe-dollarization means lessening the influence of the dollar on international markets.\n\nThe US dollar is being replaced as the unit of account for transactions involving oil and/or other commodities, the purchase of US dollars to cover foreign exchange reserves, bilateral trade agreements, and assets denominated in the US dollar.\n\nBecause of the dominance of the dollar in the world economy, the United States has a significant effect on other economies. The United States has historically used sanctions to advance its foreign policy objectives.\n\nDe-dollarization is being pushed by the need to protect national central banks from geopolitical threats where the US dollar\u2019s status as a reserve currency could be used as a weapon of mass destruction.\n\nA new Russia-China payment system that eschews SWIFT and combines the Russian SPFS (System for Transfer of Financial Messages) and Chinese CIPS is currently being developed (Cross-Border Interbank Payment System).\n\nCentral banks will be forced to reevaluate their reliance on the dollar as a result of the prolonged conflict in Ukraine and the ensuing economic sanctions.\n\nAlso read: Basic Concepts of Economics In Simple Language\n\nWay forward\n\nBy keeping a larger share of their foreign exchange reserves in other currencies, such as the Euro or the Chinese Yuan, governments can lessen their reliance on the US dollar.\n\nCountries can encourage enterprises to utilize their currencies in international trade by offering incentives.\n\nTo lessen their reliance on the dollar, governments might create economic partnerships with other nations. To lessen the risk of currency volatility or to challenge the dominance of the dollar, governments may invest in other currencies.\n\nThe US dollar continues to be the preferred trading currency since no other currency is sufficiently liquid.\n\nThe world does not want a simple regime change or to be the target of the same manipulations, even if they come from another nation. The currency market must become more varied, with no single currency claiming control, to go forward.\n\nAlso read:\u00a0Economic nationalism\n\n\u00ad-Article written by Swathi Satish"

This is a good indicator that suggests smaller businesses may be looking for funding beyond their immediate working capital needs.\nThe corporate sector has been recovering steadily, as seen by the Center\u2019s strong direct tax and GST revenues.\nThe states\u2019 combined deficits and net market borrowings have also slightly decreased.\nThe total GDP growth has been driven by the agricultural sector.\n\nAlso read: China Plus One Strategy: Opportunity for India\n\nNegative Implications on the Indian Economy 2023\n\nMost of the global environment is the major source of negative effects on the economic growth of developing countries.\n\nAs the conflict in Ukraine continues, the European Union, India\u2019s largest export market, is at risk of an energy-related slowdown.\nA pause in the rate hikes is not likely to occur until well into the second half of 2023, as the US continues to struggle with declining inflation pressure.\nThe World Bank reduced its growth prediction for China from 4.3% in June 2022 to 2.7% this year.\nThe second-largest economy in the world (China) entering a prolonged downturn will cause a significant slowdown in the global economy in 2019.\nGlobal protectionism will increase, as will support for de-globalization and economic fragmentation in 2023.\nManufacturing in India is still unsteady as indicated by the Index of Industrial Production (IIP), a gauge of factory output, which fell to a 26-month low in October 2022.\nAs a result, economists have quickly revised their estimates of India\u2019s growth for the upcoming fiscal year downward.\nIt is concerning that private consumption is increasing at a rate of over 9% while manufacturing has decreased by more than 4%.\nAlthough there has been a slight increase, capacity utilization is still stuck around the 75% level. Private investments are unlikely to noticeably increase unless this rises steadily.\nThe Micro, Small, and Medium Enterprises (MSME) businesses are still in crisis. This demonstrates the stark differences in the performance of larger and smaller businesses during the industrial recovery.\nGiven that MSMEs employ a substantial portion of the labor force, their ongoing financial stress is indicative of the labor market\u2019s suffering and has a domino effect on the recovery of demand.\nThe states\u2019 capital spending has remained low. State investments often have a greater multiplier effect.\nDespite having increased its benchmark lending rate by 225 basis points since May 2022, managing inflation expectations in 2023 may prove difficult in the future.\nAt 4% of its GDP, India\u2019s reliance on imported energy presents a problem for the country\u2019s balance of payments.\nFor FY23, a current account deficit of substantially over 3% is anticipated.\nRural communities\u2019 substantially greater inflation is further reducing expenditure there.\nWay forward\n\nThe government, private parties, organized and unorganized sectors, and large and small businesses have all worked together consistently to advance India. The Indian economy has defied expectations following the covid outbreak.\n\nThe country\u2019s young workforce\u2019s potential can be unlocked by giving the system a boost as the Skill India Mission is already in place. The economy could benefit greatly from this action for a very long period.\n\nChina is already becoming a less desirable location for manufacturing due to geopolitics. Global corporations aiming to relocate their centers outside of the East Asian economic superpower could be advantageous for India.\n\nIndia should look at creating special investment zones and approval windows for companies to deploy infrastructure, talent, and research.\n\nTo accommodate the tens of thousands of students who will soon enter the workforce, India must update its regulations. According to analysts, the budget for 2023 has to reflect this with a focus on developing finishing school programs and industry institution alliances so that the upcoming class of freshmen can get started quickly.\n\n-Article written by Swathi Satish"

According to reports, China spends 20% of its GDP on infrastructure development, compared to India\u2019s 4.3% annual expenditure.\n\nIn an effort to promote the expansion of the manufacturing sector, the Indian government introduced the \u201cMake in India\u201d initiative in September 2014. This was done primarily to support India\u2019s status as the preferred location for global manufacturing and to stimulate the design, innovation, and startup sectors.\n\nTable of Contents\n\nInfrastructure and Economic Development\nComplete Government\nComplete Private\nPublic Private Partnership (PPP)\nNecessary Steps to Boost Economic Development and Infrastructure\nChallenges\nIIPDF Scheme\nNational Infrastructure Pipeline (NIP)\nInfrastructure Development Projects\nConclusion\nInfrastructure and Economic Development\n\nSince independence, the government has had the full responsibility of providing the entire infrastructure like rail, roads, ports, power, airports, etc. But due to its capital-intensive nature, financial constraints, and human resource constraints, the government after LPG reforms (post-1991) seek the help of the private sector to bridge the infrastructural gap in the country.\n\nIn an economy, infrastructure can be built on the following three models:\n\nComplete Government\nPublic Private Partnership (PPP)\ncomplete Private\nComplete Government\n\nGovernment constructs the entire infrastructure with a financial burden on its own and outsource some tasks and operation. Its maintenance is done by the government itself.\n\n\ud83d\udc49 Which year are YOU targeting for success in the IAS/IPS/IFS Exam? \ud83d\ude80\n\n(1) \u21d2 UPSC 2025: Prelims cum Mains\n\n(2) \u21d2 UPSC 2026: Prelims cum Mains\n\n(3) \u21d2 UPSC 2027 Prelims cum Mains\n\nTip: Know more about ClearIAS Courses (Online/Offline)\n\nComplete Private\n\nPrivate construction is responsible for the construction, maintenance, and operation of the infrastructure but the traffic may be regulated by the government.\n\nPublic Private Partnership (PPP)\n\nThe PPPs, which were implemented in the early 1990s, redefined the roles of the public and private sectors in the provision of public services. Public-private partnerships (PPPs) are a mechanism for the public and private sectors to work together to implement and maintain a project (often an infrastructure project) for the delivery of goods and services.\n\nIn a typical PPP project, generally, the government shall be responsible for getting all the clearances like environment, forest, water, power, and land acquisition and the private party shall be responsible for the construction and maintenance of the project. Any political risks like nationalization of a project, government abandoning the project in between, war or social unrest shall be taken care of by the government and the private party shall take care of design and construction quality and maintenance facilities.\n\nNecessary Steps to Boost Economic Development and Infrastructure\n\nA Robust Strategy: Procurement strategy is a very important aspect of the overall execution of infrastructure projects.\n\nTechnological Obsolescence: The entire project execution chain, including engineering, procurement, construction, and commissioning, uses technology. Though it is challenging for leaders to keep up with technological advancements from beginning to end.\n\nPlanning Strategy: The supply chain is a major issue for construction companies due to the vast variety and quantum of raw materials and supplies required. It requires proper planning and a crisis management plan to tackle sudden uncertainties.\n\nChallenges\n\nMany infrastructure projects are today financially stressed, accounting for almost a third of stressed assets (Non-Performing Assets) in banks.\n\nLarge-scale infrastructure projects have been hampered by delays brought on by successive COVID-19 waves combined with a nationwide lockdown.\n\nCurrent contracts place more of an emphasis on financial (government revenue) benefits than on providing services effectively. For instance, the bidder giving the highest revenue share to the government gets chosen for port and airport contracts.\n\nOf late the government has started shifting its own responsibilities such as land acquisition, environmental and forest clearances, etc. in various projects to the private parties. If the private party is unable to obtain the clearances, it may abandon the project in the middle. As a result, there are disagreements between the public and private sectors, and the project is severely delayed.\n\nUncertainties and disruptions in the supply chain are serious problems that require immediate attention. Construction companies experienced severe shortages of building materials, a lack of transport capacity, and prolonged wait periods for construction supplies imported from overseas due to port congestion.\n\nThere is no existing structure for the renegotiation of projects in case of failure. If a bureaucrat restructures a project, there are no rewards; instead, it may lead to an investigation for graft. So, in such cases of failed projects, bureaucrats naturally avoid renegotiation and the project suffers long delays and court cases.\n\nCertain bidders are involved in reckless bidding (very aggressive in quoting prices) as they that the government will come to their rescue in case the project faces financial distress (for example Tata Ultra Mega Power Project in Gujarat).\n\nAlso read: Non-Performing Assets (NPA): How serious is India\u2019s bad loan problem?\n\nIIPDF Scheme\n\nThe Department of Economic Affairs (DEA), Ministry of Finance, announces the India Infrastructure Project Development Fund Scheme (IIPDF Scheme) for Financial Support for Project Development Expenses.\n\nThe India Infrastructure Project Development Fund Scheme (IIPDF Scheme), a Central Sector Scheme, would assist in the development of high-quality PPP projects by providing the financial support required to the project sponsoring authorities, both in the Central and State Governments, for developing a shelf of bankable viable PPP projects to achieve the goal of modern infrastructure for the country.\n\nThe DEA is putting a lot of emphasis on enhancing the quality and rate of infrastructure development in the country by encouraging private sector involvement in the sector. The DEA has taken a leading role in developing the ideal legal framework for private investment in infrastructure development. PPPs are promoted as a way to bring private capital and efficiency to the planning, construction, and maintenance of infrastructure projects. In addition, new programs and initiatives are being introduced to offer the private sector financial and technical support as needed.\n\nNational Infrastructure Pipeline (NIP)\n\nPublic Private Partnership in Infrastructure has been an important sector investment source. India is ranked second among developing countries in terms of both the quantity of PPP Projects and the related investments, according to the World Bank\u2019s database on private participation in infrastructure.\n\nIndia has to invest around $1.4 trillion in infrastructure over the next few years in order to reach a GDP of $5 trillion by 2024\u201325. In order to achieve this goal, the National Infrastructure Pipeline (NIP) was established with a planned infrastructure investment of around 111 lakh crores (US$ 1.5 trillion) between 2020-25.\n\nInfrastructure Development Projects\n\nTo improve connectivity in the North Eastern Region, various infrastructure development projects have been undertaken by the relevant Ministries and Departments of the Central Government. These are related to enhancing the NER\u2019s air, rail, road, waterway, power, and telecommunications connectivity.\n\nConclusion\n\nIn conclusion, India is certain to experience increased infrastructure expansion as a result of the government prioritizing infrastructure for overall economic development.\n\nGatiShakti, for example, is a significant \u201cproductivity\u201d booster initiative for the infrastructure industry. This program will assist in removing significant bottlenecks caused by the abundance of approvals and the lengthy clearing processes. Its multiplying effects will speed up project execution and keep expenses in check.\n\nThe program has the same transformational impact on the infrastructure market that the 1990s liberalization did. Additionally, given the endless possibilities, engaging private companies in national infrastructure projects may aid India in raising its infrastructure to international levels.\n\nArticle Written By: Priti Raj"

Read further to know more about the Depreciation of the Indian Rupee.\n\nThe country\u2019s stock market has seen $4 billion in foreign funds withdrawn, which has caused the currency to weaken. Due to this decline in the currency, the Indian rupee has had Asia\u2019s worst performance. First, let us try to understand what\u00a0 Depreciation of Currency is.\n\nTable of Contents\n\nDepreciation of Currency\nReasons for the Indian Rupee\u2019s present depreciation\nImpact of the Depreciation of the Indian Rupee\nRole of the Reserve Bank of India\nSteps to Prevent Rupee\u00a0Depreciation\nOptions open to policymakers and the RBI\nWay ahead\nConclusion\nDepreciation of Currency\n\nDepreciation of currency refers to the decline in the value of a nation\u2019s money in relation to one or more foreign reference currencies, most frequently occurring through an unofficial, floating exchange rate regime.\n\nBy making its goods and services more accessible to consumers, a country\u2019s export activity may be boosted by a controlled currency devaluation. However, a country\u2019s currency depreciation could spread to its neighbours.\n\nRupee depreciation in India means that the value of the rupee relative to the US dollar has decreased. It means that the rupee is today less strong than it was.\n\nA dollar, for instance, used to be equal to 70 rupees; today, it is equal to 77, indicating that the rupee has declined in value relative to the currency and that it now costs more rupees to buy a dollar.\n\nNumerous variables, such as lax monetary policy and excessive inflation, contribute to currency depreciation. Sudden currency devaluation, particularly in developing countries, frequently raises investor fears, and the majority of these currencies suffer similarly.\n\n\ud83d\udc49 Which year are YOU targeting for success in the IAS/IPS/IFS Exam? \ud83d\ude80\n\n(1) \u21d2 UPSC 2025: Prelims cum Mains\n\n(2) \u21d2 UPSC 2026: Prelims cum Mains\n\n(3) \u21d2 UPSC 2027 Prelims cum Mains\n\nTip: Know more about ClearIAS Courses (Online/Offline)\n\nLet us move on to the various reasons for the Indian Rupee\u2019s present depreciation.\n\nReasons for the Indian Rupee\u2019s present depreciation\nDue to greater imports, India\u2019s trade deficit grew to an all-time high of over $23 billion in November.\nThis expanding trade gap is caused by the increase in oil costs.\nPolicy differences between the Federal Reserve and the RBI: the strengthening of the US currency in reaction to the Federal Reserve\u2019s low-interest rates and predictions of improved US economic development (the US central bank).\nIn order to increase its reserves and be ready for any future turbulence, the Reserve Bank of India has been continuously purchasing US dollars.\nDue to a capital exodus from stocks, the benchmark S&P BSE Sensex Index has decreased by almost 10% from its all-time high set in October 2021.\nCurrently, worries about the omicron virus type are unsettling the world markets.\nThe conflict between Russia and Ukraine, rising crude oil prices, and tightening global financial conditions are some of the primary worldwide causes that have caused the Indian rupee to decline versus the US dollar.\nSignificant demand for dollars from oil importers due to the high price of crude oil and worries about the widening trade deficit has also been major drivers of the sharp decline in the value of the Indian rupee.\nThe increase in interest rates by the U.S. Federal Reserve (central bank), the European conflict, and worries about China\u2019s economic development as a result of the Covid-19 rise all contributed to a sell-off in the global equity markets, which in turn caused the rupee to weaken.\nHigh crude prices and the slump in equities markets are both contributing to the dollar\u2019s negative outflow.\n\u00a0The RBI\u2019s efforts to tighten the monetary policy in response to growing inflation have also resulted in devaluation.\nImpact of the Depreciation of the Indian Rupee\n\nThe rupee\u2019s depreciation is a double-edged sword for the Reserve Bank of India.\n\nTheoretically, a weaker currency should increase India\u2019s exports, but given the current state of global uncertainty and the country\u2019s weak demand, this may not be the case.\nIt raises the possibility of imported inflation and may make it challenging for the central bank to sustain historically low-interest rates for a more extended period of time.\nOver two-thirds of India\u2019s domestic oil needs are satisfied by imports. Among the major importers of edible oils in India. A weaker currency will drive up the cost of imported edible oil and increase food inflation.\nImports will cost more because importers will have to pay more for the same amount of dollars when the dollar appreciates versus the rupee. Additionally, importers must pay more because most foreign trade is conducted in US dollars.\nTherefore, a falling rupee will make imports more expensive, putting further strain on household budgets in a nation where the economy is dependent on imports.\nSince India imports, more than 85% of the oil and 50% of the gas it uses, the oil and gas industry will be the one that suffers the most.\nImported solar cells and modules are significantly reliant on Indian solar installations. Future bids would have higher tariffs and project expenses.\nThrough rising import costs, a falling rupee immediately affects India\u2019s trade balance and inflation.\nCostlier imports will increase both the trade and current account deficits, putting pressure on the currency rate. The nation\u2019s current account deficit will increase.\nIncreased import costs are also contributing to domestic inflation.\n\u00a0Depreciation benefits export-related companies like pharma and IT.\nThe rupee will lose value and foreign exchange reserves as the current account deficit inevitably grows.\nWhen overall prices rise (inflation) as a result of rising costs for wages and raw materials, this phenomenon is referred to as cost-push inflation, also referred to as wage-push inflation.\nIt\u2019s possible that businesses won\u2019t be able to fully pass on increased prices to consumers, which would have an impact on government dividend payments and raise concerns about planned fiscal deficits.\nAs India imports a lot of raw materials, this could affect consumers by raising the cost of completed items.\nIt will cost more rupees for travellers and students studying abroad to purchase dollars from banks.\nA weaker rupee could cause foreign investors to stop investing in Indian markets, which would lead to a drop in stock and equity mutual fund investments.\nRole of the Reserve Bank of India\nThe RBI keeps a close eye on the foreign currency market and steps in when there is too much volatility.\nRecent actions by the RBI to ensure foreign currency inflow and support the rupee include lowering restrictions on foreign ownership of government bonds and raising the borrowing limits for businesses. However, bond yields in the USA have yielded higher rates of return than any Indian investment.\nAdditionally, the RBI has suggested the rupee settlement method, which would allow overseas businesses to make payments in rupees rather than US dollars.\nThis should lower the demand for US dollars in international trade and stabilise their value.\n\nAlso read: Rupee Devaluation or Depreciation: How does it affect Export and Import? \u2013 Clear IAS\n\nWhat are the measures to prevent Rupee Depreciation? They are discussed below.\n\nSteps to Prevent Rupee\u00a0Depreciation\n\nThe following steps can be taken to reduce rupee depreciation.\n\nAllowing foreign central banks, sovereign wealth funds, and endowment funds to invest in government bonds.\nIncreasing the cap on foreign investment.\nThe RBI has the option to sell some of its foreign currency reserves in order to manage the weakening rupee, and it is already doing so.\nBoost the weak industrial growth.\nIncreased export incentives and decreased imports\nKeep your foreign currency spending to a minimum.\nThe RBI may take action to encourage capital inflows into NRI accounts in order to increase the amount of money going into those accounts.\nWhen NRIs start making deposits in India, they\u2019ll be selling their dollars and exchanging them for rupees, which will help the cause.\nThe RBI can speak with banks to persuade them to give non-residents greater interest rates on deposits and short-term bonds.\nIn a buy/sell exchange, dollars are withdrawn while Indian rupees are injected into the banking system.The swap will help the RBI, however in a limited way, control currency rates.\nOptions open to policymakers and the RBI\nThe RBI cannot and should not attempt to stop the rupee from sinking indefinitely.\nIndia\u2019s foreign exchange reserves will eventually run out if it defends the rupee because international investors have considerably more sway in the financial world.\nThe majority of analysts think that allowing the rupee to weaken and serve as a natural shock absorber to the unfavourable terms of trade is the wiser course of action.\nThe government should limit its borrowing, and the RBI should concentrate on reducing inflation as required by law.\nWay ahead\nCorporations\u2019 inclusion in important global indices like MSCI and FTSE: The government should promote the inclusion of some of the large market cap companies (both in the public and private sectors).\nAs investors are unlikely to be underweight on India, this will assist raise the weight of Indian equities in these indices, partially offsetting foreign portfolio outflows.\nInclusion of India into bond indices. The government might potentially hasten India\u2019s entry into bond indices like the Barclays Global Bond Index and the J.P. Morgan Emerging-Market Bond Index.\nAdditionally, causing foreign inflows will have a favourable effect on interest rates.\nBy taking these steps, the RBI will be able to maintain its FX war chest at a comfortable level and have the necessary tools at its disposal should there be a further weakness.\nThe maintenance of the interest rate differential between the United States and India, together with timely interventions on the foreign exchange market by the central bank to control volatility, will prove beneficial in protecting the rupee\u2019s value versus the dollar.\nConclusion\n\nThe currency\u2019s decline is probably going to make exports more competitive, which benefits the economy. The rupee has remained more resilient than in other earlier crises, such as the Global Financial Crisis of 2008 and the Taper Tantrum of 2013.\n\nThe rupee has lost value when compared to the US dollar, but it has gained value when compared to other major currencies like the euro and the Japanese yen. However, India is now dealing with high inflation, and more depreciation could make problems worse. As the value of the rupee continues to fall, there is a potential that the central bank would interfere once more.\n\nArticle Written By: Atheena Fathima Riyas"

Taxes are paid on a company\u2019s taxable income, which is revenue less general and administrative (G&A), selling and marketing, R&D, depreciation, and other operating expenditures.\n\nA corporate entity\u2019s net income or profit from its operations, whether domestic or international, is subject to the direct tax which is the corporation tax or corporate tax.\n\n\ud83d\udc49 Which year are YOU targeting for success in the IAS/IPS/IFS Exam? \ud83d\ude80\n\n(1) \u21d2 UPSC 2025: Prelims cum Mains\n\n(2) \u21d2 UPSC 2026: Prelims cum Mains\n\n(3) \u21d2 UPSC 2027 Prelims cum Mains\n\nTip: Know more about ClearIAS Courses (Online/Offline)\n\nThe Corporate Tax Rate is the amount of tax levied by the terms of the Income Tax Act of 1961.\n\nDepending on the kind of business entity and the various revenues generated by each corporate entity, the corporate tax rate is based on a slab rate structure.\n\nCorporate tax rates vary greatly amongst nations, with some having meager rates and being labeled as tax havens.\n\nThe effective corporate tax rate, or the rate a corporation pays, is typically lower than the statutory rate, which is the declared amount before any deductions because corporate taxes can be reduced by a variety of deductions, government subsidies, and tax loopholes.\nCorporate tax in India\n\nAs a source of revenue, the Indian government levies corporation taxes on businesses. The basis for calculating this tax is a company\u2019s net income. These are the various sources of income a business receives.\n\nProfits earned by the business\nIncome from renting a property\nCapital gains\nIncome from other sources\n\nCompanies, both domestic and foreign, are liable to pay an annual corporate tax. It is, therefore, based on the above income earned in a given financial year.\n\nDomestic companies\n\nBoth public and private businesses that are registered under the Companies Act of 1956 must pay this tax.\nCurrently, domestic businesses pay a 30% tax rate. Additionally, if net income is between Rs. 1 crore and Rs. 10 crores, the Income Tax Act imposes a 7% surcharge.\nA 12% surcharge is applied to a company\u2019s net income exceeding Rs. 10 crores.\n2019 saw the introduction of Section 115BAA by the Indian government through the Taxation (Amendment) Ordinance.\nThis resulted in many changes to the Income Tax Act, including a reduction in the corporation tax rate for domestic businesses.\nDomestic firms now can pay tax at a rate of 25.168% thanks to Section 115BAA.\n\nForeign Companies\n\nOn the money they earn within a certain period, foreign corporations are required to pay corporate income tax.\nRoyalties and other fees are subject to a 50% corporation tax rate in India, while the remaining revenue is subject to a 40% tax rate.\nA 2% surcharge is applied to foreign companies with net incomes between Rs. 1 crore and Rs. 10 crore.\nIf its net income surpasses Rs. 10 crores, a 5% surcharge will be added.\n\nAdditional charges\n\nNo matter the level of a company\u2019s net income, a 4% Health and Education Cess is imposed on the total income tax and the surcharge.\nAdditionally, under Section 115JB of the Act, businesses receiving advantages under Section 115BAA are excluded from paying Minimum Alternate Tax (MAT).\nMAT is applied to start with AY 2020\u20132021 at a rate of 15%.\nThe Taxation Laws (Amendment) Bill, 2019\nCurrently, domestic companies with an annual turnover of up to Rs 400 crore pay income tax at the rate of 25%. For other domestic companies, the corporate tax rate is 30%. The Bill provides domestic companies with an option to pay tax at the rate of 22%, provided they do not claim certain deductions under the Income Tax Act.\nThe Bill provides new domestic manufacturing companies with an option to pay income tax at the rate of 15%, provided they do not claim certain deductions. These new domestic manufacturing companies must be set up and registered after September 30, 2019, and start manufacturing before April 1, 2023.\nA company can choose to opt for the new tax rates in the financial year 2019-20 (i.e. assessment year 2020-21) or any other financial year in the future. Once a company exercises this option, the chosen provider will apply for all subsequent years.\nProvisions regarding payment of Minimum Alternate Tax (MAT) will not apply to companies opting for the new tax rates. MAT is the minimum amount of tax required to be paid by a company, in case its normal tax liability after claiming deductions falls below a certain limit. The Bill adds that the provisions regarding MAT credit will also not apply to companies opting for the new rates.\nThe Ordinance reduces the MAT rate (applicable for companies not opting for the new tax rates) from 18.5% to 15% with effect from the financial year 2019-20. The Bill amends this provision by making it effective from the financial year 2020-21.\nConclusion\n\nThe government has gradually cut the business tax rates to make India more competitive on a global scale.\n\nThe reduced corporate tax rate of 25% was extended to all businesses with an annual turnover of up to Rs 400 crore by the Union Budget 2019\u201320. It was anticipated that this would apply to 99.3% of businesses.\n\nFor newly created domestic manufacturing units, a favorable tax regime of 22% for existing businesses and 15% for corporations was also introduced, providing they do not take advantage of any specific deductions or incentives. The last day to use this is March 31, 2024.\n\nAlso, India\u2019s corporate tax collections exceeded 3% of the country\u2019s gross domestic product (GDP) for the first time in two years.\n\nAlso Read: Types of Taxes in India; Global\u00a0Minimum Corporate Tax\n\n\u00ad-Article written by Swathi Satish"

The majority of State Electricity Boards operate at a loss and are in terrible shape.\nAlthough it only employs less than 30% of the workforce, the service sector is the largest contributor to GDP growth. In contrast, the agricultural sector employs 45% of the workers but only makes up 15% of GDP growth.\nIn comparison to medium- and large-scale industrial and service sectors, the Micro, Small, and Medium-sized Enterprises (MSME) sector seems to have less favorable access to finance and greater costs for working capital.\nThe manufacturing industry in India faces a workforce shortage, which is limiting its ability to expand.\nNumerous intricate laws, including licensing, tender, and audit, apply to India\u2019s manufacturing industry, which can be burdensome for enterprises and impede their expansion.\nAdditionally, the industry is frequently hampered by subpar supply chain management, which can result in inefficiencies and higher costs.\nDue to the fierce rivalry from other nations in the manufacturing industry, it may be challenging for indigenous companies to compete in the global market.\nAdditionally, India remains dependent on imports from abroad for things like plastic materials, iron and steel, paper, chemicals and fertilizers, and both electrical and non-electrical gear.\nGovernment initiatives\n\nIndia is making slow but steady progress toward Industry 4.0 thanks to government initiatives like:\n\nThe National Manufacturing Policy aims to raise manufacturing\u2019s GDP share to 25% by 2025.\nNational Infrastructure Pipeline (NIP)\nThe PLI scheme for Manufacturing, which was introduced in 2022 and aims to bring India\u2019s core manufacturing sector up to par with international manufacturing standards.\n\u2018Make in India\u2019 program to place India on the world map as a manufacturing hub and give global recognition to the Indian economy. The government aims to create 100 million new jobs in the sector by 2022.\nThe \u201cAtma Nirbhar Bharat\u201d campaign announced in 2020 was also intended to further boost local manufacturing under its stated goal of making India economically self-sufficient.\nPM Gati Shakti\u2013 National Master Plan which is a Multimodal connectivity infrastructure project.\nThe PLI for semiconductor manufacturing is set with the goal of making India one of the world\u2019s major producers of this crucial component.\nPLI scheme for 16 plants for key starting materials (KSMs)/drug intermediates and active pharmaceutical ingredients (APIs).\nThe Mega Investment Textiles Parks (MITRA) scheme to build world-class infrastructure will enable global industry champions to be created, benefiting from economies of scale and agglomeration. Seven Textile Parks will be established over three years.\nThe \u2018Operation Green\u2018 scheme of the Ministry of the Food Processing Industry, which was limited to onions, potatoes, and tomatoes, has been expanded to 22 perishable products to encourage exports from the agricultural sector. This will facilitate infrastructure projects for horticulture products.\nThe government of India\u2019s Ministry for Heavy Industries & Public Enterprises is SAMARTH Udyog Bharat 4.0, or SAMARTH Advanced Manufacturing and Rapid Transformation Hubs. This is expected to increase the competitiveness of the manufacturing sector in the capital goods market.\nWay forward\n\nIndia is a desirable location for foreign manufacturing ventures. Numerous companies, including those from the luxury, automobile, and mobile phone industries, have already established or are planning to do so in the nation.\n\nIndia\u2019s manufacturing industry has the potential to generate $1 trillion in revenue by 2025. With a GDP of US$2.5 trillion and a population of 1.32 billion, India will become a common market after the Goods and Services Tax (GST) is implemented, which would be very attractive to investors.\n\nAccording to the Indian Cellular and Electronics Association (ICEA), by regulatory changes, India could increase its total capacity for producing laptops and tablets to US$ 100 billion by 2025.\n\nThe Government seeks to ensure the overall growth of the country by emphasizing the development of industrial corridors and smart cities. The corridors will also support advanced manufacturing techniques by integrating, monitoring, and creating an atmosphere that is favorable to industrial progress.\n\nThe industrial sector may draw additional investment and enterprises if infrastructure, such as ports, highways, and power supplies, is improved in terms of both quality and accessibility.\n\nThis can entail constructing brand-new infrastructure or improving already-existing infrastructure.\n\nSupporting the growth of export-oriented manufacturing could aid Indian companies in expanding into new markets and becoming more competitive.\n\n-Article written by Swathi Satish"

This was part of the government\u2019s effort to maintain food inflation within reasonable bounds.\n\nThe buffer stocks also assist the government in implementing its social welfare programs for the needy and poorer segments of society.\n\n\ud83d\udc49 Which year are YOU targeting for success in the IAS/IPS/IFS Exam? \ud83d\ude80\n\n(1) \u21d2 UPSC 2025: Prelims cum Mains\n\n(2) \u21d2 UPSC 2026: Prelims cum Mains\n\n(3) \u21d2 UPSC 2027 Prelims cum Mains\n\nTip: Know more about ClearIAS Courses (Online/Offline)\n\nFood grains for welfare programs\n\nThe government\u2019s social welfare programs, such as the Targeted Public Distribution System (TPDS) and Other Welfare Schemes (OWS), such as the mid-day meal program for school-age children, the distribution of food to those who have been displaced by natural disasters, etc., are made possible by the food stock procurement.\n\nRead: Food Security in India\n\nBuffer Norms\n\nThe minimal amount of food grains that the central government must keep on hand at the start of every quarter to ensure adequate supplies for the public distribution system and other government distribution programmes.\n\nFood Stock held by the following entities is accessible in the central government\u2019s pool: State Government Agencies (SGAs) States participating in the Decentralized Procurement Scheme Food Corporation of India (FCI)\n\nThroughout the year, food grains from the Central Pool are dispersed based on patterns in off-take and procurement. As a result, a key component in determining the minimum food grain reserves needed in any given quarter of the year is the season of production and procurement.\n\nThe GoI\u2019s current buffer stock stocking standards include the following:\n\nOperational Stocks: The quantity of stock needed to satisfy TDPS and OWS monthly requirements.\nFood security stocks: The supplies on hand to cover any gaps in purchasing.\n\nOperational stock refers to the food grains used for OWS and TDPS distribution, whereas operational stock and buffer stock both refer to the surplus. The stock over the minimal stockpiling standards is considered excess stock. It is occasionally exported, given to select states in additional allocations, or sold on the open market.\n\nChallenges of Buffer stocks\nHigh Cost of Logistics and Administration: The Agricultural Ministry and FCI have difficulty adjusting the budget to make money available for the effective creation and operation of the storage units because the majority of the funds are allocated for purchasing the buffer stocks. These examples show how this is possible:\nDual Wastage: In India, a significant portion of the population is dying from hunger while at the same time, enormous amounts of food inventories degrade due to improper storage techniques.\nIssues with warehousing include a lack of adequate storage space and other infrastructure following the purchase.\nWastage: In open, outdoor storage, rats, frost, and rain frequently cause the food grains to spoil, costing the government a great deal of money.\nTransportation problems: Moving grains to and from the FCI godowns is quite expensive. The losses are also increased by spills and deterioration that occur during shipment.\nDiversion and theft: The buffer stockpiles may occasionally be taken and given to ghost recipients, alcoholic beverage manufacturing facilities, and illicit markets. By doing this, a large portion of the population is starved while others gain from the buffer stockpiles of food grains in place of the target population.\nThe practice of trade distortion: Many Western industrialised nations view the government\u2019s purchase of food grains and upkeep of buffer stockpiles as a trade-distorting activity. Regarding the same, they drag India to the WTO.\nA skewed pattern of crop output results from integrating buffer stocks with MSP for staple grains like rice and wheat. These crops require a lot of water to grow, so more fertiliser needs to be applied for them to be more productive. This compromises the nutritional security of India by impacting crop diversity in addition to the environment. Farmers who live in areas where it is difficult to grow rice and wheat will likewise be more likely to grow rice and wheat.\nOpen-Ended Procurement: The open-ended procurement of the food stocks further complicates the proper storage and consumption of the buffer stocks in the absence of an accurate estimate of the overall buffer stock needed to run the PDS and in emergencies.\nWay forward\n\nIn order to enhance FCI\u2019s financial management and operational effectiveness in the purchase, storage, and distribution of food grains, the government established the six-person Shanta Kumar committee. The committee\u2019s recommendations included restructuring or unbundling FCI. Important suggestions made include the following:\n\nReduce from the present 67% to 40% the number of recipients under the National Food Security Act.\nPermit the private sector to buy and store grains of food.\nThe minimum support price (MSP) and food subsidy amounts can be directly transferred to the accounts of farmers and food security beneficiaries if bonuses on MSP payments made by governments to farmers are stopped and a direct benefit transfer system is adopted.\nOnly in states with weak procurement capabilities could FCI engage in full-fledged grain procurement.\nStates should handle procurement in the cases of conditions that are performing well, such as Haryana, Punjab, Andhra Pradesh, Chhattisgarh, Madhya Pradesh, and Odisha.\nEliminating levy rice is the term for the rice that the government compulsorily purchases from the mills under the levy rice programme, which ranges from 25 to 75% in different states. Only the remaining may be sold by mills on the open market.\nDe-regulate the fertiliser industry and give farmers a cash subsidy for fertiliser of Rs 7,000 per hectare.\nGrain outsourcing: The committee urges the implementation of a negotiable warehouse receipt (NWR) system.\nFarmers can deposit their produce in these authorised warehouses under the new arrangement, and the bank will advance them 80% of the MSP value of their produce.\nClear and open buffer stock liquidation procedures: FCI should be given more freedom to conduct business; when needed, it should sell surplus goods on the open market or export.\n\nArticle Written By: Atheena Fathima Riyas"

It influences the pricing and supply of agricultural goods and aids in managing their supply.\n\nLet\u2019s first examine the need for such subsidies before examining what direct and indirect subsidies are and the problems they raise.\n\nIt balances inter-regional imbalances, encourages agricultural production, and aids in the promotion of agricultural development. Additionally, it is anticipated that subsidies will advance agricultural mechanisation, encourage better crop patterns, provide employment prospects, etc.\n\nAgricultural subsidies in India\n\nThe main agricultural subsidies in India are for food, fertiliser, irrigation, power, and loans. While the Center pays for food and fertiliser subsidies, the corresponding state government is responsible for electricity and irrigation subsidies.\n\nCredit stipends are distributed via the banking system.\n\nThe price at which the Food Corporation of India (FCI) purchases from farmers and sells through the Public Distribution System is what is referred to as a food subsidy (PDS).\n\n\ud83d\udc49 Which year are YOU targeting for success in the IAS/IPS/IFS Exam? \ud83d\ude80\n\n(1) \u21d2 UPSC 2025: Prelims cum Mains\n\n(2) \u21d2 UPSC 2026: Prelims cum Mains\n\n(3) \u21d2 UPSC 2027 Prelims cum Mains\n\nTip: Know more about ClearIAS Courses (Online/Offline)\n\nRead:\u00a0Nutrient based subsidy scheme\n\nNeed for farm subsidies\nAccording to Article 48 of the Indian Constitution, it is the state\u2019s duty to modernise agricultural organisations.\nAccording to FAO, 70% of rural Indian households depend mostly on agriculture for their subsistence.\nOne technique for distributing income and reducing inequality is subsidies\nFarmers only receive a little portion of their income (less than one-third of non-farmers income).\nFarm subsidies provide farmers with supplemental money that can be reinvested back into the industry.\nFarm subsidies Increase in production Access to high-quality inputs like seeds and fertiliser better revenue for farmers.\nFarm subsidies in specific ways encourage farmers to keep farming as a profession.\nProtect farmers from the problems that are caused by covid 19.\nTypes \u00a0of Agriculture Subsidies\n\nDifferent types of farm subsidies include:\n\nExplicit Input Subsidies\n\nFarmers receive these specialised cost subsidies to assist them in controlling the costs of the inputs required before production. Typically, these are given to small and marginal farmers who are unable to buy high-quality inputs on their own. Utilizing modern technologies, the goal is to maximise productivity. Utilizing modern technologies, the goal is to maximise productivity.\n\nImplicit\u00a0Input Subsidies\n\nThese are covert subsidies, not payments in the traditional sense. In this situation, the input prices of the products are controlled, for instance, by low electricity costs.\n\nOutput subsidies\n\nPrices on the domestic market are kept higher than they would have been as a result of the restrictive trade rules.\n\nSimilar to this, agricultural subsidies can also be classified as Direct Subsidies and Indirect Subsidies based on the method of payment.\n\nDirect Subsidies\n\nDirect farm subsidies are those that are paid in the form of a direct cash subsidy and are given to farmers directly. In direct subsidies, the beneficiary pays the same price for the product but receives a separate payment for the purchase.\n\nThe PM Kisan Scheme, PAHAL in LPG, and agricultural loan waivers are a few examples of direct farm subsidies.\n\nDirect farm subsidies have some benefits.\n\nBenefits of Direct farm subsidies\nDirect subsidies aid in boosting farmers\u2019 purchasing power and enhancing the general level of living.\nGovernment empowerment through direct cash transfers allows recipients to choose their purchases based on their requirements.\nSince money is given to beneficiaries directly, it also aids in preventing the misuse of public funds.\nDirect payments also reduce wasteful resource use. Ex: Farmers will buy fertiliser at full price and only what is required.\nFarmers can invest the money they get in their businesses as capital.\nReduces the expense of the government, releasing funds for storage and transportation.\n\u00a0Issues of Direct farm subsidies\nRural communities have inadequate ATM and banking service accessibility and a lack of financial inclusion.\nThe potential for farmers to use the funds for non-farm, wasteful uses.\nInflation may result from increased public access to money.\nMay affect the nation\u2019s food security.\nImportant problems like agricultural innovation and market reform went neglected.\nProblems with beneficiary identification.\nIndirect\u00a0Subsidies\n\nIt is indirect as there are no direct transfers or payments involved. They can be in the form of lower prices, welfare mechanisms, more affordable credit, insurance options, waivers of agricultural loan payments, etc. These payments are mostly made to farmers in conjunction with the use of inputs, and as a result, they are closely tied to the volume of those payments.\n\nThe cost of the product is set at a lower price than the market price in cases of indirect subsidies. Indirect subsidies account for about 2% of India\u2019s GDP. An indirect subsidy is any non-cash advantage that a recipient receives to support its operations or competitiveness. Modifications to the tax code are a common form of indirect subsidy.\n\nExamples include MSP (Minimum Support Price), fertiliser, credit, and irrigation subsidies.\n\nPositive aspects of Indirect subsidies\nThese are crucial in fostering agricultural technology and infrastructure development. Ex: Subsidies for infrastructure.\nFarmers are guaranteed high-quality inputs through subsidies for seeds and fertiliser, which helps to raise farm output.\nEncourages farmers to adopt sustainable practises like crop diversification by helping to alter their behaviour.\nThe indirect subsidies that provide farmers knowledge also include farmer training.\nEnsures the nation\u2019s food security.\nContribute to limiting the outflow from the agricultural industry to other sectors\nThese aid in the development of underdeveloped priority areas.\nIn the 1960s, when the nation was experiencing severe food scarcity, the goal was to attain food security. The green revolution gave farmers access to high-quality crops and fertilisers.\nThese are designed to offer farmers technical and training support to increase productivity.\n\u00a0Issues of Indirect farm subsidies\nAgriculture has become dominated by cereals and has altered production patterns as a result of subsidies like MSP.\nDesertification is a result of the overuse of natural resources caused by subsidies for power, irrigation, and fertiliser.\nDue to intermediaries, indirect subsidies are tainted by corruption and leaks. Ex: PDS where leakages and the presence of ghost beneficiaries are noted.\nThe WTO\u2019s Amber box refers to market-distorting subsidies that are under pressure from the international community to be reduced.\nThe current administration can offer incentives for minimal political gain in \u201cvote bank politics.\u201d\nThese have resulted in agriculture centred on cereal and skewed crop patterns. Groundwater supplies, for example, are being depleted rapidly. They don\u2019t see any benefit to conserving resources.\nAnother drawback is the prejudice towards large farm owners and regional differences. Due to flaws like corruption, identification, lobbying by wealthy farmers, etc., they frequently fail to reach the intended beneficiaries.\nTypically, it is utilised improperly during elections to advance political goals, such as the remission of farm loans.\nIt doesn\u2019t result in the development\nIssues related to farm subsidies in general\nAccording to the Economic Survey 2018, wealthy farmers gain more from farm subsidies than small farmers.\nOnly roughly Rs. 3000-4000 crore of the Rs. 1.70 lakh crore allocated for food subsidies in the budget for 2018\u201319 was invested in agriculture, demonstrating wasteful spending rather than the assistance of agriculture.\nThe financial exchequer is burdened by subsidies, which result in a significant financial deficit.\nSubsidy culture may encourage inefficiency and reliance on the government while weakening incentives for improvement.\nSubsidy policies may encourage other nations to pursue similar goals, which could result in trade conflicts and protectionist measures.\nInternational issues caused by subsidies\nThe de minimus levels of AMS (Aggregate Measures of Support), where wealthy nations like the USA pay subsidies >50% in some items like cotton and sugar, are not in reach for developing nations like India and China.\nSubsidies in affluent nations also serve as a barrier to the importation of goods from developing nations.\nThe amount of subsidies given to wealthy nations is significantly more than that of developing nations like India.\nDue to the omission of equality, the WTO-signed Agreement on Agriculture contains loopholes. Spending on input subsidies and price support measures combined cannot exceed 10% of the entire value of agricultural production in developing nations and only 5% of the value of agricultural production in industrialised countries.\nMeasures and suggestions to tackle the issues\nThe Kelker Committee suggested converting subsidies into capital investments and gradually eliminating them.\nStopping subsidies that aren\u2019t producing the desired results will help to rationalise subsidies.\nLong-term policies on export commerce are required to preserve continuity and maintain farmers\u2019 alignment with exports.\nEncouraging financial inclusion activities in rural areas.\nBuilding warehouses and cold storage facilities close to the farm gate.\nThe agri-sector is being developed holistically by fortifying backwards and forward connections.\nThere should be a time limit on subsidies.\nencouraging programmes like cooperative and contract farming to make agriculture profitable.\nThe agricultural laws should be properly executed since they are a good step toward giving farmers more authority and diminishing APMC markets\u2018 monopoly.\nThe security of both food and nutrition should be a government priority.\nConstructing a system for market information to include price and demand projections that assist farmers in improved price realisation and assist farmers in selecting the crop.\nInternational measures\nUnder the Nairobi WTO package, developed and developing nations have pledged to gradually eliminate export subsidies.\nTo minimise the large agricultural subsidies to wealthy nations, India and China together filed a proposal to the WTO.\nSubsidies should be limited based on a specific commodity, such as cotton, wool, etc., rather than the total agricultural value production.\nAccording to the requests of developing countries, the base year used to compute the de-minimus level should be adjusted.\nMinimum Support Price\n\nMSP is the minimum price that the government pays for the farmers\u2019 produce at the time of procurement. It is aimed at saving the crops from price fluctuations in the market.\n\nThe MSP fixed by the government is considered as being remunerative for farmers.\n\nHowever, MSPs do not have legal backing.\n\nMSPs were first introduced in 1966-67 when the country adopted Green Revolution technologies. To boost domestic production and encourage farmers to plant high-yielding varieties, the government resorted to MSP. A minimum support price was guaranteed to them.\n\nTo read more about MSPs, click here\n\nConclusion\n\nThe fact that the agriculture industry, which accounts for greater than 40% of employment, only contributes 16\u201317% of GDP highlights the difficulties and issues that farmers must deal with. The government\u2019s goal of doubling farmer income by 2022 is therefore achieved with the aid of farm subsidies, which also aid India in achieving double-digit growth by assuring food security.\n\nArticle Written By: Atheena Fathima Riyas"

India has 23 Fintechs that have gained \u2018Unicorn Status\u2019.\n\nThe future of fintech in India is being influenced by emerging trends like:\n\nPayments: Real-time account-to-account (A2A) payments\u2019 continued development is driving out cash. Additionally, payment gateways, payment aggregators, and point of sale (POS) providers are moving beyond payment acceptance to offer full-stack merchant solutions.\n\nLending: Increased availability of embedded lending options for funding consumer purchases, digitization of asset-backed lending, and testing of decentralized finance (DeFi).\n\nWealthtech: Direct distribution integrating discount broking, Robo-advisory services integrating personal finance management and producing standard model portfolios, and an increase in investing in alternative asset classes, particularly cryptocurrency.\n\nInsurtech: Digital platforms for insurance distribution are growing, as are digital non-life insurers and bite-sized insurance.\n\nFintech infrastructure: The rise of \u201cbanking as a service\u201d (BaaS) providers, the commercialization of \u201cblockchain-based\u201d and \u201cdistributed ledger technology\u201d (DLT) use cases in corporate banking, the appearance of \u201copen banking\u201d service providers (such as \u201caccount aggregators\u201d and \u201cOCEN enablers\u201d), and the introduction of \u201cretail/wholesale Central Bank Digital Currency\u201d (CBDC).\n\nNeobanking: Growth of millennial-focused neobanks, those targeting MSME businesses, and incumbent-launched cyber attackers.\n\nGovernment initiatives for Fintech\n\nThe Fintech revolution in India is the culmination of years of effort in laying the groundwork for developing key enablers through important initiatives:\n\nJan Dhan Yojana: The world\u2019s largest financial inclusion initiative, \u201cJan Dhan Yojna\u201d, has helped in new bank account enrollment of over 450 Mn beneficiaries for direct benefits transfer and accessibility to a host of financial services applications such as remittances, credit, insurance, and pensions enabling FinTech players to build technology products to penetrate the large consumer-base in India.\nFinancial Literacy: Some of the recent initiatives towards improving financial literacy in India include setting up the National Centre for Financial Education and implementing the Centre for Financial Literacy project by the RBI.

What are its positive and negative impacts? Scroll down the page to know more about the effects of liberalization on the Indian economy.\n\nAny process of a state removing limitations on some private individual activity is known as liberalization. Liberalization has taken place when formerly prohibited items are no longer prohibited or when government regulations are loosened.\n\nIt removes governmental involvement and increases the autonomy of commercial firms. It refers to a government loosening previously enacted limits on economic or social policies. Deregulation of the industrial sector, banking sector changes, tax reforms, and reforms to the foreign exchange market all contributed to India\u2019s liberalization.\n\nThen what is Economic liberalization?

Those who support economic liberalism, commonly known as proponents of free markets and free trade, are typically those who advance it. Taxes, social security contributions, and unemployment compensation are frequently decreased as a result of economic liberalization.\n\nWhen did economic reforms begin in India?\n\nIndia began a sequence of economic reforms on July 23, 1991, in response to a fiscal and balance-of-payments (BoP) crisis. The historic reforms would fundamentally alter the character and structure of the economy in the years to come.\n\n\ud83d\udc49 Which year are YOU targeting for success in the IAS/IPS/IFS Exam? \ud83d\ude80\n\n(1) \u21d2 UPSC 2025: Prelims cum Mains\n\n(2) \u21d2 UPSC 2026: Prelims cum Mains\n\n(3) \u21d2 UPSC 2027 Prelims cum Mains\n\nTip: Know more about ClearIAS Courses (Online/Offline)\n\nWhat were the measures taken by the Indian government to start economic reforms?\n\nIndia started an economic reform initiative that included two groups of measures:\n\nMacroeconomic stabilization measures: All economic measures, both local and foreign, that aim to increase the economy\u2019s overall demand are referred to as macroeconomic stabilization measures. The creation of quality and well-paying jobs must be prioritized in order to increase the purchasing power of the general public and support the increased domestic demand.\nMeasures for Structural Reform: It encompasses all policy changes that the government has made to increase the overall supply of goods and services in the economy. Naturally, this involves releasing the economy\u2019s restrictions so that it can explore its own potential for increased productivity and output.\n\nLet us discuss what the objectives of liberalization are.\n\nAlso read: History of Banking in India\n\nObjectives of Liberalization\nTo promote the involvement of private Indian businesses and multinational corporations.\nTo enable the Indian economy\u2019s internationalization.\nPromote foreign trade in the nation to boost exports.\nTo resolve the balance of payments crisis facing India.\nTo increase the private sector\u2019s involvement in the growth of India\u2019s economy.\nto boost foreign direct investment in the Indian industry.\nTo encourage domestic enterprises to compete with one another.\nLiberalization Policies\n\nThe policies of liberalization which helps in the growth of the economy are:\n\nDeregulation of the Industrial Sector\nFinancial Sector Reforms\nTax Reforms\nForeign Exchange Reforms\nTrade and Investment Policy Reforms\nExternal Sector Reforms\nForeign Exchange Reforms\nForeign Trade Policy Reforms\n\nThe economic repercussions of liberalization on both the country and investors might be significant.\n\nEconomic liberalization means that a nation \u201copens up\u201d to the rest of the world in terms of commerce, rules, taxes, and other areas that generally have an impact on domestic business.\n\nIt has many impacts on the Indian economy. Let us discuss them.\n\nAlso read: Unified Payment Interface (UPI): Made Simple\n\nImpacts of liberalization on the Indian economy\nImpact on the rate of GDP growth\n\nIndia\u2019s 6.6% annual average growth rate from 1990 to 2010 is almost twice as high as it was before the country\u2019s economic reforms.\n\nTaking Down Obstacles to International Investment\n\nWhen a country has many barriers to entry, investing in emerging market nations can occasionally seem unattainable. These obstacles can include tax policies, prohibitions on foreign investment, legal concerns, and accounting requirements, all of which make entry into the nation difficult or impossible.\n\nThese restrictions are loosened as part of the economic liberalization process, and some private sector influence over the economy\u2019s direction is given up. Frequently, deregulation and the privatization of businesses are involved.\n\nRate of Industrial Growth\n\nDue to unfettered access to Indian markets, indigenous products are no longer competitive. Of course, they had more access to technology and scale economies.\n\nUnrestricted Capital Flow\n\nThe main objectives of economic liberalization are the effective distribution of resources and competitive advantages, as well as the free flow of capital between states. Usually, this is accomplished by lowering protectionist measures like tariffs, trade regulations, and other trade barriers.\n\nIt becomes less expensive for businesses to access capital from investors due to the increased capital flow into the nation. Higher growth rates are the result of corporations being able to invest in profitable ventures that they might not have been able to before liberalization due to a higher cost of capital.\n\nImpact on India\u2019s Small-Scale Sector\n\nAfter independence, the government made an effort to revitalize the small-scale industry by reserving goods solely for its manufacture. The list of restricted commodities was significantly reduced as a result of liberalization, and many new industries were made accessible to large corporations.\n\nHowever, there is still a small-scale sector that supports the Indian economy. It significantly impacts exports and private-sector employment. The results are conflicting, although many once small-scale industries have grown and improved. Although they only exist because of government backing, overall value addition, product innovation, and technology adoption continue to be poor.\n\nOutcomes in Agriculture\n\nAgriculture now only accounts for 15% of the national economy. However, the percentage of people who depend on agriculture is still about 55%. Although there has been a significant change in crop patterns, the effects of liberalization cannot be accurately quantified. We learned through the agricultural television programs that there are still a lot of pervasive government regulations and interventions, from the point of production to the point of distribution.\n\nThe agricultural economy worldwide is severely distorted. This is mostly due to the unequal economic and political power distribution between farmers in industrialized and developing nations. Commercial, capitalist agriculture is practiced in industrialized nations and is controlled by large agribusiness conglomerates. They have easy access to WTO policies and can simply negotiate better terms for themselves at the expense of farmers in poor countries.\nOn the plus side, India\u2019s high-quality, distinctive products\u2014like basmati rice\u2014are virtually self-sufficient and in high demand worldwide. In general, India is better equipped to tackle the challenges of globalization in this situation. If implemented in a fair and sustainable way, it will have a significant multiplier effect on the entire economy.\nIn addition to this, Farm Mechanization\u2014the use of tractors, combines, electronic/solar pumps, etc.\u2014is another benefit of globalization. Moving on, information technology is now being applied in agriculture to simplify farming.\nResult for the Services Sector\nIn this instance, globalization has benefited poor nations while harming industrialized ones. Human resources have historically been substantially more affordable in developing economies because of historical economic inequality between the two groups.\nThe IT revolution helped to expedite this even more, and as a result, many jobs left developed countries and moved to poor nations.\nThe growth of the information technology, software, BPO, KPO, and LPO industries in India has prevented a large portion of the country\u2019s demographic dividend from being wasted. The best thing is that exporting services results in high-value exports.\nThe only product that gets exported is professional labour, which doesn\u2019t diminish with time but actually increases. India is now better positioned to develop into a true knowledge economy.\nThe majority of India\u2019s foreign exchange gains come from the export of these services. In actuality, only during the three years 2000\u20132002 did India have a current account surplus.\nBanking\n\nAdditionally, India has benefited in the banking sector. There have been three rounds of licence grants for private banks since the reforms. Private banks like ICICI, HDFC, and Yes Bank, as well as foreign institutions, increased the bar for the Indian banking sector. The banking sector is now more competitive, and public sector banks are more customer-focused. Similarly, the insurance sector currently provides a wide range of products, including Unit Linked Insurance Plans and Travel Insurance.\n\nStock exchanges\nStock markets are a key development as well. Corporate Securities can be traded in real-time on stock exchanges.\nIt offers methods for ongoing price discovery as well as flexible exit and entry points for investors. These are the foundation of free markets today, and there is active trading taking place on stock exchanges around the globe. Their significance can be gauged by the fact that stock market performance is the best predictor of an economy\u2019s current state and future potential.\nA comprehensive range of related services, including Investment Banking, Asset Management, Underwriting Services, Hedging Advice, etc., have been made available by these markets. In total, these support lakhs of jobs across India.\nSimilar to stock markets, commodities markets offer opportunities for buying and selling a variety of permissible commodities.\nTelecom Sector\nTraditionally, the telecom industry was a monopoly owned by the government, which led to very poor service. Private telecom industry success peaked after reforms. Indian telecom firms also expanded internationally. However, this sector\u2019s growth and outlook were harmed by corruption and rent-seeking.\nModern Direct to Home services led to increases in television service quality on the one hand and the demise of many local cable companies on the other.\nSectors of Education and Health\nIndia has had access to top-notch education, and deregulation has led to the mushrooming of private engineering and medical colleges. In actuality, though, society as a whole was devastated.\nOnly a very small percentage of applicants are accommodated by these new universities, and they are exceedingly expensive.\nTransparency International, an independent group, recently published a report alleging that India\u2019s healthcare system is the most corrupt in the entire world.\nMany students must borrow money from banks to pay for their education due to the high cost of tuition. The majority of them are unable to find employment after qualifying. Practice ends up being the last recourse. Now, a person gets seduced by corruption in order to maintain a respectable standard of living and repay loans. As a result, when numerous instances of the same type are combined, a corrupt system, economy, and society result.\nThe truth is that after deregulation and liberalization, the government withdrew its support from social sectors along with other sectors. There are now affordable solutions in the private sector that range in quality from mediocre to excellent. Less than Mediocre to Mediocre alternatives are accessible in the public sector. This still remains a sizable population of future students and patients.\nAdvantages of liberalization in India\nFreely flowing Capital: Liberalization has boosted the flow of funding by making it more inexpensive for all types of businesses to access capital from investors and to have a successful project.\nInvestor diversity: As a result of liberalization, investors are now able to place a significant amount of their capital in a variety of assets.\nImpact on agriculture: Liberalization had a favorable effect on agriculture. The cropping patterns and designs have undergone significant alteration. Before the agricultural sector was liberalized, the government imposed limitations on everything from the beginning of crop production to its distribution.\nEconomic laws that are relaxed result in a rise in the value of the stock market, which improves investor trading.\nNegative impacts of liberalization\nEconomic instability: Due to the drastic changes that were made in the political and economic spheres, there was economic instability. Indian liberalization\u2019s unfavorable effects include the decline of the economy. The massive return of political-economic power will undermine India\u2019s whole economy.\nImpact of technology: Due to rapid development and innovation in technology, many small- and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) and other firms in emerging nations are able to adapt to the changes or even close their doors.\nAcquisitions and mergers: A lot of tiny firms have amalgamated with big businesses. Numerous smaller businesses faced increased competition from powerful global corporations.\u00a0 Because of this, workers in small industries might need to develop their abilities and adopt new technologies. Employee inefficiency and a strain on the company\u2019s resources may result from time.\nConclusion\n\nEconomic liberalization started in 1991 in India by reviving economic policies, with the goal of creating an economy more market-oriented and increasing the role of private and foreign investment.\n\nSelf-reliance and a lack of R&D spending served as roadblocks to technological advancement, which resulted in the manufacture of items of lower quality. In Indian society, there is still a strong assumption that imported items are preferable to domestic ones. It is widely accepted that, before assessing the success of the ongoing industrial policy, consideration must be given to the state of the country following two centuries of exploitation and a horrific separation.\n\nMany factors like lack of tactical skills, low literacy levels, unskilled labor, and absence of technology were significant aspects of the Indian economy before independence. It is stated that industrial strategies, policies, and their restoration are essential for a nation\u2019s economy to thrive.\n\nArticle Written By: Atheena Fathima Riyas"

India has a highly favorable climate for agro-products such as fruits, vegetables, spices, and aromatic plants.\n\nThe horticulture sector in India produces around 320 million tons of products and contributes about 33% of the Gross Value Addition (GVA).\n\nIt is a labour-intensive sector and thus provides a lot of employment opportunities, especially for the people of rural regions.\n\nHorticulture has implemented cutting-edge methods that have enhanced productivity and export potential, leading to further expansion.\n10% of the land in India is used for horticulture, which accounts for 33% of the agricultural value.\n\nIndia has advantageous topographical characteristics that promote the development of a wide range of vegetables.\n\nVegetables of more than 40 different varieties are produced throughout India. Vegetable production in India is second in the world.\n\nMore than 10% of the world\u2019s fruit production is produced in India.\n\nThe majority of fruit is produced in Indian states like Uttar Pradesh, Odisha, Andhra Pradesh, Tamil Nadu, Gujarat, Maharashtra, and Karnataka.\n\nIn some parts of the country, the favourable climate encourages the production of a wide range of flowers all year long.\n\nThe demand for flowers among the upper and middle classes for aesthetic purposes has increased, which has aided in the development of floriculture as a thriving industry.\nGrowth of horticulture in India\n\nBetween 2004\u20132005 and 2019\u201320, the productivity of horticultural crops increased by 38% in India.\n\nBecause horticulture products are more resistant to changing weather conditions, their production is economical and practical.\n\nThe requirement of area, water, and other resources are much less than other agricultural products and hence reduce the chance of failure thereby giving better returns and income opportunities.\n\nInitiatives by the Government of India\n\nMIDH and CDP are two major initiatives of the Government of India in connection with Horticulture.\n\nThe Mission for Integrated Development of Horticulture (MIDH)\nIt was implemented in 2014.\nIt is a centrally sponsored scheme with a focus on devising plans and processes to facilitate horticulture production efficiently and cost-effectively.\nThe government of India sponsors 60% of the total developmental expenditure incurred by different states and 40% is contributed by state governments.\nFor North-Indian states, the government contribution is 90%.\nThrough the use of region-specific strategies and action plans, the primary goals of this programme are to assure the overall expansion of the horticulture industry.\nResearch, technology adaptation and application, harvest management, transportation, storage, processing, and marketing are a few of the different activities.\nIt focuses on enhancing productivity through the use of superior planting materials and cutting-edge irrigation systems while taking into account the various agro-climatic characteristics of various places.\nThe programme promotes the growth of local youth\u2019s skills and their involvement in horticultural production, which creates job possibilities.\nTo increase volume and cost-effectiveness, the growers who are active in horticulture production are grouped.\nIt has five major schemes for horticulture:\nNational Horticulture Mission (NHM)\nHorticulture Mission for North East and Himalayan States (HMNEH)\nNational Horticulture Board (NHB)\nCoconut Development Board (CDB)\nCentral Institute of Horticulture (CIH), Nagaland\nHorticulture Cluster Development Programme (CDP)\nIt is a\u00a0central sector programme\u00a0aimed at growing and developing identified horticulture clusters to make them globally competitive.\nThe horticulture cluster is a regional/geographical concentration of targeted horticulture crops.\nThe National Horticulture Board (NHB) of the Ministry of Agriculture and Farmers\u2019 Welfare is responsible for carrying it out.\nThe list of 55 clusters will also include the states of Arunachal Pradesh, Assam, West Bengal, Manipur, Mizoram, Jharkhand, Uttarakhand, etc., identified with their primary/focus crops.\nTo increase the competitiveness of cluster crops, the CDP seeks to increase exports of targeted crops by around 20% and develop cluster-specific trademarks.\nIt aims to deal with all important horticulture-related challenges, such as pre-production, production, post-harvest management, logistics, marketing, and branding.\nIt plans to encourage horticulture clusters\u2019 integrated and market-driven growth by leveraging geographical specialization.\nIt also aims to coordinate with other government programmes like the Agriculture Infrastructure Fund.\nThrough CDP, significant investment will also be made in the horticultural industry.\nFuture of horticulture in India\n\nSome future targets to improve the horticulture sector in India are:\n\nImport of technologies to boost the horticultural industry\u2019s productivity and skill development.\napplication of organic farming practices in horticulture to produce goods with positive environmental and financial effects.\nAdoption of more standardized horticulture production procedures that aid farmers in using their knowledge and abilities to increase production.\nMore private companies\u2019 involvement in the horticulture industry may increase productivity and open up new export markets.\nThe government should encourage farms with incentives and offer assistance as they transition from conventional to organic farming to increase the development of organic horticulture.\nOffering certificates, incentivize farmers to follow Good Agriculture Practices (GAP).\n\nThese methods aid in the production of fruits and vegetables that are of higher quality. In turn, this will increase demand from other countries and boost export activity.\n\nOn-field projections:\nAccording to projections, the area devoted to horticulture will grow 2.7% in FY21 compared to FY20.\nAccording to estimates, horticulture production will increase by 5.8 mt in FY21 compared to FY20.\nThe agriculture ministry has chosen 10 indigenous fruit crops and 10 fruit varieties that are widely consumed.\nTo meet India\u2019s anticipated 650 mt of fruit and vegetable demand by 2050, there is room to increase productivity.\nConclusion\n\nAs a diverse agricultural function, the horticulture industry has grown to be a promising source of employment possibilities.\n\nIt helps ensure both the sector\u2019s and the economy\u2019s continuous growth. India has developed into a top producer of horticulture goods and has become a dependable source for the creation of jobs, income, and export promotion.\n\nWith the aid of better resource allocation, infrastructure development, technical advancement, and better policy implementation for the development of the horticulture industry, India is anticipated to attain a significant position in the global forum.\n\nMaking a deliberate effort to put specific strategies into action would help the horticulture industry expand and thrive in the future.\n\nRead:\u00a0Cocoa cultivation in India;\u00a0Spices Sector in India\n\n-Article written by Swathi Satish"

Some of the top countries importing tea from India are China, Russia, Iran, the United Arab Emirates, the United States, and the United Kingdom.\n\nGovernment initiatives for the development of the tea industry\n\nTo help the Indian exporters market teas of Indian origin in overseas markets on a sustained basis, the Tea Board of India started a scheme: Promotion for packaged Tea of Indian origin.\n\nThe scheme provides assistance in promotional campaigns \u2013 up to 25% of the cost reimbursement, display in International Departmental Stores, product literature and website development, and inspection charges reimbursement of up to 25% of the charges.\n\nThe Tea Board also provides subsidies to domestic exporters to participate in International Fairs and Exhibitions.\n\nThe aim is to provide a platform for exporters to showcase their products at international events for promotion and facilitate the generation of trade opportunities.\n\nTea Development and Promotion Scheme\nThis scheme was launched in November 2021 by the Tea Board of India for the period of 2021-26.\nThe objective of this scheme is to enhance the productivity and quality of production in India.\n\nThere are seven important components to this scheme:\n\nPlantation development of small tea farmers\nCreation of sector-specific action plan for North East India\nSupporting the tea producers and traders in market promotion activities\nWorker\u2019s welfare\nResearch and development activities\nRegulatory reforms\nEstablishment expenses\nGoverning body- Tea Board of India\n\nThe Tea Board of India was set up in 1953 for the development of the tea industry in India. It started functioning in 1954.\n\nThe board is located in Kolkata and has 17 offices across India. Being the regulatory body, the Board exerts control over the producers, manufacturers, exporters, tea brokers, auction organizers, and warehouse keepers through various control orders notified under Tea Act.\n\nThe responsibilities of the board are increasing production and productivity, improving the quality of tea, market promotion, and welfare measures for plantation workers, and supporting Research and Development.\n\nChallenges faced by the tea industry\n\nSome issues prevent this sector from developing to its full potential. Over the previous ten years, production expenses have increased at a rate twice as fast as prices.\n\nOverproduction is currently the biggest issue the Indian tea sector is dealing with. The total amount of tea produced in India cannot be consumed by domestic and worldwide demand.\nChina produces a lot of black tea which is not consumed domestically. China is therefore making an effort to push to sell the whole quantity of extra black tea. Indian tea exports may be at risk as a result of this.\nSince tea now has a six-digit code, India no longer serves as the place of origin after some value addition, which poses another danger to Indian export. After some slight value addition, the new product re-enters the Indian market.\nA huge number of small-scale, unorganized tea farmers are present.\nUntapped tea tourism has immense potential, but it needs a boost.\n\nAlso read: Coffee Industry In India\n\nWay forward\n\nThe Indian tea industry has many chances to develop further due to the sheer magnificence of the production capacity and because it employs so many people in the northeastern regions.\n\nThe main necessity for a highly labor-centric business like tea plantations is a fully sustainable and transparent model which balances the organic and modernization approach well.\n\nPrevious year question\n\nQ.

And, in a global comparison, most of this revenue is generated in India.\n\nTable of Contents\n\nEdible oil economy of India\nTypes of Oils commonly in use in India\nConsumption Pattern of Edible Oils in India\nExport-Import Policy on Edible Oils\nGovernment initiatives\nNews about edible oil\nPrevious year question\nEdible oil economy of India\n\nThere are two major features, which have significantly contributed to the development of this sector.\n\n\ud83d\udc49 Which year are YOU targeting for success in the IAS/IPS/IFS Exam? \ud83d\ude80\n\n(1) \u21d2 UPSC 2025: Prelims cum Mains\n\n(2) \u21d2 UPSC 2026: Prelims cum Mains\n\n(3) \u21d2 UPSC 2027 Prelims cum Mains\n\nTip: Know more about ClearIAS Courses (Online/Offline)\n\nOne was the setting up of the Technology Mission on Oilseeds in 1986 which has been converted into a National Mission on Oilseeds and Oil Palm (NMOOP) in 2014.\n\nThis gave a thrust to the Government\u2019s efforts for augmenting the production of oilseeds.\nThis is evident by the very impressive increase in the production of oilseeds from about 11.3 million tons in 1986-87 to\u00a022 million tons in 2019-20.\nMost of the oilseeds are cultivated on marginal land and are dependent on rainfall and other climatic conditions.\n\nThe other dominant feature has been the program of liberalization.\n\nThis has had a significant impact on the present status of the edible oilseeds/oil industry\nUnder this, the Government\u2019s economic policy improved allowing greater freedom to the open market and encouraging healthy competition and self-regulation rather than protection and control.\nControls and regulations have been relaxed resulting in a highly competitive market dominated by both domestic and multinational players.\nTypes of Oils commonly in use in India\n\nIndia is fortunate in having a wide range of oilseed crops grown in its different agro-climatic zones.\n\nGroundnut, mustard, rapeseed, sesame, safflower, linseed, nigerseed, and castor are the major traditionally cultivated oilseeds.\nSoybean and sunflower have also assumed importance in recent years.\nCoconut is the most important among the plantation crops.\nEfforts are being made to grow oil palm in Andhra Pradesh, Karnataka, Tamil Nadu, and North-Eastern parts of the country in addition to Kerala and Andaman & Nicobar Islands.\nAmong the non-conventional oils, rice bran oil and cottonseed oil are the most important.\nIn addition, oilseeds of tree and forest origin, which grow mostly in tribal inhabited areas, are also a significant source of oils.\nConsumption Pattern of Edible Oils in India\n\nIndia is a vast country and inhabitants of several of its regions have developed a specific preference for certain oils largely depending upon the oils available in the region.\n\nFor example, people in the South and West prefer groundnut oil while those in the East and North use mustard and rapeseed oil.\nLikewise, several pockets in the South have a preference for coconut and sesame oil.\nInhabitants of the northern plain are consumers of fats and therefore prefer Vanaspati, a term used to denote a partially hydrogenated edible oil mixture of oils like soybean, sunflower, rice bran, and cottonseed oils.\nMany new oils from oilseeds of tree and forest origin have found their way to the edible pool largely through the vanaspati route.\n\nThrough modern technological means such as physical refining, bleaching, and deodorization, all oils have been rendered practically colorless, odorless, and tasteless and therefore, have become easily interchangeable in the kitchen.\n\nOils such as soyabean oil, cottonseed oil, sunflower oil, rice bran oil, palm oil and its liquid fraction- palm olein which were earlier not known have now entered the kitchen.\n\nThe share of raw oil, refined oil, and vanaspati in the total edible oil market is estimated roughly at 35%, 60%, and 5% respectively.\nAbout 56 % of the domestic demand for edible oils is met through imports out of which palm oil/palm olein constitutes about 54%.\nThe consumption of refined palmolein (RBD palmolein) as well as its blending with other oils has increased substantially over the years and is used extensively in hotels, restaurants, and in the preparation of a wide variety of food products.\nExport-Import Policy on Edible Oils\n\nThe country has to rely on imports to meet the gap between demand and supply. Import of edible oils is under Open General License (OGL).\n\nTo harmonize the interests of farmers, processors, and consumers, Government reviews the duty structure of edible oils from time to time.\n\nFrom 2018, the import duty on all crude and refined edible oils, except Palm oil and Olive oil was raised to 35% and 45% respectively while the import duty on Olive oil was increased to 40%.\nIn 2020, the import duty on Crude and Refined Palm Oil was revised to 37.5% and 45% respectively.\nIn 2020, the import policy of Refined Palm Oil is amended from \u2018free\u2019 to the \u2018Restricted\u2019 category.\nIn 2020, the import duty on crude palm oil was revised from 37.5% to 27.5%.\nGovernment initiatives\n\nYellow Revolution\u00a0was launched to increase the production of Edible oilseeds in the country to meet domestic demand.\n\nThe government of India launched National Mission on Edible Oils-Oil Palm as a centrally-sponsored scheme, being implemented jointly by the central and state governments with a special focus on the northeast region and the Andaman and Nicobar Islands.\n\nTo improve and systemize the data management system in the vegetable oil sector, the Directorate of Sugar & Vegetable Oils under the Department of Food and Public Distribution has developed a web-based platform for the online submission of inputs by vegetable oil producers on monthly basis.\n\nThis has helped the Government to take prompt and informed policy decisions for better management of the vegetable oil sector.\nThe new system also provides transparency in the data management of the vegetable oil industry as well as the Government\u2019s work.\nThe portal also provides a window for online registration and submission of monthly production returns.\n\nTo achieve self-sufficiency in the production of oilseeds, the Ministry of Agriculture and Farmers Welfare has adopted a multi-pronged strategy.\n\nUnder the strategy, the Government of India had approved an ambitious plan for the free distribution of high-yielding varieties of seeds to the farmers for the Kharif season 2021 in the form of mini-kits.\nNews about edible oil\nRecently, GM mustard was cleared by the Genetic Engineering Appraisal Committee for field trials and environmental release.\nThe central government told the Supreme Court that the deployment of GM Mustard hybrids will contribute to India\u2019s self-sustenance in the production of edible oil and shall go a long way in realizing the vision of \u201cAtmanirbhar Bharat\u201d.\nThe government added that opposing it will hurt farmers, consumers, and industry.\nPrevious year question\n\nConsider the following statements: (2018)\n\nThe quantity of imported edible oils is more than the domestic production of edible oils in the last five years.\nThe Government does not impose any customs duty on all imported edible oils as a special case.\n\nWhich of the statements given above is/are correct?\n\n(a)\u00a01 only\n(b)\u00a02 only\n(c)\u00a0Both 1 and 2\n(d)\u00a0Neither 1 nor 2\n\n-Article written by Swathi Satish"

This would improve the soil\u2019s health.\n\nThe MRP of phosphoric and potassium (P&K) fertilizers can be fixed at appropriate levels by manufacturers, marketers, and importers thanks to the Nutrient Based Subsidy Scheme (NBS).\n\nThe country\u2019s inventory levels, currency exchange rates, and domestic and international fertilizer costs are all taken into account while determining the MRP.\n\nThe NBS does not include urea-based fertilizers and is available for imported complex fertilizers except Ammonium Sulphate.\n\nFertilizer Subsidy Scheme 2022\n\nThe Fertilizer Subsidy Scheme is a centrally funded scheme launched in April 2022.\n\nIt is operated and maintained by the Department of Fertilizers.\nThe tagline of this scheme is PROSPEROUS FARMER, PROSPEROUS INDIA.\nIts main objective is to provide Nutrient Based Subsidy (NBS) rates for Phosphatic and Potassic (P&K) fertilizers to the farmers.\nAt present, it is a short-term scheme for only Kharif Season.\n\nFertilizers Subsidy Scheme 2022 allows farmers to buy fertilizer bags at very low rates in comparison to the rates in the market.\n\nIn this scheme, the government will provide subsidies for the purchase of Phosphatic and Potassic (P & K) Fertilizers to the farmers.\n\nThis will help the farmers to procure the required quantity of fertilizers for their agricultural fields.\n\nUnder this scheme, farmers will directly get subsidized fertilizers at the government-managed Sehkari Store.\nFarmers will only have to pay the subsidized amount of fertilizers\nConcerns with the Nutrient Based Subsidy Scheme\n\nBecause urea isn\u2019t included in the plan, its price is still under control as the Nutrient Based Subsidy Scheme has only been applied to other fertilizers.\n\nTechnically, there is no price regulation for other fertilizers. Farmers are now using more urea than previously because of the increased cost of other deregulated fertilizers.\nThe imbalance in fertilizer as a result has gotten worse.\n\nThe NBS policy is not only harming the fiscal state of the economy but is also proving harmful to the soil health of the nation.\n\nFertilizer subsidies are the second-largest subsidy after food subsidies.\n\nSubsidized urea is being diverted to large purchasers, traders, or even non-agricultural consumers like plywood manufacturers and producers of animal feed.\n\nIndia\u2019s agrochemical usage is quite high and almost 55% of it is urea.\n\nThe Centre provides a subsidy for urea fertilizer based on the cost of manufacturing at each facility. Manufacturers of fertilizers are required to sell them.\nNBS Scheme in news\nThe Union Cabinet has approved the proposal of the Department of Fertilizers for per Kilogram rates of Nutrient Based Subsidy (NBS) for various Nutrients that is Nitrogen (N), Phosphorus (P), Potash (K), and Sulphur (S) for Phosphatic and Potassic (P&K) fertilizers for Rabi Season 2022-23\n\nThis will enable the smooth availability of all P&K fertilizers to the farmers during Rabi 2022-23 at the subsidized / affordable prices of fertilizers and support the agriculture sector.\n\nThe volatility in the international prices of fertilizers and raw materials has been primarily absorbed by the Union Government.\n\nWay forward\n\nUrea must be included by the Nutrient Based Subsidy Scheme to redress the imbalance in fertilizer use.\n\nA workable solution would be to raise the price of urea while concurrently lowering the NBS rates for phosphate, potash, and sulfur to lower the cost of other fertilizers.\n\nGiven that all three nutrients-nitrogen (N), phosphorus (P), and potassium (K) are essential for boosting crop yields and produce quality, the government must adopt a standard policy for all fertilizers.\n\nA flat per-acre cash subsidy that may be used to buy any fertilizer should eventually take the place of NBS.\n\nThis subsidy must cover goods with added value and customization that deliver nitrogen more effectively than urea while also including other nutrients.\n\n-Article written by Swathi Satish"

One of them is to publish two reports every year. One is, the Annual Report, and the other is the Report on Trends and Progress of Banking in India.\n\nRBI conducts Consumer Confidence Survey and Inflation Expectation Survey every quarter.\n\nKey Features Related to the Functions of RBI\nRBI is authorized to issue various guidelines for bank directors and has the power to appoint additional directors to the board of a banking company.\nPrior approval of RBI is important for the appointment, reappointment, and termination of the Chairman, Managing Director, and CEO of Commercial Banks (except PSBs).\nIf the situation arises then RBI with the approval of the Central Government can take the place of the Board of Directors of Commercial Banks.\nPublic Sector Banks (PSBs) come under dual regulation of the Central Government and RBI so the RBI\u2019s power regarding the PSBs is curtailed as it cannot remove the directors and management and cannot supersede the board of Banks also cannot enforce mergers.\nAs per RBI\u2019s regulation, Banks needed to maintain certain reserves in the form of CRR and SLR.\nRBI regulates the interest rate on NRI deposits, export credits (loans), and a few other categories. However, the interest rate on most of the categories of deposit and lending have been deregulated so the banks are responsible for determining such rates.\nRBI set up the Deposit Insurance and Credit Guarantee Corporation (DICGC) for the protection of the interest of small depositors in case of bank failure or bankruptcy (100% subsidy). It provides insurance cover to all eligible bank depositors up to 5 lakhs per depositor per bank. To provide insurance coverage, it charges premiums from banks. DICGC covers all commercial banks including foreign bank branches as well along with UCBs/StCBs/DCCBs. However, it is important to note that it does not cover deposits of foreign governments, deposits of Central and State governments, and interbank deposits.\nRBI has permitted the banks to undertake some non-traditional banking activities such as venture capital, insurance, mutual fund business, etc.\nCooperative Banks- Cooperative Banks come under the dual regulation of RBI and the Government. Both the authorities have different fields to work on as RBI manages the banking-related functions and the Central Government or State Government manages the management-related functions.\nFinancial Institutions, NBFCs, Primary Dealers, and Credit Information Companies (CIC)- The four all-India financial institutions named NABARD, NHB, EXIM Bank, and SIDBI are under full-fledged regulation and supervision of RBI.\nNBFCs, Primary Dealers and CICs also come under the regulation and supervision of RBI.\nNote: RBI is authorized to regulate banks and NBFCs but till July 2019, RBI had the power to take the place of the Board of Banks (in case of any mismanagement or default) but not of NBFCs. In July 2019 an amendment was made to the RBI Act 1934 that empowers the RBI to supersede the bank of NBFCs also in case of mismanagement or default. RBI now has the power to appoint administrators as well in the public interest.\n\nArticle Written By: Priti Raj"

Payments made in cash are an example of direct subsidies in India. Tax breaks and premium-free insurance are examples of indirect subsidies.\n\nThe purpose of the subsidy is often to alleviate some sort of hardship. It is frequently thought to be in the interest of the public to provide to promote a social good or economic policy.\n\nTable of Contents\n\nTypes of Subsidies\nOther types\nHow do subsidies affect our budgetary resources?\nThe rationale behind providing subsidies\nDisadvantages\nConclusion\nTypes of Subsidies\n\nThere are six primary categories of subsidies as follows, divided by purpose. They are as follows:\n\nExport subsidies \u2013 Subsidies given on exports.\nSubsidies contingent upon the use of domestic over imported goods \u2013 To promote domestic goods from the cheaper imported goods.\nIndustrial promotion subsidies \u2013 To promote certain industries.\nStructural adjustment subsidies \u2013 To adjust or compensate for the structural deficiencies in an economy.\nRegional development subsidies \u2013 It is given for the development of a particular region.\nResearch and development subsidies \u2013 To promote research and development.\nBy beneficiary, there are two primary categories \u2013\nSubsidies that are not limited to specific businesses or industries (non-specific subsidies).\nSubsidies that are limited to specific businesses and industries (specific subsidies).\nOther types\nProduct subsidy \u2013 Subsidies on products are payments made per unit of a produced article or service. A product subsidy is usually due when the good is manufactured, sold, or imported, but it may also be due when the good is transferred, leased, delivered, or utilized for one\u2019s consumption or capital development.\nProduction subsidy \u2013 The purpose of production subsidies is to increase the production of a specific good such that the market would support it without increasing the final cost to consumers.\nConsumer/Consumption subsidies \u2013 These reduce the price of goods and services to the consumer.\nGovernment subsidies \u2013 The government offers subsidies in a variety of types. Welfare payments and unemployment compensation are two of the most prevalent forms of individual subsidies. The main goal of these subsidies is to assist those who are momentarily experiencing financial hardship.\n\nFurther subsidies are provided to encourage people to pursue higher education and subsidized interest rates on student loans.\n\nHow do subsidies affect our budgetary resources?\n\nIndia is a developing nation, thus there aren\u2019t many budgetary resources available to expand the reach of subsidies to a larger population.\n\n\ud83d\udc49 Which year are YOU targeting for success in the IAS/IPS/IFS Exam? \ud83d\ude80\n\n(1) \u21d2 UPSC 2025: Prelims cum Mains\n\n(2) \u21d2 UPSC 2026: Prelims cum Mains\n\n(3) \u21d2 UPSC 2027 Prelims cum Mains\n\nTip: Know more about ClearIAS Courses (Online/Offline)\n\nThe amount of food subsidy in the government budget is Rs. 2.06 lakh crore, or around 1.9% of GDP in 2018\u201319 and 2.5% in 2019\u20132020.\n\nFrom 2010\u201311 to 2019\u201320, or roughly the narrow range of 18.4% to 20.3%, the revenue to GDP ratio has been stagnant for a considerable amount of time.\n\nThe ratio is much higher in many developed and emerging market economies. These ratios for the UK and the USA in 2019 were 36% and 30.1%, for Sweden and the Netherlands they were 48.6% and 43.6%, and for Brazil, it was 31.5%.\n\nAlso, Read\u00a0Direct Benefit Transfer;\u00a0Freebies politics,\u00a0Nutrients based subsidy scheme\n\nThe rationale behind providing subsidies\n\nPublic subsidies can be justified for a variety of reasons: some are political, others are economic, and some are based on socioeconomic development theory. According to development theory, some businesses require protection from outside competition to maximize domestic advantage.\n\nA free market economy is technically devoid of subsidies; adding one turns it into a mixed economy. The value of subsidies and, by extension, the degree to which an economy should be mixed are topics of frequent discussion among economists and decision-makers.\n\nSubsidies in India are provided for a variety of reasons, and they play a significant role in the country\u2019s economic and social policies. These subsidies are designed to address various economic, social, and political objectives.\n\nPoverty Alleviation: Subsidies are often used as a means of poverty alleviation. They aim to provide essential goods and services at lower prices to economically disadvantaged sections of the population, making them more accessible and affordable.\nFood Security: The government provides food subsidies to ensure food security for the population. The Public Distribution System (PDS) is a prominent example where essential food items are distributed to the poor at subsidized rates.\nAgriculture Support: Subsidies are extended to the agriculture sector to support farmers and enhance agricultural productivity. These subsidies can include fertilizers, seeds, and credit facilities.\nFuel Subsidies: Subsidies on fuels, particularly cooking gas and kerosene, are aimed at providing energy at lower costs to households, especially in rural and economically disadvantaged areas.\nEducation and Healthcare: The government offers subsidies in the education and healthcare sectors to make quality education and healthcare more accessible to the masses. This includes subsidized education in government schools and colleges and affordable healthcare services in public health facilities.\nExport Promotion: Subsidies are often provided to boost exports by making Indian products more competitive in international markets. This can include export incentives and tax benefits for exporters.\nSmall and Medium Enterprises (SMEs): Subsidies are given to support the growth and development of small and medium-sized enterprises, which are crucial for economic growth and job creation.\nEnvironmental Conservation: Some subsidies are introduced to encourage environmentally friendly practices. For instance, incentives may be provided to promote the use of clean energy sources or the adoption of eco-friendly technologies.\nSocial Welfare: Subsidies are also used for social welfare programs, including cash transfers to vulnerable populations, maternity benefits, and other forms of financial support.\nIndustrial Development: Subsidies may be offered to encourage the growth of specific industries or to attract investment in certain regions, to boost economic development and employment opportunities.\nPrice Stabilization: Subsidies are sometimes used to stabilize prices of essential commodities. For example, subsidies on cooking gas can help maintain stable prices for consumers.\nPolitical Popularity: In a democratic context, governments may use subsidies to gain political support and popularity, especially during elections.\nDisadvantages\nAlthough an increased supply of commodities is one benefit of subsidies, a lack of supply is also a possibility. This is so that manufacturers won\u2019t have to work as hard to fulfill a sudden increase in demand that can result from lower prices. In the end, it may result in extremely strong demand, which raises prices.\nOften, subsidies are efficient and beneficial. The situation would be different if the government released a report on how well it had used subsidies. This is due to the difficulty in measuring the effectiveness of subsidies.\nHow will the government raise money to support industry subsidies? Naturally, by levying larger taxes. Therefore, the general public and businesses are the ones who give the resources needed for the government to subsidize industry.\n\nGovernments utilize several tools in their toolbox, including subsidies, to accomplish various policy objectives.\n\nFrom the standpoint of sustainable development, it is essential to address the negative externalities of subsidies while maintaining their market-correcting role and the policy space for development. This is because the world is becoming more interdependent.\n\nConclusion\n\nIt\u2019s important to note that subsidies in India, while aimed at providing support and benefits, can also pose challenges, such as fiscal burdens, inefficiencies, and leakages. To address these challenges, the government has initiated reforms to rationalize and target subsidies more effectively, including the use of digital platforms for direct benefit transfers. Subsidy policies are subject to periodic review and adjustment to ensure they meet their intended objectives while minimizing distortions in the economy.\n\nArticle written by: Krishnapriya JR"

            "[CONTENT]": "The Indian Financial System plays a vital role in the Indian Economy. It has several components that are explained in detail in this article.\n\nIn India, there are primarily two types of financial institutions: Banks and Non-Banking Financial Institutions (NBFIs).\n\nThe main distinction between a bank and an NBFI is that banks accept demand deposits, whereas NBFIs do not.

These are essentially private banks with foreign ownership.\n\nRegional Rural Banks (RRB)\n\nUnder the provisions of the Regional Rural Banks Act of 1976, Regional Rural Banks were created in 1975 with the goal of boosting the rural economy by offering loans and other facilities, particularly to small and marginal farmers, agricultural laborers, artisans, and small businesses owners, for the growth of agriculture, trade, commerce, industry, and other productive activities in rural areas.\n\nRRBs are held by the Central government, the concerned State government, and the sponsor bank in the proportion of 50:15:35.\nEach RRB is sponsored by a particular bank.\nRRBs need to provide 75% of the lending to priority sectors. RRBs are under the supervision of NABARD.\nPayment Banks\n\nIn August 2015, RBI approved\u00a0licenses to 11 applicants\u00a0as Payment Banks. The RBI has set a limit of Rs. 1 lakh on the amount of deposits that payment banks may accept from one customer. Only businesses that are really committed to serving the underprivileged and poor\u00a0will be able to apply for a payment bank.\n\nTherefore, migrant workers, independent contractors, low-income households, etc. will be the main target of payment banks.\n\nPayment banks are not\u00a0allowed to lend money or issue credit cards. Payment banks will only accept demand deposits i.e.,\u00a0only current and savings account options will be offered.\n\nSmall Finance Banks\nThe RBI awarded licenses to numerous applications for Small Finance Banks in September 2015, which is a step toward advancing financial inclusion.\nThe small finance banks will largely engage in basic banking activities, such as accepting deposits and lending to underserved and unserved groups, such as unorganized sector entities, small business units, small and marginal farmers, and micro and small businesses.\nThere won\u2019t be any limitations on the area\u00a0of operation of\u00a0small financing institutions.\nThe small finance banks must lend 75% of their total credit to sectors that the RBI has designated as priority sectors for lending (PSL).\nIts lending portfolio should consist of at least 50% loans and advances under Rs. 25 lakhs.\n\nA Government of India Scheme announced in 1996 led to the establishment of Local Area Banks (LAB). The purpose of establishing local area banks was to make it possible for local institutions to mobilize rural savings and make them available for investments in the local regions.\n\nAlso read: Microfinance Institutions\n\nCooperative Banks\n\nUnder the Indian Financial System, Urban Co-operative Banks (UCB) and Rural Co-operative Banks are the two subcategories of cooperative banks. UCBs come under the supervision of RBI.\n\nUrban Co-operative Banks\n\nUrban Co-operative Banks, also known as Primary Co-operative Banks, are found in urban and semi-urban regions. They essentially made loans to small enterprises and borrowers. They now have a far wider range of operations.\n\nUCBs are further classified into\u00a0Scheduled and Non-scheduled categories, which are then further divided into single-state and multi-state.\n\nSingle State UCBs are governed by the Registrar of Cooperative Societies (RCS) of the state concerned and are\u00a0registered as cooperative societies under the State Government Cooperative Societies Act.\n\nMulti-State UCBs are governed by the Central Registrar of Cooperative Societies (CRCS) and are registered as cooperative societies under the requirements of the Multi-State Cooperative Societies Act of 2002.\n\nRural Cooperative Banks\n\nIndia\u2019s rural cooperative credit system is primarily responsible for ensuring credit flow to the agricultural sector. Both short-term and long-term cooperative credit systems are included in it.\n\nState Cooperative Banks (StCBs) at the state level, (District) Central Cooperative Banks (DCCBs) at the district level and Primary Agricultural Credit Societies (PACS) at the village level make up the three-tier system that governs the short-term cooperative credit framework.\n\nLong-term cooperative credit systems include the State Cooperative Agriculture and Rural Development Bank (SCARDB) and the Primary Cooperative Agricultural and Rural Development Bank (PCARDB).\n\nAbout Non-Banking Financial Institutions (NBFIs)\n\nUnder the Indian Financial System, the Non-Banking Financial Institutions (NBFIs) industry is a key sector that is governed and regulated by the RBI.\n\nAll India Financial Institutions (AIFIs), Non-Banking Financial Companies (NBFCs), and Primary Dealers (PDs) fall under NBFIs in the Indian Financial System.\n\nCredit Information Companies (CIC) are also a category of non-banking financial institutions that are subject to RBI regulation.\n\nAll India Financial Institutions (AIFIs)\n\nAIFIs are an institutional mechanism entrusted with providing sector-specific long-term financing. Currently, the RBI regulates and supervises several AIFIs, also known as Development Financial Institutions (DFIs). Such AIF institutions are mentioned below.\n\nA) NABARD\n\nBy the National Bank for Agriculture and Rural Development Act of 1981, NABARD was established in 1982.\n\nNABARD offers credit to promote rural areas\u2019 linked economic activities, including small-scale enterprises, cottage industries, handicrafts, and rural crafts.\n\nNABARD oversees and coordinates the activities of rural credit institutions like RRBs\u00a0and Rural Cooperative Banks (RBI has delegated its supervisory powers in the case of the rural sector to NABARD while retaining its regulatory powers)\n\nWhen it comes to issues of rural development, NABARD offers help to the government, RBI, and other organizations.\n\nprovides training and research facilities for banks, cooperatives, and organizations in areas related to rural development.\n\nAlthough it does not offer direct credit to specific individuals, it does offer indirect financial help through refinancing (NABARD finances the organizations that offer financial assistance to the rural sector). Institutions that are approved by the central government may receive direct financing from NABARD.\n\nB) NATIONAL HOUSING BANK (NHB)\n\nUnder the National Housing Bank Act of 1987, NHB was founded in 1988. The main purpose of NHB\u2019s operations is to assist and promote housing finance institutions through financial and other means at both the local and regional levels.\n\nAlthough it does not provide direct credit to individuals, it does provide indirect financial help through refinancing (i.e. NHB finances those institutions that provide finance to individual borrowers, builders, etc.)\n\nC) EXIM BANK\n\nThe Export-Import Bank of India Act of 1981 led to the establishment of the EXIM bank in 1982.\n\nThe goal of the EXIM bank is to help exporters and importers with financial support and serve as the main financial institution for coordinating the operations of institutions engaged in financing the export and import of products and services to promote the nation\u2019s international trade.\n\nIt offers direct financial support to exporters and importers as well as indirect support through refinancing.\n\nD) SMALL INDUSTRIES DEVELOPMENT BANK OF INDIA (SIDBI)\n\nUnder the provisions of the Small Industries Development of India Act 1989, SIDBI was established in 1990.\n\nSIDBI serves as the primary financial institution for the development, financing, and promotion of the Micro, Small, and Medium-Sized Enterprise (MSME) sector as well as for coordination of the operations of the institutions involved in related activities.\n\nSIDBI primarily provides banking institutions with indirect financial support (via refinancing) to enable them to continue lending to MSMEs.\n\nE) MUDRA BANK\n\nThe Government of India established MUDRA (Micro Units Development and Refinance Agency Ltd.) as a financial organization for the development and refinancing of micro-unit firms.\n\nUnder the Indian Financial System, a Non-Banking Finance Company named MUDRA Ltd has been established as a subsidiary of SIDBI.\n\nThe goal of MUDRA is to provide funding to the non-corporate (informal sector) small business sector, including small manufacturing units, store owners, fruit and vegetable vendors, hair salons,\u00a0and craftsmen in both rural and urban areas with financial requirements up to Rs. 10 lakhs.\n\nThere are three different types of MUDRA loans. Loans up to Rs. 50,000 are available for small businesses under the \u201cShishu\u201d category; loans beyond Rs. 50,000 and up to Rs. 5 lakhs are available under the \u201cKishor\u201d category, and loans between Rs. 5 lakhs and Rs. 10 lakhs are available under the \u201cTarun\u201d category.\n\nNon-Banking Financial Companies (NBFCs)\n\nNon-Banking Financial Companies (NBFCs), commonly referred to as Non-Banking Financial Institutions (NBFIs), are organizations that offer some financial services that resemble those offered by banks but do not have a banking license.\n\nUnder the Indian Financial System, a non-banking financial company (NBFC) is a company registered under the Companies Act of 1956 that engages in the business of loans and advances, acquisition of shares/stocks/bonds/debentures/securities issued by the government or a local authority or other marketable securities of a like nature, leasing, hire-purchase, insurance business, and chit business.\n\nIt excludes institutions whose main line of business is that of agriculture activity, industrial activity, and the purchase or sale of immovable property.\n\nAccording to the RBI Act of 1934, no NBFC may operate without a certificate of registration from RBI. However, certain kinds of NBFCs that are subject to regulation by other agencies are free from the requirement of registration with the RBI, for example:\n\nVenture Capital Funds, Merchant Banking Institutions, and Stock broking companies registered with SEBI.\nInsurance Company with a current Certificate of Registration by IRDA.\nChit firms, as outlined in the 1982 Chit Funds Act and governed by the respective State governments.\n\nMicro Financial Institutions (MFIs) are also a type of NBFC, however, the amount of credit they can extend is restricted. The upper limit is Rs. 1.25 lakh for those living in rural areas, and Rs. 2 lakhs for those in urban and semi-urban areas.\n\nPrimary Dealers (PDs)\n\nThe RBI has granted primary dealers the right to buy and sell government securities. They are organizations that have registered with the RBI. As RBI releases these government securities on behalf of the government, PDs purchase them directly from the government in the primary market to resell them to other customers in the secondary market. As a result, they are essential in developing the primary and secondary markets for government securities.\n\nPeer to Peer (P2P) Lender\n\nUnder the Indian Financial System, P2P intermediaries are a new class of NBFCs that offer a platform that connects independent lenders and borrowers. P2P lending allows borrowers to borrow money from private investors who are willing to lend their own funds at an agreed interest rate. Social lending or crowd lending are other names for peer-to-peer lending.\n\nThere are limits on how much a lender can lend (up to a total of Rs. 50 lakhs), how much a borrower can borrow, and for how long they can borrow it (limit on period).\n\nserve as an intermediary by offering a platform or online market to those taking part in peer-to-peer lending;\nnot raise\u00a0deposits and not end on its own\nnot offer any sort of credit guarantee\nconduct a thorough investigation of the participants;\ncarry out risk profiling and credit assessment of the borrowers and disclose the information to potential lenders;\nrequire the participant\u2019s prior consent before accessing their credit information;\nprovide aid with loan disbursement and repayment of the amount;\nCredit Information Companies (CIC)\n\nA CIC is an autonomous company that enlists banks, NBFCs, and financial institutions as members. From these members, the CIC collects data and identifying information for specific customers and companies. Based on a prospective borrower\u2019s past payment history, CICS can tell banks whether or not he is creditworthy. The level of information determines how well lenders can assess risk and how easily consumers can get loans at affordable rates.\n\nBy the Credit Information Companies (Regulation) Act of 2005, the RBI regulates and issues licenses to CICs. TransUnion Credit Information Bureau of India Limited (CIBIL), Equifax, Experian, and High Mark Credit Information Services are the four CICS currently operating in India.\n\nArticle Written By: Priti Raj"

Continue reading to learn more.\n\n\u201cTake, make, use, and Dispose\u201d\u2026We have been adhering to this norm for decades!!!\n\nWe frequently throw away the older models when we want the newest phone or laptop. We throw away our old clothes as our sense of style shifts, and this replacement is extremely typical in all aspects of our lives. However, this inefficient method, known as the linear economy, is bad for the environment.\n\nWe are running out of resources and creating an excessive amount of harmful waste. That is why we must transition to a circular economy, which is motivated by the natural world and in which nothing is wasted.\n\nTable of Contents\n\nWhat exactly is a Linear Economy?\nWhat is a Circular Economy?\nThe Concept is built on three key ideas\n1 .

With things designed to be discarded after use, it puts profit before sustainability.\n\n(According to the Ministry of Environment, Forest, and Climate Change, under the government of India, The nation generates approximately 62 million tons of waste with an average annual growth rate of 4%. It is also found that currently, India generates 70 million metrics of municipal solid wastes. Out of it, only 20% is recycled and the rest ends up in landfills and oceans affecting humans, and marine life, along with destroying the environment. )\u00a0\n\n\ud83d\udc49 Which year are YOU targeting for success in the IAS/IPS/IFS Exam? \ud83d\ude80\n\n(1) \u21d2 UPSC 2025: Prelims cum Mains\n\n(2) \u21d2 UPSC 2026: Prelims cum Mains\n\n(3) \u21d2 UPSC 2027 Prelims cum Mains\n\nTip: Know more about ClearIAS Courses (Online/Offline)\n\nWhat is a Circular Economy?\n\nA circular economy, often known as \u201ccircularity,\u201d is an economic system that addresses issues including pollution, waste, biodiversity loss, and climate change.\nA circular economy emphasizes the 3 R\u2019s (Reduce, Reuse, and Recycle) as well as material refurbishment, recovery, and repair.\nTherefore, the circular economy is focused on boosting production through resource consumption is more effective and hence has the least negative effect on the environment.\nSustainability serves as the foundation for all aspects of production, consumption, and design.\n\n(It is estimated that waste management in India is potentially a $15 billion industry. Out of the entire waste produced in India,\u00a0 25% are dry waste components that can be recycled. This recyclable waste, dumped into landfills due to a lack of proper collection and infrastructure, can be reused as raw material. If it is properly segregated and processed further, it can be a highly lucrative source of revenue generating)\n\nAlso read:\u00a0 E-waste, Single-use plastics.\n\nThe Concept is built on three key ideas\n1 . REDUCING POLLUTION AND WASTE\n\nThe idea recommends minimizing waste and pollution through minimizing the harm caused by economic activity.\n\n2. EXTENDING THE USABLE LIVES OF MATERIALS AND PRODUCTS\n\nBy creating loops of resources and products cycling in the economy, a circular economy tries to increase the usable life of the products and materials. The objective is accomplished by actively reusing, repairing, and remanufacturing the goods and resources used in the economy.\n\n3 . NATURAL SYSTEM REGENERATION\n\nOne of the core ideas of a (circular) economy is the regeneration of natural systems. It increases natural capital and establishes the prerequisites for natural systems\u2019 regeneration\n\nAlso read: Landfill Fires: Causes, Mitigation and Management\n\nWhat is a Butterfly Diagram?\n\nThe butterfly diagram, which depicts the circular economy system, demonstrates the constant flow of materials in a circular economy. The technological cycle and the biological cycle are the two main cycles. After completing one or more usage cycles, biological materials\u2014represented by the green cycles on the diagram\u2019s left side\u2014can be safely reintroduced into the natural world, where they will biodegrade over time and release the nutrients they once contained.\n\nTechnical materials, shown in blue on the right side, are prohibited from returning to the environment. For their worth to be recovered and retrieved, these commodities, such as metals, polymers, and synthetic compounds, must be continuously cycled through the system.\n\nIs recycling the same as that of the Circular Economy?\n\nAlthough the two concepts are interconnected, a circular economy is more comprehensive and ambitious.\nIn Recycling, the majority of recyclable goods can only be downcycled, which results in a loss of quality with each subsequent life cycle and eventual waste.\nWithout any fresh material inputs, a circular economy would reduce emissions, waste, and ultimately costs.\u00a0\nA circular economy would educate individuals on their consumption habits in addition to enhancing recycling systems.\n\u00a0\u00a0The Circular Economy: Is it Feasible?\nMaking a production cycle fully self-sufficient is virtually impossible. There will always be some waste produced and some new input required.\nSince the term \u201ccircular economy\u201d can refer to everything from enhancing recycling programmes to leveraging technology to streamline the sharing economy, critics claim it is challenging to quantify the environmental effects of this notion.\u00a0\nAs businesses invest in more technology and train staff and customers to adopt new behaviours, creating a circular economy also comes with substantial upfront expenditures.\u00a0\nSome claim that the circular economy will just only postpone the detrimental impacts of the linear economy on the environment.\nWhat are the Benefits of the Circular Economy?\nEnvironmental protection: By reducing emissions, using fewer natural resources, and creating less garbage.\nBenefits for the local economy include promoting business models that utilize recycled garbage from the area as a source of raw materials.\nPromotes the development of a new, imaginative, and competitive industrial model, which has a positive impact on the economy and increases jobs.\nIn the next 5-7 years, the circular economy has the potential to produce 1.4 crore employment and lakhs of new businesses says NITI Aayog.\nEncourages the independent use of resources by reducing the need for imported raw materials.\nIncreased Potential for Economic Growth: According to the UNCTAD, India could adopt circular principles in just three industries\u2014cities and construction, food and agriculture, and mobility and vehicle manufacturing\u2014to generate an additional $200+ billion in economic value by 2030 and $600+ billion by 2050.\nReduced Negative Externalities: Consumers will also receive items that are more inventive and long-lasting, which will improve their quality of life and save them money over time.\nWhat actions do governments take?\n\nThey are building action plans and making international pledges to encourage manufacturers and consumers to shift toward a more circular economy.\u00a0\n\nCountries like Canada are outlawing single-use plastics like straws, cutlery, and check-out bags, encouraging retailers and eateries to invest in environmentally friendly alternatives. In March 2020, the European Commission approved a new circular economy action plan.\nA transformation to a circular economy is discussed in the Union Budget for 2022\u20132023.\nA budget of 2000 crore has been set aside to encourage the development of high-efficiency solar modules, which will help the government reach its goal of 280 GW of installed solar power.\nThe budget has encouraged the establishment of business models for energy saving, the use of biomass pellets, and thermal power plants.\nThe budget highlights the expectation that the shift to a circular economy will boost productivity and generate new jobs.\nIt holds for a variety of industries, including the production of electronics.\nCircular economy (CE) action plans are being developed for 11 categories of waste by committees constituted by NITI Aayog. These waste categories include municipal waste, scrap metal, electronic waste, lithium-ion batteries, solar panels, gypsum, toxic and hazardous industrial waste, used oil waste, agriculture waste, tyre and rubber recycling, and end-of-life vehicles.\u00a0\nCE action plans for five waste categories \u2013 lithium-ion batteries, e-waste, toxic and hazardous industrial waste, scrap metal (ferrous and non-ferrous), and tyre and rubber recycling \u2013 have been finalised and are under implementation. Further, an overarching national policy for mainstreaming resource efficiency and circular economy across all sectors is in the works.\n\nRead:\u00a0Battery waste management; Solid Waste Management; Solar Waste Management\n\nConclusion\n\nA good alternative to the linear economy is the circular economy. Resources can be used more effectively and efficiently by maximising their value throughout the life cycles of the goods that include them, and negative effects on the environment, the economy, and society related to product life cycles can be reduced.\n\nAs a result, the circular economy provides a simple solution that satisfies existing policy objectives. There is a lot of room to grow the circular economy\u2019s contribution to the global economy.\n\nMains Practice Question:\n\nCircular Economy is the key to Green India.

            "[CONTENT]": "Unemployment means when someone actively searches for work but is unsuccessful. There are different types of unemployment that are explained in this article.\n\nUnemployment is a major economic criterion for defining a nation\u2019s economic health because it shows the capability (or incapability) of healthy, educated, and willing individuals to gain a livelihood.\n\nThis does not include people who are unable to work due to retirement, a disability, higher education pursuits, etc.\n\nIn short, a higher unemployment rate indicates lesser economic growth and productivity.\n\nTable of Contents\n\nTypes of Unemployment\nOpen Unemployment\nDisguised Unemployment\nSeasonal Unemployment\nVulnerable Unemployment\nStructural Unemployment\nCyclical Unemployment\nTechnological Unemployment\nFrictional Unemployment\nEducated Unemployment\nUnderemployment\nChronic Unemployment\nCasual Unemployment\nReasons for Unemployment\nMeasures to Curb Unemployment\nTypes of Unemployment\n\nUnemployment can be caused by a number of reasons. A few important of them are-\n\nOpen Unemployment\n\nOpen unemployment occurs when a significant portion of the labour force is unable to find a position that may provide them with a stable source of income.\n\nReason: The labour force is growing Bigger than the pace of economic expansion. Therefore, not everyone finds employment.\n\n\ud83d\udc49 Which year are YOU targeting for success in the IAS/IPS/IFS Exam? \ud83d\ude80\n\n(1) \u21d2 UPSC 2025: Prelims cum Mains\n\n(2) \u21d2 UPSC 2026: Prelims cum Mains\n\n(3) \u21d2 UPSC 2027 Prelims cum Mains\n\nTip: Know more about ClearIAS Courses (Online/Offline)\n\nDisguised Unemployment\n\nIn this case, more individuals are working than is truly necessary. Production is not harmed even if some are pulled. In other words, it refers to a situation in which there is an excess of labour and certain workers have zero marginal output.\n\nReason: The main causes of disguised unemployment in India may be related to overcrowding in agriculture brought on by the country\u2019s fast population increase and a lack of alternative employment opportunities.\n\nIn India, it is mainly found in the agricultural and unorganised sectors.\n\nSeasonal Unemployment\n\nThis type of unemployment happens at different times of the year. Production activities only happen during certain seasons in several sectors and professions, such as agriculture, holiday destinations, ice manufacturers, etc.\n\nAs a result, they only offer jobs for a limited time each year. People who participate in such activities run the risk of not finding work during the off-season.\n\nUnemployment is a major economic criterion for defining a nation\u2019s economic health because it shows the capability (or incapability) of healthy, educated, and willing individuals to gain a livelihood.\n\nVulnerable Unemployment\n\nPeople who work informally, without adequate job contracts or other legal protection, are said to be in vulnerable employment. Since no records of their employment are ever kept, these people are considered to be \u201cunemployed.\n\nIt is one of the primary categories of unemployment in India.\n\nStructural Unemployment\n\nThis kind of unemployment develops as a result of substantial adjustments made to a nation\u2019s economic structure. These adjustments may have an impact on a production factor\u2019s demand or supply.\n\nStructural employment is a natural byproduct of the tremendous global economic growth, technical innovation, and advancement that is occurring in every area.\n\nFor example: Unable to get a job due to a lack of required skills or poor education level or lack of advancement.\n\nCyclical Unemployment\n\nIt is brought on by trade cycles, which happen periodically. Typically, trade cycles are a feature of capitalist economies. Unemployment is caused by a decline in business activity. Typically, cyclical unemployment is a short-run\u00a0situation.\n\nThe figure for Cyclical unemployment in India is almost negligible.\n\nTechnological Unemployment\n\nIt is the outcome of some technological advancement in production methods, which could not need a lot of labour. Because it is capital intensive, modern technology uses fewer workers and that leads to this type of unemployment.\n\nIn 2016, World Bank data said that year by year the proportion of jobs threatened by automation in India is 69%.\n\nFrictional Unemployment\n\nUnsuccessful labour market adjustments between supply and demand lead to frictional unemployment.\n\nThis sort of unemployment is brought on by the labour force\u2019s inactivity, a lack of accurate and timely information, the seasonal nature of employment, etc. It is also called search unemployment.\n\nIt is sometimes considered voluntary unemployment because it is not caused because of any shortage of jobs, opposite to that, the workers themselves either quit or choose not to get jobs at a point in search of better opportunities.\n\nFor Example: the time lag between jobs when an individual is searching for a new job.\n\nEducated Unemployment\n\nIn addition to open unemployment, many educated people are underemployed since their qualifications do not fit the position. The main causes of unemployment among educated young people in India are the country\u2019s flawed educational system, mass production, desire for white-collar work, a lack of employable skills, and a decline in regular salaried employment.\n\nOpen unemployment or underemployment may both apply to educated people.\n\nUnderemployment\n\nPeople who are employed are in a circumstance where they are not contributing as much as they could. In such a scenario,\u00a0people take up a position that needs less educational qualification. that means people are unable to untap their potential and settle for lesser work because of the lack of employment opportunities.\n\nChronic Unemployment\n\nChronic unemployment is defined as persistent unemployment over an extended period of time. The primary reasons for long-term unemployment are population expansion that is out of control and an inadequate degree of economic development as a result of poverty\u2019s vicious circle.\n\nCasual Unemployment\n\nCasual unemployment can happen when a person is not regularly or day to day basis employed because of short-term contracts, a lack of raw materials, a decline in demand, a change in ownership, etc.\n\nReasons for Unemployment\nLack of entrepreneurship culture- This has limited the scope.\nInadequate resources or opportunities- This covers illiteracy, linguistic ability, transportation, and many other things.\nLack of skilled employment- The rates of employment availability are changing along with the times. Businesses are now searching for more specialised talents as a result of the deployment of AI.\nlack of relevant jobs- This undermines the qualification and abilities.\nInadequate employability- There must be more employers and enterprises to accommodate the increased demand for jobs.\nMeasures to Curb Unemployment\n\nIt is important\u00a0to address frictional and cyclical unemployment by creating more jobs. There are steps that can be implemented to encourage companies to hire more workers at a better wage to foster growth.\n\nIt is important\u00a0to address frictional and cyclical unemployment by creating more jobs. There are steps that can be implemented to encourage companies to hire more workers at a better wage to foster growth.\n\nMore effort is needed to create structural employment, however, the long-term outcome is better.\n\nThe issue of unemployment runs extremely deep. Education and skill development are among the changes that are needed at this hour.\n\nArticle Written By: Priti Raj"

With the expansion of the tourism industry, there are an increasing number of companies that will be benefitted from the service sector.\nA growing tourism industry is a driving force behind development, necessitating adequate infrastructure. Example: The mobile tourism caravans in Uttarakhand.\nThe railroad, aviation, and real estate sectors are also supported.\nTourism also provides an opportunity for foreign hotel and tourism groups to establish themselves in India. The influx of tourists benefits small companies in tourist areas.\nIt creates jobs for tour operators and the hospitality industry.\nIt develops a connection with other nations regarding India\u2019s attraction and contributes to India\u2019s soft power.\nIt aids in the search for funds on a global scale for the protection and repair of the monuments and the area.\nIt enables India to promote its biodiversity and important animals, such as tigers, red pandas, and wild asses.\nIt can also aid in drawing attention to Indian wildlife issues on a worldwide scale and aid in the effort to raise money.\nChallenges of the Tourism Sector\nBecause the tourism industry depends on certain seasons, many regions do not make any revenue for the rest of the year, which slows growth rates.\nExchange rate volatility might result in a weak rupee and lower-than-expected foreign exchange reserves.\nThe lack of acceptance of international credit cards in many locations hurts tourism.\nIndia is an expensive destination for many tourists due to the high taxes on travel and tourism.\nThere aren\u2019t enough skilled professionals, tour operators, or guides who speak English.\nMany places lack the most basic conveniences, such as tourist-friendly restrooms and urinals.\nLandslides and cloudbursts frequently occur in the Himalayas and the North East, claiming the lives of numerous travelers in the past. For example, the 2013 Kedarnath Cloud Burst.\nWildlife tourism puts more strain on already-vulnerable species and increases the risk of forest fires.\nIndiscriminate garbage dumping and landmark degradation by tourists harm the environment and contaminate water sources.\nVisa requirements, inner line permissions, and other paperwork increase traveler delays.\nFewer states have a higher concentration of tourists, although numerous attractions in northern India\u2019s interior need more promotion.\nDespite its excellent rankings, India ranks 34th overall for tourist competitiveness, which indicates that the country has not successfully monetized or marketed the industry.\nGovernment Initiatives\n\nUnder the Swadesh Darshan Scheme, the Ministry of Tourism assists State Governments in developing the infrastructure for 13 theme-based circuits that have been designated.\n\nA recent budget allocation of Rs. 1,200 crores (US$ 171.70 million) was given for the creation of tourist circuits for eight Northeastern states as part of Swadesh Darshan.\n\nThe Swadesh Darshan and PRASHAD schemes are designed to promote expansion in specialized tourism markets such as wildlife, adventure, wellness, and religious travel.\n\nThe Swachh Bharat movement has started a significant cleaning campaign to safeguard and maintain the sacredness of national historic monuments.\n\nAll India Permit Rules 2021: Under the All India Permit Rules 2021, a tourist vehicle operator may apply online for an All India Tourist Authorization/Permit.\n\nDekho Apna Desh: On November 28, 2020, a webinar series entitled \u201c12 Months of Adventure Travel\u201d is projected to market India as an adventure tourism destination.\n\nWay Forward\n\nBuilding new roads, railroads, and tourist attractions in interior regions that do not have them is necessary. It will lead to infrastructure development in these areas.\n\nEncourage private sector involvement in the construction of tourist amenities in interior and less traveled locations.\n\nTo handle concerns and upcoming initiatives related to tourism, the government can establish a National Tourism Authority & Advisory Council.\n\nTourism with a specific theme should be promoted, including medical tourism, Buddhist circuits, organic tourism, and historical circuits.\n\nIt is important to strike a balance between promoting tourism and preserving the natural, social, and cultural environments in the destinations. To address concerns with the water crisis, pollution, waste management, and other related challenges, the government should also promote eco-friendly and sustainable tourism.\n\nMaking use of social media to promote Indian tourist destinations online to both domestic and international visitors.\n\nRationalizing inner line permits and extending visas on arrival and visa regulations to other countries to provide access for foreigners from other nations.\n\nEmphasize underserved areas to tap the vast potential of the region. For example, North Eastern region.\n\nGreater coordination at the state and local levels will help India\u2019s rural tourism industry grow and generate more revenue for the area.\n\nTo genuinely guarantee a seamless tourist transportation experience, all interstate road taxes must be standardized.\n\nIn India, the industry has enormous unrealized potential. The tourism sector\u2019s multiplier impact can help increase income levels and ensure inclusive growth. To ensure India\u2019s transition to a high-income economy, a booming tourism industry may prove to be crucial. It is necessary to redesign the entire industry and strengthen its resistance to future shocks. Growth must be encouraged, however, sustainable growth that adheres to environmental standards is also vital.\n\nRelated Posts\nRiverine-Based Religious Tourism Circuit\nBuddhist Tourism Circuit\nCultural Tourism in India\n\nArticle written by Chetna Yadav."

Unlike trains, which only stop at certain stations, buses and trucks can be stopped anywhere and at any time for passengers and cargo.\nCompared to railroads, highways are easier and faster for the transportation of perishable goods like milk, fruit, and vegetables.\nChallenges\nConstruction of roads is more straightforward and less expensive in plain locations, while it is challenging and more expensive in hilly and plateau areas, depending on the type of terrain and the amount of economic development.\nIn high-altitude, wet, and forested areas, the quality of the roads is substantially worse. Climate plays a very important role.\nThere are regional variations in road density. Compared to cities and towns, rural areas have fewer roads. Road density is higher in places with higher industrial concentrations than in areas with lower industrial concentrations.\nState and national highways, which carry more than 65% of all traffic, are subjected to the problem of excess loads.\nIndia has a low intra-city vehicle speed because of its heavy traffic. The country\u2019s average road speed is between 30 and 40 km/h. The standard road speed across the globe is 60 to 80 km/h.\nThe road density per thousand people is low, which raises traffic and fuel use. It leads to increased air pollution.\nThe logistics bottlenecks also impact the GDP of the country.\n40% of the roads are unsurfaced, making them only usable in good weather and impractical for travel when it rains.\nThere is widespread corruption due to the connections between contractors, bureaucrats, and politicians.\nIndia lacks adequate funding for road maintenance, leaving thousands of villages without access to all-weather roads.\nEconomic gains take time to materialize. It is unclear whether the return from competitively priced tolls will result in profits in the initial years or not.\nAlthough there is a trend of going away from gasoline and diesel in favor of electric cars (EVs), the rate of adoption is modest\nThe motor vehicle population is expanding quickly.\nIt leads to construction hazards and unforeseen delays before the project even starts.\nRoad accidents in India result in fatalities each day. Hence there are concerns about accidents and safety.\nThere is large-scale land acquisition, especially on toll roads with restricted access.

It is predicted to become the third-largest air passenger market by 2024. However, there are still many challenges left. What are those challenges? Why does civil aviation infrastructure hold so much importance? To answer these questions, read further.\n\nIndia\u2019s civil aviation industry has the potential to become one of the largest in the world.\n\nAirways play an important role as a modern means of transportation. They are vital for the country\u2019s economic growth and to be globally competitive.\n\nThe Airways contribute to the trade and commerce of a nation and thus are critical for development.\n\nThe aviation sector is managed by the Airports Authority of India (AAI). AAI was founded in 1994 under the Airports Authority Act. All government airports in India must be developed, financed, operated, and maintained by AAI. The remaining airports are governed by the Aircraft Act (1934).\n\nTable of Contents\n\nSignificance of Aviation Infrastructure\nChallenges of Aviation Infrastructure\nGovernment Initiatives\nWay Forward\nConclusion\nSignificance of Aviation Infrastructure\nIn India, there are large plains that make for good landing sites. It provides an excellent transition from railways\nCompared to other forms of transportation, it is the fastest way to move both people and cargo.\nTransporting expensive, light, and perishable items that cannot be moved by road or rail is made simple by the availability of air transportation.\nPhysical impediments, such as rivers, mountains, and valleys, are absent in air transport, thus allowing for smooth movement around the world.\nIt improves connectivity to smaller cities and the northeastern states. Thus increasing regional connectivity.\nAir travel is widely used during earthquakes, floods, accidents, and starvation while trains and roads are not very useful for rescue operations.\nIt has significant strategic implications. It can be used to advance both internal and external security.\nChallenges of Aviation Infrastructure\nThere is a problem of unavailability of space and land to expand the airports.\nThe government approval processes frequently cause delays in the development of airport infrastructure.\nLack of funds is a challenge the government is currently dealing with. Therefore, the development of the infrastructure is moving in the direction of PPP models.\nWhen airline ticket prices will increase, customers often might turn to trains and other modes of transportation.\nAccording to an audit undertaken by the International Civil Aviation Organization, India\u2019s air safety oversight is weaker than that of Bangladesh, the Maldives, Pakistan, Nepal, Sri Lanka, and North Korea.\nIneffective administration of air navigation, air traffic, airline slots waiting, etc. is some of the other issues.\nThere is a shortage of pilots as well as there are gaps in the skills of pilots, crew members, and ground handling personnel.\nIn India, the cost of fuel accounts for 45% of operating expenses, compared to a global average of 30%.\nDue to heavy central and state taxation, India\u2019s aviation fuel prices are higher than those of ASEAN and the Middle East nations.\nDue to heavy central and state taxation, India\u2019s aviation fuel prices are higher than those of ASEAN and the Middle East nations.\nThe UDAN Scheme is not operating well because many planned routes have not yet become operational, leaving the country\u2019s hinterland partially disconnected from the aviation industry.\nIndia constructs airports only when there is a need, which slows the expansion of the aviation sector.\nDespite India\u2019s status as a \u201cUnilateral Open Sky\u201d nation, cargo mobility is still in its youth.\nGovernment Initiatives\n\nUde Desh ka Aam Nagrik (UDAN) Plan: To develop regional routes that are both inexpensive and profitable, so that even in small communities, the average person can afford to fly.\n\n100% FDI is allowed in non-scheduled air transport services, flying schools, helicopter services, and seaplane services through an automated route.\n\n\ud83d\udc49 Which year are YOU targeting for success in the IAS/IPS/IFS Exam? \ud83d\ude80\n\n(1) \u21d2 UPSC 2025: Prelims cum Mains\n\n(2) \u21d2 UPSC 2026: Prelims cum Mains\n\n(3) \u21d2 UPSC 2027 Prelims cum Mains\n\nTip: Know more about ClearIAS Courses (Online/Offline)\n\nDigiSky: Online site that complies with the civil aviation rules for using drones for commercial purposes.\n\nThe 2016 National Civil Aviation Policy: The policy is covering 22 areas of the aviation sector. Airlines must deploy 20 aircraft or 20% of their total capacity for domestic operations, whichever is higher. This will expand the reach of Indian airline services abroad.\n\ne-Sahaj: The Civil Aviation Ministry\u2019s online platform e-Sahaj offers 100% of security clearances.\n\nDigi Yatra Platform: Biometric digital processing technology to save travelers from multiple airport security procedures.\n\nAlso read: International Climate Action in Civil Aviation\n\nWay Forward\n\nComplete the worldwide UDAN program. It will increase the current capacity of international airports while also completing the ongoing initiatives under the UDAN initiative in a timely manner.\n\nAircraft powered by solar energy and biofuels are the need of the hour.\n\nCities with multiple airports will help to reduce traffic.\n\nDeveloping a manufacturing ecosystem in the nation through long-term initiatives to support advanced research in aviation technologies.\n\nThere is a need for cutting-edge technology for the effective operation of the air traffic control and navigation system.\n\nThe aviation industry has to think about the \u201cStart-up India\u201d project. Young entrepreneurs are the backbone of high-tech firms and are revolutionizing many traditional industries.\n\nTo stay up with modern aircraft technology, industry expansion, and passenger demand, it is important to amend India\u2019s 1934 Aircraft Act and 1937 Aircraft Rules.\n\nVacant land around the Airports Authority of India (AAI) airports in all major cities should be monetized to boost non-aeronautical earnings and management techniques. It will lead to the effective utilization of AAI resources.\n\nTo address the skilled labor shortage, businesses and educational institutions should work together to integrate the latest technology.\n\nAirlines that perform poorly may switch to cargo transport.\n\nMake India a transshipment hub by creating digital business enablers like e-contracting, e-multimodal transportation, e-compliances, and an e-grievance redressal module.\n\nConclusion\n\nThere is a significant untapped market for aviation in India. The government must continue to promote this industry with effective policy measures. This would boost the home economy and India\u2019s aviation sector\u2019s global presence in terms of both passenger and freight traffic.\n\nThe major part of countries GDP is mostly derived from the travel and aviation industries, hence it is essential to assure economic growth and development. For this sector to flourish at a good rate, the Central Government and the State Governments should work together.\n\nAlso read:\u00a0Aviation safety\n\nArticle written by Chetna Yadav."

            "[CONTENT]": "Inflation-indexed bonds are often seen in the news. Do you know what exactly it is? Read to know more about Inflation-indexed bonds.\n\nDid you ever think about saving a part of your income? Probably the first thing which came to our mind will be of savings account or buying a bond. However year by year there is an overall rise in prices which reduces our purchasing power over time. This is due to inflation. Here comes the role of inflation-indexed bonds.\n\nWhen the principal amount of a bond is indexed to inflation, it is called an inflation-indexed bond. Indexed to inflation means the principal amount rises or falls with the rate of inflation. Regardless of the amount of inflation in the economy, the investor is guaranteed a continuous return.\n\nTable of Contents\n\nHow is interest on an Inflation-indexed bond calculated?\nFeatures of inflation-indexed bonds:\nCurrently, IIBs are linked to WPI, not to CPI.

If inflation rises by 10%, in the case of a fixed deposit investor will receive Rs.5 per year as interest while in an inflation-indexed bond, the principal amount will get adjusted to Rs.110. Hence the resulting interest payment will be Rs.110 \u00d7 5% i.e. Rs. 5.5. At the time of redemption, adjusted principal or face, whichever is higher will be paid.\n\nFeatures of inflation-indexed bonds:\nCoupons will be paid on half yearly basis. The fixed coupon rate will be paid on an adjusted principal.\nIIBs are issued for 10 years.\nAs they are G-secs, eligible for SLR status.\nThe main objective is to protect middle the poor and middle classes\u2019 savings against inflation.\nThe minimum amount of investment is Rs. 5000 and the maximum limit is Rs. 10 lakh per annum for individual investors and Rs. 25 lakh per annum for institutions.\n\nInflation-indexed bond was first issued by Massachusetts Bay Company during the American Revolution to combat inflation\u2019s effects on the price of consumer goods in the colonies during the war.\n\nIn India, IIBs were announced in the 2013 budget mainly to provide an alternative for the household to invest in rather than gold as the increasing current account deficit (CAD) driven by higher gold imports is of serious concern. Until 2013, capital-indexed bonds were issued which will protect only the principal, unlike IIBs which can provide inflation protection for interest payments as well.\n\nCurrently, IIBs are linked to WPI, not to CPI. Why?\n\nBecause in India CPI is being released since January 2011 and will take some time to stabilize. Also, monetary policy is being continued to target WPI for its price stability objective.\n\n\ud83d\udc49 Which year are YOU targeting for success in the IAS/IPS/IFS Exam? \ud83d\ude80\n\n(1) \u21d2 UPSC 2025: Prelims cum Mains\n\n(2) \u21d2 UPSC 2026: Prelims cum Mains\n\n(3) \u21d2 UPSC 2027 Prelims cum Mains\n\nTip: Know more about ClearIAS Courses (Online/Offline)\n\nGlobally CPI is used for inflation targets by central banks as CPI reflects the inflation faced by the majority.\n\nTax treatments:\nTax provisions are applicable on interest payments and capital gains made when sold in the secondary market (through the BSE, NSE, and other stock exchanges).\nThere will be no special tax treatment for these bonds.\n\nUnited States, India, Canada, and many other countries now issue Inflation-indexed bonds.

            "[CONTENT]": "What are the Planning and Economic Reforms? Why is it so important that it is considered by almost all leaders? What are the Gandhian and Nehruvian approaches to planning? To answer these questions, read further.\n\nOne of the most notable inventions of the 20th century was socioeconomic planning. The nation understood the value of planned growth even before it attained independence.\n\nNearly all of the national leaders saw political freedom as the major solution to these core issues.\n\nThe Constitution became effective on January 26, 1950. The planning era in India began on April 1, 1951, with the introduction of the First Five-Year Plan, and planning officially began on March 15, 1950, with the creation of the Planning Commission.\n\nTable of Contents\n\nHistory of Planning\nGandhian approach\nThe Nehruvian model\nFeatures of the Nehruvian model\nHistory of Planning\nThe idea of a planned economy first and foremost came into existence in the 1930s, when our country\u2019s leaders were influenced by socialist philosophy.\nIndia\u2019s five-year plans were significantly impacted by the USSR\u2019s enormous development accomplished through five-year plans.\nSir M. Visvesvaraya in his 1934 book \u201cPlanned Economy in India,\u201d proposed a promising plan for India\u2019s advancement over the succeeding ten years.\nHis main objective was to come up with a plan for moving labor from agriculture to industry and tripling the country\u2019s GDP in ten years. This was the first significant academic study on the topic of planning.\nThe economic perspective of India\u2019s freedom movement changed between the Indian National Congress sessions in Karachi in 1931 and Faizpur in 1936.\nThe first attempt to create a national plan for India was launched in 1938. That year, Jawaharlal Nehru served as the chairman of the National Planning Committee, founded by Subhash Chandra Bose, the president of Congress.\nHowever, the committee\u2019s recommendations could not be written, and only a small number of papers were first published in 1948\u20131949.\nEight businessmen from Bombay worked on \u201cA Brief Memorandum Outlining a Plan of Economic Development for India\u201d in 1944. They included Mr. JRD Tata, GD Birla, Purshottamdas Thakurdas, Lala Shriram, Kasturbhai Lalbhai, AD Shroff, Ardeshir Dalal, and John Mathai.\nEven though Nehru did not formally embrace the plan, many of its elements were integrated into later designs. This is known as the \u201cBombay Plan.\u201d\nLater the People\u2019s Plan was prepared by MN Roy. This ten-year strategy placed the highest priority on agriculture. It involves the nationalization of all production. The main component of this plan was agriculture.\nThis proposal was developed by M N Roy on behalf of the Indian Federation of Lahore and is based on Marxist socialism.\nThen the Gandhian Plan was developed by Wardha Commercial College\u2019s principal, Sriman Nayaran. It gave economic decentralization priority while concentrating on rural development by fostering cottage industries.\nThe Sarvodaya Plan was created in 1950 by Jaiprakash Narayan. The Sarvodaya Idea and Gandhian Plan of Vinoba Bhave both had an impact on this strategy. This plan focused on small and cottage businesses as well as agriculture.\nIt also strongly emphasized freedom from foreign technologies, decentralized participatory planning, and land reforms.\nTo evaluate plans and potential projects and offer suggestions, the Interim Government set up a planning advisory board in October 1946.\nGandhian approach\n\nGandhi was not an economist in a conventional sense. Nor he has given any systematic views on the model of development to be adopted by India.\n\nWe get the blueprint of Gandhian idea of development in his book Hind Swaraj.\n\n\ud83d\udc49 Which year are YOU targeting for success in the IAS/IPS/IFS Exam? \ud83d\ude80\n\n(1) \u21d2 UPSC 2025: Prelims cum Mains\n\n(2) \u21d2 UPSC 2026: Prelims cum Mains\n\n(3) \u21d2 UPSC 2027 Prelims cum Mains\n\nTip: Know more about ClearIAS Courses (Online/Offline)\n\nHe was a critic of the Western model of development and believed that if the other adopts the same model, nine more earth are needed.\n\nThe fundamental idea governing the Gandhian approach to development was the principle of Nonviolence and Swaraj. Non-violence even towards nature and minimization of needs.\n\nThe three pillars of the Gandhian approach were economic growth, redistributive justice, and morale regeneration.\n\nGandhian approach to the way of life can be understood based on his concept of the seven sins.\n\nThe seven sins of Gandhi are wealth without work, Pleasure without conscience, knowledge without character, commerce without morality, science without humanity, worship without sacrifice, and politics without ethics.\n\nAt the time of independence, he proposed a Development plan.\n\nIt included the Reform of agriculture and believed that it will address hunger and unemployment. This suggested that the government should focus on land reforms, cooperatives, and rural credit.\n\nThey also suggested the revival of the cottage industries as it will not only provide a supplementary income but the Khadi was the way to address the requirement for clothing also.\n\nThus, the focus of the Gandhian plan was to fulfill the basic necessity as a priority.\n\nThere is a misunderstanding that Gandhi was against machines and industrialization. Gandhi was not against machines, he was only against imitating the Western model in the Indian situation.\n\nHis concerns were that machines should not be pitted against human beings, and mechanization results in the accumulation of wealth and increasing exploitation.\n\nThus the Gandhian approach was to make Indian villages self-sufficient entities. He was in favor of the revival of the village Republic as he believed that India lives in its villages. Without the resurrection of villages, the goal of Swaraj remains incomplete.\n\nThe Gandhian approach was not adopted. And we can see the consequences of the neglect of the Gandhian approach.\n\nThe Nehruvian model\n\nNehru was not an economist. He was a modernist. He was impressed by the achievements of the USSR.\n\nNehru wanted to make India a modern and scientific society. He described his philosophy as progressive socialism. Nehru always wanted India to be a society based on a socialistic pattern.\n\nHis realistic approach to the development strategy can be understood from the second five-year plan which was based on the Nehru Mahalanobis model.\n\nFeatures of the Nehruvian model\n\nNehru favored investment in heavy industries as it will promote capital formation. The investment in heavy industries will help in making India independent of the imports of essential goods.\n\nNehru introduced centralized planning, even though centralized planning goes against the spirit of federalism.\n\nThe Nehruvian model neglected the consumer industry. As he believed that Indian need to make sacrifices in the short term for a better life in the longer term.\n\nNehru was not against the agrarian reforms but he believe that industrialization will create more demand for agricultural goods and automation will provide fertilizer, equipment for the promotion of agriculture, etc\n\nNehru knew that his model would create shortages of basic commodities and hence he introduced physical control on rationing and fiscal control on administered pricing.\n\nTo avoid income disparities, the Nehruvian model put State in the commanding heights of the economy and kept the Private sector weak to check the accumulation of wealth.\n\nThe public sector will not only address the concentration of wealth but also provide employment.\n\nNehruvian policies could not address the structural weaknesses of the Indian economy. Rationing has resulted in black marketing. The public sector was not working on economic logic, it was producing poor-quality goods at a higher price.\n\nThe Nehruvian model was import substitution and export promotion. However, India could not produce manufactured goods that can be exported.\n\nThe Nehruvian model resulted in India becoming the license permit quota Raj, which ultimately made India an Inspector Raj or overdeveloped state.\n\nEconomics is always dynamic. And so the Economic Policies. The policies need to be changed as per the changing scenario. During Nehru times our economy was an infant. However, today is the era of the survival of the fittest. We always need to change as per the requirements.\n\nArticle written by Chetna Yadav."

What are the objectives and key features of this scheme? Read here to know more.\n\nThe Mahatma Gandhi National Rural Employment Guarantee Act was passed on 23rd August 2005 and it was officially launched on 2nd February 2006.\n\nDo you know what was MGNREGA earlier called? It was known to be National Rural Employment Guarantee Act. Learn more about this topic.\n\nTable of Contents\n\nWhat is MGNREGA?\nThe objectives of the Act are:\nKey features of MGNREGA:\nSignificance of MGNREGA:\nChallenges of MGNREGA:\nWay forward\nWhat is MGNREGA?\nMGNREGA is a rural wage employment program in India.\nIt provides for a legal guarantee of at least 100 days of unskilled wage employment in a financial year to rural households whose adult members are willing to engage in unskilled manual work at a predetermined minimum wage rate.\nThe Ministry of Rural Development (MRD), Govt of India is monitoring the entire implementation of this scheme in association with state governments.\nThe objectives of the Act are:\nTo enhance the livelihood security of the rural poor by generating wage employment opportunities; and\nTo create a rural asset base which would enhance productive ways of employment, and augment and sustain a rural household income.\nAdults in rural households provide the Gram Panchayat with their name, age, address, and photo. Following inquiries, the Gram Panchayat registers homes and gives an employment card. The information about an enrolled adult member, including his or her picture, is on the job card. The registered person may write to the Panchayat or the Programme Officer to request employment (for at least fourteen days of continuous work).\nThe Panchayat/Program officer will accept a legitimate application and issue a dated receipt of it. A letter outlining the applicant\u2019s duties will be delivered to them as well as displayed in the Panchayat office. Within a 5 km radius of the job site, employment will be offered; if farther than that, extra pay will be given.\nOn February 2, 2006, MGNREGA was first put into effect as the National Rural Employment Guarantee Act (NREGA) in 200 chosen backward districts of India. As of April 1, 2007, it was extended to an additional 130 districts. Later, beginning on April 1, 2008, coverage began for the remaining 285 districts. NREGA was renamed MGNREGA by the National Rural Employment Guarantee (Amendment) Act of 2009.\nThe work is usually on projects to build durable assets like roads, canals, ponds and wells.\nKey features of MGNREGA:\nLegal right to work: The Act gives adult members of rural households a legal right to employment, in contrast to past job guarantee programmes. The beneficiaries must include at least one-third of women.\nWages: Unless the central government notifies of a pay rate, wages shall be paid by the wages stipulated for agricultural labourers in the state under the Minimum Wages Act of 1948. (this should not be less than Rs 60 per day). Currently, the federal government sets pay rates, which vary by state.\nWage-material ratio: The Act stipulates a minimum wage-material ratio of 60:40. The average wage per day per person in 2016-17 was Rs 161.\nDecentralised planning: Gram Sabhas must recommend the projects to be carried out and must carry out at least 50% of them. Pris is largely in charge of organising, carrying out, and overseeing the projects that are done.\nTransparency and accountability: Wall writings, citizen information boards, management information systems, and social audits are all options for proactive disclosure. Gram Sabhas carry out social audits so that the locals may keep track of how the programme is being implemented.\nFunding: The federal government and the states split the cost of funding. Wages (for unskilled, semiskilled, and skilled labour), material costs, and administrative costs make up the three main categories of expenditures. 100% of the cost of unskilled labour, 75% of the cost of semi-skilled and skilled labour, 75% of the cost of supplies, and 6% of the cost of administrative expenses are covered by the central government.\nTime-bound guarantee of work and unemployment allowance: Employment must be provided within 15 days of being demanded failing which an \u2018unemployment allowance\u2019 must be given.\nWorksite facilities: All work sites should have facilities such as cr\u00e8ches, drinking water and first aid.\n\nAlso read: Postal History of India\n\nSignificance of MGNREGA:\n\nSocial\n\nMGNREGA is the largest social security scheme in the world.\n\nEmpowerment of vulnerable sections: Large-scale engagement of women, people from traditionally marginalised groups like Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes (SCs/STs), and others. Women generate 47% of the total person-days, while SCs/STs contribute 51% of the total person-days.\nPoverty alleviation: The less poor have used it as a means to augment their income by working during slow agricultural seasons, while the poor have used it as a means of escaping poverty.\nDistress migration: MGNREGA has a highly positive impact on poor households with a drastic reduction in the distress migration\nSome studies even point to improved education for children in MGNREGA households.\n\nEconomical\n\n\ud83d\udc49 Which year are YOU targeting for success in the IAS/IPS/IFS Exam? \ud83d\ude80\n\n(1) \u21d2 UPSC 2025: Prelims cum Mains\n\n(2) \u21d2 UPSC 2026: Prelims cum Mains\n\n(3) \u21d2 UPSC 2027 Prelims cum Mains\n\nTip: Know more about ClearIAS Courses (Online/Offline)\n\nEmployment generation: Since this program\u2019s introduction in 2006, it has altered the rural labour market\u2019s makeup. Rural households were given the chance to make a minimal income by receiving employment cards under this programme.\nIncreasing wage rate: Increasing the wage rate in rural areas and thereby increasing the purchasing power in rural India\nThrust to the rural economy: Strengthening the rural economy through the creation of infrastructure assets.\nFinancial inclusion: Payments under the scheme today are mostly by way of direct transfer into beneficiary accounts \u2014 which in turn forced people to open 10 crore new bank or post office accounts. The scheme has indirectly enabled households to get freed from the clutches of local money lenders too.\n\nPolitical\n\nDecentralisation: Strengthening PRIs by involving them in the planning and monitoring of the scheme.\nChallenges of MGNREGA:\n\nEconomical\n\nRidiculously low wage rate: MGNREGA wage rates are now lower than the matching state/UT minimum wages in 34 of 35 states and union territories. The MGNREGA wage rate cannot be less than the state\u2019s minimum agricultural wage rate, according to several rulings. Because workers aren\u2019t interested in working for MGNREGA programmes due to the absurdly low pay rates, contractors and intermediaries are now in control locally.\nInadequate budgetary allocation: Researchers determined that the scheme should have received an allocation of Rs 76,131 crore, which was less than the actual amount, to satisfy the registered work requirement in 2017\u201318. Similar to practically every year, the first six months see more than 80% of the funds depleted.\nInflation: As agricultural labourers\u2019 pay has multiplied, forcing farmers to seek higher prices for their food grains through Minimum Support Prices, the MGNREGA initiative to reduce poverty has come at the expense of skyrocketing food prices (MSPs).\nAffected labour market: Rural agricultural labourer wages are pushing farmers to mechanise their operations, which is proving to be more cost-effective.\nImpact on urban sectors: MGNREGA also has implications for the increase of urban wages in sectors like infrastructure and real estate, which depend on migrant workers from rural areas. This increases the costs of real estate and infrastructure projects.\nThe banking puzzle: The rural banks are highly de-capacitated in terms of staff and infrastructure and thus always remain hugely crowded.\n\nAdministrative challenges\n\nFabrication of job cards: The availability of fraudulent job cards, the use of fictitious identities, missing data, and delays in entering information into employment cards are only a few of the problems.\nDemand-supply mismatch in work allocation: Researchers have discovered a growing disparity between the supply and demand for labour. According to a 2017\u201318 research of 3,500 panchayats, the employment that was offered was 32% less than the need for labour that was created.\nDelay in payment of wages: The majority of states have not fulfilled the MGNREGA requirement to pay wages within 15 days. Additionally, workers are not reimbursed for late wage payments. Wage payments are frequently delayed for weeks or even months without providing any sort of compensation.\nNon-payment of unemployment allowances: When the job is not readily available, the majority of states do not provide unemployment benefits. The failure to provide dated receipts for the requested work hinders employees from requesting unemployment benefits.\nIneffectiveness of local bodies: Since Panchayat Samitis hasn\u2019t been met in months, work approval has been put off. In 2015\u201316, only 10% of the 4.8 crore households were able to fully benefit from 100 days of labour.\nWorkers penalised for administrative lapses: The ministry withholds wages from employees of states that fail to comply with administrative obligations within the allotted time frame (such as submitting the audited fund statements from the previous financial year, utilisation certificates, bank reconciliation certificates, etc.).\n\nPolitical\n\nAsymmetry: The ability of the states to predict labour demand and then submit a plan articulating the same is what determines the flow of resources to certain states. The programme may be regressive because of the reduced resource flow in the poorer states due to their inability to plan. Thus, there is a chance that programmes like MGNREGA, which depend on the ability of the states to implement them, will lead to a budgetary imbalance.\nCorruption: Muster rolls are inflated and middlemen pocket the difference. As a result, a large amount of money is siphoned-off by them.\n\nSocial\n\nBehavioural implications: People who are employed under MGNREGA are developing the habit of getting paid for doing nothing, which could have major repercussions for India\u2019s human prowess and outlook. This is because most of the labour done under MGNREGA is not well planned and is frequently perfunctory.\nImpact on skilled occupations: Many specialised professions, such as handloom weavers and rural craftsmen, are losing their workforce to MGNREGA, which causes a loss of expertise in that particular field. Thus, even though employment guarantee programmes like MGNREGA offer higher incomes and have little to no effect on skill development, they are losing the distinctive abilities that have been accumulated through generations.\nWay forward\nWage: Each state\u2019s minimum wage should be adhered to, and the CPI-Rural index should be used to index pay rather than the previous Consumer Price Index for Agricultural Laborers (CPI-AL). Similarly, wages must be updated yearly.\nTraining of functionaries: Training and capacity building of elected representatives and other functionaries of PRIs must be done regularly as it will facilitate their involvement in the implementation of MGNREGA.\nContext-specific projects: States have different needs for development because they are at different stages of socioeconomic development. Therefore, it should be permitted for state governments to carry out projects that are appropriate for their location. Under MGNREGA, a greater emphasis should be placed on skilled and semi-skilled jobs.\nSocial audits: Social audits must mandatorily be held every six months. The performance of MGNREGA is better in states with effective social audit mechanisms.\nRegular monitoring: The Ministry of Rural Development sends out National Level Monitors (NLMs) to conduct routine and targeted MGNREGA monitoring and to investigate accusations of improper use of money, among other things. By their recommendations, states should implement appropriate procedures and enhance the frequency of NLM monitoring.\nRegulation of job cards: It should be made illegal to possess job cards with elected PRI representatives and MGNREGA officials, as well as to not register employment-related information in job cards.\nConvergence: A greater emphasis on convergence with other schemes such as the PMKSY, National Rural Livelihoods Mission, National Rural Health Mission, etc.\n\nArticle Written by: Remya"

            "[CONTENT]": "What is a Golden fibre? Is India rich in it? Why is it so significant for India to develop this sector? Read more details about the Golden fibre revolution in India.\n\nJute is also referred to as Golden fibre due to its colour and high monetary value. Therefore Golden fibre revolution is related to Jute production in India. The skin of the plant\u2019s stem yields this fibre, which is the least expensive.\n\nJute is the vegetable fibre that is consumed, produced, used, and widely accessible after cotton. Jute was initially employed as a raw material in the fabric industry during the industrial revolution. It is still employed today to create durable threads and other jute-based goods.\n\nTable of Contents\n\nWhy are Jute industries important for India?\nOther benefits\nWhat leads to Golden Fibre Revolution?\nConclusion\nWhy are Jute industries important for India?\n\nIndia and Bangladesh are the two countries that produce the most jute worldwide. The only limit to this carbon-neutral crop\u2019s potential is your imagination, but its potential is still unrealized.\n\nThis miracle crop is not just much more profitable than the majority of cash and food crops, but it also scores big points for sustainability.\n\nJute is the second most common natural fibre after cotton in the world, but cotton requires five times as much water, five times as many areas, and a staggering amount of chemicals to grow.\n\nJute can be used for countless industrial and domestic applications due to its high tensile strength, \u00a0breathability, low extensibility, ease of blending with both synthetic and natural fibres, acoustic and thermal insulation,\u00a0and antistatic properties. Examples include insulation (replacing glass wool), geotextiles, carpet backings,\u00a0activated carbon powder, gunny bags,\u00a0wall coverings, flooring, garments, rugs, ropes, \u00a0handicrafts, curtains, \u00a0paper, furniture and\u00a0sandals.\n\n\ud83d\udc49 Which year are YOU targeting for success in the IAS/IPS/IFS Exam? \ud83d\ude80\n\n(1) \u21d2 UPSC 2025: Prelims cum Mains\n\n(2) \u21d2 UPSC 2026: Prelims cum Mains\n\n(3) \u21d2 UPSC 2027 Prelims cum Mains\n\nTip: Know more about ClearIAS Courses (Online/Offline)\n\nKnow more about Jute industries in India.\n\nOther benefits\n\nJute improves the fertility and condition of the soil, which is advantageous to all plants growing there. Carbon credits are awarded to jute farmers who manage their crops, and they can use these credits to reduce their costs. The quantity of the carbon credit for jute farming is determined by farmers\u2019 savings on purchases of inorganic fertiliser. Since jute is a renewable resource, it is a vital resource for the paper sector.\n\nWhat leads to Golden Fibre Revolution?\n\nJute is the most widely produced sustainable and adaptable fibre in India, yet we uses relatively little creativity to market it. India was the only country that contributed significantly to the production of jute before we gained our independence.\n\nFollowing independence, the sector experienced hardship for a number of reasons, including after India was divided, a number of jute-producing districts in India were integrated into Bangladesh. As a result, India was running low on raw supplies. Because all of the machinery used to process jute had become outdated, new machines were urgently needed.\n\nDue to a lack of diversification and an excessive reliance on jute bags, the jute sector in India has become stagnant, ineffective, and unproductive. The industries compete fiercely on the international market against nations like Bangladesh, South Korea, the Philippines, Japan, etc. As a result of illnesses in the jute mills, outdated technology, higher pricing, etc., the industry also loses competitiveness.\n\nDue to India\u2019s excessive jute dependence and failure to adapt the way jute is farmed, the country\u2019s jute industry has experienced a fall in output and popularity. The Golden Fibre Revolution got started as a result of all these elements acting simultaneously.\n\nConclusion\n\nAlthough numerous committees have long advocated for a \u201cGolden Fibre Revolution,\u201d the sector urgently needs fundamental changes. The sector is plagued by two main issues: out-of-date processing technology and a lack of product diversity beyond handcraft and packaging.\n\nJute should be pushed out of the emporium and into every home through a larger range of products, reclaiming the position that polluting synthetic fibres have robbed it of. Jute may in fact be India\u2019s future fabric and the answer to two significant issues: farmer hardship and pollution.\n\nArticle written by: Krishnapriya JR"

            "[CONTENT]": "The Reserve Bank of India (RBI) has released the first set of regulations for digital lending in an effort to rein in players that engage in illicit activity.\n\nDigital Lending is an automated and remote lending procedure that heavily relies on seamless digital technology for customer acquisition, credit scoring, loan approval, disbursement, recovery, and related customer support.\n\nA working group on digital lending named \u201cDigital Lending, including Lending through Online Platforms and Mobile Apps\u201d (WGDL) in January 2021 presented some recommendations.\n\nThe working group made its report public in November 2021. Following such recommendations, RBI has made public the digital lending norms/guidelines.\n\nTable of Contents\n\nAim of Digital Lending Norms\nClassification of Digital Lenders\nScope of Application of Digital Lending Norms\nConcerns related to Digital Lending\nWhy Such Norms are Needed\nRBI Guidelines on Digital Lending\nDefinitions of Important Terms Used in the Guidelines\nConclusion\nAim of Digital Lending Norms\n\nIn order to curb the rising malpractice in the digital lending ecosystem, the Reserve Bank of India has issued a guideline for entities engaged in digital lending.\n\nAs per the norms, all the loans must be disbursed and repaid through bank accounts of regulated bank entities only. That must be without passing through Lending Service Providers (LSPs) or other third parties.\n\nClassification of Digital Lenders\n\nAs per the regulators, the \u2018Digital Lenders\u2019 are classified into three groups:\n\n\ud83d\udc49 Which year are YOU targeting for success in the IAS/IPS/IFS Exam? \ud83d\ude80\n\n(1) \u21d2 UPSC 2025: Prelims cum Mains\n\n(2) \u21d2 UPSC 2026: Prelims cum Mains\n\n(3) \u21d2 UPSC 2027 Prelims cum Mains\n\nTip: Know more about ClearIAS Courses (Online/Offline)\n\nEntities regulated by the RBI and permitted to carry out lending business; for example, Banks and NBFCs.\nEntities that are authorized to carry out a lending as per other statutory or regulatory provisions but are not regulated by RBI. For example, Rural cooperatives like \u2018Primary Agriculture Credit Societies (PACS), are regulated by State Governments.\nEntities lending outside the purview of any statutory or regulatory provisions. For example, informal lenders.\nScope of Application of Digital Lending Norms\n\nThese guidelines are applicable to digital lending extended by:\n\nAll Commercial Banks,\nPrimary (Urban) Co-operative Banks, State Co-operative Banks, District Central Co-operative Banks; and\nNon-Banking Financial Companies (including Housing Finance Companies)\nConcerns related to Digital Lending\n\nRBI released Guidelines related to digital lending. The primary matter of concern that needed to be curbed or solved is related to the engagement of third parties, breach of data privacy, mis-selling of info, unfair means of business conduct, exorbitant interest rates charged on the loans and over all of it, unethical recovery practices followed.\n\nWhy Such Norms are Needed\n\nAnalyzing a participant\u2019s operational legitimacy was challenging in the absence of standardized disclosure and regulatory standards. There were over 1,100 lending apps available for Indian Android users between January and the end of February of last year, of which approximately 600 were illegal.\n\nNBFCs have a significant impact on the market. Small borrowers without a history of credit documentation, who are typically underserved by traditional financial institutions, are among its consumers in particular.\n\nTransparency is the main tenet. Lending must be done by organizations that are either under RBI regulation or have been granted a license to operate by relevant law. This would also aid in addressing regulatory arbitrage given the industry\u2019s extensive outsourcing.\n\nRBI Guidelines on Digital Lending\n\nAll loan payments and disbursements must be made directly between the borrower\u2019s and the RE\u2019s bank accounts (banks, NBFCs) and not through a pass-through or pool account of the LSPs (lending service providers) or any other entity.\n\nThe RE, not the borrower, shall pay all fees, charges, etc., payable to LSPs in the credit intermediation process.\n\nThe borrower must get a standardized Key Fact Statement (KFS) before executing the loan contract.\n\nBorrowers must be informed of the total cost of digital loans in the form of the annual percentage rate (APR). APR shall also form part of KFS.\n\nIt is forbidden to automatically increase the credit limit without the borrower\u2019s explicit consent.\n\nThe loan contract must include a cooling-off or look-up period during which borrowers can cancel their digital loans by paying the principal plus the appropriate APR without incurring any penalties.\n\nTo handle complaints relating to FinTech and digital lending, REs must make sure that they and the LSPs,\u00a0both\u00a0have\u00a0access to an appropriate nodal grievance redressal officer.\n\nData acquired by DLAs should only be done with the explicit prior consent of the borrower, be need-based, and have clear audit trails.\n\nAny lending sourced through Digital Lending Apps (DLAs) is required to be reported to Credit Information Companies (CICs) by REs irrespective of its nature or tenor.\n\nAll new digital lending products that REs extend over merchant platforms (for instance, when you purchase something via an EMI facility) and that involve short-term credit or deferred payments must be reported by REs to CICs. [ Credit Bureaus are another name for Credit Information Companies].\n\nDefinitions of Important Terms Used in the Guidelines\n\nAnnual Percentage Rate (APR): APR refers to the effective annualized rate that is charged to a borrower of a digital loan.\u00a0\u00a0APR shall be based on an all-inclusive cost and margin, including Cost of Funds, Credit Cost, Operating Cost, Processing Fee, Verification Charges, Maintenance Charges, etc., and excluding Contingent Charges such as Penal Charges, Late Payment Charges, etc.,\n\nCooling off/look-up period: If a borrower decides not to continue with the loan, they will be given a window of time, as set by the Board of the RE, during which they can quit their digital debts.\n\nDigital Lending Apps/Platforms (DLAs): User-friendly mobile and online applications that support digital lending services. Applications run by Regulated Entities (REs) as well as Lending Service Providers (LSPs) hired by REs for providing any credit facilitation services in accordance with current outsourcing standards outlined by the Reserve Bank will be included in DLAs.\n\nLending Service Provider (LSP): An agent of a Regulated Entity who, in accordance with the Reserve Bank\u2019s current outsourcing guidelines, performs one or more of the lender\u2019s functions\u2014or portions thereof\u2014in customer acquisition, underwriting support, pricing support, servicing, monitoring, and recovery of a particular loan or loan portfolio\u2014on behalf of REs.\n\nConclusion\n\nAlthough the percentage of digital lending is now small, given their scalability, they have the potential to quickly become significant players. The wider financial system may be affected by these implications. Senior Director and Deputy Chief Ratings Officer at CRISIL, Krishnan Sitaraman, said, \u201cWe will have to see what kind of changes the digital lenders make to their operating models in light of the new regulations, how it impacts the fees they charge, the speed of their disbursements, or how they continue to provide a seamless experience to their customers,\u201d\n\nWith the economy recovering at a respectable pace after the pandemic and our expectations of a GDP growth of 7.3% this fiscal, we expect demand for loans across the credit ecosystem to be higher this fiscal even though higher inflation and interest rates. Digital lenders should proactively create and adhere to a code of conduct that specifies the values of honesty, openness, and consumer protection and includes specific guidelines for disclosure and complaint resolution. So, it is important to be under regulation in order to avoid a distorted financial system in the future.\n\nArticle Written By: Priti Raj"

Read the article to know more about it.\n\nThe energy needs of India are on rising due to the electrification of more houses and new industries coming into being.\n\nDo you think we have a sufficient amount of coal to meet this rising demand as people are moving to a new developmental phase?\n\nHow developing the coal sector help the country overcome the present power crisis?\n\nAlso read: Mining Sector in India\n\nTable of Contents\n\nIntroduction\nHow can the coal crisis lead to power cuts?\nCoal imports\nWho is responsible for the exploration and development of coal reserves in India?\nReasons for coal shortage in recent times\nConclusion\nIntroduction\n\n\ud83d\udc49 Which year are YOU targeting for success in the IAS/IPS/IFS Exam? \ud83d\ude80\n\n(1) \u21d2 UPSC 2025: Prelims cum Mains\n\n(2) \u21d2 UPSC 2026: Prelims cum Mains\n\n(3) \u21d2 UPSC 2027 Prelims cum Mains\n\nTip: Know more about ClearIAS Courses (Online/Offline)\n\nNote: Subscribe to the ClearIAS YouTube Channel to learn more.\n\nIndia has the fourth largest coal reserves in the world. It is estimated to be around 319.02 billion tonnes of which not even 1 billion tonnes is extracted in a year. The majority of extracted coal is used for electricity production. The remaining coal is used for cement, steel and other industries.\n\nThe top five states in terms of total coal reserves in India are:\n\nJharkhand\nOdisha\nChhattisgarh\nWest Bengal\nMadhya Pradesh\nHow can the coal crisis lead to power cuts?\n\nDifferent sources of power production are renewable and non-renewable sources. Non-renewable accounts for coal and non-coal sources (diesel, natural gas). Coal (Thermal base power production) is the major component of entire electricity production.\n\nOther sources such as renewables i.e. wind, solar, etc, are not reliable sources of power. They have their limitations and cannot provide power for 24 hours.\n\nSimilarly, non-coal sources of non-renewable sources also have their limitations. Its capacity is not beyond a particular point. In the total amount of electricity, the production of coal constitutes around 70%. This is the reason why the coal crisis led to power cuts.\n\nCoal imports\n\nIndia is the second-largest importer of coal after China. As per the present Import policy, coal can be freely imported (under Open General Licence) by the consumers themselves considering their needs based on their commercial prudence.\nSteel Authority of India Limited (SAIL) and other steel-making facilities import coking coal primarily to fill the gap between demand and supply domestically and to raise the quality.\n\nNon-coking coal is imported by coal-based power stations, cement factories, captive power plants, sponge iron plants, industrial customers, and coal traders.\n\nRelated link: Coal mining in India\n\nWho is responsible for the exploration and development of coal reserves in India?\n\nThe Ministry of Coal is ultimately responsible for formulating policies and strategies regarding the exploration and development of coal and lignite reserves, for approving significant projects with high economic value, and for making decisions regarding all pertinent matters.\n\nThese important roles are carried out by the Public Sector Undertakings Coal India Ltd. and its subsidiaries and Neyveli Lignite Corporation India Limited under the administrative supervision of the Ministry (NLCIL).\n\nThe Ministry of Coal also has a joint venture with the Government of Telangana called Singareni Collieries Company Limited in addition to Coal India Ltd. and Neyveli Lignite Corporation India Ltd. Governments of Telangana and India both own 49% and 51% of the company, respectively.\n\nReasons for coal shortage in recent times\nThere was a surge in electricity demand due to the revival of the economy after the second wave of Covid19 got declined, along with a limited production of coal.\nAvailable coal cannot reach on time due to container shortages because of high imports and exports.\nHowever, starting in 2021, rising industrial demand, global price swings, and most recently, Russia\u2019s invasion of Ukraine, caused coal prices to soar to all-time highs. All of this has had a significant impact on India\u2019s coal imports.\nThe almost depleted thermal power plants are now under additional strain as a result of the increasing heat waves. The country\u2019s electricity demand reportedly reached a record high of 201 gigawatts (GW) on April 26, 2022, as several areas of the nation suffered from extreme heat.\nThe nation\u2019s industries, which have resumed operations following the second wave of the COVID-19 epidemic, can be blamed for the unexpected increase in demand. Additionally, despite having the fourth-largest reserves in the world, domestic coal producers cannot keep up with demand.\nConclusion\n\nTo liberalise the coal industry the government created (in June 2019) a High-Level Committee under the direction of the Vice-Chairman of NITI Aayog. This HLC issued several significant suggestions (October 2019) for coal block allocations, with the most significant being a paradigm change in which coal was to be viewed as an input to economic growth through the relevant sectors utilising coal rather than as a source of money.\n\nThe Indian government wants to accelerate economic growth in the nation\u2019s aspirational regions. Because these States have abundant natural resources, making use of those resources in the coal sector is essential to their growth. The Government of India\u2019s transparent actions and commercial auction of coal mines have come at the perfect time to close the gap between the country\u2019s supply and demand for coal.\n\nArticle written by: Krishnapriya JR"

All of this prompted India to borrow money in the short term more and more by the late 1980s.\nUp until the early 1980s, the government had wisely managed the fiscal (revenue and expenditure) situation, but it started to engage in fiscal profligacy (recklessly wasting money) by taking on large amounts of debt to support various development programs and maintain growth, which caused issues in the late 1980s and early 1990s.\nAs a result, the macroeconomic foundations of the economy turned bad\u00a0(fiscal deficit of 8.4%, current account deficit of 3.14%, high inflation of 17%, huge foreign debt, etc. in 1990\u20131991); this puts a lot of pressure on the Balance of Payment (BoP) front.\n\nThe worrying foreign exchange position was partly caused by the Iraqi invasion of Kuwait in August 1990, which increased oil prices (and the cost of imports) and decreased Indian exports to the Middle East or Gulf region. India\u2019s sovereign rating (international credit rating) was severely lowered, making it very challenging to obtain credit (loan) abroad.\n\nThe three primary areas in which economic changes were implemented during the Economic Reforms of 1991\u00a0were as follows:\n\n\ud83d\udc49 Which year are YOU targeting for success in the IAS/IPS/IFS Exam? \ud83d\ude80\n\n(1) \u21d2 UPSC 2025: Prelims cum Mains\n\n(2) \u21d2 UPSC 2026: Prelims cum Mains\n\n(3) \u21d2 UPSC 2027 Prelims cum Mains\n\nTip: Know more about ClearIAS Courses (Online/Offline)\n\nWe removed the complex system of rules, permissions, and licenses.\nIn nearly every area of economic activity, we turned around the significant bias in favor of state ownership of the means of production and the expansion of public sector businesses.\nWe stopped pursuing an inward-looking trade strategy.\n\nThe main goal of the reforms was to quickly and thoroughly integrate the Indian economy with the global economy through trade, investment, and technology flows. To this end, it was necessary to create conditions that would provide Indian entrepreneurs with a business environment that was roughly comparable to that of other developing nations.\n\nAlso read: History of Banking in India\n\nMajor Reforms Carried Out in 1991\n\nEconomic Reforms in India in 1991 carried out several changes. A few important reforms are-\n\nFiscal Stabilisation\n\nThe effectiveness of economic reforms depends on the achievement of fiscal stabilization. In order for the reforms to succeed, the Central Government\u2019s fiscal deficit, which had reached 8.4% in the 1990\u20131991 fiscal year, needed to be reduced. The below actions were performed in order to decrease the budget deficit.\n\nExport subsidies were abolished in 1991\u20131992, and fertilizer subsidies were partially restructured in 1992\u20131993.\nBudget assistance to loss-making public-sector units in the form of government loans to cover their losses was gradually phased out.\nSome development expenditure, such as spending on social and economic infrastructure, was reformed.\nIndustrial Policy\n\nIndustrial policy has seen the most radical changes as a result of the reform plan. There is no longer\u00a0a need for the government to grant approval for new investments or for the significant expansion of current capacity as it was previously under\u00a0industrial licensing (License Raj).\n\nNowadays, only a small number of businesses are required to have licenses, mostly due to environmental and pollution concerns. Additionally, the MRTP Act was also eliminated.\nThe list of industries that were solely for the public sector to operate\u00a0was drastically reduced, and many crucial sectors were made available to the private sector, including power generation, hydrocarbons (oil and gas exploration, production, and refining), air transportation, telecommunications, and others.\nDe-licensing of items reserved for the MSME Sector\n\nSince 1991, the Ministry of Commerce and Industry has been gradually de-licensing the products specified for the MSME sector through a proactive approach.\n\nForeign Investment\n\nPrior to 1991, India had an extremely restrictive and often regarded hostile foreign investment policy.\n\nThe new strategy supported foreign investment considerably more actively in a variety of ways. For foreign equity investments of up to 51 percent in a lengthy list of 34 industries, permission is automatically granted; for investments of more than 51 percent, government approval was required.\n\nTrade and Exchange Rate Policy\n\nWith certain required\u00a0exceptions,\u00a0all raw materials, other production inputs, and capital products can now be imported without restriction.\n\nPrior to 1991, the RBI-determined an official exchange rate on which the Indian Rupee was converted into foreign currency. The value of the rupee dropped by nearly 24 percent in July 1991. (for alignment of the exchange rate with the market rate).\u00a0 In 1993, India switched to a market-based exchange rate system (managed float/floating rate).\n\nTax Reforms\nIn June 1991, the highest marginal rate of personal income tax was 56%. This was decreased to 40%.\nFor publicly listed enterprises, corporate income tax was lowered from 51.75% to 46%.\nThe average amount of customs duty drastically decreased from 200% to only 65%.\nPublic Sector Reforms\n\nThe government started a restricted process of disinvesting its ownership and equity in public sector enterprises instead of going through full privatization, keeping 51% of the equity and management control.\n\nFinancial Sector Reforms\nNew private banks were allowed to compete in the banking sector, and numerous new banking licenses were granted.\nTrading practices in capital markets are kept under\u00a0transparent and\u00a0strict control. In order to oversee the major players in the capital markets and regulate stock exchanges, an independent statutory entity called SEBI was created in 1988.\nThe capital market was made available for portfolio investments, and Indian businesses were permitted to access global capital markets by issuing equity or shares overseas through Global Depository Receipts (GDR).\nImpact of Economic Reforms of 1991\n\nThe economic reforms made in 1991 had a large-scale impact.\n\nOn various macroeconomic parameters (short-term)\nWithin 2.5 years, inflation dropped from a peak of 17 percent in August 1991 to roughly 8.5 percent.\nForex reserves increased from $1.2 billion in June 1991 to nearly $15 billion in 1994.\nGDP growth rate\u00a0increased from 1.1% in 1991\u20131992 to 4% in 1992\u20131993\nThe fiscal deficit decreased from 8.4%% in 1990\u20131991 to 5.7% in 1992\u20131993\nBetween 1990\u20131991 and 1993\u20131994 exports nearly doubled.\nOn poverty reduction (long term)\n\nGrowth contributes to the reduction of poverty in two ways: first, through the percolation (trickle-down) impact, and second, by enabling the government to raise more funds to support increased social sector spending. So, in order to significantly reduce poverty, two strategies are required:\n\nallowing rapid economic growth, and\nconcentrating on specialized programs to assist the underprivileged and needy\n\nThe Indian economy grew at a faster rate of 6.3 percent when we started the reforms in 1991, which enabled the government to raise more resources and pull in a sizable population in the\u00a0growth process.\n\nHowever, despite all the reforms, a large portion of Indians remain impoverished. According to estimates from the Tendulkar Committee for 2011\u201312, there is still 21.9 percent (26.9 cr) of the population living below the poverty line. In addition to being impoverished, they lack the necessities that have been discussed since Independence and before.\n\nOn the disparity between rich and poor (long term)\n\nAccording to data from the National Council of Applied Economic Research, the Gini coefficient in income for rural and urban areas rose from 0.52 in 2004-05 to 0.55 in 2011-12. (the higher the Gini coefficient higher the inequality).\n\nAccording to data from the National Council of Applied Economic Research, the Gini coefficient in income for rural and urban areas rose from 0.52 in 2004-05 to 0.55 in 2011-12. (the higher the Gini coefficient higher the inequality). The conclusion is that poverty decreased faster but inequality rose throughout the post-reform period.\n\nConclusion\n\nAs a result of our inability to provide enough work opportunities for young people, the post-reform period has been referred to as a period of jobless growth. The creation of numerous high-quality jobs is currently India\u2019s most urgent task since it is the only sustainable way to address chronic poverty; otherwise, the demographic dividend could turn into a nightmare of underemployment and unemployment.\n\nThe low rise in rural productivity in India is the other important issue, in contrast to China where rural entrepreneurship was the main economic driver for years.\n\nAccording to Raghuram Rajan (2014), India simply redistributed resources to rural regions through transfer programs (redistribution) like the guaranteed rural job plan and the minimum support price (MSP) for crops, without the concurrent increase in farm production that increased the demand for goods and services and increased inflation.\n\nHowever, since 2014, the government has boosted budgeted spending on rural infrastructure.\n\nArticle Written By: Priti Raj"

Kiran Kumar Reddy.\n\nThe first phase of DBT was launched in 43 districts, covering scholarships and social security pensions initially.\n\nWith effect from December 2014, it was expanded across the nation.\u00a0\n\nStructure of the Direct Benefit Transfer\n\nThe Direct Benefit Transfer program aims to bring transparency and terminate pilferage from the distribution of funds sponsored by the Central Government of India.\n\nBenefits or subsidies are immediately transferred to citizens living below the poverty level under DBT.\n\nThe Office of the Controller General of Accounts\u2019 Central Plan Scheme Monitoring System (CPSMS) serves as a common platform for routing DBT.\n\nCPSMS can be used to prepare the beneficiary list, digitally sign it, and process payments in the beneficiary\u2019s bank accounts via the Aadhaar Payment Bridge.\n\nNote: Aadhar is not mandatory to access benefits under DBT.\n\nTo know more about The Architecture Of Direct Cash Transfer To Public Using AADHAR, click here.\n\nObjectives of Direct Benefit Transfer\nCurbing pilferage and duplication.\nAccurate targeting of the beneficiary.\nReduced delay in payments.\nElectronic transfer of benefits, minimizing levels involved in benefit flow.\nThe mechanism of the Direct Benefit Transfer Scheme\nFirst, the beneficiaries are determined, and the beneficiary database is digitalized.\nBeneficiaries are given bank accounts if they don\u2019t already have one.\nBeneficiaries will enrol in Aadhaar after the bank account has been set up.\nThe seeding of Aadhaar with bank accounts and the beneficiary database.\nPutting the payment into the beneficiary\u2019s account as soon as possible and starting the last-mile connectivity or service delivery under the protocol.\nThe Components of the Direct Benefit Transfer\u00a0\n\nBeneficiary Account Validation System, a strong payment and reconciliation platform integrated with RBI, NPCI, Public and Private Sector Banks, Cooperative Banks, and Regional Rural Banks (core banking solutions for banks, settlement systems of Reserve Bank, Aadhaar Payment Bridge of the Payment Corporation of India), etc., are the essential elements in the execution of DBT schemes.\n\nValidation of Beneficiary Account\n\nThese functions include features like application for the scheme by the beneficiary with a bank account and Aadhaar details, review by scheme owners for eligibility of the beneficiary according to scheme guidelines, beginning bank account/Aadhaar verification, payment initiation through Fund Transfer Order, etc. These features make up a workflow-based framework for centrally sponsored and state-linked schemes.\n\nMGNREGA, PM-AWAS, PM-KISAN, DBT-PAHAL, etc. are some examples of such systems.\n\nAlthough many of the initiatives use Aadhaar to process payments, payments can also be made using a bank account number if Aadhaar is not readily available.\n\nPayment and Reconciliation Platform\n\nBy sending payment instructions to PFMS, which then sends them to banks after the appropriate beneficiary confirmation, the IT systems of the plan start the process of paying legitimate beneficiaries.\n\nWith the integration of more than 500 banks for the verification of bank accounts and the Aadhar seeding of beneficiaries with the NPCI, PFMS has developed into a powerful payment and reconciliation platform.\n\nThe failure of payments and delays in the beneficiary receiving their monies were significantly reduced by the prior authentication of beneficiary accounts.\n\nCore Banking Solutions\n\nAs the final mile of distribution, banks are important to the DBT process flow.\n\nAll account-based transfers are sent through core banking channels. The processing effectiveness at this point along with the flow of reverse MIS provided the DBT program with the desired momentum.\n\nAadhaar Payment Bridge (APB)\n\nOne of the unusual payment methods mandated by NPCI, the Aadhaar Payment Bridge (APB), leverages the Aadhaar number as a crucial key to digitally channel government rewards and subsidies into the Aadhaar Enabled Bank Accounts (AEBA) of the targeted beneficiaries.\n\nNPCI generates an Aadhaar mapper to enable the transfer of funds.\n\nThe most crucial element of the Aadhaar Payments Bridge (APB) is the Aadhaar mapper, which holds data about the bank accounts that have been seeded with the Aadhaar number and are used by NPCI to send payments to the destination Bank.\n\nThe types of schemes covered under the Direct Benefit Transfer\u00a0\n\nThe following are the different methods of cash transfer covered under DBT.\n\nCash transfer\n\nThe government immediately forwards cash to each beneficiary under the Direct Benefit Transfer cash transfer scheme. Following is a list of the numerous ways that money is transferred from the government to beneficiaries:\n\nThe beneficiary may receive the amount directly.\nThe fund is transferred from the State Treasury Account to the beneficiary.\nThrough an Implementing Agency that has been assigned by the government.\nThe beneficiary gets the fund from the State or Central Government.\nSome examples include the National Social Assistance Program (NSAP) and MGNREGA.\nIn-kind benefit transfers from the government to beneficiaries\nThe Government pays benefits to the recipients in kind under the Direct Benefit Transfer In-Kind Benefit Transfer Scheme either directly or through government-appointed implementing entities.\nThe cost of purchasing the items that can be used for public distribution and transporting them to the intended beneficiaries is often covered by the government. Then, these goods or services are provided to the beneficiaries at no cost or for a very cheap cost.\nOther types of transfers\n\nThe Direct Benefits Transfer program also distributes funding and subsidies to other non-governmental functionaries that help implement government objectives, in addition to cash and in-kind transfers.\n\nThis category of benefit transfer includes incentives, entitlements, etc. that are provided to community workers and Non-Governmental Organizations (NGOs). Due to the assistance they provide to other recipients and the community, they are provided such benefits.\n\nAdvantages of the Direct Benefit Transfer\u00a0\nDirect Benefit Transfer lessens the possibility of fraud while accelerating the safe delivery of information and money.\nIt eliminates the need for middlemen, such as government employees, by sending the subsidy amount directly to the beneficiary accounts.\nTransparency is increased, and incidences of theft from central government-sponsored monies being distributed are reduced.\nDirect Benefit Transfer ensures precise targeting of beneficiaries.\nBy linking the fund deposits to their Aadhaar details, beneficiaries will be permitted to join just one bank account, preventing the duplication of subsidies.\nIt enables the government to communicate with both citizens and program participants at the same time.\nDBT assists in the distribution of grants to worthy candidates who are living in poverty. It makes it easier for the government to communicate with the target recipients.\nThe plan prevents theft during the distribution of payments and lessens the exploitation of public resources.\nDBT is a potent settlement and transaction technology that collaborates with numerous organizations.\nDBT has shown to be a successful method of reaching out to people to disperse aid funding.\nChallenges faced by the Direct Benefit Transfer\u00a0\nDespite its widespread use and applicability, it can be noted that DBT has a few structural issues that need to be taken into account in due course.\nApproximately 91% of the population in the nation has currently registered for an Aadhar card. Since DBT and Aadhar are linked for programs, it is necessary to increase the Aadhar connection to 100% to ensure that no one is excluded.\nA low level of digital literacy in people living in rural areas poses one of the significant challenges in implementing this mechanism.\nAround 81% of Indians now have access to financial services, which may disqualify those from rural backgrounds. People won\u2019t be able to access financial facilities if they are inadequate. Pradhan Mantri Jan Dhan Yojna of the Government of India will play a vital role here.\nReaching those without bank accounts is extremely difficult for bank correspondents. Additionally, internet connectivity issues and other technical difficulties plague bank correspondents. For the benefits to reach the beneficiaries, banking services in rural regions must be improved.\nDirect Benefit Transfer in PDS\n\nRecently, The Centre has decided to make the Direct Benefit Transfer (DBT) for the Public Distribution System (PDS) optional for states as the pilot initiatives have failed to yield the desired results.\n\nDetails\n\nThe Centre had launched pilot projects for cash transfers in three Union Territories \u2014 Chandigarh, Puducherry, and Dadra & Nagar Haveli \u2014 to PDS beneficiaries, who had to then purchase food grains from the open market.\n\nFood and Public Distribution Minister Ram Vilas Paswan stated the DBT effort did not achieve the desired objectives since recipients diverted payments for reasons other than purchasing food grains.\n\nFurthermore, PDS recipients in a Maharashtra hamlet were offered the option of using DBT or purchasing foodgrains from a fair-pricing shop. It was discovered that the beneficiaries preferred to shop at the fair price shop.\n\nSimilarly last year, Jharkhand discontinued a DBT pilot in the public distribution system ten months after it was launched.\n\nPositives of DBT in PDS\nDBT can prevent fraudulent transactions while also reducing red tape and enhancing efficiency.\nFlexibility and convenience: PDS provided flexibility, convenience, and choice in terms of food quality \u2013 people could now buy better quality grains than what they received through the PDS or spend the money on other foods.\nTargeting: The goal of DBT is not to do away with subsidies, but to target them effectively so that they flow only to the intended beneficiaries.\nPrevent market distortion: The subsidy in indirect subsidy is embedded in the physical delivery of a product at a price lower than the open market price. This price disparity disrupts the market, creating chances for arbitrage, supply diversion, and profit in the black market.\nLow economic cost: To handle the rationing of subsidized commodities, sophisticated administrative machinery must be maintained at a high expense, which can be reduced by DBT.\nNegatives of DBT in PDS\nDelay in payment: Money not being deposited in accounts on time.\nNot Inflation indexed: The cash sum is not adjusted for market pricing or inflation. As a result, the monetary value is less than the market value of rice.\nMultiple accounts: Money is being placed into another account. This occurs when recipients open a new bank account, which is automatically connected to their Aadhaar number. The money is automatically deposited in the newest account to be seeded with Aadhaar via the Public Finance Management System \u2013 National Payments Corporation of India\u2019s cash remittance system. The beneficiary, on the other hand, examines the account registered with the civil supplies department.\nInaccessibility: According to a study by NITI Aayog, it was found that the beneficiaries of the cash transfer initiative had trouble accessing funds deposited in their bank accounts.\nLack of communication: DBT\u2019s standard operating procedures require recipients to be notified through SMS. People are unconcerned about money being deposited by SMS. As a result, recipients were frequently required to make several journeys to banks to check on and withdraw funds. This resulted in significant opportunity costs, particularly for the rural poor.\nExtra cost: It was also discovered that the majority of beneficiaries had to spend extra money on single-purpose visits to banks to withdraw the subsidy amount and to the market to purchase food grains.\nTime-consuming: Beneficiaries discovered that going to the bank to withdraw money takes longer than going to the ration shop to obtain their fortnightly rations.\nExploitation by banks: Banks were discovered to be adjusting the money beneficiaries received with any outstanding loans they had, rendering them unable to buy rice from ration stores.\nInadequate grievance redressal mechanisms: There were toll-free numbers, but people did not know how to report their grievances.\nWhat is the current level of Central Government subsidy and to what extent is it under DBT?\nIn the fiscal year 2021-22 Union Budget, the Centre allocated approximately Rs 3.70 lakh crore (more than 10% of the entire budget amount of Rs 35.83 lakh crore) for 38 different forms of subsidies, the most important of which being food, fertilizer, and gasoline.\nAll subsidies are included in DBT. DBT also covers several sorts of scholarships/stipends and monetary support, in addition to subsidies.\n312 schemes, including key subsidies being run by 54 Central Government Ministries and Departments, are part of DBT.\nThe deletion of 3.99 crore duplicate and fake/non-existent ration cards (between 2013 and 2020) resulted in an estimated saving of approximately Rs 1 lakh crore for the Public Distribution Scheme (PDS).\nMGNREGS saved 10% on wages by removing duplicate, fictitious/non-existent, and ineligible beneficiaries. Aside from that, 4.11 crore duplicate, fake/non-existent, dormant LPG connections have been removed.\nWay forward\nFor a DBT implementation to succeed, there must be a focus on three critical areas:\nProper identification of beneficiaries: Aadhaar can solve the identification problem.\nTimely transfer of money to beneficiaries: Some banking tasks could be replaced by mobile penetration. However, physical connectivity to financial centres will be required at the final mile.\nTheir ability to access these benefits with relative ease.\nChoice-based DBT system: People could be given the option of switching to cash transfers or remaining with subsidized food in this case. This will protect recipients, particularly the most vulnerable, against suboptimal implementation.\nMore pilot initiatives are needed, with a focus on beneficiary convenience rather than government cost savings. If beneficiaries embrace it freely, savings will occur, possibly in bigger numbers.\n\nArticle Written by: Remya"

This document set an agenda that focused on what gender discrimination is and called for action to eliminate it.\n\nOn July 9, 1993, India ratified the CEDAW convention with two\u00a0declaratory\u00a0statements.\n\nThe first Gender Budget Statement appeared in the Indian Budget of 2005\u20132006. Every year, the government releases a Gender Budget Statement with the Union Budget.\n\nSteps Taken by GoI to promote gender equality\n\nThe government is committed to promoting gender equality across all fields and spheres of government. \u00a0Gender budgeting is an approach the government has chosen to include a gender perspective in all phases of policy formulation.\n\nThe government has stressed that gender-sensitive legislation, policies, plans, programs, schemes, resource allocation, implementation, monitoring, auditing, and effect evaluation of programs and schemes are all part of gender budgeting.\n\nIn this regard, the Ministry of Women and Child Development has focused on:\n\nEstablishing institutional mechanisms and structures for gender budgeting across all Ministries/Departments at the central, state/UTs, and local levels.\nCreating expertise and enhancing capacity at all levels of governance for gender budgeting.\n\nThe Ministry of Women and Child Development is putting into practice a program on gender budgeting to provide financial grant-in-aid to government agencies, national and state training institutions, and organizations to conduct training and workshops to increase the capacity of various stakeholders.\n\nWomen\u2019s programs received Rs. 1.71 lakh crore (almost 5% of the total budget) in the 2022\u20132023 budget. At least 16 states have implemented gender-responsive budgets and programs that help women.\n\nSad Fact: World Economic Forum (WEF) released the Global Gender Gap (GGG) Report for 2022. India ranked 135 out of 146 countries.\n\nParts of Gender Budget\nPart A includes schemes with 100% allocation for women (for ex: Beti Bachao Beti Padhao, Ujjawala, Mahila Shakti Kendra, Anganwadi, etc.)\nPart B with schemes allocating at least 30% of funds for women (for ex: Mid-day meals program, PM POSHAN, etc.)\nSignificance of gender Budgeting\n\nThe main benefit of gender budgeting is the reduction of gender disparities.\n\nModern society still exhibits gender inequality, which is seen in entrepreneurship opportunities, labour participation, pay, education, health outcomes, governance, and employee representation in top management roles.\n\nThese differences show unfair resource distribution even if they may be related to more traditional elements, such as cultural roles for men and women. By ensuring that public policy is developed and implemented in an inclusive manner that recognizes women as important contributors to economic progress, gender budgeting seeks to address these imbalances.\n\nGender budgeting calls for the auditing of public budgets to take into account gender differences. The care of household environments and interpersonal connections is primarily performed by women- is frequently ignored by public budgets.\n\nThe visualization of women\u2019s unpaid effort in social reproduction and its contribution to the general well-being of society is made possible by gender budget auditing.\n\nWhat have Gender Budgets achieved?\n\nThe Gender Budget has been successful in raising awareness of gender issues despite its flaws. The mainstreaming of the notion that a gender lens is significant inside the fiscal discourse is one of the biggest successes of gender-responsive budgeting.\n\nAbout CEDAW: The Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination against Women\n\nThe CEDAW convention not only prohibits overt acts of discrimination by States but also obliges them to take positive steps to end discrimination against women in all spheres of society, including the public and private sectors and political life.\n\nOn July 9, 1993, India ratified the CEDAW treaty along with two declarative statements. The declaration\u2019s text is as follows:\n\nDeclaration \u2013 1\n\nThe Government of the Republic of India declares that it shall abide by and ensure these provisions in conformity with its policy of non-interference in the personal affairs of any community without its initiative and consent.\n\nDeclaration \u2013 2\n\nThe Government of the Republic of India declares that though in principle it fully supports the principle of compulsory registration of marriage, it is not practical in a vast country like India with its variety of customs, religions, and level of literacy.\n\nThe UN General Assembly adopted the Optional Protocol on October 15, 1999, and it came into effect in December 2000. It is a separate instrument that can be ratified by countries that have already ratified the CEDAW Convention. If justice is not served at the national level, OP-CEDAW gives women access to justice on an international level. Up to this point, India has not ratified OP-CEDAW.\n\nObjectives of State Level Consultation: CEDAW and OP-CEDAW\n\nObjectives of the state-level consultation are:\n\nTo increase knowledge and comprehension of the CEDAW and OP-CEDAW principles among the major players working in the area of women\u2019s rights, empowerment, and development, both in the public and private sectors\n\nTo raise knowledge of the laws against discrimination against women in human rights.\n\nIn news\n\nThe\u00a02024-25 Budget\u00a0emphasises women-led development, with\u00a0Gender Budget\u00a0Statement (GBS)\u00a0allocations reaching\u00a01% of\u00a0Gross Domestic Product(GDP)\u00a0for the first time and pro-women funding exceeding\u00a0\u20b93 lakh crore.\n\nThe GBS, since it was first introduced in 2005-06, consistently reported an average share of 5% of the total budgetary allocations, with marginal ups and downs.\nThis year is special as the share of allocations to pro-women schemes stands at approximately 6.8% of the total budget expenditure for 2024-25, which is way above the usual trends and marks a positive departure from the status quo.\nInclusion of Part C:\u00a0A new section,\u00a0Part C,\u00a0now includes pro-women schemes with\u00a0up to 30% allocation\u00a0for women, such as the\u00a0PM Kisan scheme.\nEarlier the GBS comprised two parts \u2013\u00a0Part A\u00a0reflecting Women Specific Schemes, such as those with\u00a0100% allocation for women such as\u00a0SAMARTHYA, which now accounts for nearly\u00a040% of GBS allocations,\u00a0partly due to the full inclusion of the\u00a0Pradhan Mantri Awas Yojana (PMAY).\nPart B reflects the schemes with 30% to 99% expenditure on women-related components, such as PM AJAY \u2013 Adarsh Gram Yojana.\nWay Forward\n\nGender budgeting strategies should use intersectionality rather than the premise that \u201call women are equal\u201d. Intersectionality refers to the way in which multiple forms of discrimination \u2013 based on gender, race, sexuality, disability, class, etc. overlap and interact with one another.\n\nIn order to address the rising caste-based violence, targeted gender budgeting strategies are also required.\n\nFor example: In the context of South Africa, Black Economic Empowerment (BEE) is a strong strategy for addressing Apartheid\u2019s disparities. In BEE, the issue of how race and gender interact is addressed.\n\nRelated article:\u00a0Gender Justice\n\nArticle Written By: Priti Raj"

Thus, it does not say anything about the real strength of a currency; it is just a relative value.\n\nHowever, it can be used to measure the relative strength of different currencies.\n\nAn increase in NEER indicates that the domestic currency has appreciated against the basket of currencies whereas a decrease indicates a relative depreciation.\n\nThere is no fixed standard used to determine the basket of currencies.\n\nThe OECD basket is different from that of the IMF or that of the US Federal Reserve. Most of the institutions rely on the IMF\u2019s basket of currencies.\n\nREER\n\nThe Real Effective Exchange Rate (REER) is the NEER adjusted by inflation differentials between the domestic currency and that of the trading partners.\n\nThus, it says about the real strength of a domestic currency against a basket of currencies, unlike NEER.\n\nDifferences between NEER and REER\nNEER\n\t\nREER\n\n\nIt reflects the relative value of a currency with respect to that of the trading partners\n\t\nIt reflects the inflation-adjusted value of a currency with respect to that of the trading partners\n\n\nIt is calculated based on a basket of currencies\n\t\nIt is calculated based on NEER\n\n\nIt is not an accurate measure of a currency\u2019s strength as it is not adjusted for inflation differential\n\t\nIt is considered a more accurate measure to gauge a currency\u2019s strength\nNEER and REER in the Indian context\n\nThe Reserve Bank compiles and disseminates indices of NEER and REER of the Indian rupee.\n\nThe latest series was constructed with the base year 2015-16. The new indices of NEER and REER replaced the old series from 2004-05 onwards.\n\nThe coverage of the NEER and REER basket has been expanded from 36 to 40 currencies. This was in view of the growing importance of emerging markets and developing economies in India\u2019s foreign trade and to better reflect shifts in external competitiveness.\n\nThe selection of currencies for NEER and REER in the new series is based on two criteria:\n\nTrading partners with extremely high and volatile inflation are excluded. This is because their currencies tend to experience rapid nominal declines, undermining the stability of the NEER and REER indices. This obscures their usefulness in the assessment of external competitiveness.\nData on inflation and exchange rates of trading partners should be available on a regular basis.\nConclusion\n\nSince the adoption of floating exchange rates, NEER and REER have become instrumental in analyzing the competitiveness of a country\u2019s economy.\n\nIt is also quite significant from the perspective of policymakers, especially in the light of the under or over-evaluation of currencies leading to many global trade disputes.\n\nArticle written by: Caroline Abraham"

The mission is:\n\nEfficient procurement at Minimum Support Price (MSP), storage, and distribution of food grains.\nEnsuring availability of food grains and sugar through appropriate policy instruments; including maintenance of buffer stocks of food grains.\nMaking food grains accessible at reasonable prices, especially to the weak errand vulnerable sections of the society under PDS.\nFunctions of Food Corporation of India (FCI)\n\nIt has primary duty to undertake purchase, store, move/transport, distribute and sell food grains and other food items.\n\nFCI thrives to transform food security into a stable security system to ensure availability, accessibility, and affordability of food grains to all people at all times so that no one, nowhere, and at no time should go hungry.\n\nProcurement: The Central Government extends price support for the procurement of wheat, paddy, and coarse grains through the FCI and State Agencies.\n\nAll the food grains conforming to the prescribed specifications are procured by the public procurement agencies at the Minimum Support Price (MSP) plus the incentive bonus announced.\nFCI has also been nominated as an additional nodal Agency for the procurement of Pulses and Oilseeds.\n\nDecentralized Procurement Scheme (DCP): It was introduced in 1997-98 for food grains to be procured and distributed by the state governments themselves.\n\nThe designated States procure, store and issue food grains under the Targeted Public Distribution System (TPDS) and other welfare schemes of the Government.\n\nQuality control: The quality Control Division of FCI ensures the procurement of food grains from procurement centers strictly by Govt. of India\u2019s uniform quality specifications.\n\nDistribution: FCI meets the requirements of TPDS through grains procured which are issued at a Central Issue Price fixed by Government.\n\nFCI delivers food grains to State Agencies from its base depots for distribution through Fair Price Shops.\n\nThe role of FCI is important as the National Food Security Act, 2013 commits to distributing grains through TPDS and other welfare schemes at highly subsidized prices.\n\nPublic distribution system: Public Distribution System (PDS) evolved as a system for the distribution of food grains at affordable prices and management of emergencies.\n\nThe center is responsible for procuring the food grains from farmers at a\u00a0Minimum Support Price (MSP).\nThe MSP is the price at which the FCI purchases the crop directly from farmers; generally, the MSP is higher than the market price.\nThe MSP is set by the Commission for Agricultural Costs and Prices (CACP).\n\nPDS is operated under the joint responsibility of the Central and State Governments. The Central Government, through FCI, has assumed the responsibility for procurement, storage, transportation, and bulk allocation of food grains to the State Governments.\n\nCommission for Agricultural Costs and Prices (CACP)\n\nThe Commission for Agricultural Costs & Prices (CACP) is an attached office of the Ministry of Agriculture and Farmers Welfare, Government of India.\n\nIt came into existence in January 1965.\n\nThe Commission comprises a Chairman, Member Secretary, one Member (Official), and two Members (Non-Official).\n\nThe non-official members are representatives of the farming community and usually have an active association with the farming community.\nFunctions of CACP:\nIt is mandated to recommend minimum support prices (MSPs) to incentivize the cultivators to adopt modern technology and raise productivity and overall grain production in line with the emerging demand patterns in the country.\nMSP for major agricultural products is fixed by the government, each year, after taking into account the recommendations of the Commission.\nAs of now, CACP recommends MSPs of 23 commodities, which comprise 7 kinds of cereal (paddy, wheat, maize, sorghum, pearl millet, barley, and ragi), 5 pulses (gram, tur, moong, urad, lentil), 7 oilseeds (groundnut, rapeseed-mustard, soybean, sesamum, sunflower, safflower, nigerseed), and 4 commercial crops (copra, sugarcane, cotton and raw jute).\n\nCACP submits its recommendations to the government in the form of Price Policy Reports every year, separately for five groups of commodities namely:\n\nKharif crops\nRabi crops\nSugarcane\nRaw Jute\nCopra\n\nBefore preparing the aforesaid five pricing policy reports, the Commission draws a comprehensive questionnaire and sends it to all the state governments and concerned National organizations and Ministries to seek their views.\n\nSeparate meetings are also held with farmers from different states, state governments, and National organizations like Food Corporation of India (FCI), NAFED, Cotton Corporation of India (CCI), Jute Corporation of India (JCI), trader\u2019s organizations, processing organizations, and key central Ministries.\nThe Commission also makes visits to states for on-the-spot assessment of the various constraints that farmers face in marketing their products or even raising the productivity levels of their crops.\n\nBased on all these inputs, the Commission then finalizes its recommendations/reports, which are then submitted to the government.\n\nThe government, in turn, circulates the CACP reports to state governments and concerned central Ministries for their comments.\n\nAfter receiving the feedback from them, the Cabinet Committee on Economic Affairs (CCEA) of the Union government takes a final decision on the level of MSPs and other recommendations made by the CACP.\n\nOnce this decision is taken, CACP puts all its reports on the website for various stakeholders to see the rationale behind CACP\u2019s price and non-price recommendations.\n\nIssues with FCI and recommendations for improvement\n\nFood Corporation of India has been marred by numerous shortfalls over the years in the areas of timely procurement, storage, and distribution.\n\nThis led to the formation of a high-level committee (HLC) led by Shanta Kumar for restructuring FCI. The committee recommendations were:\n\nProcurement: The committee recommended that all procurement made by the FCI should be handed over to the states that gained experience in this matter and created the necessary infrastructure for the same\nNegotiable warehouse receipt system: A warehouse receipt system should be made negotiable as this can help farmers deposit their produce at the registered warehouses. They can then sell it at a price suitable for them and at the same time reduce the cost of storage for the government.\nRevision of the MSP Policy: The HLC recommended that pulses and oilseeds should also be in the MSP category. At present MSP for 23 commodities are announced with priority given to wheat and rice, but the MSP was applicable in only selected states. The present arrangement creates a disproportionate price structure that favors wheat and rice.\nStorage and movement: HLC recommended that the Food Corporation of India (FCI) should outsource its stocking operations to various agencies such as Central Warehousing Corporation, State Warehousing Corporation, the Private Sector under the Private Entrepreneur Guarantee (PEG) scheme, and even state governments that are building silos through a private sector on state lands.\nThe committee had recommended that the government should relook at the coverage (67% of the population) under the NFSA as it\u2019s on the \u2018higher\u2019 side."

            "[CONTENT]": "Animal rearing is an important aspect of the Indian agricultural sector. Read here to know more about the significance of the economics of animal rearing in India.\n\nLivestock or animal rearing plays an important role in the Indian economy because about 20.5 million people depend upon livestock for their livelihood. Livestock provides livelihood to two-thirds of rural communities in India.\n\nIndia has a rich heritage of animal rearing. It is home to several breeds of cattle, small ruminants, fowl, pigs, and equine species among others.\n\nLivestock contributes about 16% to the income of small farm households as against an average of 14% for all rural households. It also employs about 8.8 % of the population in India.\n\nIndia has vast livestock resources and the sector contributes 4.11% to total GDP and 25.6% of total Agriculture GDP.\n\nTable of Contents\n\nWhat is animal rearing?\nSignificance of animal rearing in India\nImportance of animal rearing in farmers\u2019 economy\nChanges in the animal-rearing system\nImportant Initiatives by the Government\nWay forward\nWhat is animal rearing?\n\nAnimal rearing is considered an integral part of agricultural activities in rural India. The diversity in breeds is based on traditional selection methods.\n\n\ud83d\udc49 Which year are YOU targeting for success in the IAS/IPS/IFS Exam? \ud83d\ude80\n\n(1) \u21d2 UPSC 2025: Prelims cum Mains\n\n(2) \u21d2 UPSC 2026: Prelims cum Mains\n\n(3) \u21d2 UPSC 2027 Prelims cum Mains\n\nTip: Know more about ClearIAS Courses (Online/Offline)\n\nSome of the selection criteria considered in the traditional breeding systems include the ability of the animals too:\n\nwithstand heat and\u00a0humidity,\nto resist diseases,\nto cope with feed stress,\nto\u00a0walk and graze forages,\nto utilize a range of forages and,\nto survive for longer periods.\n\nThe\u00a0objective\u00a0of animal rearing is to make the livestock useful for human beings for a variety of purposes with economic value. Therefore, it provides non-farm employment and income in rural areas.\n\nThe animal production system in India is part of a mixed crop-livestock farming system and is important for the security of the rural populace.\n\nSignificance of animal rearing in India\n\nAnimal rearing is integrated with the natural environment to a great extent, less dependent on purchased inputs and external factors. As a result, animal rearing, even during the down performance of agriculture, contributes nearly 40% of the rural GDP across India.\n\nAnother key factor is, that in arid and semi-arid regions of India, agriculture is possible only for three to six months during the monsoon period and high-cost irrigation investments are beyond the reach of most the farmers. Thus, for a large percentage of the rural populace cattle rearing provides a steady income.\n\nThe diversity of breeds itself is a certain risk mitigation characteristic; as animals are bred to fulfill a wide array of characteristics.\n\nAccording to the Livestock census, India is\n\nWorld\u2019s highest livestock owner at about 535.78 million\nFirst in the total buffalo population in the world \u2013 109.85 million buffaloes\nSecond in the population of goats \u2013 148.88 million goats\nSecond largest poultry market in the world\nThe second-largest producer of fish and also the second-largest aquaculture nation in the world\nThird in the population of sheep (74.26 million)\nFifth in the population of ducks and chickens (851.81 million)\nTenth in camel population in the world \u2013 2.5 lakhs\nImportance of animal rearing in farmers\u2019 economy\n\nThe farmers in India maintain a mixed farming system i.e. a combination of crop and livestock where the output of one enterprise becomes the input of another enterprise thereby realizing resource efficiency.\n\nThe livestock serves the farmers in different ways:\n\nFood\n\nThe livestock provides food items such as Milk, Meat, and Eggs for human consumption. India is the number one milk producer in the world.\n\nFibre and skins:\n\nThe livestock also contributes to the production of wool, hair, hides, and pelts. Leather is the most important product which has very high export potential. India is producing about 41.5 million Kg of wool per annum\n\nAnimals for agricultural operations and transport\n\nBullocks are the backbone of Indian agriculture. Despite a lot of advancements in the use of mechanical power in Indian agricultural operations, the Indian farmer especially in rural areas still depends upon bullocks for various agricultural operations.\nThe bullocks are saving a lot on fuel which is a necessary input for using mechanical power like tractors, combine harvesters, etc\nPack animals like camels, horses, donkeys, ponies, mules, etc are being extensively used to transport goods in different parts of the country in addition to bullocks.\nIn situations like hilly terrains, mules and ponies serve as the only alternative to transport goods.\nSimilarly, the army has to depend upon these animals to transport various items in high areas of high altitudes.\n\nAnimal waste\n\nDung and other animal wastes serve as very good farm yard manure and have a great monetary value.\nIn addition, it is also used as fuel (biogas, dung cakes), and for construction purposes in rural areas.\n\nLivestock as asset\n\nLivestock is considered as \u2018moving banks\u2019 because of their potential to dispose of during emergencies.\nThey serve as capital and in cases of landless agricultural laborers many times it is the only capital resource they possess.\nLivestock serves as an asset and in case of emergencies, they serve as a guarantee for availing loans from the local sources such as money lenders in the villages.\n\nWeed control\n\nLivestock is also used for biological control of brush, plants, and weeds as cattle graze off the weeds.\n\nSocio-cultural importance\n\nLivestock has been part of generations of pastoral communities in India and the special knowledge of animal rearing has evolved over the centuries.\nThey have been responsible for developing and conserving domestic animal diversity with important genetic traits.\n\nMilk marketing network\n\nMilk marketing has a significant role in the rural economy. The sale of milk does help family farms to get regular income, though not high profits.\n\nAlso read: Sustainable Livestock Production\n\nChanges in the animal-rearing system\n\nAs in the case of agriculture, the animal rearing system is witnessing a rapid movement toward an intensive production model characterized by a focus on one trait or breed; production of milk through heavy doses of external inputs like feed concentrates and other enhancing chemicals like antibiotics, probiotics, etc.\n\nStatistically, such a system is unsustainable and the cost of external inputs pushes the animal rearers out of the vocation.\n\nThe whole system is protected enormously by subsidies. India is pushing itself into this trap with a focus on an intensive production system.\n\nUshering in such a production system into India has the potential to push out traditional breeds and increase the dependence on inputs like concentrates, medicines, and genetic inputs like imported semen of exotic bulls, thereby increasing the costs of production.\nSuch a system is unsuitable for the agro-climatic conditions of India.\n\nThe aspect of cross-breeding is also on the rise and its usage is specifically considering the availability of resources, educational and social status of farmers, and climatic conditions.\n\nThe excessive focus on exotic breeds ignores evidence from the field which points to progressively stagnating milk production and returns from crossbreeds.\nImportant Initiatives by the Government\n\nRashtriya Gokul Mission: To develop and conserve indigenous breeds of the bovine population enhance milk production and make it more remunerative to the farmers.\n\nNational Livestock Mission: To ensure quantitative and qualitative improvement in livestock production systems and capacity building of all stakeholders.\n\nNational Artificial Insemination Programme: To suggest novel methods of bringing about impregnation in female breeds. And to prevent the spread of certain diseases which are genital, thereby enhancing the efficiency of the breed.\n\nNational Cattle and Buffalo Breeding Project: To genetically upgrade important indigenous breeds on a priority basis with a focus on development and conservation.\n\nAnimal Husbandry Startup Grand Challenge: To appreciate innovations coming from the villages to expand the dairy sector in India.\n\nWay forward\n\nThe economics of animal rearing is an important aspect of the developmental policies of India\u2019s economy. Hence more measures can be used to promote the well-being of the system:\n\nincorporating seeds that yield good edible biomass in our agricultural practices;\nmaking the right choice in introducing cattle/ buffalo breeds in different agro-climatic regions;\nin western India, high-yielding milk breeds can be used in pure form or could be used for upgrading cattle in the local or adjoining areas;\npromoting milk recording at farmers\u2019 gate;\nselection of bulls for higher milk yields needs to be simultaneously carried out;\nidentifying possible breeds which may already exist in different areas;\npromoting milk yield competitions in different regions for identifying good milk-yielding cows\n\nThis will be a slow and time-consuming process but, ultimately will give a solid indigenous base with all the good genetic characteristics."

            "[CONTENT]": "Surety Bonds are a new concept in India and recently IRDAI has released guidelines for it. Read here to know the pros, cons, and significance of them.\n\nIn Budget 2022-23, the government has allowed the use of surety insurance bonds as a substitute for bank guarantees in case of government procurement and also for gold imports.\n\nRecently the Ministry for Road Transport & Highways (MORTH) has asked insurance regulator Insurance Regulatory and Development Authority (IRDAI) to develop a model product on Surety Bonds in consultation with general insurers.\n\nTable of Contents\n\nWhat is a surety bond?\nTypes of surety bonds\nAdvantages of surety bonds\nDisadvantages\nIRDAI Guidelines on Surety Bonds\nWay forward\nWhat is a surety bond?\n\nSubscribe to the ClearIAS YouTube Channel for more informative videos on UPSC preparation, tips, and strategies. Stay updated with our latest content and enhance your exam readiness.\n\nA surety bond is defined as a three-party agreement that legally binds together a principal who needs the bond, an obligee who requires the bond, and a surety company that sells the bond.\n\n\ud83d\udc49 Which year are YOU targeting for success in the IAS/IPS/IFS Exam? \ud83d\ude80\n\n(1) \u21d2 UPSC 2025: Prelims cum Mains\n\n(2) \u21d2 UPSC 2026: Prelims cum Mains\n\n(3) \u21d2 UPSC 2027 Prelims cum Mains\n\nTip: Know more about ClearIAS Courses (Online/Offline)\n\nThe bond guarantees the principal will act by certain laws.\nIf the principal fails to perform in this manner, the bond will cover the resulting damages or losses.\n\nThe obligee, usually a government entity, requires the principal, typically a business owner or contractor, to obtain a surety bond as a guarantee against future work performance.\n\nA surety bond is provided by the insurance company on behalf of the contractor to the entity which is awarding the project.\n\nThese bonds are mainly aimed at infrastructure development to reduce indirect costs for suppliers and contractors.\nThis helps in the diversification of options hence acting as a substitute for a bank guarantee.\nTypes of surety bonds\nBid bond: It provides financial protection to an obligee if a bidder is awarded a contract under the bid documents, but fails to sign the contract and provide any required performance and payment bonds.\nPerformance bond: It assures that the obligee will be protected if the principal or contractor fails to perform the bonded contract. If the obligee declares the principal or contractor as being in default and terminates the contract, it can call on the Surety to meet the obligations under the bond.\nPayment bond: Bond assures that the contractor will pay certain subcontractors, laborers, and materials suppliers associated with the project.\nAdvantages of surety bonds\n\nThere are many benefits of contract surety bonds:\n\nAs an impartial third party, the surety prequalifies the contractor to verify that the contractor is capable and qualified.\nThe owner has the assurance of project completion, however, many things can cause contractors to default, and in that event, the surety bond offers protection against financial loss.\nIf the contractor requests help, the surety may offer technical, managerial, or financial assistance. This can help the project move forward and significantly reduce the likelihood of default.\nThese bonds protect the beneficiary\u00a0against acts or events that impair the underlying obligations of the principal.\nThey\u00a0guarantee the performance\u00a0from construction or service contracts to licensing and commercial undertakings.\nSurety bonds protect taxpayer dollars on public projects.\nWhen subcontractors and suppliers know they are protected by a payment bond, they may present lower quotes since they no longer have to absorb the risk of nonpayment.\n\nFor infrastructure projects:\n\nThe large liquidity and funding requirements of the infrastructure sector can be addressed with surety bonds.\n\nThe Surety bonds will assist in developing an alternative to bank guarantees for construction projects. This will enable the efficient use of working capital and reduce the requirement of collateral\u00a0to be provided by construction companies.\n\nInsurers will work together with financial institutions to share risk information which will assist in releasing liquidity in the infrastructure space without compromising on risk aspects.\n\nDisadvantages\nBonded parties must pay for bonds and any valid claims\nA lapse in bond coverage can invalidate a license or contract\nRequired bonds renewals can add ongoing costs and hassle\n\nSurety bonds are a new concept in India hence are risky as insurance companies here are yet to achieve expertise in risk assessment in such business.\n\nThere is no clarity on pricing, the recourse available against defaulting contractors, and reinsurance options.\nThese are critical and may impede the creation of surety-related expertise and capacities and eventually deter insurers from writing this class of businesses.\nIRDAI Guidelines on Surety Bonds\n\nInsurance Regulatory and Development Authority of India (IRDAI) (Surety Insurance Contracts) Guidelines, 2022 came into force in April 2022.\n\nThe premium charged for all surety insurance policies underwritten in a financial year, including all installments due in subsequent years for those policies, should not exceed 10% of the total gross written premium of that year, subject to a maximum of Rs 500 crore.\nInsurers can issue contract bonds, which assure the public entity, developers, subcontractors, and suppliers that the contractor will fulfill its contractual obligation when undertaking the project.\nContract bonds may include Bid Bonds, Performance Bonds, Advance Payment Bonds, and Retention Money.\nThe limit of the guarantee should not exceed 30% of the contract value.\nSurety Insurance contracts\u00a0should be issued only to specific projects and not clubbed for multiple projects.\nWay forward\n\nMost general insurers are still apprehensive and are seeking more clarity on the structure and pricing of these bonds before moving ahead.\n\nThere are also concerns about defaulting, reinsurance support, experience, and capacity to underwrite such bonds.\n\nThe major concern is that general insurers do not have the same understanding of customers as banks do. There also needs to have clarity on whether these bonds fall under the Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code.\n\nHence, more elaborate and clearer guidelines will encourage general insurers to adopt the surety bonds."

This includes the internet and related information technologies, and digital technologies, used of which have grown rapidly in recent years in all fields.\n\nThe impact of information and communication technology in agriculture can be evaluated broadly under two categories.\n\nFirst, Information technology is a tool for direct contribution to agricultural productivity.\nSecondly, as an indirect tool for empowering agriculturalists to make informed and quality decisions, it will have a positive impact on the agriculture and allied activities conducted.\n\nAgricultural biotech and InfoTech together are helping to create new tools to-\n\ntackle the problem of consistent rural poverty\ngenerate employment,\nincrease farm productivity and production,\nimprove quality and marketing\n\nBeneficial outcomes of e-Agriculture which enhance the quality of life of farmers include-\n\nbridging the information gap between the farmers and\nbuilding a productive and competitive market,\nDifferent IT interventions support rural and under-developed markets to become efficient and pesticides.\nFarm animals are fed and monitored by electronic sensors and identification systems.\nAccess to price information, access to agriculture information, access to national and international markets,\nIncreasing production efficiency and so on.\nAdvantages of E-technology in aid of farmers\n\nSome of the benefits derived by the farmers through ICT are given below:\n\nImproved decision making: By having the necessary information, farmers make improved decisions concerning their agricultural activities. The exchange of knowledge from various countries and organizations also helps farmers be more aware of factors to consider before making their decisions.\nPlanning: IT has paved the way to come up with farming software that determines the best aids to use on the farm. Gaining information from their farm is essential in sustaining growth.\nCommunity participation: When a community adopts modern methods for agriculture, the production of local goods can be increased. With IT, there can be an improved union among local farmers, leading to better income for everyone involved.\nAgricultural innovations: When scientists develop new and improved techniques that help grow crops in adversities, a connected agricultural world will promote better reach.\nBetter outreach: Not only small and medium farmers, but even backyard farmers also play a role in promoting agriculture. USe of e-technology will help in spreading ideas and innovations to all levels of farming sects.\n\nAlong with the advantages, e-agriculture has lots of problems like technical feasibility of connectivity in rural areas, cost involved in ensuring services, need for basic computer literacy, etc. Some of those problems are:-\n\nThe reach of the technology is still very poor and a large number of farmers are still ignorant about such advancements.\nThe distribution of technologies is not uniform throughout the country.\nThe use of technology is being used by the already big-scale farmers is pushing the wealth gap wider. The small and marginal farmers are again being left out in the process of development.\nDue to the low literacy rate among farmers and the digital divide, there is a rise of a new class of middlemen, who provide ICT services to farmers.\nThe rural infrastructure for the use of ICT is also not uniform and a lot of regional disparity persists.\nInitiatives by the Central Government for promoting E-technology in aid of farmers\n\nThere are many initiatives of the Central Government integrating electronic technology and farming.\n\nNational Agriculture Market\nThe National Agriculture Market (NAM) is a pan-India electronic trading portal that seeks to network the existing APMC and other market yards to create a unified national market for agricultural commodities.\nNAM is a \u201cvirtual\u201d market, but it has a physical market at the backend.\nNAM was announced during the\u00a0Budget of 2014-15\u00a0and is proposed to be achieved through the setting up of a common e-platform to which initially 585 APMCs selected by the states are linked. NAM was launched on 14 April 2016 with 21 mandis from 8 States joining it and the first phase of connecting 250 mandis was over on 6 October 2016.\nNAM is implemented as a\u00a0Centrally Sponsored Scheme\u00a0through Agri-Tech Infrastructure Fund (ATIF). The\u00a0Department of Agriculture & Cooperation\u00a0(DAC), Ministry of Agriculture will set it up through the\u00a0Small Farmers Agribusiness Consortium\u00a0(SFAC).\nAGMARKNET\nThe Agricultural Marketing Information Network (AGMARKNET) was launched in 2000 by the Union Ministry of Agriculture.\nThis e-governance portal AGMARKNET, implemented by National Informatics Centre (NIC), facilitates the generation and transmission of prices, commodity arrival information from agricultural produce markets, and web-based dissemination to producers, consumers, traders, and policymakers transparently and quickly.\ne-choupal\nAn initiative by ITC provides alternative marketing channels, information on weather, agricultural practices, input sales, etc.\nIt is a kiosk located in a village and equipped with computer and internet access, which is managed by a trained sanchalak.\nDirect benefit transfer (DBT) Central Agri Portal\nLaunched in 2013, the DBT Agri Portal is a unified central portal for agricultural schemes across the country\nThe portal helps farmers adopt modern farm machinery through government subsidies.\nVillage Resource Centres\nVillage Resource Centres provide space-based services in rural areas.\nThey are one of the unique initiatives that use the Satellite Communication (SATCOM) network and Earth Observation (EO) satellite data to reach out to the villages to address the needs of the local people in the villages themselves.\nDigital Agriculture Mission\nThe Digital Agriculture Mission (2021\u20132025) aims to support and accelerate projects based on new technologies, like AI, blockchain, remote sensing, and GIS technology, and the use of drones and robots\n\nRead:\u00a0New Schemes for Farmers\n\nUnified Farmer Service Platform (UFSP):\nUFSP is a combination of Core Infrastructure, Data, Applications, and Tools that enable seamless interoperability of various public and private IT systems in the agriculture ecosystem across the country. UFSP is envisaged to play the following role:\nAct as a central agency in the Agri ecosystem (like UPI in the e-Payments)\nEnables Registration of the Service Providers (public and private) and the Farmer Services.\nEnforces various rules and validations required during the service delivery process.\nActs as a Repository of all the applicable standards, APIs (Application Programming Interface), and formats.\nAct as a medium of data exchange amongst various schemes and services to enable comprehensive delivery of services to the farmer\nAgriStack\nThe Ministry of Agriculture and Farmers Welfare has planned to create \u2018AgriStack\u2019 \u2013 a collection of technology-based interventions in agriculture.\nIt will create a unified platform for farmers to provide them with end-to-end services across the agricultural food value chain.\nSandesh Pathak\nThe Sandesh Pathak application was developed jointly by C-DAC Mumbai, IIT-Madras, IIIT Hyderabad, IIT Kharagpur, and C-DAC Thiruvananthapuram will enable SMS messages to be read out loud, for the benefit of farmers who may have difficulty in reading.\nState-level initiatives connected with Electronic Technology and Farmers\n\nThere are many programs in different states which integrates e-technology with agricultural practices. Some of them are:\n\neSagu\neSagu provides personalized expert advice promptly from the sowing stage to harvest for small and marginal farmers at their doorstep.\nThe farm situation is brought to the expert in the form of digital photographs and text information.\nThe expert advice after analyzing the situation is prepared and is delivered to the concerned farmer on the same day or subsequent day.\nSagu means cultivation in the Telugu-local language of Telangana Andhra Pradesh, the region in which the project started.\nAGRISNET\nThe AGRISNET project was conceptualized with the vision of creating an interconnected technology-enabled network to deliver informational services effectively to the farming community.\nThe project aimed to integrate cross-functional processes of the Department of Agriculture in Tamilnadu, to effectively and efficiently communicate informational services to the farming community.\nJio Agri(JioKrishi) Platform\nA pilot project was initiated at Jalna and Nashik, Maharashtra in 2020.\nIt digitizes the agricultural ecosystem along the entire value chain to empower farmers\nThe core function of the platform uses stand-alone application data to provide advisory, the advanced functions use data from various sources, feed the data into AI/ML algorithms, and provide accurate personalized advice.\nConclusion\n\nThe Indian agriculture sector has still not been able to overcome the digital divide that is prevalent for so many years in rural development scenarios. Hence, it is high time to fill the digital gap for farmers.\n\nIt is important to adopt a holistic approach to address the challenges faced by Indian agriculture to achieve inclusive growth and sustainable development.\n\nThe use of e-technology like remote sensing, and GIS, will enable wide-scale adoption of digital agriculture, ease of access and operations, and easy maintenance of systems with supportive government policies."

Read here to understand inclusive growth and the associated challenges with it.\n\nThe concept of inclusive growth has become vital to economic development due to rising economic inequality and its effects on human well-being and prosperity.\n\nOECD defines inclusive growth as economic growth that is distributed fairly across society and creates opportunities for all.\n\nInclusive growth is intended to meet the objectives of inclusiveness and sustainability together. Former President Pranab Mukherjee had mentioned that \u201cInclusive growth should not be a mere slogan but a fundamental driving force for sustainable development.\u201d\n\nInclusive growth focuses on ecologically friendly economic growth which is a necessary and crucial condition for poverty reduction and sustainability.\n\nTable of Contents\n\nFeatures of Inclusive Growth\nElements of Inclusive Growth\nChallenges\nMeasurement of inclusive growth\nIndian efforts for inclusive growth\nWay forward\nFeatures of Inclusive Growth\nLong-term perspective with sustainable growth\nBroad-based and spread across all sectors for economic diversification\nIt must be inclusive of the large labor force concerning market access, resources, and an equal environment for trade and business.\nFocus on ace and pattern of growth\nPotential outcomes are employment generation or income distribution.\nA comprehensive approach that is in line with pro-poor growth.\nElements of Inclusive Growth\n\nSkill development:\n\n\ud83d\udc49 Which year are YOU targeting for success in the IAS/IPS/IFS Exam? \ud83d\ude80\n\n(1) \u21d2 UPSC 2025: Prelims cum Mains\n\n(2) \u21d2 UPSC 2026: Prelims cum Mains\n\n(3) \u21d2 UPSC 2027 Prelims cum Mains\n\nTip: Know more about ClearIAS Courses (Online/Offline)\n\nThe employable population needs vocational training and education for skill development for better output.\nIn India, there is a dearth of highly trained workforce on the one hand and conventionally trained youths are unemployed on the other hand.\n\nFinancial inclusion:\n\nIt means access to financial aid and services for all and affordable especially for vulnerable groups.\nFor inclusive growth and economic development, financial inclusion is crucial.\n\nTechnology:\n\nWith the advent of Industrial Revolution 4.0, advancements in technology can increase and decrease inequality causing urban and rural divide.\nDigital India Mission is an attempt by the government to smoothen the divide by increasing digital literacy.\nTechnology can have a positive impact on other areas like agriculture, manufacturing, education, health, and governance by transforming how each sector functions.\n\nEconomic growth:\n\nAs one of the fastest-growing economies in the world, India has to focus more on inclusive growth for overall economic development.\n\nSocial development:\n\nIt is another important aspect of inclusive growth as it targets the marginalized and vulnerable sections of the population.\nInvesting in social structures for providing services for the marginalized sections will create capable future generations as well boost fiscal growth.\nChallenges\n\nPoverty:\n\nA recent World Bank report published that extreme poverty in India declined by 12.3 % between 2011 and 2019.\nBut India still has a long way to go as poverty is one of the causes and reasons hindering inclusive growth.\nThe global multidimensional poverty index ranked India 66 out of 109 countries.\n\nUnemployment:\n\nUnemployment among the educated urban youth has increased alarmingly, especially after the Covid-19 pandemic.\nThe workforce is mostly employed in informal sectors with no social security.\nNow, the gig economy is taking over the employment market. Though it provides more opportunities to people, it still lacks social security for the employed.\n\nUrban and rural divide:\n\nRural India is facing agricultural backwardness majorly due to declining per capita land availability and yield due to climate change, land degradation, etc.\nThere are significant regional and social disparities between the urban and rural populations and the divide was widened by digital advancement as well.\n\nSocial issues:\n\nSocial issues like gender disparity, caste system, and religious disparity are also causing hindrance to inclusive growth.\nMalnutrition among children is another worry affecting the future of the country.\nMeasurement of inclusive growth\n\nInclusive Development Index (IDI)\n\nThe Inclusive Development Index (IDI) was compiled by the World Economic Forum (WEF).\nThe IDI is based on the idea that most people base their country\u2019s growth not on GDP but on their standard of living.\nIt gives a measure of inequality based on three parameters: Growth and development, Inclusion, and Inter-generational equity and sustainability.\n\nSocial Progress Index (SPI)\n\nIt is an aggregate index of social and environmental indicators that includes- Basic human needs, Foundation of well-being, and Opportunities.\nSPI measures the outcomes of the government measures rather than money spent. It also takes into account of efficiency with which money spent by the government has been used.\nIt is more comprehensive.\n\nGlobal Slavery Index\n\nIt is released by the Walk Free Foundation of Australia.\nModern Slavery means a situation where one person has taken away another person\u2019s freedom, to control their body so that they can be exploited.\nFactors responsible for modern slavery are the absence of rights, Lack of physical safety, Access to necessities such as health care, education, food, etc, and Pattern of migration.\nIndian efforts for inclusive growth\n\nThe government of India has come forth with multiple schemes that address inclusive growth:\n\nMahatma Gandhi National Rural Employment Guarantee Act Scheme (MGNREGA): MGNREGA also known as Mahatma Gandhi National Rural Employment Guarantee Scheme (MNREGS) is Indian legislation enacted on August 25, 2005. The MGNREGA provides a legal guarantee for one hundred days of employment in every financial year to adult members of any rural household willing to do public work-related unskilled manual work at the statutory minimum wage. The\u00a0Ministry of Rural Development\u00a0(MRD), Govt of India is monitoring the entire implementation of this scheme in association with state governments\n\nPrime Minister\u2019s Employment Generation Programme (PMEGP): The scheme is implemented by the Khadi and Village Industries Commission (KVIC) functioning as the nodal agency at the national level. At the state level, the scheme is implemented through State KVIC Directorates, State Khadi and Village Industries Boards (KVIBs), District Industries Centres (DICs), and banks. In such cases, KVIC routes government subsidies through designated banks for eventual disbursal to the beneficiaries/entrepreneurs directly into their bank accounts.\n\nMudra Bank scheme: Pradhan Mantri MUDRA Yojana (PMMY) is a scheme launched in 2015 for providing loans up to 10 lakh to the non-corporate, non-farm small/micro-enterprises. These loans are classified as MUDRA loans under PMMY. These loans are given by Commercial Banks, RRBs, Small Finance Banks, MFIs, and NBFCs.\n\nPt. Deen Dayal Upadhyaya Grameen Kaushalya Yojana (DDU-GKY): It aims to skill rural youth who are poor and provide them with jobs having regular monthly wages or above the minimum wages. It is one of the clusters of initiatives of the Ministry of Rural Development, Government of India that seeks to promote rural livelihoods. It is a part of the\u00a0National Rural Livelihood Mission\u00a0(NRLM) \u2013 the Mission for poverty reduction called\u00a0Aajeevika. The scheme will benefit more than 55 million poor rural youth who are ready to be skilled by providing sustainable employment.\n\nThis scheme derives importance from its potential to reduce poverty. It is also designed to be a major contributor to the Prime Minister\u2019s \u2018Make in India\u2018 campaign.\n\nDeendayal Antyodaya Yojana- National Urban Livelihoods Mission (DAY-NULM): The mission would aim at providing shelters equipped with essential services to the urban homeless in a phased manner. In addition, the mission would also address the livelihood concerns of the urban street vendors by facilitating access to suitable spaces, institutional credit, social security, and skills to the urban street vendors for accessing emerging market opportunities.\n\nSarva Shiksha Abhiyan (SSA): Sarva Shiksha Abhiyan (SSA) is the Government of India\u2019s flagship program for the achievement of Universalization of Elementary Education (UEE) in a time-bound manner, as mandated by the 86th amendment to the Constitution of India making free and compulsory Education to the Children of 6-14 years age group, a Fundamental Right.\n\nNational Rural Health Mission (NRHM): The National Rural Health Mission (NRHM) was launched in 2005, to provide accessible, affordable, and quality health care to the rural population, especially the vulnerable groups.\n\nSwachh Bharat Mission: To ensure that open defecation-free behavior is sustained, no one is left behind, and that solid and liquid waste management facilities are accessible, the Mission is moving towards the next Phase II of SBMG i.e. ODF-Plus. ODF Plus activities under Phase II of the Swachh Bharat Mission (Grameen) will reinforce ODF behaviors and focus on providing interventions for the safe management of solid and liquid waste in villages.\n\nMission Ayushman: The Ayushman Bharat Digital Mission (ABDM) aims to develop the backbone necessary to support the integrated digital health infrastructure of the country. It will bridge the existing gap among different stakeholders of the Healthcare ecosystem through digital highways.\n\nPradhan Mantri Jan Dhan Yojana: PMJDY is the National Mission for Financial Inclusion to ensure access to financial services, namely, basic savings & deposit accounts, remittance, credit, insurance, and pension in an affordable manner. Under the scheme, a basic savings bank deposit (BSBD) account can be opened in any bank branch or Business Correspondent (Bank Mitra) outlet, by persons not having any other account.\n\nDISHA Project is being implemented in partnership with UNDP to create employment and entrepreneurship opportunities for women in India.\n\nRead:\u00a0PM SVANidhi Scheme\n\nWay forward\n\nIndia\u2019s economic growth has not been well reflected in the real-time development on the ground which pushes back the aim to achieve complete inclusive growth. More steps need to be taken to make inclusive growth the target of development.\n\nIssues like social and regional disparity, rural and urban divide, malnutrition, poverty, etc, are being addressed via various schemes and projects but need more impetus.\n\nThe 2008 financial crisis was a dramatic wake-up call. Growth as we know it doesn\u2019t work for all and is putting everyone\u2019s well-being at risk. We need to develop new and improved models and focus on ensuring growth improves lives.\n\nPeople would feel more motivated and involved if the benefits of economic growth were not allowed to flow into the pockets of a rich minority. This can be achieved by a few simpler steps like-\n\nMaking our tax systems fairer and more effective\nEnsuring people can earn the wages they need to thrive\nCreating a business environment that attracts new firms and boosts communities\n\nOn a global scale, some social groups and territories, even in rich countries, have been left out for decades and need support. With the right policies and investments in essential public services, we can build more cohesive societies and bridge the divides that threaten our future prosperity.\n\nMost importantly, we need to anticipate the radical changes induced by globalization, digitalization, and demographic shift and target them by answering questions like:\n\nHow can we build the skills of tomorrow\u2019s workforce?\nHow can we support risk-taking and entrepreneurship while safeguarding job quality, collective bargaining, and social protection?\nHow do we integrate the growing number of migrants to enhance solidarity, performance, and cohesion in our societies?\n\nIn the end, inclusive growth has to start from the grassroots level, hence targeting the basic issues is key. Nowadays, large numbers of people are losing faith in their institutions. This trend can be reversed if public authorities demonstrate the highest standards of integrity and efficiency in their work, and promote more transparency and public participation.\n\nAlso read:\u00a0Rights of Persons with Disabilities; Corporate driven Inequality\n\n\u00a0"

            "[CONTENT]": "Ways and means advances are a loan facility provided by RBI which is often in news. Read here to know more about this economic concept.\n\nGiven the improvement in the pandemic situation, the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) decided to reduce the Ways and Means Advances (WMA) for States and Union Territories (UTs) to \u20b947,010 crores from \u20b951,560 crores.\n\nConsidering the uncertainties related to COVID-19, the RBI had raised the WMA limit to \u20b951,560 crores for all States. The higher WMA was applicable till March 31, 2022.\n\nTable of Contents\n\nHow the central government meets the temporary cash needs?\nWhat are Ways and means advances (WMA)?\nTypes of Ways and Means Advances:\nWMA Limits:\nSignificance of WMA scheme\nConcerns against Ways and Means Advances scheme\nConclusion\nProbable question:\nHow the central government meets the temporary cash needs?\n\nThe fund deficit or cash-flow mismatches of the Government are largely managed through:\n\nIssuance of\u00a0Treasury Bills,\nGetting temporary loans from the RBI called Ways and Means Advances (WMA) and;\nIssuance of\u00a0Cash Management Bills.\nWhat are Ways and means advances (WMA)?\n\nWays and means advances are special features of the Indian economy. WMA are temporary advances given by the RBI to the centre and state governments to tide over any mismatch in receipts and payments.\n\nIt was introduced in 1997 and comes under Section 17(5) of the RBI Act of 1934.\nIt was introduced to end the four-decade-old system of ad-hoc treasury bills to finance the central government deficit.\n\nStates and centre pay interest linked to the repo rate on WMA withdrawals.\n\n\ud83d\udc49 Which year are YOU targeting for success in the IAS/IPS/IFS Exam? \ud83d\ude80\n\n(1) \u21d2 UPSC 2025: Prelims cum Mains\n\n(2) \u21d2 UPSC 2026: Prelims cum Mains\n\n(3) \u21d2 UPSC 2027 Prelims cum Mains\n\nTip: Know more about ClearIAS Courses (Online/Offline)\n\nThe government can avail of immediate cash from the RBI is required. But it has to return the amount within 90 days. Interest is charged at the existing repo rate.\n\nIf the WMA exceeds 90 days, it would be treated as an overdraft (the interest rate on overdrafts is 2 percentage points more than the repo rate).\n\nWMA is not part of the Fiscal Responsibility and Budget Management Act (FRBM) because they get paid within the year itself.\n\nTypes of Ways and Means Advances:\n\nThere are two types of WMAs- normal and special.\n\nNormal WMAs are clean advances special WMA are secured advances provided against the pledge of the Government of India dated securities.\n\nThe number of loans under normal WMA is based on a three-year average of actual revenue and capital expenditure of the state.\n\nSpecial WMA is also called Special drawing rights (SDF) and is provided against the collateral of government securities held by the state.\n\nThe operative limit for special WMA for a State is subject to its holdings of Central Government dated securities up to a maximum of the limit sanctioned.\nThe interest rate for SDF is one percentage point less than the repo rate.\nAfter the state has exhausted the limit, it gets normal WMA.\nWMA Limits:\n\nThe limits for Ways and Means Advances are decided by the government and RBI mutually and revised periodically.\n\nThere is a state-wise limit for the funds that can be availed via WMA which depends on factors like total expenditure, revenue deficit, and fiscal position of the state.\n\nAnother factor that will add to the SDF loan limit of the state government is the incremental investment in Consolidated Sinking Fund (CSF) /Guarantee Redemption Fund (GRF).\n\nIn addition to WMA, the Overdraft facility is also provided whenever financial accommodation to a state exceeds its SDF and WMA limits.\n\nThe withdrawal above the WMA limit is considered an overdraft. A State Government account can be in overdraft for a maximum of 14 consecutive working days with a limit of 36 days in a quarter.\nGenerally, the interest rate for overdraft is repo plus 2% given that it comes under the WMA limit.\nSignificance of WMA scheme\n\nThere are times of economic stress on governments, especially in situations like the Covid-19 pandemic. Ways and means advances are a scheme that relieves the financial stress on the government in the worst times.\n\nAs frontline fighters against Covid-19, many States needed immediate and large financial resources to deal with challenges, including medical testing, screening, and providing income and food security to the needy.\n\nWhen tax receipts are unpredictable owing to adverse economic conditions, the increased WMA limit allows states to borrow short-term cash from the RBI, providing a financial cushion.\n\nThe increased override limit of WMA enables states to borrow money from RBI on a short-term basis if the states are facing a budget deficit.\n\nWMA funding is cheaper than borrowings from markets or other schemes because it has a longer maturity date, and its interest rate is also lower.\n\nWMA can be an alternative to raising longer-tenure funds from the markets, issuing State government securities (State development loans), or borrowing from financial institutions for short-term funding.\n\nConcerns against Ways and Means Advances scheme\n\nSome states voiced concerns that increasing WMA limits would not be sufficient and demanded a moratorium on loans and interest for nine months.\n\nFew states also complained about the short window to repay (90 days).\n\nThe WMA window is intended only to tide over temporary mismatches in the cash flow of receipts and payments.\n\nConclusion\n\nWays and Means advances are meant to pass over temporary mismatches in the cash flow of receipts and payments and are not a source of permanent financial relief. It provides leverage for both the centre and the states to borrow from the RBI and it, therefore, helps to meet the receipts and payments of the government.\n\nProbable question:\n\nConsider the following statements regarding Ways and Means Advances:\n1. It is a long-term loan facility for the government with RBI.\n2. The facility is exclusive to the Union Government.\n3. RBI charges interest equal to the repo rate on loans given under WMA.\n\nWhich of the above statements is/are correct?\n\na) 1 and 2 only\n\nb) 2 and 3 only\n\nc)\u00a0 3 only\n\nd) None of the above"

OECD has issued\u00a015 action\u00a0items\u00a0to address this.\nChallenges:\n\nIt impinges on the right of the sovereign to decide a nation\u2019s tax policy. A global minimum rate would essentially take away the ways that countries use to push policies that suit them.\n\nThe time frame for implementing the laws by 2022 so that they can take effect from 2023 is a difficult task for the countries.\n\nThe deal has also been criticized for lacking effectiveness; groups such as Oxfam said the deal would not put an end to tax havens."

For example, Public Sector Enterprises like LIC.\n\nThe National Monetisation Pipeline (NMP) estimates an aggregate monetization potential of Rs 6 lakh crores through core assets of the Central Government, over a period of four years from FY 2022 to FY 2025.\n\nTable of Contents\n\nWhat is National Monetisation Pipeline (NMP)?\nNMP as a part of Divestment Policy\nNMP vs NIP\nWhat is Monetisation?\nGreenfield Project:\nBrownfield Project:\nChallenges for implementing National Monetisation Pipeline\nWay Forward\nWhat is National Monetisation Pipeline (NMP)?\n\nNITI Aayog has developed the pipeline, in consultation with infrastructure line ministries, based on the mandate for \u2018Asset Monetisation\u2019 under Union Budget 2021-22.\n\nIt\u00a0aims to unlock value in brownfield projects by engaging the private sector.\n\nThe revenue rights will be transferred to them but not ownership in the projects.

The term is used for purchasing or leasing existing production facilities to launch a new production activity.\n\nChallenges for implementing National Monetisation Pipeline\nDeficiency of identified revenue-generating ways in various assets, hence investment in them may end up in losses.\nThe slow pace of privatization in government companies including Air India and BPCL.\nThe recently launched PPP initiative in railways indicates a lack of private investors\u2019 interest.\nCapacity utilization in gas and petroleum pipeline networks is not up to the mark and has a lot of untapped potentials.\nPower sector assets come with regulated tariffs making them less viable for private players.\nNational highways below four lanes do not attract investors.\nMany assets like railways have multiple stakeholders, including state governments, which own a stake in the entity.\nWay Forward\n\nThe National Monetisation Pipeline framework on paper looks very promising, but the government should ensure proper execution to derive desired outcomes.\n\nThere is a need for an efficient dispute resolution mechanism, which is one of the key aspects of such a wide-ranged plan.\n\nThe success of the infrastructure expansion plan would depend on other stakeholders playing their due role; hence all the strata should be duly considered and be given opportunities.\n\nThe State governments and their public sector enterprises and the private sectors should be able to work together through healthy competition.\n\nA high-Powered Intergovernmental Group can be set up as recommended in the 15th finance commission to re-examine the fiscal responsibility legislation of the Centre and States."

Read to know about the Economic Survey 2021-22 highlights.\n\nEconomic Survey is the flagship annual document of the Ministry of finance \u2013 released usually a day before the Budget for the next year is presented in the Indian Parliament.\n\nEconomic Survey gives a detailed account of the various sectors of the economy and overall economic scenario of the country in the past years and provides an outline for the year ahead.\n\nThe Economic Survey, even though a government document, provides an opportunity for the Chief Economic Adviser to provide a disinterested, economic objective analysis.\n\nTable of Contents\n\nWhat is the theme of Economic Survey 2021-22?\nWhat is the Agile approach mentioned in the Economic Survey 2021?\nEconomic Survey 2021-22: Highlights\nState of the Economy\nFiscal Developments\nExternal Sectors\nMonetary Management and Financial Intermediation\nPrices and Inflation\nSustainable Development and Climate Change\nAgriculture and Food Management\nIndustry and Infrastructure\nServices\nSocial Infrastructure and Employment\nEconomic Survey 2021-22 Summary\nWhat is the theme of Economic Survey 2021-22?\n\nThe central theme of this year\u2019s Economic Survey is the \u201cAgile approach\u201d, implemented through India\u2019s economic response to the COVID-19 Pandemic shock.\n\nAnother theme highlighted in this Economic Survey relates to the art and science of policy-making under conditions of extreme uncertainty.\n\nWhat is the Agile approach mentioned in the Economic Survey 2021?\n\nAs per the Agile approach, short-term policy responses can be tailored to an evolving situation rather than what a model may have predicted.\n\n\ud83d\udc49 Which year are YOU targeting for success in the IAS/IPS/IFS Exam? \ud83d\ude80\n\n(1) \u21d2 UPSC 2025: Prelims cum Mains\n\n(2) \u21d2 UPSC 2026: Prelims cum Mains\n\n(3) \u21d2 UPSC 2027 Prelims cum Mains\n\nTip: Know more about ClearIAS Courses (Online/Offline)\n\nThe short-term policy response is possible because of the explosion of real-time data that allows for constant monitoring. Such information includes GST collections, digital payments, satellite photographs, electricity production, cargo movements, internal/external trade, infrastructure roll-out, delivery of various schemes, mobility indicators etc.\n\nThe \u201cAgile approach\u201d is based on feedback loops, real-time monitoring of actual outcomes, flexible responses, safety-net buffers and so on.\n\nPlanning is not done in the Agile approach as a deterministic prediction of the flow of events. Still, planning is relevant in the framework \u2013 mostly for scenario analysis, identifying vulnerable sections, and understanding policy options.\n\nEconomic Survey 2021-22: Highlights\n\nEconomic Survey 2021-22 reverts to a single volume plus a separate volume for the Statistical Appendix.\n\nThe highlights of the Economic Survey are as follows:\n\nState of the Economy\nEconomic Survey 2021-22 estimates that the Indian economy (GDP) may grow by 9.2 per cent in real terms in 2021-22 (as per first advanced estimates) subsequent to a contraction of 7.3 per cent in 2020-21.\nGDP is projected to grow by 8- 8.5 per cent in real terms in 2022-23.\nThe year ahead is poised for a pickup in private sector investment with the financial system in a good position to provide support for the economy\u2019s revival.\nProjection is comparable with World Bank and Asian Development Bank\u2019s latest forecasts of real GDP growth of 8.7 per cent and 7.5 per cent respectively for 2022-23.\nAs per IMF\u2019s latest World Economic Outlook projections, India\u2019s real GDP is projected to grow at 9 per cent in 2021-22 and 2022-23 and at 7.1 per cent in 2023-2024, which would make India the fastest-growing major economy in the world for all 3years.\nAgriculture and allied sectors are expected to grow by 3.9 per cent; industry by 11.8 per cent and services sector by 8.2 per cent in 2021-22.\nOn the demand side, consumption is estimated to grow by 7.0 per cent, Gross Fixed Capital Formation (GFCF) by 15 per cent, exports by 16.5 per cent and imports by 29.4 per cent in 2021-22.\nMacroeconomic stability indicators suggest that the Indian Economy is well placed to take on the challenges of 2022-23.\nA combination of high foreign exchange reserves, sustained foreign direct investment, and rising export earnings will provide an adequate buffer against possible global liquidity tapering in 2022-23.\nThe economic impact of the \u201csecond wave\u201d was much smaller than that during the full lockdown phase in 2020-21, though the health impact was more severe.\nGovernment of India\u2019s unique response comprised of safety-nets to cushion the impact on vulnerable sections of society and the business sector, significant increase in capital expenditure to spur growth and supply-side reforms for a sustained long-term expansion.\nThe government\u2019s flexible and multi-layered response is partly based on an \u201cAgile\u201d framework that uses feedback-loops, and the use of eighty High-Frequency Indicators (HFIs) in an environment of extreme uncertainty.\nFiscal Developments\nEconomic Survey 2021-22 observes that the revenue receipts from the Central Government (April to November 2021) have gone up by 67.2 per cent (YoY) as against the expected growth of 9.6 per cent in the 2021-22 Budget Estimates (over 2020-21 Provisional Actuals).\nGross Tax Revenue registers a growth of over 50 per cent from April to November 2021 in YoY terms.\u00a0 This performance is strong compared to pre-pandemic levels of 2019-2020 also.\nDuring April-November 2021, Capex has grown by 13.5 per cent (YoY) with a focus on infrastructure-intensive sectors.\nSustained revenue collection and a targeted expenditure policy have contained the fiscal deficit for April to November 2021 at 46.2 per cent of BE.\nWith the enhanced borrowings on account of COVID-19, the Central Government debt has gone up from 49.1 per cent of GDP in 2019-20 to 59.3 per cent of GDP in 2020-21 but is expected to follow a declining trajectory with the recovery of the economy.\nExternal Sectors\nIndia\u2019s merchandise exports and imports rebounded strongly and surpassed pre-COVID levels during the current financial year.\nThere was a significant pickup in net services with both receipts and payments crossing the pre-pandemic levels, despite weak tourism revenues.\nNet capital flows were higher at US$ 65.6 billion in the first half of 2021-22, on account of continued inflow of foreign investment, revival in net external commercial borrowings, higher banking capital and additional special drawing rights (SDR) allocation.\nIndia\u2019s external debt rose to US $ 593.1 billion at the end-September 2021, from US $ 556.8 billion a year earlier, reflecting additional SDR allocation by IMF, coupled with higher commercial borrowings.\nForeign Exchange Reserves crossed US$ 600 billion in the first half of 2021-22 and touched US $ 633.6 billion as of December 31, 2021.\nAs of end-November 2021, India was the fourth-largest forex reserves holder in the world after China, Japan and Switzerland.\nMonetary Management and Financial Intermediation\nEconomic Survey 2021-22 notes that the liquidity in the system remained in surplus.\nRepo rate was maintained at 4 per cent in 2021-22.\nRBI undertook various measures such as G-Sec Acquisition Programme and Special Long-Term Repo Operations to provide further liquidity.\nThe economic shock of the pandemic has been weathered well by the commercial banking system:\nYoY Bank credit growth accelerated gradually in 2021-22 from 5.3 per cent in April 2021 to 9.2 per cent as of 31st\u00a0December 2021.\nThe Gross Non-Performing Advances ratio of Scheduled Commercial Banks (SCBs) declined from 11.2 per cent at the end of 2017-18 to 6.9 per cent at the end of September 2021.\nNet Non-Performing Advances ratio declined from 6 per cent to 2.2 per cent during the same period.\nThe capital to risk-weighted asset ratio of SCBs continued to increase from 13 per cent in 2013-14 to 16.54 per cent at the end of September 2021.\nThe Return on Assets and Return on Equity for Public Sector Banks continued to be positive for the period ending September 2021.\nExceptional year for the capital markets:\nRs. 89,066 crores were raised via 75 Initial Public Offering (IPO) issues in April-November 2021, which is much higher than in any year in the last decade.\nSensex and Nifty scaled up to a touching peak at 61,766 and 18,477 on October 18, 2021.\nAmong major emerging market economies, Indian markets outperformed peers in April-December 2021.\nPrices and Inflation\nThe average headline CPI-Combined inflation moderated to 5.2 per cent in 2021-22 (April-December) from 6.6 per cent in the corresponding period of 2020-21.\nThe decline in retail inflation was led by the easing of food inflation.\nFood inflation averaged at a low of 2.9 per cent in 2021-22 (April to December) as against 9.1 per cent in the corresponding period last year.\nEffective supply-side management kept prices of most essential commodities under control during the year.\nProactive measures were taken to contain the price rise in pulses and edible oils.\nReduction in central excise and subsequent cuts in Value Added Tax by most States helped ease petrol and diesel prices.\nWholesale inflation based on the Wholesale Price Index (WPI) rose to 12.5 per cent during 2021-22 (April to December).\n\u00a0This has been attributed to:\nLow base in the previous year,\nPick-up in economic activity,\nA sharp increase in international prices of crude oil and other imported inputs, and\nHigh freight costs.\nThe divergence between CPI-C and WPI Inflation:\nThe divergence peaked at 9.6 percentage points in May 2020.\nHowever, this year there was a reversal in divergence with retail inflation falling below wholesale inflation by 8.0 percentage points in December 2021.\nThis divergence can be explained by factors such as:\nVariations due to base effect,\nThe difference in scope and coverage of the two indices,\nPrice collections,\nItems covered,\nThe difference in commodity weights, and\nWPI is more sensitive to cost-push inflation led by imported inputs.\nWith the gradual waning of the base effect in WPI, the divergence in CPI-C and WPI is also expected to narrow down.\nSustainable Development and Climate Change\n\nIndia\u2019s overall score on the NITI Aayog SDG India Index and Dashboard improved to 66 in 2020-21 from 60 in 2019-20 and 57 in 2018-19.\n\nThe number of Front Runners (scoring 65-99) increased to 22 States and UTs in 2020-21 from 10 in 2019-20.\n\nIn North-East India, 64 districts were Front Runners and 39 districts were Performers in the NITI Aayog North-Eastern Region District SDG Index 2021-22.\n\nIndia has the tenth largest forest area in the world.\n\nIn 2020, India ranked third globally in increasing its forest area from 2010 to 2020.\n\nIn 2020, the forests covered 24% of India\u2019s total geographical, accounting for 2% of the world\u2019s total forest area.\n\nIn August 2021, the Plastic Waste Management Amendment Rules, 2021, was notified which is aimed at phasing out single-use plastic by 2022.\n\nDraft regulation on Extended Producer Responsibility for plastic packaging was notified.\n\nThe Compliance status of Grossly Polluting Industries (GPIs) located in the Ganga main stem and its tributaries improved from 39% in 2017 to 81% in 2020.\n\nThe consequent reduction in effluent discharge has been from 349.13 million litres per day (MLD) in 2017 to 280.20 MLD in 2020.\n\nThe Prime Minister, as a part of the national statement delivered at the 26th\u00a0Conference of Parties (COP 26) in Glasgow in November 2021, announced ambitious targets to be achieved by 2030 to enable further reduction in emissions.\n\nThe need to start the one-word movement \u2018LIFE\u2019 (Lifestyle for Environment) urging mindful and deliberate utilization instead of mindless and destructive consumption was underlined.\n\nAgriculture and Food Management\n\nThe Agriculture sector experienced buoyant growth in the past two years, accounting for a sizeable 18.8% (2021-22) in Gross Value Added (GVA) of the country registering a growth of 3.6%

Situation Assessment Survey (SAS) compared to the SAS Report of 2014.\n\nAllied sectors including animal husbandry, dairying and fisheries are steadily emerging to be high growth sectors and major drivers of overall growth in the agriculture sector.\n\nThe Livestock sector has grown at a CAGR of 8.15% over the last five years ending 2019-20. It has been a stable source of income across groups of agricultural households accounting for about 15% of their average monthly income.\n\nGovernment facilitates food processing through various measures of infrastructure development, subsidized transportation and support for the formalization of micro food enterprises.\n\nIndia runs one of the largest food management programmes in the world.\n\nThe government has further extended the coverage of food security networks through schemes like PM Gareeb Kalyan Yojana (PMGKY).\n\nIndustry and Infrastructure\nIndex of Industrial Production (IIP) grew at 17.4 per cent (YoY) during April-November 2021 as compared to (-)15.3 per cent in April-November 2020.\nCapital expenditure for the Indian railways has increased to Rs. 155,181 crores in 2020-21 from an average annual of Rs. 45,980 crores during 2009-14 and it has been budgeted to further increase to Rs. 215,058 crores in 2021-22 \u2013 a five times increase in comparison to the 2014 level.\nThe extent of road construction per day increased substantially in 2020-21 to 36.5 Kms per day from 28 Kms per day in 2019-20 \u2013 a rise of 30.4 per cent.\nNet profit to sales ratio of large corporates reached an all-time high of 10.6 per cent in the July-September quarter of 2021-22 despite the pandemic (RBI Study).\nIntroduction of Production Linked Incentive (PLI) scheme, the major boost provided to infrastructure-both physical as well as digital, along with measures to reduce transaction costs and improve ease of doing business, would support the pace of recovery.\nServices\nGVA of services crossed pre-pandemic level in July-September quarter of 2021-22; however, GVA of contact intensive sectors like trade, transport, etc. still remain below pre-pandemic level.\nOverall service Sector GVA is expected to grow by 8.2 per cent in 2021-22.\nDuring April-December 2021, rail freight crossed its pre-pandemic level while air freight and port traffic almost reached their pre-pandemic levels, domestic air and rail passenger traffic are increasing gradually \u2013 shows the impact of the second wave was much more muted as compared to during the first wave.\nDuring the first half of 2021-22, the service sector received over US$ 16.7 billion FDI \u2013 accounting for almost 54 per cent of total FDI inflows into India.\nIT-BPM services revenue reached US$ 194 billion in 2020-21, adding 1.38 lakh employees during the same period.\nMajor government reforms include removing telecom regulations in the IT-BPO sector and opening up of space sector to private players.\nServices exports surpassed the pre-pandemic level in the January-March quarter of 2020-21 and grew by 21.6 per cent in the first half of 2021-22 \u2013 strengthened by global demand for software and IT services exports.\nIndia has become 3rd largest start-up ecosystem in the world after US and China.

These banks are owned and controlled by the members, who democratically elect a board of directors.\nProfit Allocation: A significant part of the yearly profit, benefits, or surplus is usually allocated to constitute reserves and a part of this profit can also be distributed to the cooperative members, with legal and statutory limitations.\nFinancial Inclusion: They have played a significant role in the financial inclusion of unbanked rural masses. They provide cheap credit to the masses in rural areas.\nWhat are Urban Cooperative banks (UCB)?\n\nThe term Urban Cooperative Banks (UCBs) is not formally defined but refers to primary cooperative banks located in urban and semi-urban areas.\n\nThe Urban Cooperative Banks (UCBs), the Primary Agricultural Credit Societies (PACS), the Regional Rural Banks (RRBs), and Local Area Banks (LABs) could be considered as differentiated banks as they operate in localized areas.\n\nTill 1996, these banks were allowed to lend money only for non-agricultural purposes. This distinction does not hold today.\n\nThese banks were traditionally centred on communities and local workgroups as they essentially lent to small borrowers and businesses. Today, their scope of operations has widened considerably.\n\nHistory of Urban Cooperative Banks\n\nThe inspiration for UCB was the success of the experiments related to the cooperative movement in Britain and the cooperative credit movement in Germany. The origins of the urban cooperative banking movement in India can be traced back to the 19th century when such societies were first set up in India.\n\nCooperative societies are based on the principles of cooperation, mutual help, democratic decision-making, and open membership. Cooperatives represented a new and alternative approach to organization as against proprietary firms, partnership firms, and joint-stock companies which represent the dominant form of commercial organization.\n\nThe first known mutual aid society in India was the \u2018Anyonya Sahakari Mandali\u2019 organized in the erstwhile princely State of Baroda in 1889 under the guidance of Vithal Laxman also known as Bhausaheb Kavthekar.\n\nThe enactment of the Cooperative Credit Societies Act, 1904 gave the real impetus to the movement. The first urban cooperative credit society was registered in Canjeevaram (Kanjivaram) in the erstwhile Madras province in October 1904.\n\nThe most prominent amongst the early credit societies was the Bombay Urban Co-operative Credit Society, sponsored by Vithaldas Thackersey and Lallubhai Samaldas established on January 23, 1906.\n\nThe Maclagan Committee of 1915 was appointed to review their performance and suggest measures for strengthening them. The committee observed that such institutions were suited to cater to the needs of the lower and middle-income classes of society and would encourage the principles of banking amongst the middle classes.\n\nThe Government of India Act in 1919 transferred the subject of \u201cCooperation\u201d from the Government of India to the Provincial Governments.\n\nThe Cooperative Planning Committee (1946) and The Rural Banking Enquiry Committee (1950) recommended the establishment of such banks even in places smaller than taluka towns.\n\nThe first study of Urban Cooperative Banks was taken up by RBI in 1958-59. The Report published in 1961 acknowledged the widespread and financially sound framework of urban cooperative banks and emphasized the need to establish primary urban cooperative banks in new centers and suggested that State Governments lend active support to their development.\n\nRecent developments related to UCB\n\nIn January 2020, the RBI\u00a0revised the Supervisory action Framework (SAF) for UCBs.\n\nIn June 2020, the Central government approved an Ordinance to bring all urban and multi-state cooperative banks under the direct supervision of RBI.\n\nMost recently RBI appointed a committee that suggested 4 tier structure for the UCBs.\n\nTier 1 with all unit UCBs and salary earner\u2019s UCBs (irrespective of deposit size) and all other UCBs having deposits up to Rs 100 crore,\nTier 2 with UCBs of deposits between Rs 100 crore and Rs 1,000 crore,\nTier 3 with UCBs of deposits between Rs 1,000 crore and Rs 10,000 crore and\nTier 4 with UCBs of deposits more than Rs 10,000 crore.\nChallenges faced by cooperative banks:\n1. Changing financial sector trends:\n\nChanges in the financial sector and evolving microfinance, FinTech companies, payment gateways, social platforms, e-commerce companies, and NBFCs challenge the continued presence of the UCBs, which are mostly small in size, lack professional management, and have geographically less diversified operations.\n\n2. The decline in deposits and loans:\n\nThe collapses in the management have led to people losing trust in cooperative banks slowly.\n\n3. Declining contributions:\n\nA report noted that despite a crucial role played by the sector, its share in total agricultural lending diminished considerably over the years from as high as 64% in 1992-93 to just 11.3 % in 2019-20.\n\n4. Declining numbers:\n\nAfter liberalization in licensing policy of 1993, nearly one-third of the newly licensed ones became financially unsound. In 2005, RBI merged the weaker ones together into one unit.\n\n5. Dual control:\n\nThe UCBs were under dual regulation by the state registrar of societies and the RBI. But in 2020, all UCBs and multi-state cooperatives were brought under the supervision of RBI.\n\nWay forward:\n\nThe establishment of the country\u2019s dedicated Ministry of Cooperation is a crucial moment for the history of the cooperative movement.\n\nNow, the establishment of a standard regulatory and supervisory framework, and an umbrella organization, should be given top importance in the advancement of UCBs.\n\nThe RBI is should interpret the Act\u2019s provisions so that they do not disrupt UCBs and people\u2019s faith is restored in the cooperative banking system."

            "[CONTENT]": "What are the Factors of Production? What do you mean by factor income and non-factor income? Read this article to know more.\n\nThe objective of any economy is to produce goods and services.\n\nThe more goods and services a country produces, the more income the country generates.\n\nThen, why can\u2019t we produce more goods and services? What are the requirements for the production of goods and services?\n\nTable of Contents\n\nWhat are the factors of production?\n1. Land (Natural Resources)\n2. Labour (Human Resources)\n3. Physical Capital (Man-made Resources)\n4. Human Capital (Entrepreneurship OR Entrepreneur OR Enterprise)\nIncome Types: Factor Income and Non-Factor Income\nFactor Income\nNon- factor income\nWhy is it not easy to produce more goods and services?\nWhat are the factors of production?\n\nFactors of production are those inputs used in the production process to produce the outputs (finished goods and services).\n\nFactors of production are the resources used by people to produce goods and services.\n\nThere are mainly four factors of production. They are (1) Land (2) Labour (3) Physical Capital and (4) Human Capital.\n\n\ud83d\udc49 Which year are YOU targeting for success in the IAS/IPS/IFS Exam? \ud83d\ude80\n\n(1) \u21d2 UPSC 2025: Prelims cum Mains\n\n(2) \u21d2 UPSC 2026: Prelims cum Mains\n\n(3) \u21d2 UPSC 2027 Prelims cum Mains\n\nTip: Know more about ClearIAS Courses (Online/Offline)\n\nEvery production is organised by combining land, labour, physical capital and human capital, which are known as factors of production.\n\n1. Land (Natural Resources)\n\nThe first factor of production is land.\n\nHowever, in economics, by land, we mean all that is given to us free by nature.\n\nThis includes not just land, but anything that comes from the land.\n\nMost of the natural resources like soil, water, forests, minerals, petroleum, sunlight, wind etc come under the category of land \u2013 the first factor of production.\n\nNote: The income that the owners of the land earn in return for land resources is called rent.\n\n2. Labour (Human Resources)\n\nWhile natural resources are one factor of production, human resources are another.\n\nThe second factor of production\u00a0 \u2013 Labour \u2013 includes all efforts of human beings used for the production of goods and services. Labour include physical and mental labour.\n\nNote: The income earned by labour resources is called wages.\n\n3. Physical Capital (Man-made Resources)\n\nCapital includes all the man-made resources used for producing goods and services like buildings, machines, equipment, vehicles, stock of materials etc.\n\nCapital denotes all tools humans use to produce goods and services. For example, a stethoscope is the capital of a doctor.\n\nPhysical capital can be broadly divided into two categories \u2013 Fixed Capital and Working Capital.\n\nTools, machines, buildings etc that can be used in production over many years are called fixed capital.\n\nRaw materials and money in hand are called working capital. Unlike tools, machines and buildings, these are used up in production.\n\nYou should note here that some economists do not consider money in hand as capital. This is because money merely facilitates trade, but it is not in itself a productive resource. Only if it is a productive resource, it can be considered as capital (fixed capital). It is not money but the capital goods such as machinery and tools bought by the money that are used to produce goods and services.\n\nNote: The income earned by owners of capital resources is interest.\n\n4. Human Capital (Entrepreneurship OR Entrepreneur OR Enterprise)\n\nOnly those with knowledge and entrepreneurial skills will be able to put together land, labour and physical capital and produce an output.\n\nThus the fourth factor of production is entrepreneurship. These days, entrepreneurship (the knowledge and skillset) is also known as Human Capital.\n\nUnless somebody takes an initiative, no business can be started. The one who takes this initiative is termed an entrepreneur.\n\nAn entrepreneur is a person who combines the other factors of production \u2013 land, labour, and capital \u2013 to earn a profit.\n\nThink of the entrepreneurship of Bill Gates, Elon Musk, or Jeff Bezos.\n\nNote: The income accruing to the entrepreneur is termed as profit.\n\nIncome Types: Factor Income and Non-Factor Income\n\nWhat is the meaning of income?\n\nWhat are the types of income?\n\nWe have so far seen that people receive different types of incomes \u2013 rent, wages, interest, and profit.\n\nWe also receive gifts and donations from others without giving anything in return.\n\nAll these incomes can be grouped into two types of incomes \u2013 Factor incomes and Non-factor incomes\n\nFactor Income\n\nA factor income is an income accruing to a factor of production in return for the services rendered to the production unit.\n\nFor example for the services rendered, land receives rent, labour receives wages, capital receives interest, and entrepreneur receives profit.\n\nNon- factor income\n\nThere are certain money receipts that do not involve any sacrifice on the part of their recipients. They are not earned by playing a role as a factor of production \u2013 hence this income has no connection with the production of any goods and services. Such incomes are known as non-factor income.\n\nExamples include\u00a0gifts, donation charities, taxes, fines etc.\n\nNo production activity is involved in getting these incomes.\n\nThese incomes are also called transfer incomes because such income merely represents the transfer of money without any good or service being provided in return for the receipts.\n\nThese incomes are not included in national income.\n\nWhy is it not easy to produce more goods and services?\n\nLet\u2019s try to find the answer to the question we raised at the beginning.\n\nWe have now learned that if we produce more goods and services we earn more income. It can be either as rent, wages, interest, or profit.\n\nThe more income a country generates, the richer it will become.\n\nThen, why nations are not able to increase production? Why is it not easy to increase Gross Domestic Product (GDP)?\n\nIt is not easy to produce more goods are services because factors of production are limited in nature.\n\nYes, goods and services are scarce because the four factors of production (land, labour, capital, and entrepreneurship) are scarce.\n\nOnce we realise this concept, it is easy to understand most of the economic principles.\n\nEconomics is the study of how society allocates these scarce resources (land, labour, capital, and entrepreneurship) to produce output (goods and services).\n\nThe scarce resources \u2013 four factors of production \u2013 land, labour, capital, and entrepreneurship \u2013 form the building blocks of any economy."
