The important and impactful environmental laws and acts are listed and explained below.\n\nThe Wildlife (Protection) Act, 1972\n\nThe\u00a0Act provides for the protection of wild animals, birds, and plants; and for matters connected therewith or ancillary or incidental thereto. It extends to the whole of India.\n\nIt has six schedules that give varying degrees of protection:\n\nSchedule I and Part II of Schedule provide\u00a0absolute protection, offences under these are prescribed the highest penalties.\nSpecies listed in Schedule III\u00a0and\u00a0Schedule IV are also protected, but the penalties are much lower.\nAnimals under Schedule V, e.g. common crows, fruit bats, rats, and mice, are legally considered vermin and may be hunted freely.\nThe specified endemic plants in\u00a0Schedule VI are prohibited from cultivation and planting.\n\nStatutory bodies under WPA:\n\nNational Board for Wildlife and state wildlife advisory boards\nCentral Zoo Authority\nWildlife Crime Control Bureau\nNational Tiger Conservation Authority\nThe Water (Prevention and Control of Pollution) Act, 1974\n\nObjective: To provide prevention and control of water pollution. Maintaining or restoring of wholesomeness and purity of water in the various sources of water.\n\nIt vests regulatory authority in Centre Pollution Control Boards (CPCB) and State Pollution Control Board (SPCB).\n\nCPCB and SPSB are statutory bodies created under the Water Act, of 1974. It empowers CPCB and SPCB to establish and enforce effluent standards for factories discharging pollutants into water bodies.\n\nCPCB performs these same functions for union territories along with formulating policies related to the prevention of water pollution and coordinating activities of different SPSBs.\n\nSPCB controls sewage and industrial effluent discharge by approving, rejecting, and granting consent to discharge.\n\nThe Air (Prevention and Control of Pollution) Act, 1981\n\nThe act aims to control and prevent air pollution in India and its main objectives are:\n\nTo provide for prevention, control, and abatement of air pollution.\nTo provide for the establishment of the boards at the central and state levels to implement the act.\n\nCPCB and SPCB were given the responsibility.\n\nIt states that the sources of air pollution such as internal combustion engines, industry, vehicles, power plants, etc., are not permitted to release particulate matter, lead, carbon monoxide, sulfur dioxide, nitrogen oxide, volatile organic compounds (VOCs), or other toxic substances beyond the predetermined limit.\n\nIt empowers the state government to designate air pollution areas.\n\nThe Environment (Protection) Act, 1986\n\nThis act was passed under Article 253 (legislation for giving effect to international agreements)\n\nThis was passed in the wake of the Bhopal gas tragedy in December 1984.\n\nIt was enacted to achieve the UN conference on the human environment, 1972- Stockholm declaration.\n\nEco-sensitive zones or ecologically fragile areas are notified by MoEFCC under EPA, 1986 \u2013 10 km buffer zones around protected areas.\n\nStatutory bodies under the EPA, 1986:\n\nGenetic Engineering Appraisal Committee\nNational Coastal Zone Management Authority (later converted to National Ganga Council under the Ministry of Jal Sakthi)\nThe ozone-depleting substances (regulation and control) rules, 2000\nIt set deadlines for phasing out of various Ozone Depleting Substances (ODSs) and regulating production, trade import, and export of the product containing ODS.\nThese rules prohibit the use of CFCs, halons, ODSs such as carbon tetrachloride and methyl chloroform, and SFC except in metered-dose inhalers and for other medical purposes.\nCoastal Regulation Zone Notification 2018\n\nIt was notified based on the recommendations of the Shailesh Nayak Committee.\n\nTo promote sustainable development while taking into account the natural hazards such as increasing sea levels due to global warming.\n\nTo conserve and protect biodiversity besides livelihood security to local communities including the fishermen.\n\nCRZs have been classified into 4 zones for regulation:\n\nCRZ I\u2013\u00a0ecologically sensitive areas such\u00a0as mangroves, coral reefs, salt marshes, turtle nesting ground, and the inter-tidal zone.\nCRZ II\u2013\u00a0areas close to the shoreline, and which have been developed.\nCRZ III- Coastal areas that are not substantially built up, including rural coastal areas.\nCRZ IV- water area from Low Tide Line (LTL) to the limit of territorial waters of India.\nThe Energy Conservation Act, 2001\n\nIt was enacted as a step towards improving energy efficiency and reducing wastage. It specifies the energy consumption standards for equipment and appliances.\n\nIt prescribes energy consumption norms and standards for consumers. It prescribes energy conservation building codes for commercial buildings.\n\nThe Bureau of Energy Efficiency (BEE) is a statutory body established under the act.\n\nBiological Diversity Act 2002\n\nIt was implemented to give effect to CBD, Nagoya Protocol.\n\nTo check biopiracy, protect biological diversity, and local growers through a three-tier structure of central and state boards and local committees.\n\nTo set up National Biodiversity Authority (NBA), State Biodiversity Boards (SBBS), and Biodiversity Management Committees (BMCS).\n\nScheduled Tribes and Other Traditional Forest Dwellers (Recognition of Forest Rights) Act, 2006 (FRA)\n\nThe act recognizes and vests the forest rights and occupation in forest land in Forest Dwelling Scheduled Tribes (FDST) and Other Traditional Forest Dwellers (OTFD)\u00a0residing in such forests for generations. This act comes under the aegis of the Ministry of Tribal Affairs.\n\nThe act also establishes the responsibilities and authority for sustainable use, conservation of biodiversity, and maintenance of the ecological balance of FDST and OTFD.\n\nIt strengthens the conservation regime of the forests while ensuring the livelihood and food security of the FDST and OTFD.\n\nIt seeks to rectify colonial injustice to the FDST and OTFD who are integral to the very survival and sustainability of the forest ecosystem.\n\nThe act identifies four types of rights:\n\n1. Title rights\n\nIt gives FDST and OTFD the right to ownership of land farmed by tribals or forest dwellers subject to a maximum of 4 hectares.\n\nOwnership is only for land that is being cultivated by the concerned family and no new lands will be granted.\n\n2. Use rights\n\nThe rights of the dwellers extend to extracting Minor Forest Produce, grazing areas, pastoralist routes, etc.\n\n3. Relief and development rights\n\nTo rehabilitation in case of illegal eviction or forced displacement and basic amenities, subject to restrictions for forest protection\n\n4. Forest management rights\n\nIt includes the right to protect, regenerate conserve, or manage any community forest resource that they have been traditionally protecting and conserving for sustainable use.\n\nTo know more read Forest Rights Act\n\nThe National Green Tribunal Act, 2010\n\nIt was established in concurrence with Rio Summit 1992\u00a0to provide judicial and administrative remedies for the victims of the pollutants and other environmental damage.\n\nIt also agrees with Article 21, the Right to a healthy environment for its citizens of the constitution.\n\nThe NGT has to dispose of the cases presented to it within 6 months of their appeals.\n\nNGT has original jurisdiction on matters related to substantial questions of the environment.\n\nNGT deals with the civil cases under the 7 acts related to the environment:\n\nWater (Prevention And Control Of Pollution) Act, 1974\nWater (Prevention And Control Of Pollution) Cess Act, 1974\nAir (Prevention And Control Of Pollution) Act, 1977\nForest Conservation Act, 1980\nEnvironmental Protection Act, 1986\nPublic Liability Insurance Act 1991\nBiological Diversity Act, 2002\n\n2 acts have been kept out of the jurisdiction of NGT:\n\nWildlife Protection Act, 1972\nScheduled Tribes and Other Traditional Forest Dwellers (Recognition of Forest Rights) Act, 2006 (FRA)\n\nThe decisions of the NGT can be challenged in High Courts and the Supreme Court.\n\nCompensatory Afforestation Fund Act, 2016\n\nThe CAF Act was enacted to manage the funds collected for compensatory afforestation which till then was managed by\u00a0ad hoc Compensatory Afforestation Fund Management and Planning Authority (CAMPA).\n\nCompensatory afforestation means\u00a0that every time forest land is diverted for non-forest purposes such as mining or industry, the user agency pays for planting forests over an equal area of non-forest land, or when such land is not available, twice the area of degraded forest land.\n\nAs per the rules,\u00a090% of the CAF money is to be given to the states while 10% is to be retained by the Centre.\n\nThe funds can be used for the treatment of catchment areas, assisted natural generation, forest management, wildlife protection and management, relocation of villages from protected areas, managing human-wildlife conflicts, training and awareness generation, supply of wood-saving devices, and allied activities.\n\nRead: Environmental Regulatory Bodies\n\nUPSC CSE Previous year questions\n\nPrelims 2021\n\nQ.

The main areas of function are:\n\nScience \u00a0\u2013 the IUCN Red List of Threatened Species\u2122.\nAction \u2013 hundreds of conservation projects all over the world.\nInfluence \u2013 through the collective strength of more than 1,200 government and non-governmental Member organizations.\nHow does IUCN work?\n\nThe\u00a0work is framed by a Global Programme, developed with and approved by IUCN member organisations every four years. The current programme runs from 2012 to 2016.\u00a0IUCN\u2019s Global Programme is coordinated by IUCN\u2019s Secretariat and delivered in conjunction with IUCN member organisations, Commissions and IUCN\u2019s theme-based programmes.\n\nIUCN Red Data Book : Threatened Species classification\n\nThreatened species are any species which are vulnerable to extinction in the near future. International Union for Conservation of Nature treats threatened species not as a single category, but as a group of three categories: vulnerable, endangered, and critically endangered, depending on the degree to which they are threatened.\n\nCritically Endangered Species\n\nCritically Endangered (Cr) is the highest risk category assigned by the IUCN for wild species. Critically endangered species means a species numbers have decreased, or will decrease by 80% within three generations. It is therefore considered to be facing an extremely high risk of extinction in the wild.\n\nEndangered (EN) species\n\nEndangered (EN) species is a population of organisms which is at risk of becoming extinct because it is either few in numbers, or threatened by changing environmental or predation parameters. Also it could mean that due to deforestation there may be a lack of food and/or water. It is therefore considered to be facing a very high risk of extinction in the wild.\n\n\ud83d\udc49 Which year are YOU targeting for success in the IAS/IPS/IFS Exam? \ud83d\ude80\n\n(1) \u21d2 UPSC 2025: Prelims cum Mains\n\n(2) \u21d2 UPSC 2026: Prelims cum Mains\n\n(3) \u21d2 UPSC 2027 Prelims cum Mains\n\nTip: Know more about ClearIAS Courses (Online/Offline)\n\nVulnerable (VU) species\n\nVulnerable (VU) species is a species which has been categorised by the IUCN as likely to become endangered unless the circumstances threatening its survival and reproduction improve. It is therefore considered to be facing a high risk of extinction in the wild.\n\nOther divisions: Extinct, Functionally Extinct and Extinct in the wild\n\nA species becomes extinct when the last existing member of that species dies. Extinction therefore becomes a certainty when there are no surviving individuals that are able to reproduce and create a new generation.\n\nA species may become functionally extinct when only a handful of individuals survive, which are unable to reproduce due to poor health, age, sparse distribution over a large range, a lack of individuals of both sexes (in sexually reproducing species), or other reasons.\n\nAn important aspect of extinction at the present time is human attempts to preserve critically endangered species, which is reflected by the creation of the conservation status \u201cExtinct in the Wild\u201d (EW). Species listed under this status by IUCN are not known to have any living specimens in the wild, and are maintained only in zoos or other artificial environments. Some of these species are functionally extinct; as they are no longer part of their natural habitat and it is unlikely the species will ever be restored to the wild.\n\nAlso read: Climate change and women\n\nReasons for species extinction\n\nMain reasons for extinction are either natural or manmade. Through evolution, new species arise through the process of speciation and species become extinct when they are no longer able to survive in changing conditions or against superior competition. A typical species becomes extinct within 10 million years (1 crore year) of its first appearance although some species, called living fossils, survive virtually unchanged for hundreds of millions of years. Extinction, though, is usually a natural phenomenon; it is estimated that 99.9% of all species that have ever lived are now extinct.\n\nVarious anthropogenic activities causing extinction are manmade reasons. Only recently scientists have become alarmed at the high rates of recent extinctions due to various anthropogenic activities. Some of these anthropogenic activities include intentional or accidental introduction of invasive alien species, over exploitation and unscientific collection of Non-Timber Forest Produce (NTFPs) including medicinal plant, climate change, unsustainable tourism, habitat destruction, encroachment etc.\n\nStatus of Plants and Animals : 2012 list\n\nOf the total 63,837 species globally assessed plants and animals, the IUCN classified the numbers as below in 2012.\n\n81 as Extinct.\n63 as Extinct in the Wild.\n3,947 as Critically Endangered.\n5766 species in Endangered.\n10,104 in Vulnerable.\n4,467 in Near Threatened.\n10,497 species \u2013 Data Deficient.\nList of Extinct Plants in India\n\nExtinct plants are enlisted in Red Data book of Botanical Survey of India. As per the Red Data book of Botanical Survey of India (BSI), 17 plants have been recorded as extinct.

However many plants and animals are facing the threat of extinction. To protect the critically endangered and other threatened animal and plant species, the Government of India has adopted many steps, laws, and policy initiatives.\n\nSteps Taken By Government for Biodiversity Protection\n\nIndian Government has taken various biodiversity protection steps. Important measures include:\n\nThe Central Government enacted the Wild Life (Protection) Act, in 1972. The Act, inter alia, provides for the creation of Protected Areas for the protection of wildlife and also provides for punishment for hunting of specified fauna specified in schedules I to IV thereof.\nWetland (Conservation and Management) Rules 2010 have been framed for the protection of wetlands, in the States.\nThe Centrally Sponsored Scheme of the National Plan for Conservation of Aquatic Eco-System also provides assistance to the States for the management of wetlands including Ramsar sites in the country.\nThe Wildlife Crime Control Bureau has been established for control of illegal trade in wildlife, including endangered species.\nWildlife Institute of India, the Bombay Natural History Society, and the Salim Ali Centre for Ornithology and Natural History are some of the research organizations undertaking research on the conservation of wildlife.\nThe Indian Government has banned the veterinary use of diclofenac drug which has caused the rapid population decline of Gyps vultures across the Indian Subcontinent. Conservation Breeding Programmes to conserve these vulture species have been initiated at Pinjore (Haryana), Buxa (West Bengal), and Rani, Guwahati (Assam) by the Bombay Natural History Society.\nThe Centrally Sponsored Scheme \u2018Integrated Development of Wildlife Habitats\u2018 has been modified by including a new component namely \u2018Recovery of Endangered Species\u2018 and 16 species have been identified for recovery viz.

Hangul in Jammu and Kashmir, Snow Leopard in Jammu and Kashmir, Himachal Pradesh, Uttarakhand and Arunachal Pradesh, Vulture in Punjab, Haryana and Gujarat, Swiftlet in Andaman and Nicobar Islands, Nilgiri Tahr in Tamil Nadu, Sangai Deer in Manipur, the government has to spend lakhs of rupees.\nProtected Areas, viz, National Parks, Sanctuaries, Conservation Reserves, and Community Reserves all over the country covering important habitats have been created as per the provisions of the Wild Life (Protection) Act, 1972 to provide better protection to wildlife, including threatened species and their habitat.\nFinancial and technical assistance is extended to the State Governments under various Centrally Sponsored Schemes, viz, \u2018Integrated Development of Wildlife Habitats\u2019, \u2018Project Tiger\u2019, and \u2018Project Elephant\u2019 for providing better protection and conservation to wildlife.\nThe Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) has been empowered under the Wild Life (Protection) Act, of 1972 to apprehend and prosecute wildlife offenders.\nThe State Governments have been requested to strengthen the field formations and intensify patrolling in and around the Protected Areas.\nImportant Indian Acts passed related to Environment and Bio-Diversity\n\nFisheries Act 1897.\nIndian Forests Act 1927.\nMining and Mineral Development Regulation Act 1957.\nPrevention of cruelty to animals 1960.\nWildlife Protection Act 1972.\nWater (prevention and control of pollution) Act 1974.\nForest Conservation Act 1980.\nAir(prevention and control of pollution) act 1981.\nEnvironment Protection Act 1986.\nBiological Diversity Act 2002.\nScheduled Tribes and other traditional forest dwellers (recognition of rights) act 2006.\nPolicies Related to Environment and Bio-Diversity\nNational Forest Policy.\nNational Conservation Strategy and Policy Statement on Environment and Development.\nNational Policy and Macro-level Action Strategy on Biodiversity.\nNational Biodiversity Action Plan (2009).\nNational Agriculture Policy.\nNational Water Policy.\nNational Environment Policy (2006).\n\nAlso read: Vulture Conservation in India\n\n\ud83d\udc49 Which year are YOU targeting for success in the IAS/IPS/IFS Exam? \ud83d\ude80\n\n(1) \u21d2 UPSC 2025: Prelims cum Mains\n\n(2) \u21d2 UPSC 2026: Prelims cum Mains\n\n(3) \u21d2 UPSC 2027 Prelims cum Mains\n\nTip: Know more about ClearIAS Courses (Online/Offline)"

Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO) which is based in Paris, France.\n\nThe International World Heritage Programme administered by the UNESCO World Heritage Committee establishes the sites to be listed as UNESCO World Heritage Sites.\n\nThe World Heritage Committee is responsible for the implementation of the World Heritage Convention (The Convention Concerning the Protection of the World Cultural and Natural Heritage or the World Heritage Convention), defines the use of the World Heritage Fund and allocates financial assistance upon requests from States Parties.\n\nIt is composed of 21 state parties which are elected by the General Assembly of States Parties for a four-year term.\n\nCurrently, India is a member of the World Heritage Committee.\n\nHow is a World Heritage Site selected?\nThe first step towards the listing is the nomination of a site by the respective government of a country.\nThe site should have an Outstanding Universal Value (OUV) for the World Heritage nomination.\nTo determine the Outstanding Universal Value (OUV) for the World Heritage nomination, there are ten enlisted criteria.\nThe proposed nomination must satisfy at least one of these ten criteria.\nThe Nomination File is then evaluated by the International Council on Monuments and Sites and the World Conservation Union.\nThese bodies then make their recommendations to the World Heritage Committee.\nThe Committee meets once per year to determine whether or not to inscribe each nominated property on the World Heritage List and sometimes defers the decision to request more information from the country which nominated the site.\nWhat are the ten criteria for determining Outstanding Universal Value (OUV)?\n(i)\n\t\nto represent a masterpiece of human creative genius;\n\n\n(ii)\n\t\nto exhibit an important interchange of human values, over a span of time or within a\u00a0\u00a0 cultural area of the world, on developments in architecture or technology, monumental arts, town-planning or landscape design;\n\n\n(iii)\n\t\nto bear a unique or at least exceptional testimony to a cultural tradition or to a civilization which is living or which has disappeared;\n\n\n(iv)\n\t\nto be an outstanding example of a type of building, architectural or technological\u00a0\u00a0 ensemble or landscape which illustrates (a) significant stage(s) in human history;\n\n\n(v)\n\t\nto be an outstanding example of a traditional human settlement, land-use, or sea-use which is representative of a culture (or cultures), or human interaction with the environment especially when it has become vulnerable under the impact of irreversible change;\n\n\n(vi)\n\t\nto be directly or tangibly associated with events or living traditions, with ideas, or with beliefs, with artistic and literary works of outstanding universal significance. (The Committee considers that this criterion should preferably be used in conjunction with other criteria.\n\n\n(vii)\n\t\nto contain superlative natural phenomena or areas of exceptional natural beauty and aesthetic importance;\n\n\n(viii)\n\t\nto be outstanding examples representing major stages of earth\u2019s history, including the record of life, significant on-going geological processes in the development of landforms, or significant geomorphic or physiographic features;\n\n\n(ix)\n\t\nto be outstanding examples representing significant ongoing ecological and biological processes in the evolution and development of terrestrial, freshwater, coastal and marine ecosystems and communities of plants and animals;\n\n\n(x)\n\t\nto contain the most important and significant natural habitats for in-situ conservation of biological diversity, including those containing threatened species of outstanding universal value from the point of view of science or conservation.\nHow does this program help the listed site and the country?\n\nWhen a site is inscribed on the World Heritage List, the resulting prestige often helps raise awareness among citizens and governments for heritage preservation.\n\nGreater awareness leads to a general rise in the level of the protection and conservation given to heritage properties.\n\nA country may also receive financial assistance and expert advice from the World Heritage Committee to support activities for the preservation of its sites.\n\nThe site will also get immediate international recognition which boosts the tourism of the country.\n\nAlso read: Gothic Architecture\n\nUNESCO World Heritage Sites in India\n\nThe Archaeological Survey of India (ASI) is the nodal agency for forwarding any request for World Heritage status to any Indian site whether cultural or natural.\n\nBased on the proposals received from the Central or State Government agencies as well as management Trusts, etc., and after their due scrutiny, the Government forwards the nomination dossiers to the World Heritage Center.\n\nIndia now has 35 sites, including 27 cultural properties, seven natural sites and one mixed site, notified as World Heritage Sites.\n\nThe\u00a0latest entries in 2016 were \u2013 (1) Nalanda University (2) Capitol Complex and (3) Khangchendzonga National Park (mixed site).\n\nThe list of places in India that have

of industrial property which refers to the geographical indication referring to a country or to a place situated therein as being the country or place of origin of that product.\nTypically, such a name conveys an assurance of quality and distinctiveness which is essentially attributable to the fact of its origin in that defined geographical locality, region or country.\nUnder Articles 1 (2) and 10 of the Paris Convention for the Protection of Industrial Property, geographical indications are covered as an element of IPRs.\nThey are also covered under Articles 22 to 24 of the Trade Related Aspects of Intellectual Property Rights (TRIPS) Agreement, which was part of the Agreements concluding the Uruguay Round of GATT negotiations.\nProponents of GIs regard them as strong tools for protecting their national property rights. Opponents, however, consider GIs as barriers to trade.\n\nCompiled by: Yuvaalex and Ujwala Pullela"

The terms \u2018green movement\u2019 or \u2018conservation movement\u2019 are alternatively used to denote the same.\nThe environmental movements favour the sustainable management of natural resources. The movements often stress the protection of the environment via changes in public policy. Many movements are centred on ecology, health and human rights.\nEnvironmental movements range from highly organized and formally institutionalized ones to radically informal activities.\nThe spatial scope of various environmental movements ranges from being local to almost global.\nMajor Environmental Movements in India\n\nSome of the major environmental movements in India during the period 1700 to 2000 are the following.\n\nBishnoi Movement\n\nYear: 1700s\nPlace: Khejarli, Marwar region, Rajasthan state.\nLeaders: Amrita Devi along with Bishnoi villagers in Khejarli and surrounding villages.\nAim: Save sacred trees from being cut down by the king\u2019s soldiers for a new palace.\n\nWhat was it all about: Amrita Devi, a female villager could not bear to witness the destruction of both her faith and the village\u2019s sacred trees. She hugged the trees and encouraged others to do the same. 363 Bishnoi villagers were killed in this movement.\n\nThe Bishnoi tree martyrs were influenced by the teachings of Guru Maharaj Jambaji, who founded the Bishnoi faith in 1485 and set forth principles forbidding harm to trees and animals. The king who came to know about these events rushed to the village and apologized, ordering the soldiers to cease logging operations. Soon afterwards, the maharajah designated the Bishnoi state as a protected area, forbidding harm to trees and animals. This legislation still exists today in the region.\n\nChipko Movement\n\nYear: 1973\nPlace: In Chamoli district and later in Tehri-Garhwal district of Uttarakhand.\nLeaders: Sundarlal Bahuguna, Gaura Devi, Sudesha Devi, Bachni Devi, Chandi Prasad Bhatt, Govind Singh Rawat, Dhoom Singh Negi, Shamsher Singh Bisht and Ghanasyam Raturi.\nAim: The main objective was to protect the trees on the Himalayan slopes from the axes of contractors of the forest.\n\nWhat was it all about: Mr. Bahuguna enlightened the villagers by conveying the importance of trees in the environment which check the erosion of soil, cause rains and provide pure air. The women of Advani village of Tehri-Garhwal tied the sacred thread around the trunks of trees and they hugged the trees, hence it was called the \u2018Chipko Movement\u2019 or \u2018hug the tree movement\u2019.\n\nThe main demand of the people in these protests was that the benefits of the forests (especially the right to fodder) should go to local people. The Chipko movement gathered momentum in 1978 when the women faced police firings and other tortures.\n\nThe then state Chief Minister, Hemwati Nandan Bahuguna set up a committee to look into the matter, which eventually ruled in favour of the villagers. This became a turning point in the history of eco-development struggles in the region and around the world.\n\nSave Silent Valley Movement\n\nYear: 1978\nPlace: Silent Valley, an evergreen tropical forest in the Palakkad district of Kerala, India.\nLeaders: The Kerala Sastra Sahitya Parishad (KSSP) an NGO, and the poet-activist Sughathakumari played an important role in the Silent Valley protests.\nAim: To protect the Silent Valley, the moist evergreen forest from being destroyed by a hydroelectric project.\n\nWhat was it all about: The Kerala State Electricity Board (KSEB) proposed a hydroelectric dam across the Kunthipuzha River that runs through Silent Valley. In February 1973, the Planning Commission approved the project at a cost of about Rs 25 crores. Many feared that the project would submerge 8.3 sq km of untouched moist evergreen forest. Several NGOs strongly opposed the project and urged the government to abandon it.\n\nIn January 1981, bowing to unrelenting public pressure, Indira Gandhi declared that Silent Valley will be protected. In June 1983 the Center re-examined the issue through a commission chaired by Prof. M.G.K. Menon. In November 1983 the Silent Valley Hydroelectric Project was called off. In 1985, Prime Minister Rajiv Gandhi formally inaugurated the Silent Valley National Park.\n\nJungle Bachao Andholan\n\nYear: 1982\nPlace:\u00a0Singhbhum district of Bihar\nLeaders: The tribals of Singhbhum.\nAim: Against the government\u2019s decision to replace the natural sal forest with Teak.\n\nWhat was it all about: The tribals of the Singhbhum district of Bihar started the protest when the government decided to replace the natural sal forests with the highly-priced teak. This move was called by many \u201cGreed Game Political Populism\u201d. Later this movement spread to Jharkhand and Orissa.\n\nAppiko Movement\n\nYear: 1983\nPlace:\u00a0Uttara Kannada\u00a0and Shimoga districts \u00a0of Karnataka State\nLeaders: Appiko\u2019s greatest strengths lie in it being neither driven by a personality nor having been formally institutionalised. However, it does have a facilitator in Pandurang Hegde. He helped launch the movement in 1983.\nAim: Against the felling and commercialization of natural forest and the ruin of ancient livelihood.\n\nWhat was it all about: It can be said that the Appiko movement is the southern version of the Chipko movement. The Appiko Movement was locally known as \u201cAppiko Chaluvali\u201d. The locals embraced the trees which were to be cut by contractors of the forest department. The Appiko movement used various techniques to raise awareness such as foot marches in the interior forest, slide shows, folk dances, street plays etc.\n\nThe second area of the movement\u2019s work was to promote afforestation on denuded lands. The movement later focused on the rational use of the ecosphere by introducing alternative energy resource to reduce pressure on the forest. The movement became a success. The current status of the project is \u2013 stopped.\n\nNarmada Bachao Andholan (NBA)\n\nYear: 1985\nPlace:\u00a0Narmada River, which flows through the states of Gujarat, Madhya Pradesh and Maharashtra.\nLeaders: Medha Patker, Baba Amte, Adivasis, farmers, environmentalists and human rights activists.\nAim: A social movement against several large dams being built across the Narmada River.\n\nWhat was it all about: The movement first started as a protest for not providing proper rehabilitation and resettlement for the people who have been displaced by the construction of the Sardar Sarovar Dam. Later on, the movement turned its focus on the preservation of the environment and the eco-systems of the valley. Activists also demanded the height of the dam to be reduced to 88 m from the proposed height of 130m. World Bank withdrew from the project.\n\nThe environmental issue was taken into court. In October 2000, the Supreme Court gave a judgment approving the construction of the Sardar Sarovar Dam with a condition that the height of the dam could be raised to 90 m. This height is much higher than the 88 m which anti-dam activists demanded, but it is definitely lower than the proposed height of 130 m. The project is now largely financed by the state governments and market borrowings. The project is expected to be fully com\u00adpleted by 2025.\n\nAlthough not successful, as the dam could not be prevented, the NBA has created an anti-big dam opinion in India and outside. It questioned the paradigm of development. As a democratic movement, it followed the Gandhian way 100 per cent.\n\nTehri Dam Conflict\n\nYear: 1990\u2019s\nPlace: Bhagirathi River near Tehri in Uttarakhand.\nLeaders: Sundarlal Bahuguna\nAim: The protest was against the displacement of town inhabitants and the environmental consequence of the weak ecosystem.\n\nTehri Dam attracted national attention in the 1980s and the 1990s.\u00a0 The major objections include seismic sensitivity of the region, the submergence of forest areas along with Tehri town etc. Despite the support from other prominent leaders like Sunderlal Bahuguna, the movement has failed to gather enough popular support at the national as well as international levels.\n\nReference:\n\nAppiko \u2013 The Hindu\nNBA \u2013 The Hindu\n\nArticle by: Priyanka Sunil"

An additional cover of 1,540 square kilometers increased over the past two years.\nIndia\u2019s forest cover is now7,13,789 square kilometers (21.71% of the country\u2019s geographical area) which is an increase from 67% in 2019.\nTree cover is defined as all tree patches of size less than one hectare occurring outside the\u00a0recorded forest area. This covers trees in all formations including scattered trees. Tree cover has increased by 721 sq km.\nIncrease/Decrease in Forests:\nThe states that have shown the highest increase in forest cover are Telangana (3.07%), Andhra Pradesh (2.22%), and Odisha (1.04%).\nFive states in the Northeast have shown a loss in forest cover: Arunachal Pradesh, Manipur, Meghalaya, Mizoram, and Nagaland\u00a0\nStates with Highest Forest Area/Cover:\nArea-wise: Madhya Pradesh has the largest forest cover in the country followed by Arunachal Pradesh, Chhattisgarh, Odisha, and Maharashtra.\nForest cover as a percentage of total geographical area: Mizoram, Arunachal Pradesh, Meghalaya, Manipur, and Nagaland.\n\nThe \u2018forest area\u2019 denotes the legal status of the land as per the government records, whereas the term \u2018forest cover\u2019 indicates the presence of trees over any land.\n\nMangroves:\nMangroves have increased by 17 sq km making India\u2019s total mangrove cover as 4,992 sq km.\nTop 3 states showing mangrove cover increase: Odisha (8 sq km), Maharashtra (4 sq km), and Karnataka (3 sq km).\nForest Prone to Fires:\n46% of the forest cover is prone to forest fires.\n81% are extremely prone, 7.85% are very highly prone and 11.51% are highly prone.\nBy 2030, 45-64% of forests in India will experience the effects of climate change and rising temperatures.\nForests in all states (except Assam, Meghalaya, Tripura, and Nagaland) will be highly vulnerable climate hot spots.\nLadakh (forest cover 0.1-0.2%) is likely to be the most affected.\nTotal Carbon Stock:\nForest carbon stock is the\u00a0amount of carbon that has been sequestered from the atmosphere and stored within the forest ecosystem. Such carbon is mainly stored within living biomass and soil and to some extent in deadwood and litter.\nThe total carbon stock in the country\u2019s forests is estimated at 7,204 million tonnes, showing an increase of 79.4 million tonnes since 2019.\nBamboo Forests:\nBamboo forests have grown from 13,882 million culms (stems) in 2019 to 53,336 million culms in 2021.\nConcerns as per the findings of the report:\n\nA decline in Natural Forests:\n\nThere is a\u00a01,582 sq km decline in moderately dense or natural forests.\nThe decline even with an increase of 2,621 sq km in open forest areas shows the degradation of forests in the country.\nThe scrub area has increased by 5,320 sq km which indicates the complete degradation of forests in these areas.\nVery dense forests have increased by 501 sq km.\n\nA decline in Forest Cover in Northeast:\n\nThe forest cover in the northeast has shown an overall decline of 1,020 sq km.\nThe Northeast states cover 98% of the total geographical area but have 23.75% of total forest cover.\nThis decline in this region has been attributed to the series of natural calamities that occurred here like landslides and heavy rains, as well as to anthropogenic activities such as shifting agriculture, developmental activities, and extensive deforestation."

            "[CONTENT]": "The Kunming declaration is been said to be paving way for global biodiversity negotiations. Read here to know about the key points of the declaration.\n\nThe Kunming Declaration was adopted by over 100 countries on October 13, 2021, at the first part of the virtual 15th meeting of the Conference of the Parties (COP15) to the United Nations Convention on Biological Diversity (UN-CBD).\n\nKunming is situated in the Yunnan province of the People\u2019s Republic of China.\n\nThe theme of the declaration is \u2018Ecological Civilization: Building a Shared Future for All Life on Earth\u2019.\n\nTable of Contents\n\nHistory of UN-CBD:\nKunming declaration:\n30 by 30 target:\nKunming biodiversity fund:\nWhat is Climate Financing mentioned in the Kunming declaration?\nHistory of UN-CBD:\n\nThe United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP) convened the Ad Hoc Working Group of Experts on Biological Diversity in November 1988 to explore the need for an. international convention on biological diversity. Soon after, in May 1989, it established the Ad Hoc Working Group of Technical and Legal Experts to prepare an international legal instrument for the conservation and sustainable use of biological diversity.\n\nBy February 1991, the Ad Hoc Working Group had become known as the Intergovernmental Negotiating Committee. Its work culminated on 22 May 1992 with the Nairobi Conference for the Adoption of the Agreed Text of the Convention on Biological Diversity. The Convention was opened for signature on 5 June 1992 at the United Nations Conference on Environment and Development (the Rio Earth Summit).\n\nThe Convention on Biological Diversity (CBD) entered into force on 29 December 1993. It has 3 main objectives:\n\n\ud83d\udc49 Which year are YOU targeting for success in the IAS/IPS/IFS Exam? \ud83d\ude80\n\n(1) \u21d2 UPSC 2025: Prelims cum Mains\n\n(2) \u21d2 UPSC 2026: Prelims cum Mains\n\n(3) \u21d2 UPSC 2027 Prelims cum Mains\n\nTip: Know more about ClearIAS Courses (Online/Offline)\n\nThe conservation of biological diversity\nThe sustainable use of the components of biological diversity\nThe fair and equitable sharing of the benefits arising out of the utilization of genetic resources\n\nCBD is a legally binding treaty.\n\nKunming declaration:\n\nThis declaration asks the parties to prioritize biodiversity protection in terms of decision-making and recognizing the importance of conservation in protecting human health. The adoption of this declaration aims to create momentum for a new global biodiversity pact.\n\nBy this action, the nations have committed themselves to support the development, adoption, and implementation of an effective post-2020 implementation plan, capacity-building action plan for the Cartagena Protocol on bio-safety.\n\nSignatory nations will ensure that the post-pandemic recovery policies, programs, and plans contribute to the conservation and sustainable use of biodiversity, promoting sustainable and inclusive development.\n\nIt shines a light on the need for urgent and integrated action to reflect\u00a0biodiversity considerations in all sectors of the global economy.\n\nThe crucial issues \u2013 like funding conservation in poorer countries and committing to biodiversity-friendly supply chains have been left to be discussed later.\n\nIt is not a binding international agreement.\n\nPreviously, Aichi Biodiversity Targets or Strategic Plan for Biodiversity was adopted where governments agreed on 20 targets to slow down biodiversity loss and to protect habitats by 2020.\n\nThe declaration stated:\n\n\u2018Putting biodiversity on a path to recovery is a defining challenge of this decade, in the context of the UN Decade of Action for Sustainable Development, the UN Decade on Ecosystem Restoration and the UN Decade for Ocean Science for Sustainable Development. It requires strong political momentum to develop, adopt and implement an ambitious and transformative post-2020 global biodiversity framework that promotes the three objectives of the Convention in a balanced manner.\u2019\n\n30 by 30 target:\nThe declaration referred to the \u201930 by 30\u2032 target which is a\u00a0key proposal being debated at the COP15- 30% of the Earth\u2019s land and oceans to have protected status by 2030.\nApart from this, the goal to halve the use of chemicals in agriculture and end creating plastic waste is also being debated.\nKunming biodiversity fund:\n\nThe Kunming declaration also includes a fund that is being created by China to fund biodiversity protection actions in developing nations. Thye have pledged to pump USD 233 million into the new fund.\n\nThe actions for the protection and mitigation of further impact on biodiversity, without doubt, require as much funding as possible, hence this new fund should be welcome as it makes available more resources. But countries have raised their criticisms against this also-\n\nThe presence of the UN Global environment facility (GEF) is deemed sufficient in funding green projects in developing nations.\nChina being the biggest polluter in the world right now, this fund has been called a \u2018drop in the bucket\u2019 by some countries as well.\nWhat is Climate Financing mentioned in the Kunming declaration?\n\nClimate finance refers to local, national, or transnational financing- drawn from public, private and alternative sources of financing that seek to support mitigation and adaptation actions that will address climate change.\n\nThe UNFCC, the Kyoto Protocol, and the Paris Agreement call for financial assistance from parties with more financial resources to those that are less endowed and more vulnerable. This recognizes that the contribution of countries to climate change and their capacity to prevent it and cope with its consequences vary enormously.\n\nClimate finance is needed for mitigation because large-scale investments are required to significantly reduce emissions. Climate finance is equally important for adaptation, as significant financial resources are needed to adapt to the adverse effects and reduce the impacts of a changing climate.\n\nBy the principle of \u201ccommon but differentiated responsibility and respective capabilities\u201d set out in the Convention, developed country parties are to provide financial resources to assist developing country parties in implementing the objectives of the UNFCCC.\n\nThe Paris Agreement reaffirms the obligations of developed countries, while for the first time also encouraging voluntary contributions by other Parties.\n\nDeveloped country parties should also continue to take the lead in mobilizing climate finance from a wide variety of sources, instruments, and channels, noting the significant role of public funds, through a variety of actions, including supporting country-driven strategies and taking into account the needs and priorities of developing country parties.\n\nThe other funds facilitating such efforts are-\n\nThe\u00a0Global Environment Facility (GEF) has served as an operating entity of the financial mechanism since the Convention entered into force in 1994.\nAt COP 16, in 2010, Parties established the\u00a0Green Climate Fund (GCF) and in 2011 also designated it as an operating entity of the financial mechanism.\nParties have established two special funds \u2013 the Special Climate Change Fund (SCCF) and the\u00a0Least Developed Countries Fund(LDCF), both managed by the GEF and the\u00a0Adaptation Fund\u00a0(AF) established under the Kyoto Protocol in 2001."

The aims of Paris Agreement is as below:\n\nKeep the global temperature rise this century well below 2 degrees Celsius above the pre-industrial level.\nPursue efforts to limit the temperature increase even further to 1.5 degrees Celsius.\nStrengthen the ability of countries to deal with the impacts of climate change.\n\nIt may seem a small change in temperature but this can mean a big difference for the Earth!\n\nParis Agreement: Things to note\nIn French, the Paris\u00a0Agreement\u00a0is known as L\u2019accord de Paris.\nThe key vision\u00a0of Paris Agreement is to keep global temperatures \u201cwell below\u201d 2.0C (3.6F) above pre-industrial times and \u201cendeavour to limit\u201d them even more, to 1.5C.\nParis Accord talks about limiting\u00a0the amount of greenhouse gases emitted by human activity to the same levels that trees, soil and oceans can absorb naturally, beginning at some point between 2050 and 2100.\nIt also mentions the need to\u00a0review each country\u2019s contribution to cutting emissions every five years so they scale up to the challenge.\nRich countries should help poorer nations by providing \u201cclimate finance\u201d to adapt to climate change and switch to renewable energy.\nThe Paris Agreement has a \u2018bottom up\u2019 structure in contrast to most international environmental law treaties which are \u2018top down.\nThe agreement is\u00a0binding in some elements like reporting requirements, while leaving other aspects of the deal such as the setting of emissions targets for any individual country as non-binding.\nNote: You can download the Paris Agreement from this link.\nIs this the first international agreement to combat climate change due to global warming?\n\nNo. In fact, Paris Agreement comes under the broad umbrella of United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC). UNFCCC is a convention held in 1992 to combat climate change. Kyoto Protocol (1997) was another major international commitment under UNFCCC.\n\n\ud83d\udc49 Which year are YOU targeting for success in the IAS/IPS/IFS Exam? \ud83d\ude80\n\n(1) \u21d2 UPSC 2025: Prelims cum Mains\n\n(2) \u21d2 UPSC 2026: Prelims cum Mains\n\n(3) \u21d2 UPSC 2027 Prelims cum Mains\n\nTip: Know more about ClearIAS Courses (Online/Offline)\n\nParis Agreement (2015) vs\u00a0Kyoto Protocol (1997)\nParis Agreement is\u00a0the world\u2019s first comprehensive climate agreement. Although developed and developing countries were parties to Kyoto Protocol,\u00a0developing countries were not mandated to reduce their emissions.\nThis means that while Paris Agreement is legally binding to all parties, Kyoto Protocol was not.\nParis Agreement was reached on\u00a0the twenty-first session of the Conference of the Parties (COP) and the eleventh session of the Conference of the Parties serving as the meeting of the Parties to the Kyoto Protocol (CMP).\n\nNationally Determined Contributions (NDC)\nThe national pledges by countries to cut emissions are voluntary.\nThe Paris Agreement requires all Parties to put forward their best efforts through \u201cnationally determined contributions\u201d (NDCs) and to strengthen these efforts in the years ahead.\nThis includes requirements that all Parties report regularly on their emissions and on their implementation efforts.\nIn 2018, Parties will take stock of the collective efforts in relation to progress towards the goal set in the Paris Agreement.\nThere will also be a global stock take every 5 years to assess the collective progress towards achieving the purpose of the Agreement and to inform further individual actions by Parties.\nIndia\u2019s Intended Nationally Determined Contribution (INDC)\n\nIndia\u2019s INDC include a reduction in the emissions intensity of its GDP by 33 to 35 per cent by 2030 from 2005 level.\nIndia has also pledged to create an additional carbon sink of 2.5 to 3 billion tonnes of CO2 equivalent through additional forest and tree cover by 2030.\nIndia will\u00a0anchor a global solar alliance, INSPA (International Agency for Solar Policy & Application), of all countries located in between Tropic of Cancer and Tropic of Capricorn.\nFrameworks\u00a0under Paris Agreement\nTechnology Framework\nCapacity Building Framework\nTransparency Framework\nWhy is Paris Agreement important?\nCurrent commitments on greenhouse gas emissions (Kyoto Protocol) will expire in 2020. Paris Agreement deals with what should be done in the decade after 2020 and beyond this time frame.\nThe text of the agreement includes a provision requiring developed countries to send $100 billion annually to their developing counterparts beginning in 2020. That figure will be a \u201cfloor\u201d that is expected to increase with time.\nThe Paris Agreement has a \u2018bottom up\u2019 structure in contrast to most international environmental law treaties which are \u2018top down.\nFor the first time, the accord lays out a longer-term plan for reaching a peak in greenhouse emissions \u201cas soon as possible\u201d and achieving a balance between the output of man-made greenhouse gasses and absorption \u2013 by forests or the oceans \u2013 \u201cby the second half of this century\u201d.\nWhen will Paris Agreement come into force?\nThirty days after the date on which at least 55 Parties to the Convention accounting in total for at least an estimated 55 % of the total global greenhouse gas emissions have deposited their instruments of ratification, acceptance, approval or accession with the Depositary.\nOn 5 October 2016, the threshold for entry into force of the Paris Agreement was achieved.\nThe Paris Agreement will enter into force on 4 November 2016.\nCriticisms about Paris Agreement\nAccording to a study published in Nature on June 2016, current country pledges are too low to lead to a temperature rise below the Paris Agreement temperature limit of \u201cwell below 2 \u00b0C\u201d.\nEven a UNFCCC report had observed that even if all the pledges made by 197 countries that are signatory to the Paris pact were fulfilled, it would be insufficient to meet the conservative goal of keeping global temperature rise within the 2 degree Celsius threshold.\nMost of the agreement consists of \u201cpromises\u201d or aims and not firm commitments.\nThe starting point of $100bn per year remains under 8% of worldwide declared military spending each year.\nSince the only mechanism remains voluntary national caps on emissions, without even any guidance on how stringent those caps would need to be, it is hard to be optimistic that these goals are likely to be achieved.\nThere is only a \u201cname and shame\u201d system or\u00a0a \u201cname and encourage\u201d plan and\u00a0the \u2018contributions\u2019 themselves are not binding as a matter of international law.\nSummary\nThe Paris Agreement is an agreement within the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC).\nCountries will aim to keep global temperatures from rising more than 2\u00b0C (3.6\u00b0F) by 2100 with an ideal target of keeping temperature rise below 1.5\u00b0C (2.7\u00b0F).\nParis is only the beginning of a shift towards a low-carbon world, and there is much more to do.\nREFERENCE:\nUNFCCC.\nIndia\u2019s INDC \u2013 PIB.\nBBC\nTime.\nWikipedia."

In this post, we explain the importance of Kigali agreement and it\u2019s relevance to India.\n\nTable of Contents\n\nWhat is Kigali Agreement?\n\u00a0What is Montreal Protocol?\nWhat are Hydrofluorocarbons\u00a0(HFCs)?\nHFCs: Will not cause ozone layer depletion, but will cause global warming!\n\u00a0Kigali Agreement: Important Points\nWhy is Kigali Agreement significant?\nKigali Amendment and India\nImplications of Kigali Agreement on India\nWhat next, after HFCs?\nWhat are the main characteristics of HFO-1234yf?\nReferences\nWhat is Kigali Agreement?\n\nIn the 28th meeting of the Parties to the Montreal Protocol, negotiators from 197 nations have signed a historic agreement to amend the Montreal Protocol in Kigali, a capital city of a tiny African country, Rwanda on 15th October 2016.\nAs per the agreement, these countries are expected to reduce the manufacture and use of Hydrofluorocarbons (HFCs) by roughly 80-85%\u00a0 from their respective baselines, till 2045.\nThis phase down is expected to arrest the global average temperature rise up to 0.5o C by 2100.\nKigali agreement is an amendment to Montreal Protocol.\n\u00a0What is Montreal Protocol?\n\nThe Montreal Protocol is a most effective international environmental treaty to phase out the Ozone Depleting Substances (ODSs) from the atmosphere.\nIt came into force in 1989.\nIt has 197 member parties to the protocol and become a first international treaty with complete ratification.\nIt has undergone several amendments and Kigali amendment is the eighth amendment to this protocol.\nIt has successfully curbed the 98% production of chlorofluorocarbons and other ODSs and significantly contributed to the repair of the ozone hole.\nWhat are Hydrofluorocarbons\u00a0(HFCs)?\n\nHydrofluorocarbons are organic compounds containing hydrogen, Carbon, and fluorine.\nThey are commonly used as substitutes for Ozone depleting substances like Chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs) and are used in refrigerators and air-conditioners.\nHFCs: Will not cause ozone layer depletion, but will cause global warming!\n\nThough HFCs are not as harmful as CFCs for ozone layer depletion, they have a thousand times more potential to cause global warming effect than commonly known greenhouse gases like carbon Dioxide, methane etc.\n\n\u00a0Kigali Agreement: Important Points\nIt is a legally binding agreement between the signatory parties with non-compliance measures.\nIt will come into effect from 1st January 2019 provided it is ratified by at least 20 member parties by then.\nIt has shown a considerable flexibility in approach while setting phase-down targets for different economies accommodating their developmental aspirations, different socio-economic compulsions, and scientific & technological capabilities.\nIt has divided the signatory parties into three groups-\nThe first group consists of rich and developed economies like USA, UK and EU countries who will start to phase down HFCs by 2019 and reduce it to 15% of 2012 levels by 2036.\nThe second group consists of emerging economies like China, Brazil as well as some African countries who will start phase down by 2024 and reduce it to 20% of 2021 levels by 2045.\nThe third group consists of developing economies and some of the hottest climatic countries like India, Pakistan, Iran, Saudi Arabia who will start phasing down HFCs by 2028 and reduce it to 15% of 2024-2026 levels till 2047.\nIt also has a provision for a multilateral fund for developing countries for adaptation and mitigation.\nThe Technology and Energy Assessment Panel (TEAP) will take a periodic review of the alternative technologies and products for their energy efficiency and safety standards.\nWhy is Kigali Agreement significant?\nIt strengthens the Paris Agreement which sets an ambitious target of restricting the rise in global temperature below 2O Celsius, as compared to pre-industrial level.\nUnlike Paris agreement, it gives clear, concrete and mandatory targets with fixed timelines to the signatory parties to achieve their targets.\nIt would prevent the emission of HFCs equivalent to 70 billion tons of CO2.\nKigali Amendment and India\nIndia played a very flexible and cooperative role in the whole negotiating process.\nIt has agreed on a lenient schedule as it consumes only 3% of HFCs as compared to the other nations like the USA (37%) and China (25%).\nIt would be tough for Indian to adhere to this agreement along with Paris Pact especially when it has embarked on an ambitious\u00a0\u201dMake in India\u201d Programme to increase its industrial production.\nIt should also take into consideration the hot climatic conditions and growing demand for air conditioners, refrigerators, and cars with growing middle-class incomes while implementing the program.\nStill, as a responsible nation with a global perspective, the Indian government has voluntarily passed the order to stop the production of HFC-23 which is a byproduct of commonly used refrigerant. This will reduce the emission by 100 million tons equivalent of Carbon dioxide in next 15 years.\nImplications of Kigali Agreement on India\n\nIndian industries using HFCs like Air-Conditioning industry, Automobiles, and refrigeration industry have some serious implications on financial and technical fronts:\n\n\ud83d\udc49 Which year are YOU targeting for success in the IAS/IPS/IFS Exam? \ud83d\ude80\n\n(1) \u21d2 UPSC 2025: Prelims cum Mains\n\n(2) \u21d2 UPSC 2026: Prelims cum Mains\n\n(3) \u21d2 UPSC 2027 Prelims cum Mains\n\nTip: Know more about ClearIAS Courses (Online/Offline)\n\nFinancial implications \u2013 Industries have to either invest in R & D to find out the substitutes for HFCs or they have to buy patented substances and technologies from other MNCs. Consequently, the cost of production will increase which may ultimately shrink the buyer base for their products.\nTechnological implications \u2013 Some of the developed nations have already started using substitutes of HFCs in their products and have a sound technological knowledge about their use. Without technology transfer or research, it would be difficult for domestic industries to compete with them in global as well as domestic market.\n\nOn a positive side, this will incentivise business and scientific fraternity to invest their financial and intellectual resources in finding out more economic and environment-friendly technological alternatives.\n\nWhat next, after HFCs?\n\nThe answer is HFO refrigerants.\u00a0HFO stands for hydrofluoro olefin.\u00a0HFC refrigerants are composed of hydrogen, fluorine and carbon atoms connected by single bonds between the atoms. HFO refrigerants are composed of hydrogen, fluorine and carbon atoms, but contain at least one double bond between the carbon atoms.\n\nHFO-1234yf has physical properties similar to HFC-134a. Therefore, HFO-1234yf has the potential to be used in current HFC-134a systems with minimal system modifications.\n\nWhat are the main characteristics of HFO-1234yf?\n\nLow toxicity.\nLow GWP; GWP = 4.\nZero ozone depletion potential.\nLow total contribution to climate change.\nSame operating pressures as the current HFC-134a system.\nReferences\nAljazeera.\nTheWire.\nFinancialExpress.\nScroll.\nIndianExpress.\nUNEP.\nTheGuardian.\nNature.\nWikipedia.\n\nArticle by: Manjiri Mulye"

Mobilise Finance:\n\nDeveloped countries must make good on their promise to\u00a0mobilize at least USD100bn in climate finance per year.\nInternational financial institutions must play their part and we need to work towards unleashing the trillions in private and public sector finance required to secure global net zero.\n\n4. Work Together to Deliver:\n\nAnother important task at the COP26 is to\u00a0\u2018finalize the Paris Rulebook\u2019.\nLeaders will work together to frame a list of detailed rules that will help fulfil the Paris agreement.\n\nThe outcome of the COP26- the Glasgow Climate Pact gives new building blocks to advance implementation of the Paris Agreement through actions that can get the world on a more sustainable, low-carbon pathway forward.\n\nThe Glasgow climate pact:\n\nThe following were agreed upon in the Glasgow Climate Pact by the nations of the world:\n\nRecognizing the emergency\n\nCountries reaffirmed the Paris Agreement goal of limiting the increase in the global average temperature to well below 2\u00b0C above pre-industrial levels and pursuing efforts to limit it to 1.5 \u00b0C.\n\nAccelerating action\n\nCountries stressed the urgency of action when carbon dioxide emissions must be reduced by 45 percent to reach net-zero around mid-century. But with present climate plans and the Nationally determined Contributions are falling far short. Hence the Glasgow Climate Pact calls on all countries to present stronger national action plans next year, instead of in 2025, which was the original timeline.\n\nMoving away from fossil fuels\n\nThe countries agreed to a provision calling for a phase-down of coal power and a phase-out of fossil fuel subsidies \u2013 two key issues that had never been explicitly mentioned in decisions of UN climate talks before.\n\nDelivering on climate finance\n\nDeveloped countries came to Glasgow falling short on their promise to deliver US$100 billion a year for developing countries and expressed confidence that the target would be met in 2023.\n\nStepping up support for adaptation\n\nThe Glasgow Pact calls for a doubling of finance to support developing countries in adapting to the impacts of climate change and building resilience.\n\nCompleting the Paris rulebook\n\nCountries reached an agreement on the remaining issues of the so-called Paris rulebook, the operational details for the practical implementation of the Paris Agreement.\n\nFocusing on loss & damage\n\nAcknowledging that climate change is having increasing impacts on people especially in the developing world, countries agreed to strengthen a network\u2014 known as the Santiago Network, that provides vulnerable countries with technical assistance, knowledge, and resources to address climate risks.\n\nThey also launched a new \u201cGlasgow dialogue\u201d to discuss arrangements for the funding of activities to avert, minimize and address loss and damage associated with the adverse effects of climate change.\n\nNew announcements at COP26:\n\nThere were many other significant deals and announcements which can have major positive impacts if they are implemented. These include:\n\nForests: 137 countries took a landmark step forward by committing to halt and reverse forest loss and land degradation by 2030. The pledge is backed by $12bn in public and $7.2bn in private funding.\n\nMethane: 103 countries, including 15 major emitters, signed up to the Global Methane Pledge, which aims to limit methane emissions by 30 percent by 2030, compared to 2020 levels. Methane, one of the most potent greenhouse gases, is responsible for a third of current warming from human activities.\n\nCars: Over 30 countries, six major vehicle manufacturers, and other actors, like cities, set out their determination for all new car and van sales to be zero-emission vehicles by 2040 globally and 2035 in leading markets, accelerating the decarbonization of road transport, which currently accounts for about 10 percent of global greenhouse gas emissions.\n\nCoal: Leaders from South Africa, the United Kingdom, the United States, France, Germany, and the European Union announced a ground-breaking partnership to support South Africa \u2013 the world\u2019s most carbon-intensive electricity producer\u2014 with $8.5 billion over the next 3-5 years to make a just transition away from coal, to a low-carbon economy.\n\nPrivate Finance: Private financial institutions and central banks announced moves to realign trillions of dollars towards achieving global net-zero emissions. Among them is the Glasgow Financial Alliance for Net Zero, with over 450 firms across 45 countries that control $130 trillion in assets, requiring its member to set robust, science-based near-term targets.\n\nKey terms to know from COP26:\nWhat is net-zero?\nNet-zero emissions pertain to achieving an overall balance between greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions produced, and GHG emissions removed from the atmosphere.\nA country can be said to be net-zero when it produces no emissions, either because it has actually phased out all emissions or because it is removing enough from the atmosphere to offset the emissions it releases.\nThe latter can be achieved by restoring or increasing forest cover or through technologies such as\u00a0carbon capture.\nWhat is carbon neutrality?\nCarbon neutrality is a state of net-zero carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions. It is achieved when anthropogenic CO2 emissions are balanced globally by anthropogenic CO2 removals over a specified period.\nThere are several actions that an emitter can take to achieve this balance, such as reducing energy consumption and emissions-producing activities, improving energy efficiency processes, and consumption of renewable sources of energy.\nA nation or an organization can also achieve carbon neutrality through carbon offsetting, a process of compensating for CO2 emissions it generates by participating in, or funding efforts to remove CO2 from the atmosphere.\nOffsetting usually involves paying another party, somewhere else, to save emissions equivalent to those produced by the emitter.\nWhat is the carbon footprint?\nA carbon footprint measures the amount of CO2 equivalent a country, an industry, an individual, or a product emits or is responsible for.\nThe footprint is calculated in both direct emissions (from the burning of fossil fuels, heating, and transportation), and indirect emissions during the whole lifecycle of products.\nIt also includes emissions of other greenhouse gases, such as methane, nitrous oxide, or chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs).\nIt is expressed as a measure of weight, as in tons of CO2 or CO2 equivalent per year.\nWhat are carbon credits?\nCarbon credits are a system of purchasing and trading carbon emissions to mitigate the growth in concentrations of global atmospheric CO2 levels.\nThe term carbon credit usually refers to a tradable certificate or permit that shows a company, industry, or country, has paid to remove a certain amount of CO2 from the atmosphere.\nThis certificate gives them the right to emit 1 tonne of CO2 or the equivalent of different greenhouse gas. It is used by individuals or businesses to reduce their carbon footprint through investing in an activity that reduced, removed, or sequestered greenhouse gases at another site.\nThe trading of carbon credits has turned them into a type of climate currency, subject to supply and demand, just like fiat currencies.\nIndia at COP26:\n\nIndia is the 3rd largest emitter in terms of net emissions whereas it has the lowest per capita emission among the major economies of the world (17% of the world population emitting just 5% of total).\n\nIndia has announced its net-zero targets in COP26 s accordance with the Paris Agreement of 2015.\n\nUnder the Paris Agreement, countries were bound to submit carbon-cutting plans and updates by the end of 2020.\n\nIndia\u2019s 5-point pledge or Panchamrit:\n\nNet-zero by 2070\nTo increase its non-fossil fuel energy capacity to 500 GW by 2030.\nIncrease the share of renewables in the energy mix to 50% by 2030.\nReduce the emissions intensity of its economy by 45%.\nReduce emissions by 1 billion tonnes of CO2.\n\nIndia also supported the Africa Group\u2019s demand for $1 trillion in climate action that the developed countries should make available for climate action in developing nations.\n\nIndia\u2019s efforts at present:\nIndia\u2019s renewable energy capacity is 4th in the world as of now and growing at a rapid rate.\nIndia has seen an increase of about 25% in renewable energy capacity in the last four years.\nIndian railways, one of the largest emitters has promised to reach net-zero by 2030\u2013 this alone will reduce 60 million tonnes of emissions.\nIndia has launched international institutions for climate action such as the International Solar Alliance (ISA), Coalition for Disaster Resilient Infrastructure (CDRI),\nIndia along with the UK and Australia will launch the Infrastructure for Resilient Island States (IRIS) for the island nations and developing countries.\nIndia will also be part of the launch of the Green Grids Initiative.\nUPSC CSE Mains Questions about COP26\n\nQuestion) Describe the major outcomes of the 26th session of the Conference of the Parties (COP) to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC).

Stay updated with our latest content and enhance your exam readiness.\n\nDesertification is a type of land degradation in which a relatively dry region becomes increasingly arid, typically losing its water bodies as well as vegetation and wildlife.\n\n\ud83d\udc49 Which year are YOU targeting for success in the IAS/IPS/IFS Exam? \ud83d\ude80\n\n(1) \u21d2 UPSC 2025: Prelims cum Mains\n\n(2) \u21d2 UPSC 2026: Prelims cum Mains\n\n(3) \u21d2 UPSC 2027 Prelims cum Mains\n\nTip: Know more about ClearIAS Courses (Online/Offline)\n\nWhat are the causes of desertification?\n\nLand degradation has accelerated during the 20th\u00a0and 21st centuries due to increasing and combined pressures of agricultural and livestock production (over-cultivation, overgrazing, and forest conversion), urbanization, deforestation, and extreme weather events such as droughts and coastal surges, which salinate land.\n\nWater shortage: The deficit of water resources for crops and other vegetation affects their normal growth and eventually destabilizes other ecological processes.\nDraught: The lack of precipitation under high air temperatures causes droughts and water scarcity increases.\nClimate dryness: Arid climate strengthening due to an increase in air temperature, along with a decrease in vaporability and precipitation.\nDeforestation: Felling trees leads to an imbalance in the ecology and leads to soil erosion.\nOvergrazing: Excessive grazing by domestic animals increases the loss of vegetation and reduces the soil\u2019s ability to hold moisture.\nVegetation loss: The death of vegetation occurs due to the unavailability of water demand and the toxic matter concentration in soil and atmosphere increases.\nLack of drainage: Lack of natural groundwater drainage leads to water table rise, waterlogging, and salinization.\nSalinization: Salt accumulation in the root layer or aeration zone of soil leads to salinization and the land further loses water-holding capacity.\nSalt accumulation on irrigated fields: This type of salt accumulation is formed on irrigated fields when the inflow of water is more than the outflow (total evaporation, overflow from unsaturated zone in groundwater) under deficient natural and artificial drainage.\nSalt accumulation due to mining: Salt accumulation is formed due to mines, plants, and enterprise wastes where water without treatment is released to lands.\nWater erosion: It results in badland topography, the initial stage of desertification.\nWind erosion: This type is created due to the wind transfer of different kinds of dust and salt. Sources of this can be salt deserts, semi-deserts, dried sea beds, and salts within irrigated lands.\nDecreasing Groundwater table: Groundwater table lowering due to overexploitation of water resources and sea bed and water bodies desiccation.\nIrrigation: Excessive irrigation leads to waterlogging and if irrigation can be stopped due to a lack of water resources leads to low land fertility.\nLand Fertility: Loss of land fertility occurs due to land salinization and waterlogging due to lack of drainage and poor agricultural production practices. This type of desertification is typical for irrigated lands located in river deltas.\nImpact of desertification\n\nDesertification and land degradation are major threats to agricultural productivity in the world and water and quality air. It can affect human health through complex pathways. As land is degraded and deserts expand in some places, food production is reduced, water sources dry up and populations are pressured to move to more hospitable areas.\n\nEconomic impact: The decreasing agricultural productivity affects the livelihood of a major population. The increasing global population will add more strain to land and cause food shortages.\nClimate change: Degraded land loses its capacity to absorb carbon dioxide (CO2), a greenhouse gas (GHG) that is the biggest factor in worsening global warming.\nWater scarcity: Land degradation has resulted in deterioration in the quantity and quality of both surface and groundwater resources.\nEcological threat: The increasing desertification is threatening the flora and fauna of the regions.\n\nImpact on human health:\n\nMalnutrition from reduced food and water supplies;\nWater and food-borne diseases due to poor hygiene and a lack of clean water\nRespiratory diseases caused by atmospheric dust from wind erosion and other air pollutants\nThe spread of infectious diseases as populations migrate.\nGlobal scenario\n\nSahel region, North Africa\n\nThe Sahel region is a strip of land that stretches from one side of northern Africa to the other. It is bordered by the Sahara Desert to the north and by the rich savannahs and rainforests of Central and Western Africa to the south.\nIt experiences a rather dry, semi-arid climate, with a brief two-month wet season; however, the occurrence of long droughts coupled with systematic over-exploitation of the land makes this one of the world\u2019s most alarming desertification examples.\nHowever, overgrazing and agricultural practices within the region, which had been promoted by many national governments, also played a large part.\nIn 2007, 11 African governments launched the Great Green Wall of Africa in an attempt to mitigate the problem. This initiative aimed to plant a 15-kilometer wide and 8,000-kilometre-long plant barrier along the northern edge of the Sahel, to prevent the Sahara from expanding southwards.\n\nNingxia Hui, China\n\nThe Ningxia Hui Autonomous Region is located in northern China. Sandwiched between the Tenggeli, Wulanbu, and Maowusu Deserts, it is no surprise that Ningxia Hui has already seen desertification on an alarming scale, with just over half of its area having already been devoured by deserts.\nLike in the Sahel, a combination of human and climatic factors is to blame for this, and the threat has not gone away.\nA 2012 World Bank project has been largely successful in restoring vegetation cover, which has increased by around 40% and has kept the dunes in place.\n\nMurray-Darling Basin, Australia\n\nThe Murray-Darling basin covers a vast area of eastern and south-eastern Australia. Located to the east of a vast area of aridity that covers much of Australia, and largely within a semi-arid area susceptible to long droughts, desertification is a large issue within the region.\nClimatic factors have contributed massively to the desertification of the region, via long droughts such as the so-called \u2018Big Dry\u2019 that lasted from 1996 to 2012.\nHowever, as with the other desertification examples, human factors like overgrazing and soil degradation, as well as the salinization of the soil, are large additional contributors, all of which stem mainly from inappropriate farming practices.\nDesertification in India\n\nSix states in northeastern India were among the top 10 places in the country with the highest rates of desertification between 2003 and 2018, according to a recent report. These are Mizoram, Arunachal Pradesh, Assam, Tripura, Nagaland, and Meghalaya.\n\nPunjab, Delhi, Jammu Kashmir, and Uttarakhand in northern India also witnessed some of the highest rates of desertification, the most recent estimates by the Space Applications Centre under the Indian Space Research Organisation (ISRO).\n\nDesertification and Land Degradation Atlas: This is a document published by ISRO that shows that Land Degradation and Desertification have increased significantly in recent years. The Atlas provides a state-wise area of degraded lands for the time frame 2018-19. It also provides the change analysis for the duration of 15 years, from 2003-05 to 2018-19.\n\nRecently, the Indian Prime Minister delivered a keynote address at the UN\u00a0\u201cHigh-Level Dialogue on Desertification, Land Degradation, and Drought\u201d\u00a0via video conference.\n\nUnited Nations Convention to Combat Desertification (UN-CCD)\n\nEstablished in 1994, the United Nations Convention to Combat Desertification (UNCCD) is the sole legally binding international agreement linking environment and development to sustainable land management. The Convention addresses specifically the arid, semi-arid, and dry sub-humid areas, known as the drylands, where some of the most vulnerable ecosystems and peoples can be found.\n\nIndia is a signatory to the United Nations Convention on Combating Desertification (UNCCD). The country is committed to combating desertification and land degradation and intends to achieve land degradation-neutral status by 2030. MoEF&CC is the nodal Ministry for the implementation of the UNCCD. The status of India\u2019s desertification and land degradation is an important contribution to India\u2019s report to the UNCCD.\n\nSchemes by the Indian Government\n\nIntegrated watershed management system:\n\nIt aims to restore ecological balance by harnessing, conserving, and developing degraded natural resources with the creation of Rural Employment. Now it is subsumed under Pradhan Mantri Krishi Sinchai Yojana which is being implemented by NITI Ayog.\n\nDesert Development Programme:\n\nIt was launched in 1995 to minimize the adverse effects of drought and to rejuvenate the natural resource base of the identified desert areas. It was launched for hot desert areas of Rajasthan, Gujarat, and Haryana, and cold desert areas of Jammu & Kashmir and Himachal Pradesh.\n\nNational Afforestation Programme:\n\nIt has been implemented since 2000 for the afforestation of degraded forest lands. It is being implemented by the Ministry of Environment, Forest, and Climate Change\n\nNational Action Programme to Combat Desertification:\n\nIt was prepared in 2001 to address issues of increasing desertification and to take appropriate actions.\n\nNational Mission on Green India:\n\nIt was approved in 2014 to protect, restore, and enhance India\u2019s diminishing forest cover with a deadline of 10 years.\n\nIndia is working hard to achieve its national commitment to Land Degradation Neutrality (LDN)\u00a0(SDG Goal target 15.3). LDN is a state whereby the amount and quality of land resources, necessary to support ecosystem functions and services and enhance food security, remains stable or increases within specified temporal and spatial scales and ecosystems.\n\nWhat can be done to combat desertification?\n\nSome of the techniques that may help improve the consequences of desertification in croplands and woodlands include:\n\nSalt traps involve the creation of empty layers of gravel\u00a0and\u00a0sand\u00a0at certain depths in the soil. Salt traps prevent\u00a0salts from reaching the surface of the soil and also help to inhibit water loss.\nIrrigation improvements can inhibit water loss from evaporation and prevent salt accumulation. This technique involves changes in the design of irrigation systems to prevent water from pooling or evaporating easily from the soil.\nCover crops prevent soil\u00a0erosion\u00a0from\u00a0wind\u00a0and water. They can also reduce the local effects of drought. On larger scales,\u00a0plant\u00a0cover can help maintain normal rainfall patterns. Cover crops may be perennials or fast-growing annuals.\nCrop rotation involves the alternation of different crops on the same plot of land over different growing seasons. This technique can help maintain the productivity of the soil by replenishing critical\u00a0nutrients\u00a0removed during harvesting.\nRotational grazing is the process of limiting the grazing pressure of livestock in a given area. Livestock is frequently moved to new grazing areas before they cause permanent damage to the plants and soil of any one area.\nTerracing is the creation of multiple levels of flat ground that appear as long steps cut into hillsides. The technique slows the pace of runoff, which reduces soil erosion and retards overall water loss.\nContour bunding involves the placement of lines of stones along with the natural rises of a landscape, and contour farming. These techniques help to capture and hold rainfall before it can become runoff. They also inhibit wind erosion by keeping the soil heavy and moist.\nWindbreaks are the placing of lines of fast-growing trees planted at right angles to the prevailing surface winds. They are primarily used to slow wind-driven soil erosion but may be used to inhibit the encroachment of dunes.\nDune stabilization involves the conservation of the plant community living along the sides of dunes.

This includes working and broken items that are thrown in the garbage or donated to a charity reseller, their components, consumables, parts, and spares.\n\nE-waste is particularly dangerous due to toxic chemicals that naturally leach from the metals inside when buried.\n\nIt is divided into 21 types under\u00a0two broad categories:\n\nInformation technology and communication equipment. Examples: Cell phones, Smartphones, Desktop Computers, Computer Monitors, Laptops. Circuit boards, Hard Drives\nConsumer electrical and electronics. Examples: microwaves, heaters, remote controls, television remotes, electrical cords, lamps, smart lights, treadmills, smartwatches, heart monitors, etc.\nLeftover technology:\n\nToday, a growing amount of e-waste is not considered only to be products that have stopped working or become obsolete.\n\nTechnology is advancing at such a fast pace that a lot of electronic devices that still work fine are the ones considered obsolete. The updated versions of the devices replace the older ones which then become e-waste.\n\n\ud83d\udc49 Which year are YOU targeting for success in the IAS/IPS/IFS Exam? \ud83d\ude80\n\n(1) \u21d2 UPSC 2025: Prelims cum Mains\n\n(2) \u21d2 UPSC 2026: Prelims cum Mains\n\n(3) \u21d2 UPSC 2027 Prelims cum Mains\n\nTip: Know more about ClearIAS Courses (Online/Offline)\n\nHarmful effects of e-waste:\n\nElectronics contain toxic substances \u2013 therefore they must be handled with care when no longer wanted or needed.\n\nThe consequences of improper e-waste disposal in landfills or other non-dumping sites pose serious threats to current public health and can pollute ecosystems for generations to come. When electronics are improperly disposed of and end up in landfills, toxic chemicals are released, impacting the earth\u2019s air, soil, water, and ultimately, human health.\n\nEffects on Air quality:\n\nContamination in the air occurs when e-waste is informally disposed of by dismantling, shredding, or melting the materials, releasing dust particles or toxins, such as dioxins, into the environment that cause air pollution and damage respiratory health.\n\nChronic diseases and cancers are at a higher risk to occur when burning e-waste because it also releases fine particles, which can travel thousands of miles, creating numerous negative health risks to humans and animals.\n\nThe negative effects on air from informal e-waste recycling are most dangerous for those who handle this waste, but the pollution can extend thousands of miles away from recycling sites\n\nThe air pollution caused by e-waste impacts some animal species more than others, which may be endangering these species and the biodiversity of certain regions that are chronically polluted. Over time, air pollution can hurt water quality, soil, and plant species, creating irreversible damage to ecosystems.\n\nEffects on Soil\n\nWhen the improper disposal of e-waste in regular landfills or in places where it is dumped illegally, both heavy metals and flame retardants can seep directly from the e-waste into the soil, causing contamination of underlying groundwater or contamination of crops that may be planted nearby or in the area in the future. When the soil is contaminated by heavy metals, the crops become vulnerable to absorbing these toxins, which can cause many illnesses and doesn\u2019t allow the farmland to be as productive as possible.\n\nEffects on Water\n\nAfter soil contamination, heavy metals from e-waste, such as mercury, lithium, lead, and barium, then leak through the earth even further to reach groundwater.\n\nWhen these heavy metals reach groundwater, they eventually make their way into ponds, streams, rivers, and lakes. Through these pathways, acidification and toxicity are created in the water, which is unsafe for animals, plants, and communities even if they are miles away from a recycling site. Clean drinking water becomes problematic to find.\n\nAcidification can kill marine and freshwater organisms, disturb biodiversity, and harm ecosystems. If acidification is present in water supplies, it can damage ecosystems.\n\nEffects on Humans\n\nElectronic waste contains toxic components that are dangerous to human health, such as mercury, lead, cadmium, polybrominated flame retardants, barium, and lithium.\n\nThe negative health effects of these toxins on humans include brain, heart, liver, kidney, and skeletal system damage. It can also considerably affect the nervous and reproductive systems of the human body, leading to disease and birth defects.\n\nImproper disposal of e-waste is unbelievably dangerous to the global environment, which is why it is so important to spread awareness on this growing problem and the threatening aftermath.\n\nTo avoid these toxic effects of e-waste, it is crucial to properly re-cycle, so that items can be recycled, refurbished, resold, or reused.\n\nConcerning global data on e-waste\n20 to 50 million metric tons of e-waste are disposed of worldwide every year\nCell phones and other electronic items contain high amounts of precious metals like gold or silver.\nA large number of what is labeled as \u201ce-waste\u201d is not waste at all, but rather whole electronic equipment or parts that are readily marketable for reuse or can be recycled for materials recovery.\nOnly 12.5% of e-waste is currently recycled.\nE-waste leads to data theft hence adding to security woes.\nE-waste and the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development\n\nIn 2015, the United Nations General Assembly adopted the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) as an outline for the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development. In order to end poverty, protect the planet, and ensure prosperity for all 17 goals and 169 targets were set to be achieved in the next 13 years.\n\nThe environment is an integral part of each of the goals, with e-waste specifically linking to a number of these targets. Increasing levels of e-waste globally pose challenges for the implementation of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development.\u00a0 Hence it requires an efficient approach and coordinated action by the UN system to support the countries in their efforts to manage their e-waste in a sustainable manner and to minimize the creation of e-waste.\n\nSDG Target 3.9: By 2030, substantially reduce the number of deaths and illnesses from hazardous chemicals and air, water, and soil pollution and contamination.\n\nSDG Target 8.3: Promote development-oriented policies that support productive activities, decent job creation, entrepreneurship, creativity, and innovation, and encourage the formalization and growth of micro, small and medium-sized enterprises, including through access to financial services.\n\nSDG Target 8.8: Protect labor rights and promote safe and secure working environments for all workers, including migrant workers, in particular, women migrants, and those in precarious employment.\n\nSDG Target 11.6: By 2030, reduce the adverse per capita environmental impact of cities, including by paying special attention to air quality and municipal and other waste management.\n\nSDG Target 12.4: By 2020, achieve the environmentally sound management of chemicals and all wastes throughout their life cycle, in accordance with agreed international frameworks, and significantly reduce their release to air, water, and soil in order to minimize their adverse impacts on human health and the environment.\n\nSDG Target 12.5: By 2030, substantially reduce waste generation through prevention, reduction, repair, recycling, and reuse.\n\nImportant\u00a0 international agreements related to e-waste:\nInternational Convention for Prevention of Pollution from Ships (MARPOL)\n\nMARPOL addresses pollution from ships by oil; by noxious liquid substances carried in bulk; harmful substances carried by sea in packaged form; sewage, garbage; and the prevention of air pollution from ships.\n\nThe Basel Convention on the Control of Transboundary Movements of Hazardous Wastes and their Disposal (1989)\n\nThe Basel Convention aims to protect human health and the environment against the adverse effects resulting from the generation, management, transboundary movements, and disposal of hazardous and other wastes. Among key provisions of the Basel Convention are environmentally sound management, transboundary movement, waste minimization, and waste disposal practices aimed at mitigating adverse effects on human health and the environment.\n\nThe Nairobi Declaration and decision IX/6 was adopted by the 9th meeting of the conference of the parties to the Basel Convention in 2006 and gave a mandate to the secretariat of the Basel Convention to implement a work plan for the environment sound management of e-waste.\n\nMontreal Protocol on Ozone Depleting substances (1989)\n\nThe Montreal Protocol is an international treaty that aims to protect the ozone layer by phasing out the production and use of ozone-depleting substances (ODS). ODS, chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs), and hydrochlorofluorocarbon (HCFCs) as refrigerants are still used in some refrigerators and air conditioners. Waste refrigerators and air conditioners will also likely contain CFCs or HCFCs.\n\nUnited Nations Framework on Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC)\n\nAlthough not directly involved in e-waste, UNFCCC has been active as part of the e-waste from toxic to the green initiative. Through the initiative, waste pickers in India have been trained to collect electronic waste, such as computers and mobile phones, for safe disposal and recycling.\n\nRotterdam Convention on Prior Informed Consent Procedure for certain hazardous chemicals and pesticides in international trade (1998)\n\nThe Rotterdam Convention promotes shared responsibilities in relation to the international trade of certain hazardous chemicals in order to protect human health and the environment from potential harm. It also calls on exporters of hazardous chemicals to use proper labeling, to include directions on safe handling, and to inform purchasers of any known restrictions or bans.\n\nThe Durban Declaration, 2008\n\nThe declaration called for an African regional platform/forum on e-waste alongside international bodies. The requirements of the declaration are as follows: countries must review existing legislation, improve their compliance with legislation and amend existing legislation regarding e-waste management.\n\nE-waste generation in India\n\nAccording to the Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB), India generated more than\u00a010 lakh tonnes of e-waste in 2019-20,\u00a0an increase from\u00a07 lakh tonnes in 2017-18.\n\nBut the\u00a0e-waste dismantling capacity\u00a0has not been increased from\u00a07.82 lakh tonnes\u00a0since 2017-18.\n\nIn 2018, the Ministry of Environment had told the tribunal that\u00a095% of e-waste\u00a0in India is\u00a0recycled by the informal sector\u00a0and\u00a0scrap dealers unscientifically dispose of it\u00a0by burning or dissolving it in acids.\n\nE-Waste Management Rules, 2016\n\nThe Ministry of Environment, Forest and Climate Change (MoEFCC) notified the E-Waste Management Rules, 2016 by replacing the E-waste (Management & Handling) Rules, 2011.\n\nOver 21 products (Schedule-I) were included under the purview of the rule. It included Compact Fluorescent Lamp (CFL) and other mercury-containing lamps, as well as other such equipment.\nFor the first time, the rules brought the producers under Extended Producer Responsibility (EPR), along with targets. Producers have been made responsible for the collection of E-waste and its exchange.\nVarious producers can have a separate\u00a0Producer Responsibility Organisation(PRO) and ensure collection of E-waste, as well as its disposal in an environmentally sound manner.\nThe Deposit Refund Scheme has been introduced as an additional economic instrument wherein the producer charges an additional amount as a deposit at the time of sale of the electrical and electronic equipment and returns it to the consumer along with interest when the end-of-life electrical and electronic equipment is returned.\nThe role of State Governments has been also introduced to ensure the safety, health, and skill development of the workers involved in dismantling and recycling operations.\nA provision of penalty for violation of rules has also been introduced.\nUrban Local Bodies(Municipal Committee/Council/Corporation) has been assigned the duty to collect and channelize the orphan products to authorized dismantlers or recyclers.\nAllocation of\u00a0proper space to existing and upcoming industrial units for e-waste dismantling and recycling.\n\nAlso read: Biomedical Waste Management;\u00a0Battery waste management\n\nWay forward:\n\nE-waste management is a great challenge for governments of many developing countries such as India. This is becoming a huge public health issue and is exponentially increasing by the day.\n\nTo separately collect, effectively treat, and dispose of e-waste, as well as divert it from conventional landfills and open burning, it is essential to integrate the informal sector with the formal sector.\n\nThe competent authorities in developing countries need to establish mechanisms for handling and treatment of e-waste safely and sustainably.\n\nIncreasing information campaigns, capacity building, and awareness are critical to promoting environment-friendly e-waste management programs.\n\nMore efforts are required on the improvement of the current practices such as collection schemes and management practices to reduce the illegal trade of e-waste.\n\nReducing the number of hazardous substances in e-products will also have a positive effect in dealing with the specific e-waste streams since it will support the prevention process."

They are distributed across different states in India, such as Gujarat, Rajasthan, Madhya Pradesh, Uttar Pradesh, Maharashtra, and others.\nMuggers are smaller compared to saltwater crocs, with adult lengths typically ranging from 3 to 4 meters (9.8 to 13.1 feet).\nMuggers are well-adapted to freshwater environments and are known to be more tolerant of different water conditions than saltwater crocs.\nMedium-sized crocodiles (max. length of 4-5m) with the broadest snout of any living Crocodylus species, Mugger Crocodiles are hole-nesting species, with egg-laying taking place during the dry season.\nGharial\u00a0(Gavialis gangeticus)\n\nIUCN Red List Status: Critically Endangered\n\nThe Gharial derives its name from a bulbous knob-like bump on the snout of breeding males that resembles a ghara, which in Hindi means an earthen pot.\nThe bulbous snout makes them the only crocodile species on the planet with a visible difference between males and females.\nLargely piscivorous, their long, slender snout and rows of sharp teeth make them efficient fish catchers.\nAdults are dark olive or brownish olive in color, while the juveniles are greyish brown with five irregular bands on the upper body and nine on the tail.\nOnce a common sight within the subcontinent\u2019s riverine ecosystems, local gharial populations have declined by 98 percent since the 1940s, with fewer than 250 adult gharials remaining in the wild in 2006.\nConcerted conservation efforts have since borne fruit, with a recent survey by the Wildlife Trust of India (WTI) reporting 1,255 gharials in the Chambal River alone.\nConservation efforts\n\nIn response to declining crocodilian populations, in cooperation with the Government of India and State Governments, a crocodile conservation program, the UNDP/FAO Crocodile Breeding and Management Project, was launched in 1975.\n\nThis coupled with other measures, including notification of Bhitarkanika as a wildlife sanctuary, contributed significantly to the revival of the population in the next two decades.\nAs the number increased\u2014from just around 96 in 1974 to over 1,000 in 1995-the Forest Department had to stop the breeding program.\nThe protection measures put in place, however, continued to supplement the growth of the estuarine crocodiles.\nBut now the density of the population of saltwater crocodiles has led to issues of conflict with human settlements near the rivers.\nGlobal distribution of crocodiles\n\nCrocs are found in various regions around the world, primarily in tropical and subtropical habitats.\n\nAfrica:\n\nNile Crocodile (Crocodylus niloticus): Found in various freshwater habitats across sub-Saharan Africa, including the Nile River and its tributaries.\nAfrican Crocodile (Crocodylus anthropophagus): Native to Central Africa, including the Congo River basin.\nWest African Crocodile (Crocodylus suchus): Found in West and Central Africa, inhabiting freshwater and brackish habitats.\n\nAmericas:\n\nAmerican Crocodile (Crocodylus acutus): Found in parts of the Americas, including southern Florida, Mexico, Central America, northern South America, and the Caribbean.\nOrinoco Crocodile (Crocodylus intermedius): Native to the Orinoco River basin in Venezuela and Colombia.\nMorelet\u2019s Crocodile (Crocodylus moreletii): Found in freshwater habitats in Mexico, Belize, Guatemala, and Honduras.\n\nAsia:\n\nSaltwater Croc (Crocodylus porosus): Distributed across Southeast Asia, Northern Australia, the Indian subcontinent, and parts of the Indian and Pacific Oceans.\nSiamese Croc (Crocodylus siamensis): Historically found in Southeast Asia, its range has significantly declined, and conservation efforts are ongoing.\n\nAustralia:\n\nSaltwater Croc (Crocodylus porosus): Found in Northern Australia, particularly in estuaries, mangrove swamps, and coastal habitats.\nFreshwater Croc (Crocodylus johnsoni): Native to northern parts of Australia, inhabiting freshwater rivers and streams.\nAlligators\n\nAlligators are large, aquatic reptiles belonging to the family Alligatoridae, which is part of the order Crocodylia. There are two species of alligators: the American alligator (Alligator mississippiensis) and the Chinese alligator (Alligator sinensis).\n\nAmerican Alligator: Found in the southeastern United States, primarily in states like Florida, Louisiana, Georgia, Alabama, Mississippi, and parts of South Carolina, Texas, and North Carolina.\nChinese Alligator: Native to eastern China and historically found in the Yangtze River basin. The Chinese alligator is critically endangered, with a very limited and fragmented range.\nBasking: Alligators are ectothermic, and they regulate their body temperature by basking in the sun. They are often seen lying on riverbanks or logs with their mouths open.\nNocturnal Feeders: While they can be active during the day, alligators are primarily nocturnal feeders, hunting for prey in the evening and at night.\nConclusion\n\nConservation efforts in India have been crucial in ensuring the survival and protection of these croc species.\n\nVarious wildlife sanctuaries, conservation projects, and breeding programs have been implemented to safeguard croc populations and their habitats. The conservation success stories in India highlight the importance of these efforts in maintaining biodiversity and ecological balance.\n\nIt\u2019s worth noting that crocodiles are protected under wildlife conservation laws in India, and efforts are ongoing to mitigate human-crocodile conflicts and promote coexistence.\n\nThe conservation status of different crocodile species varies, with some facing threats due to habitat loss, hunting, and human-wildlife conflicts. Conservation efforts often involve habitat protection, captive breeding programs, and public awareness initiatives to promote the coexistence of crocodiles and human populations.\n\n-Article by Swathi Satish"

And 15 ZJ is enough energy to boil 2.3 billion Olympic-sized swimming pools of 50 m length, 25 m width, and 2 m depth.\n\nOHC provides insights into the distribution of heat within the ocean, the impact of climate change, and the potential influence on weather patterns.\n\nTable of Contents\n\nOcean heat content (OHC)\nHow is the heat content measured?\nFactors Influencing Ocean Heat Content\nSignificance of Ocean Heat Content\nGlobal Trends and Concerns\nConclusion\nOcean heat content (OHC)\n\nThe ocean is the largest solar energy collector on Earth. Not only does water cover more than 70 percent of our planet\u2019s surface, it can also absorb large amounts of heat without a large increase in temperature.\n\nThis tremendous ability to store and release heat over long periods gives the ocean a central role in stabilizing Earth\u2019s climate system.\n\n\ud83d\udc49 Which year are YOU targeting for success in the IAS/IPS/IFS Exam? \ud83d\ude80\n\n(1) \u21d2 UPSC 2025: Prelims cum Mains\n\n(2) \u21d2 UPSC 2026: Prelims cum Mains\n\n(3) \u21d2 UPSC 2027 Prelims cum Mains\n\nTip: Know more about ClearIAS Courses (Online/Offline)\n\nThe main source of ocean heat is sunlight. Additionally, clouds, water vapor, and greenhouse gases emit heat that they have absorbed, and some of that heat energy enters the ocean.\nWaves, tides, and currents constantly mix the ocean, moving heat from warmer to cooler latitudes and deeper levels.\n\nHeat absorbed by the ocean is moved from one place to another, but it doesn\u2019t disappear.\n\nThe heat energy eventually re-enters the rest of the Earth\u2019s system by melting ice shelves, evaporating water, or directly reheating the atmosphere.\nThus, heat energy in the ocean can warm the planet for decades after it is absorbed.\nIf the ocean absorbs more heat than it releases over a given time, its heat content increases.\nKnowing how much heat energy the ocean absorbs and releases is essential for understanding and modeling global climate.\nHow is the heat content measured?\n\nTo get global coverage, scientists turned to satellites that measure the height of the ocean\u2019s surface. As water warms, it expands, so estimates for ocean temperature can be deduced from sea surface heights.\n\nTo get a more complete picture of ocean heat content at different depths, scientists and engineers also use a range of in situ temperature-sensing instruments.\n\nAmong these are a fleet of more than 3,000 robotic \u201cfloats\u201d that measure ocean temperature around the world.\nKnown as Argo floats, the sensors drift through the ocean at different depths. Every 10 days or so, according to their programmed instructions, they rise through the water, recording temperature (and salinity) as they ascend.\nWhen a float reaches the surface, it sends its location and other information to scientists via satellite and then descends again.\n\nOther methods:\n\nSatellites equipped with infrared and microwave sensors measure sea surface temperatures, providing valuable data for estimating OHC.\nOceanographic buoys equipped with temperature sensors are strategically deployed to collect data on subsurface temperatures, allowing for a more comprehensive understanding of OHC.\nResearch vessels collect ocean temperature data during scientific expeditions, contributing to the understanding of OHC on regional scales.\nClimate models simulate oceanic and atmospheric processes to project future changes in OHC. These models help researchers assess the impact of climate change on the world\u2019s oceans.\nFactors Influencing Ocean Heat Content\nSolar Radiation: The sun\u2019s energy is a primary driver of OHC. The ocean absorbs solar radiation, particularly in the upper layers, influencing temperature distributions.\nAtmospheric Heat Exchange: Heat exchange between the ocean and the atmosphere plays a significant role. Factors like air temperature, humidity, and wind patterns influence this exchange.\nOcean Circulation: Ocean currents redistribute heat globally. Warm water is transported from the equator towards the poles, influencing regional climate patterns.\nGreenhouse Gas Effect: The absorption of infrared radiation by greenhouse gases, such as carbon dioxide, contributes to the warming of the ocean. This process is linked to anthropogenic climate change.\nOcean Mixing: Vertical and horizontal mixing within the ocean contribute to the distribution of heat. Processes like upwelling and downwelling influence temperature profiles.\nSignificance of Ocean Heat Content\nClimate Change Indicator: OHC is a key indicator of climate change. Increasing OHC is consistent with the warming of the Earth\u2019s surface due to elevated greenhouse gas concentrations.\nSea Level Rise: The expansion of seawater as it warms contributes to sea level rise. Monitoring changes in OHC is crucial for understanding and predicting sea level trends.\nImpact on Weather Patterns: Changes in OHC influence weather patterns and can lead to more intense and frequent extreme weather events, including hurricanes and heat waves.\nEcosystem Impact: The distribution of marine species is influenced by variations in OHC. Temperature changes can impact the breeding, migration, and survival of marine organisms.\nThermal Inertia: Oceans have a high thermal inertia, meaning they can store and release heat slowly. These characteristics moderate the Earth\u2019s climate by absorbing and redistributing heat over extended periods.\nGlobal Trends and Concerns\n\nMore than 90 percent of the warming that has happened on Earth over the past 50 years has occurred in the ocean.\n\nRecent studies suggest that warming extends to deeper layers of the ocean, highlighting the importance of monitoring surface temperatures and subsurface layers.\nChanges in OHC can have profound effects on marine ecosystems, including coral reefs, fisheries, and biodiversity.\nOHC influences atmospheric circulation patterns and can contribute to shifts in climate systems, such as El Ni\u00f1o and La Ni\u00f1a events.\n\nUnderstanding OHC is crucial for developing effective mitigation and adaptation strategies to address the impacts of climate change on coastal communities, ecosystems, and economies.\n\nConclusion\n\nOcean Heat Content is a key parameter in the study of climate science, providing essential information about the Earth\u2019s energy budget and the dynamics of the global climate system.\n\nMonitoring OHC trends and understanding the mechanisms driving changes in ocean temperatures are critical for making informed decisions about climate mitigation and adaptation efforts.\n\nWarm waters jeopardize the health of corals, and in turn, the communities of marine life that depend upon them for shelter and food.\n\nUltimately, people who depend upon marine fisheries for food and jobs may face negative impacts from the warming ocean.\n\nAs ongoing research improves our understanding of OHC, it will contribute to more accurate climate models and projections, aiding efforts to address the challenges posed by climate change.\n\nRelated articles:\n\nMarine heatwaves\nAtlantic Meridional Overturning Circulation (AMOC)\nInsolation and heat balance of earth\n\n-Article by Swathi Satish"

            "[CONTENT]": "The Holocene extinction, often referred to as the Sixth Mass Extinction or Anthropocene Extinction, is an ongoing period of biodiversity loss marked by a significant decline in the diversity and abundance of various species on Earth. Read here to learn more.\n\nUnlike previous mass extinctions, the Holocene extinction is primarily driven by human activities, particularly habitat destruction, overexploitation of resources, pollution, climate change, and the introduction of invasive species.\n\nThe term \u201cHolocene\u201d refers to the current geological epoch, which began approximately 11,700 years ago and continues to the present day.\n\nTable of Contents\n\nHolocene Extinction\nWhy is the Holocene extinction worrying?\nExamples of recent extinctions\nEfforts to curb the sixth mass extinction\nDe-extinction\nConclusion\nHolocene Extinction\n\nThe primary driver of the Holocene extinction is human activity. The expansion of agriculture, urbanization, deforestation, industrialization, and other anthropogenic activities has led to widespread habitat destruction and fragmentation.\n\nOverexploitation: Overharvesting of natural resources, including overfishing, poaching, and hunting, has contributed to the decline of numerous species. Economic activities driven by human demand for food, medicine, and other products have led to the depletion of many populations.\nHabitat Loss and Fragmentation: The conversion of natural habitats into agricultural land, urban areas, and infrastructure projects has significantly reduced the available living space for many species. Habitat fragmentation isolates populations, making it challenging for them to survive and reproduce.\nClimate Change: Human-induced climate change is altering temperature patterns, precipitation, and ecosystems. These changes can lead to shifts in species distribution, disrupt ecological relationships, and exacerbate the vulnerability of certain species.\nPollution: Pollution from industrial activities, agriculture, and waste disposal has contaminated air, water, and soil. Chemical pollutants and plastic waste, in particular, have harmful effects on ecosystems and wildlife.\nInvasive Species: The introduction of non-native species to new environments, intentionally or accidentally, can outcompete or prey upon native species, leading to their decline or extinction.\n\nCurrently, 40% of all land has been converted for food production. Agriculture is also responsible for 90% of global deforestation and accounts for 70% of the planet\u2019s freshwater use, devastating the species that inhabit those places by significantly altering their habitats.\n\nIt\u2019s evident that where and how food is produced is one of the biggest human-caused threats to species extinction and our ecosystems.\n\n\ud83d\udc49 Which year are YOU targeting for success in the IAS/IPS/IFS Exam? \ud83d\ude80\n\n(1) \u21d2 UPSC 2025: Prelims cum Mains\n\n(2) \u21d2 UPSC 2026: Prelims cum Mains\n\n(3) \u21d2 UPSC 2027 Prelims cum Mains\n\nTip: Know more about ClearIAS Courses (Online/Offline)\n\nUnsustainable food production and consumption are significant contributors to greenhouse gas emissions that are causing atmospheric temperatures to rise, wreaking havoc across the globe.\nThe climate crisis is causing everything from severe droughts to more frequent and intense storms.\nIt also exacerbates the challenges associated with food production that stress species, while creating conditions that make their habitats inhospitable.\nIncreased droughts and floods have made it more difficult to maintain crops and produce sufficient food in some regions.\nThe intertwined relationships among the food system, climate change, and biodiversity loss are placing immense pressure on our planet.\nWhy is the Holocene extinction worrying?\n\nSpecies do not exist in isolation; they are interconnected. A single species interacts with many other species in specific ways that produce benefits to people, like clean air, clean water, and healthy soils for efficient food production.\n\nWhen one species goes extinct in an ecosystem or its population numbers decline so significantly that it cannot sustain its important function, other species are affected, impacting the way the ecosystem functions and the benefits it provides.\n\nCurrently, the species extinction rate is estimated between 1,000 and 10,000 times higher than natural extinction rates, the rate of species extinction that would occur if humans were not around.\n\nWhile extinctions are a normal part of the evolutionary process, the current rates of species population decline and species extinction are high enough to threaten important ecological functions that support human life on Earth, such as a stable climate, predictable regional precipitation patterns, and productive farmland and fisheries.\n\nExamples of recent extinctions\n\nThe International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) characterizes \u2018recent\u2019 extinction as those that have occurred past the cut-off point of 1500, and at least 875 plant and animal species have gone extinct since that time and 2009.\n\nWhile it\u2019s challenging to provide a comprehensive list of all affected species, here are some examples of species that have been particularly impacted by the Holocene extinction:\n\nAmphibians:\n\nHarlequin Frog: Many species of harlequin frogs, once abundant in Central and South America, have experienced dramatic declines due to a combination of habitat loss and the spread of the chytrid fungus.\n\nBirds:\n\nPassenger Pigeon: The passenger pigeon was once one of the most abundant bird species in North America but became extinct in the early 20th century due to habitat destruction and overhunting.\nCalifornia Condor: Facing threats from lead poisoning, habitat destruction, and hunting, the California condor is one of the most critically endangered bird species.\n\nMammals:\n\nNorthern White Rhinoceros: The northern white rhinoceros is functionally extinct, with only two surviving females. Poaching for their horns and habitat loss have contributed to their decline.\nSumatran Orangutan: Orangutans, particularly the Sumatran orangutan, face severe threats from habitat destruction, primarily due to palm oil plantations.\nJavan Tiger: The Javan tiger became extinct in the mid-20th century due to habitat loss and hunting.\nPinta Island Tortoise: Lonesome George, the last known individual of this tortoise species, died in 2012, marking the species\u2019 extinction.\n\nReptiles:\n\nVaquita: The vaquita, a small porpoise species, is critically endangered, with a population decline primarily attributed to bycatch in illegal gillnets.\n\nInsects:\n\nMonarch Butterfly: The monarch butterfly population has declined due to habitat loss, pesticide use, and climate change, affecting their migratory patterns.\n\nFish:\n\nChinese Paddlefish: Declared extinct in 2020, the Chinese paddlefish was a large freshwater species that declined due to overfishing, habitat degradation, and dam construction.\n\nPlants:\n\nFranklinia Tree: This tree species, native to the southeastern United States, is believed to be extinct in the wild due to habitat loss.\n\nMarine Species:\n\nGreat Barrier Reef Corals: Coral reefs, including those in the Great Barrier Reef, are facing significant threats from climate change, coral bleaching, and ocean acidification.\nEfforts to curb the sixth mass extinction\nParis Agreement: We can ramp up our commitments to cutting carbon emissions under the Paris Agreement and limit global warming to 1.5 degrees Celsius.\nKunming-Montreal Agreement:\u00a0 The global fraternity needs to put more effort into conserving at least 30% of lands, inland waters, and oceans worldwide.\nDe-extinction\n\nDe-extinction reverses plant and animal extinctions by creating new proxy versions of previously lost species. Conservationists frame de-extinction as \u201cdeep ecological enrichment\u201d or restoring ecosystem functions lost through the extinctions of keystone species, which leave an ecological void by their absence.\n\nThis idea is the motivation for de-extinction projects: releasing resurrected animals into suitable habitats to increase biodiversity and restore ecosystem resilience. Assisted breeding, cloning, and genome editing are species restoration methods undertaken with the goal of re-establishing the dynamic processes that produce healthy ecosystems and restore biodiversity.\n\nTo de-extinct species, there are established research methods which include assisted breeding, cloning, and genetic engineering.\n\nAssisted breeding\u00a0uses the principles of\u00a0biobanking\u00a0and\u00a0assisted reproductive technologies to help restore species.\nAssisted reproductive scientists have highly characterized assisted breeding technologies in model species. However, non-model species have not been characterized at all, and this set includes many critically endangered species. These technologies enable scientists to increase overall population fitness and heterozygosity within fragmented populations.\nOne of the best examples of successful assisted reproductive technologies (ART) for species with declining populations is the Northern White Rhino project, which has been underway for decades and continues today. In projects such as these, scientists retrieve and preserve gametes (oocytes and sperm) from populations at the brink of extinction.\nCloning\u00a0is another option useful for continuing a species, but not for returning or bringing back a lost one.\nGenome editing and synthetic genomics, using tools like CRISPR, are addressing de-extinction with positive results.\nConclusion\n\nThe Holocene extinction underscores the urgency of addressing human-induced threats to biodiversity and implementing effective conservation strategies to ensure the survival of diverse species and the health of ecosystems.\n\n-Article by Swathi Satish"

The impact is not limited to a specific region.\nDiversity Loss: A large percentage of Earth\u2019s species, spanning various taxonomic groups, experience extinction during a mass extinction event. This loss of diversity has long-term consequences for ecosystems and the evolutionary trajectory of life.\nEcological Disruption: Mass extinctions often lead to significant disruptions in ecological relationships and food webs. The loss of key species can have cascading effects throughout ecosystems.\nOpportunities for Evolution: While mass extinctions result in widespread species loss, they also create ecological opportunities for the evolution and diversification of surviving species. New ecological niches become available as a result of the extinction event.\nEnvironmental Changes: Mass extinctions are often associated with significant environmental changes, including alterations in climate, sea levels, and atmospheric composition. These changes can be triggered by various factors such as asteroid impacts, volcanic activity, or long-term geological processes.\nGeological Significance: Mass extinctions are marked by distinctive geological signatures in the fossil record. The boundary between rock layers associated with the extinction event and those above it often reveals evidence of abrupt changes.\n\nThe history of life on Earth is punctuated by several recognized mass extinction events, each associated with different causes. Notable examples include the Permian-Triassic extinction (often referred to as the \u201cGreat Dying\u201d) and the Cretaceous-Paleogene extinction, which led to the demise of the dinosaurs.\n\nBig Five mass extinctions\nOrdovician-Silurian Extinction (End-Ordovician, around 443 million years ago):\nCauses: Possible causes include glaciation, sea-level changes, and decreased oxygen levels in the oceans.\nThe tectonic uplift of the Appalachian mountains created lots of weathering, sequestration of CO2, and with it, changes in climate and ocean chemistry.\nImpact: Approximately 85% of marine species were eliminated, particularly brachiopods and conodonts.\nLate Devonian Extinction (Late Devonian, around 360 million years ago):\nCauses: Possible causes include climate change, sea-level fluctuations, and the development of terrestrial ecosystems.\nImpact: About 75% of species, including many marine organisms, were affected.\nPermian-Triassic Extinction (End-Permian, around 252 million years ago):\nCauses: Likely a combination of volcanic activity, climate change, and the release of methane hydrates.\nIntense volcanic activity in Siberia caused global warming. Elevated CO2 and sulfur (H2S) levels from volcanoes caused ocean acidification, acid rain, and other changes in ocean and land chemistry.\nImpact: Often referred to as the \u201cGreat Dying,\u201d it resulted in the loss of around 96% of marine species and 70% of terrestrial vertebrate species.\nTriassic-Jurassic Extinction (End-Triassic, around 201 million years ago):\nCauses: Possibly related to volcanic activity in the Central Atlantic Magmatic Province (CAMP) and climate change.\nImpact: Approximately 80% of species in the oceans were affected, including many marine reptiles.\nCretaceous-Paleogene Extinction (End-Cretaceous, around 66 million years ago):\nCauses: Often associated with the impact of a large asteroid or comet, leading to a sudden environmental disruption.\nImpact: About 75% of Earth\u2019s species, including non-avian dinosaurs, became extinct. Mammals, birds, and certain reptiles survived and diversified.\nHolocene Extinction (Ongoing, from approximately 11,700 years ago to the present):\nCauses: Primarily driven by human activities, including habitat destruction, overexploitation, pollution, and climate change.\nImpact: Ongoing loss of biodiversity, affecting various species across the globe.\n\nRead:\u00a0Holocene Extinction\n\nWhy do we need to understand these events?\n\nUnderstanding mass extinctions is crucial for scientists studying Earth\u2019s history, evolution, and the factors that influence biodiversity.\n\nThe ongoing concern about human-induced environmental changes and the loss of biodiversity has led to increased awareness of the potential for a contemporary mass extinction, often referred to as the Holocene extinction or Anthropocene extinction.\nThis ongoing extinction event is driven by human activities such as habitat destruction, climate change, and overexploitation of resources.\n\nThere\u2019s a natural background rate to the timing and frequency of extinctions: 10% of species are lost every million years, 30% every 10 million years, and 65% every 100 million years.\n\nIt would be wrong to assume that species going extinct is out of line with what we would expect.\nEvolution occurs through the balance of extinction \u2013 the end of species \u2013 and speciation \u2013 the creation of new ones.\n\nHowever, mass extinctions are periods with much higher extinction rates than normal. They are defined by both magnitude and rate. Magnitude is the percentage of species that are lost. Rate is how quickly this happens. These metrics are inevitably linked, but we need both to qualify as a mass extinction.\n\nAlso read: Fossils: Everything you need to know\n\nConclusion\n\nThese mass extinctions have shaped evolution by opening ecological niches for new species to evolve. They are marked by profound changes in the composition of life on Earth and have been crucial in determining the trajectory of biological diversity.\n\nWhile natural events such as asteroid impacts and volcanic eruptions have played roles in some mass extinctions, human activities are increasingly recognized as significant contributors to the current ongoing extinction crisis, making conservation efforts crucial for preserving biodiversity.\n\nRead:\u00a0Geologic Time Scale\n\n-Article by Swathi Satish"

Harmful algal blooms, or HABs, occur when colonies of algae grow out of control. Read here to learn more.\n\nRecently, a report was published about the sea turning red at Puducherry Beach, and the preliminary analysis suggests an algal bloom.\n\nRanging from microscopic, single-celled organisms to large seaweeds, algae are simple plants that form the base of food webs.

While not all blooms are harmful, certain types can have detrimental effects on the ecosystem, water quality, and even human health.\n\nNutrient Enrichment: Algal blooms are often associated with an excess of nutrients, particularly nitrogen and phosphorus, in the water. These nutrients may come from agricultural runoff, sewage discharge, or other human activities.\nWarm Temperatures and Sunlight: Algal blooms tend to occur in warm conditions with abundant sunlight, as these factors promote the rapid growth of algae through photosynthesis.\nToxic Algae Species: Some algal blooms are caused by toxic species of algae, known as harmful algal blooms (HABs). These toxins can have adverse effects on aquatic life, animals, and humans.\nDepletion of Oxygen: As algae die and decompose, they consume oxygen. In cases of extensive algal blooms, the decomposition process can deplete oxygen levels in the water, leading to hypoxic or anoxic conditions, which can harm fish and other organisms.\nTypes of Algae in Blooms\nCyanobacteria (Blue-Green Algae): Certain species of cyanobacteria can form toxic algal blooms. The toxins produced by these algae, such as microcystins and saxitoxins, can be harmful to animals and humans.\nDinoflagellates: Some dinoflagellates, a type of microscopic algae, can cause red tide events. These algae can produce toxins that can lead to fish kills and harm marine organisms.\nDiatoms: Diatoms are a group of algae that can contribute to non-toxic algal blooms. While they are generally not harmful, their rapid growth can still have ecological consequences.\nGolden algae: Although found mostly in oceans, golden algae (Prymnesium parvum) are an emerging problem in freshwater rivers, reservoirs, and lakes, particularly those with higher salinity (due to higher mineral content).\nCauses of algal blooms\n\nAlgal blooms are caused by a combination of environmental factors that create favorable conditions for the rapid growth and proliferation of algae.\n\nNutrient pollution\n\nNutrients like nitrogen and phosphorus, essential to plant growth, are a natural part of underwater ecosystems. But when they run off urban and rural surfaces and flow into a river, lake, pond, or reservoir in excess, a phenomenon known as nutrient pollution, they act like fertilizer and promote the growth of algae and bacteria.\n\nWarm water\n\nAlgae thrive in warm water conditions. Warmer temperatures enhance the metabolic rates of algae, allowing them to grow and reproduce more quickly.\nAlgae are photosynthetic organisms that require sunlight for photosynthesis. Adequate sunlight promotes the photosynthetic activity of algae, leading to their rapid growth.\n\nStable Water Column\n\nIn some water bodies, especially freshwater lakes, stratification can occur, creating distinct layers of water with different temperatures. The stable stratification prevents the mixing of surface and deeper waters, trapping nutrients in the upper layer where they fuel algal growth.\n\nStagnant Water\n\nStagnant or slow-moving water allows algae to remain concentrated in one area, facilitating their growth. In contrast, swift currents may disperse algae, preventing the development of dense blooms.\n\nNatural or Anthropogenic Eutrophication\n\nEutrophication is the process by which a water body becomes enriched with nutrients, leading to increased algal growth. While natural eutrophication occurs over geological time scales, anthropogenic eutrophication is accelerated by human activities.\n\nOther causes\n\nAgricultural Runoff: Runoff from agricultural lands can carry fertilizers, pesticides, and other pollutants into water bodies, contributing to nutrient enrichment.\nUrban Runoff: Urban areas with impervious surfaces can contribute to nutrient-rich stormwater runoff, enhancing nutrient levels in water bodies.\nAlgae Trapping: Reservoirs created by dams can trap nutrients, leading to increased nutrient concentrations in the water. This can create conditions favorable for algal blooms.\nAltered Precipitation Patterns: Changes in precipitation patterns, a consequence of climate change, can influence nutrient runoff and water temperature, affecting the occurrence and intensity of algal blooms.\n\nRead:\u00a0Planetary boundaries; Nitrogen pollution\n\nImpact of Algal Blooms\nWater Quality Degradation: Algal blooms can lead to the deterioration of water quality by reducing clarity and imparting undesirable colors and odors to the water.\nFish Kills: Depletion of oxygen during the decomposition of algae can result in fish kills and harm other aquatic organisms.\nToxicity to Animals: Harmful algal blooms can produce toxins that are harmful to aquatic animals, leading to illness or death.\nHuman Health Risks: Some algal blooms produce toxins that pose health risks to humans through exposure via recreational activities, drinking water, or consumption of contaminated seafood.\nEconomic Impact: Algal blooms can have economic implications, affecting fisheries, tourism, and recreational activities.\nPrevention and Mitigation\nNutrient Management: Implementing practices to reduce nutrient runoff from agriculture and urban areas can help prevent excessive nutrient enrichment in water bodies. These practices include planting cover crops, diversifying what\u2019s grown, reducing tillage, properly applying compost and manure, and following fertilizer best practices.\nMonitoring and Early Detection: Regular monitoring of water bodies for algal biomass and toxin levels can facilitate early detection and management of potential algal blooms.\nWater Treatment: Certain water treatment technologies, such as the use of algaecides, can be employed to control algal blooms in specific situations. Protecting wetlands, which act as natural filters to improve water quality, capture runoff, and enhance biodiversity, is also vital.\nRestoration of Riparian Zones: Restoration of riparian zones and wetlands can help filter nutrients before they enter water bodies, reducing the risk of algal blooms.\nConclusion\n\nAlgal blooms are complex phenomena influenced by various environmental factors. Managing and mitigating their impacts often requires a holistic approach that addresses nutrient inputs, land-use practices, and the restoration of natural ecosystems.\n\nUnderstanding the interactions among the factors is crucial for managing and preventing algal blooms. Implementing measures to control nutrient inputs, improve water quality, and promote sustainable land and water management practices can help mitigate the occurrence and impacts of algal blooms.\n\n\u00ad-Article by Swathi Satish"

Read here to learn more about the FRA.\n\nThe Forest Rights Act was enacted to address historical injustices, promote social justice, and conserve biodiversity.\n\nThe FRA was passed 17 years ago, and it is still far from fulfilling its promise to liberate forest inhabitants from historical injustices and to democratize forest administration.\n\nTable of Contents\n\nHistory of forest rights in India\nSalient Features of the Forest Rights Act (FRA) 2006\nAdvantages of the Forest Rights Act\nDisadvantages and Challenges\nWay forward\nHistory of forest rights in India\n\nThe history of forest rights in India is characterized by a complex interplay of colonial policies, traditional practices of forest-dwelling communities, and efforts to address historical injustices.\n\nDuring British colonial rule, forest management policies were primarily focused on revenue generation and resource extraction, leading to the declaration of reserved forests and stringent forest regulations.\n\nTribal and forest-dwelling communities traditionally had symbiotic relationships with forests and faced displacement and loss of access to resources due to these policies.\n\n\ud83d\udc49 Which year are YOU targeting for success in the IAS/IPS/IFS Exam? \ud83d\ude80\n\n(1) \u21d2 UPSC 2025: Prelims cum Mains\n\n(2) \u21d2 UPSC 2026: Prelims cum Mains\n\n(3) \u21d2 UPSC 2027 Prelims cum Mains\n\nTip: Know more about ClearIAS Courses (Online/Offline)\n\nThe colonial government introduced the Indian Forest Act, of 1878 which was based on the idea of \u2018eminent domain\u2019 which means that the ruler always owns all property.\nThe statutes of the Indian Forest Act, of 1927, were the rights of settlements that were provided by the procedure but were followed hardly.\n\u2018Forest Villages\u2019 were created to ensure labor for forestry operations, wherein forest land was leased for agriculture to households (mostly Adivasis) in return for compulsory labor.\n\nFollowing Independence, not much changed.\n\nIn a rush to unite princely States and zamindari estates, the government annexed their forest regions without first determining the legal status of the local population.\nThen, to accommodate a burgeoning population, the government leased out forest tracts under several initiatives including \u201cGrow More Food,\u201d although these were never adequately managed.\nEminent domain was again the basis for creating the Forest (Conservation) Act of 1980 and the Wildlife (Protection) Act of 1972.\nThe Forest Conservation Act, of 1980 aimed at restricting diversion of forestland for non-forest purposes. While its intent was conservation, it often led to the displacement of forest communities.\n\nThe late 20th century witnessed the emergence of the \u201cRecognition of Forest Rights\u201d movement, highlighting the struggles of forest-dwelling communities for recognition of their customary rights.\n\nIn 2006, the Scheduled Tribes and Other Traditional Forest Dwellers (Recognition of Forest Rights) Act, 2006, commonly known as the Forest Rights Act (FRA), was enacted to recognize and vest forest rights in forest-dwelling communities.\n\nThe period following the enactment of the FRA has seen the identification and vesting of forest rights in various states, providing legal recognition to forest-dwelling communities.\nSalient Features of the Forest Rights Act (FRA) 2006\nRecognition of Rights: The FRA recognizes the rights of forest rights and occupation in Forest land in Forest Dwelling Scheduled Tribes (FDST) and Other Traditional Forest Dwellers (OTFD) residing in such forests for generations.\nVesting of Rights: Forest rights, including individual and community rights, are vested in the forest-dwelling communities, providing legal recognition to their historical and cultural connections with the land.\nCategories of Rights: The act delineates various rights, including individual rights to cultivate, community rights over common property resources, and rights for traditional seasonal access to forests.\nGram Sabha\u2019s Role: The Gram Sabha, or village assembly, plays a central role in the implementation of the act. It is involved in the identification of beneficiaries and the extent of Individual Forest Rights (IFR) Community Forest Rights (CFR) or both that may be given to FDST and OTFD.\nCultural and Religious Rights: FRA acknowledges the cultural and religious rights of forest-dwelling communities, ensuring the protection of their customs, traditions, and rituals.\nConsent of Gram Sabha: Prior informed consent of the Gram Sabha is required for the diversion of forestland for non-forest purposes, ensuring the participation of local communities in decision-making.\nProtection against Eviction: The act prohibits the eviction of forest dwellers from their traditional habitats, providing a safeguard against displacement.\nRole of Committees: Various committees, such as the District Level Committee (DLC) and Sub-Divisional Level Committee (SDLC), are established to facilitate the process of verification and approval of claims.\n\nThe Act identifies four types of rights:\n\nTitle rights: It gives FDST and OTFD the right to ownership of land farmed by tribals or forest dwellers subject to a maximum of 4 hectares. Ownership is only for land that is being cultivated by the concerned family and no new lands will be granted.\nUse rights: The rights of the dwellers extend to extracting Minor Forest Produce, grazing areas, etc.\nRelief and development rights: To rehabilitate in case of illegal eviction or forced displacement and to basic amenities, subject to restrictions for forest protection.\nForest management rights: It includes the right to protect, regenerate, conserve, or manage any community forest resource that they have been traditionally protecting and conserving for sustainable use.\nAdvantages of the Forest Rights Act\nEmpowerment of Forest Communities: FRA empowers marginalized forest communities by recognizing and vesting rights, leading to improved socio-economic conditions and a sense of ownership.\nBiodiversity Conservation: By involving local communities in forest management, the act contributes to biodiversity conservation as these communities often have traditional knowledge about sustainable resource use.\nSocial Justice: FRA addresses historical injustices by recognizing the rights of tribal and forest-dwelling communities, promoting social justice and inclusive development.\nProtection of Livelihoods: The act protects the livelihoods of forest-dependent communities by granting them legal rights to access and use forest resources sustainably.\nParticipatory Governance: FRA promotes a participatory approach to governance, involving local communities in decision-making processes related to forest management.\nDisadvantages and Challenges\nImplementation Challenges: Inconsistent implementation across states and regions has led to challenges in realizing the objectives of the FRA.\nImplementation of digital processes, such as the VanMitra software in Madhya Pradesh, has posed challenges in areas with poor connectivity and low literacy rates.\nLack of Awareness: Limited awareness and understanding of the provisions of the act among forest-dwelling communities have hindered the effective implementation of the FRA.\nBureaucratic Hurdles: Complex administrative procedures and bureaucratic hurdles have slowed down the process of recognition and vesting of forest rights.\nConflict with Conservation Goals: There is an ongoing debate about the perceived conflict between recognizing traditional rights and the need for conservation, especially in protected areas.\nIncomplete Implementation: The process of recognizing and vesting rights is incomplete in many areas, leading to continued vulnerability and insecurity for forest-dwelling communities.\nLegal Challenges: Legal challenges and disputes related to the interpretation of provisions and verification of claims have resulted in delays and uncertainties.\nWay forward\n\nThe Act aims to provide a more democratic framework for forest governance, but it has been impacted by bureaucratic indifference, political opportunism, and resistance from foresters.\n\nSome states want to recognize rights as soon as possible, but in places like Chhattisgarh, quick implementation frequently benefits the Forest Department, twisting rights and giving bureaucrats too much power.\n\nPolitical leaders, bureaucrats, and environmentalists must understand and support the FRA\u2019s core principles to address this problem. In the absence of such measures, historical injustices will persist, democratic forest governance will be absent, and the potential for community-led conservation and sustainable livelihoods will remain untapped.\n\nRead: Forest management; Social Forestry\n\n-Article by Swathi Satish"

Thereafter many more cases were reported from West Bengal and other States like Bihar, Uttar Pradesh, Jharkhand, Assam, etc.\n\nThe problem of high Arsenic levels in drinking water has been observed in parts of the USA, Canada, Argentina, Chile, Mexico, Hungary, and many countries of the Southeast Asia Region which contains a natural Arsenic-rich eco-belt formed by Arsenic-laden alluvium or sediments deposited in the Brahmaputra-Gangetic River basins millions of years ago.\n\nCountries of Southeast Asia that are in this belt include Bangladesh, parts of India, Myanmar, and Nepal.\n\nTable of Contents\n\nArsenic\nArsenic contamination in India\nCauses of Arsenic Contamination\nHealth Impacts of Arsenic contamination\nGovernment Initiatives\nChallenges\nArsenic Removal Technologies\nWay forward\nConclusion\nArsenic\n\nArsenic occurs naturally in the environment and can be released into water through natural activities such as hydrothermal action & dissolution of rocks.\n\nIt occurs in both inorganic and organic forms.\nInorganic Arsenic compounds (such as those found in water) are highly toxic while organic Arsenic compounds (such as those found in seafood) are less harmful to health.\nShift from surface water and shallow open well sources to deep tube wells in Arsenic affected areas has also led to Arsenic contamination in some States.\nArsenic leaching may also occur from industrial sources or Arsenic-containing insecticides, herbicides, or rodenticides.\n\nArsenic is introduced into soil and groundwater during weathering of rocks and minerals followed by subsequent leaching and runoff.\n\n\ud83d\udc49 Which year are YOU targeting for success in the IAS/IPS/IFS Exam? \ud83d\ude80\n\n(1) \u21d2 UPSC 2025: Prelims cum Mains\n\n(2) \u21d2 UPSC 2026: Prelims cum Mains\n\n(3) \u21d2 UPSC 2027 Prelims cum Mains\n\nTip: Know more about ClearIAS Courses (Online/Offline)\n\nIt can also be introduced into soil and groundwater from anthropogenic sources.\nArsenic is emitted into the atmosphere by high-temperature processes such as coal-fired power plants, burning vegetation, and volcanism.\nIn water, particularly groundwater, where there are sulfide mineral deposits and sedimentary deposits deriving from volcanic rocks, the concentrations can be significantly elevated. Natural low-temperature biomethylation and reduction of arsines also release arsenic into the atmosphere.\nArsenic contamination in India\n\nArsenic contamination is prevalent in several states in India, with the most severely affected areas located in the Ganges-Brahmaputra delta region.\n\nStates such as West Bengal, Bihar, Jharkhand, Uttar Pradesh, and Assam are particularly impacted.\nThe contamination is primarily found in groundwater sources, which many communities rely on for drinking water.\n\nBIS, specification for drinking water (IS10500:2003) specified both values as 0.05mg/l. However, in 2012, BIS reduced the desirable limit of Arsenic from 0.05mg/l to 0.01mg/l while retaining the permissible limit of 0.05mg/l.\n\nCauses of Arsenic Contamination\nNatural Sources: Arsenic contamination in groundwater is often a result of geological processes, where arsenic naturally occurs in certain rock formations. The release of arsenic into groundwater can be influenced by factors such as sedimentation and redox conditions.\nHuman Activities: While natural sources play a significant role, human activities like mining, industrial processes, and the use of arsenic-containing pesticides can also contribute to localized contamination.\n\nRead:\u00a0Groundwater depletion and contamination in India\n\nHealth Impacts of Arsenic contamination\n\nLong-term intake of arsenic-contaminated water leads to arsenic poisoning or arsenicosis, with cancer of the skin, bladder, kidney, or lung or diseases of the skin (color changes, and hard patches on palms and soles), or blood vessels of legs and feet.\n\nArsenicosis is defined as\u00a0a chronic health condition arising from prolonged ingestion of Arsenic above the safe dose for at least six months, usually manifested by characteristic skin lesions of melanosis and keratosis, occurring alone or in combination, with or without the involvement of internal organs.\n\nFresh evidence indicates a possible association between the intake of contaminated water and to onset of diabetes, hypertension, and reproductive disorders.\n\nChronic Health Issues: Prolonged exposure to elevated levels of arsenic in drinking water can lead to chronic health issues, including skin lesions, various cancers (particularly skin, lung, and bladder cancers), and neurological effects.\nVulnerable Populations: Children, pregnant women, and individuals with pre-existing health conditions may be more susceptible to the adverse health effects of arsenic exposure.\nGovernment Initiatives\n\nWater is a state subject, the responsibility of groundwater management, including taking initiatives for improving groundwater quality and mitigating the contamination issue, lies primarily with the state governments. However, several steps have also been taken by the Central Government in this regard.\n\nWater Quality Monitoring: The government has implemented water quality monitoring programs to assess arsenic levels in groundwater and identify contaminated areas.\n\nCentral Pollution Control Board (CPCB) in association with State Pollution Control Boards/Pollution Control Committees (SPCBs/PCCs) is implementing the provisions of the Water (Prevention & Control) Act, 1974, and the Environment (Protection) Act, 1986 to prevent and control pollution in water.\nDepartment of Drinking Water & Sanitation had launched a National Water Quality Sub-Mission (NWQSM) as a part of the National Rural Drinking Water Programme (NRDWP), which has now been subsumed under JJM, to provide safe drinking water to arsenic/fluoride-affected rural habitations in the country.\n\nMitigation Measures: Various mitigation measures have been initiated, including the installation of arsenic removal technologies and the promotion of alternative safe water sources.\n\nThe government of India, in partnership with States, has been implementing the Jal Jeevan Mission (JJM) since 2019 to provide potable tap water supply of prescribed quality and on a regular & long-term basis to every rural household in the country.\nAtal Mission for Rejuvenation and Urban Transformation (AMRUT) scheme has been implemented since 2015, in selected 500 cities and towns across the country it focuses on the development of basic urban infrastructure in the AMRUT cities, such as water supply, sewerage & septage management, stormwater drainage, green spaces & parks, and non-motorized urban transport.\nFurther, AMRUT- 2.0 was launched in 2021 for the period of 05 years (FY 2021-22 to 2025-26), to provide universal coverage of water supply through functional household tap connections in all statutory towns in the country.\nChallenges\nInfrastructure and Resources: Many arsenic-affected areas, especially in rural and remote regions, lack adequate infrastructure for implementing and maintaining arsenic mitigation technologies and water supply systems.\nFinancial Constraints: Insufficient financial resources hinder the implementation of large-scale arsenic mitigation projects, especially in economically disadvantaged regions.\nSelecting the right Technologies: Identifying and implementing suitable arsenic removal technologies for specific hydrogeological conditions is challenging. What works in one area may not be effective in another.\nMaintenance and Operation: Sustaining the functionality of arsenic removal technologies requires ongoing maintenance and operational support. Communities may lack the resources or knowledge to maintain these systems.\nAwareness and Education: Lack of awareness about the risks of arsenic exposure and insufficient education on water quality and safety can hinder community participation in mitigation efforts.\nIncreased Demand: Population growth in affected regions increases the demand for safe water, adding pressure to existing water supply systems and making it challenging to meet the needs of growing communities.\nHydrogeological Changes: Climate change can influence hydrogeological conditions, potentially affecting the mobility and distribution of arsenic in groundwater, and complicating mitigation strategies.\nArsenic Removal Technologies\n\nAdoption of arsenic removal technologies, such as activated alumina, iron removal filters, and community-based water treatment plants, is crucial in mitigating the contamination.\n\nTapping groundwater from alternate arsenic-free aquifers at a higher depth and proper sealing-off of the arsenic-bearing aquifer from the same.

Read further to learn more about the impact of invasive species on the environment.\n\nAccording to a new study, extreme weather might be wreaking havoc across the globe, but some non-native plants and animals could be benefiting from the disasters, adding risk to already threatened local species.\n\nThese species can outcompete or prey upon native species, disrupt natural habitats and lead to biodiversity loss.\n\nInvasive species are a major driver of global environmental change.\n\nTable of Contents\n\nInvasive species\nImpact on Biodiversity\nPrevention and Management of invasive Species\nConclusion\nInvasive species\n\nInvasive species are usually introduced to new environments either intentionally or unintentionally by human activities. This can occur through trade, transportation, agriculture, or even as pets.\n\nThese species, often transported by human activity, are thought to be playing a major role in global extinction rates and the catastrophic declines of biodiversity threatening the well-being of people and the planet.\nOnce introduced, they can spread rapidly and establish self-sustaining populations.\nBallast water from ships is a common pathway for the introduction of non-native species. Species from one region may be inadvertently transported in ballast water and released in a new location.\nGlobal trade and climate change contribute to the spread of non-native species. Changes in temperature and precipitation patterns can create new suitable habitats for invasive species.\n\nExamples of Invasive Species:\n\n\ud83d\udc49 Which year are YOU targeting for success in the IAS/IPS/IFS Exam? \ud83d\ude80\n\n(1) \u21d2 UPSC 2025: Prelims cum Mains\n\n(2) \u21d2 UPSC 2026: Prelims cum Mains\n\n(3) \u21d2 UPSC 2027 Prelims cum Mains\n\nTip: Know more about ClearIAS Courses (Online/Offline)\n\nPlants: Kudzu (in the United States), Water hyacinth (in various regions), Japanese knotweed (in Europe and North America), and Chestnut blight (in North America, and Europe).\n\nAnimals: Brown tree snake (in Guam), Cane toad (in Australia), Burmese python (in the Florida Everglades), Zebra mussels (in North America and Europe), European starling (in North America, Australia, and South Africa).\n\nMicroorganisms: Dutch elm disease (affecting elm trees globally).\n\nImpact on Biodiversity\n\nInvasive species can outcompete native species for resources such as food, water, and shelter, leading to declines or extinctions of native flora and fauna.\n\nPredatory invasive species can disrupt food webs by consuming or outcompeting native predators.\nThese species can alter ecosystem processes and functions. For example, they may change fire regimes, nutrient cycling, and water flow patterns.\nInvasive plants may alter fire regimes in ecosystems, making them more susceptible to wildfires. Some invasive plants are adapted to thrive in post-fire conditions, further altering the composition of plant communities.\nThese species often outcompete native species for resources such as sunlight, water, nutrients, and space. This can lead to a decline in native plant and animal populations.\nThey may act as predators or herbivores, consuming native species that may not have evolved defenses against them. This can result in a decline or extinction of native species.\nThese can modify or destroy native habitats. This may occur through activities such as burrowing, nesting, or altering the physical characteristics of the environment, leading to changes in soil composition and hydrology.\nHybridization between invasive and native species can occur, leading to genetic introgression. This can result in the loss of unique genetic traits in native populations.\n\nEconomic Impact: Invasive species can have severe economic consequences. They may damage crops, reduce agricultural yields, and increase the cost of controlling their populations. Control and eradication efforts for them can be expensive and challenging.\n\nHuman Health: Some of these species can pose risks to human health. For example, certain plants and animals may be toxic or carry diseases that can affect humans and domestic animals.\n\nPrevention and Management of invasive Species\n\nPreventing the introduction of non-native species is often more effective and cost-efficient than trying to control established populations.\n\nManagement strategies may include physical removal, chemical control, biological control (introducing natural enemies of the invasive species), and public education.\n\nInternational cooperation and regulations, such as the International Plant Protection Convention (IPPC) and the International Maritime Organization\u2019s (IMO) guidelines on ballast water management, play crucial roles in addressing the spread of invasive species.\n\nIt is important to implement measures that prevent and control the introduction and spread of invasive species to protect ecosystems and biodiversity.\n\nEarly identification of non-native species is crucial. Implementing rapid response plans allows for the quick control and containment of newly introduced species before they become established.\nConduct thorough risk assessments to evaluate the potential impact of species before they are introduced. Implement and enforce regulations to control the import, sale, and release of potentially invasive species.\nnon-native species often cross borders. International cooperation and information exchange help address the global nature of the problem. Regional agreements and collaborations are valuable for coordinated efforts.\nRaise awareness among the public, industries, and stakeholders about the risks associated with non-native species. Promote responsible practices, such as cleaning boats and equipment to prevent the spread of invasive species.\nImplement quarantine measures to inspect and regulate the movement of goods and organisms that may carry invasive species. This is particularly important for international trade.\nDevelop and enforce biosecurity protocols in agriculture, aquaculture, and other sectors to minimize the risk of introducing non-native species.\nIntroduce natural enemies or predators of the invasive species to control their populations. This method requires careful consideration to avoid unintended ecological consequences.\nUse an integrated approach that combines various strategies, including biological, chemical, and mechanical methods, to manage invasive species sustainably and effectively.\nConclusion\n\nThe invasive species can be managed especially if detected early, then even complete eradication is also possible. Implementing control measures to manage established populations of invasive species is necessary. This may include the use of biological controls, chemical treatments, mechanical removal, or habitat manipulation.\n\nAddressing non-native species requires a comprehensive and collaborative approach that involves governments, communities, scientists, and various stakeholders working together to prevent, detect, and manage these threats to ecosystems and biodiversity.\n\nAfter controlling or eradicating non-native species, undertake restoration efforts to rehabilitate ecosystems. This may involve reintroducing native species, restoring habitats, and improving ecosystem resilience.\n\nContinuously monitor ecosystems for the presence of invasive species and assess the effectiveness of management strategies. Ongoing research helps refine and develop new management techniques.\n\nInvolve local communities in invasive species management efforts. Community engagement fosters a sense of responsibility and can lead to more effective control and prevention measures.\n\nRelated articles:\n\nGeneral Issues on Environmental Ecology, bio-diversity, and Climate Change\nWildlife Crime\nSpecies Reintroduction\n\n-Article by Swathi Satish"

It often leads to the erosion of riverbanks and can have a significant impact on river ecosystems.\nBeach Mining: Sand is often mined from beaches, especially in coastal areas with high tourism and construction demands. This can lead to the erosion of beaches, which threatens coastal communities and ecosystems.\nDredging: Dredging is the process of removing sand from the seabed or ocean floor using specialized equipment, such as dredgers. It is typically used for large-scale projects, such as harbor expansion.\nIn-Stream Mining: In-stream mining involves extracting sand from the river channel itself. This can disrupt the natural flow of rivers and harm aquatic life.\nEnvironmental and Social Impacts\nHabitat Destruction: Sand extraction can destroy river and beach habitats, which are critical for various aquatic species and nesting sea turtles.\nErosion: The removal of sand from riverbeds and beaches can lead to increased erosion and a higher risk of flooding in adjacent areas.\nWater Quality: Sand extraction can cause the sedimentation of rivers and streams, leading to reduced water quality and impacting aquatic ecosystems.\nThreat to Biodiversity: Many species depend on healthy river and coastal ecosystems. Sand extraction can disrupt their habitats and lead to declines in biodiversity.\nLivelihoods: Coastal communities often rely on tourism and fishing, and sand mining can negatively affect these industries. It can also displace local communities.\nHealth and Safety: Sand extraction is often labor-intensive and can expose workers to hazardous conditions and respiratory issues due to dust and airborne particles.\nIllegal sand mining\n\nIllegal sand mining, also known as sand theft or sand poaching, refers to the unlawful extraction of sand from rivers, beaches, or other natural environments. It is a widespread environmental problem with significant ecological, social, and economic consequences.\n\nIllegal sand extraction can have severe environmental consequences.\n\nIt disrupts river ecosystems, leading to erosion, loss of habitat for aquatic life, and alterations in river flow patterns.\nIt can also lead to the degradation of coastal areas, impacting coastal ecosystems and increasing the risk of erosion and flooding.\nSand is a finite and non-renewable resource, and illegal mining contributes to the depletion of this resource.\nThe excessive removal of sand can result in the loss of valuable sediment that helps maintain beaches, riverbanks, and deltas.\nThe extraction of sand from rivers can disturb aquatic ecosystems, harm fish breeding grounds, and contribute to the decline of aquatic species. This disruption can have cascading effects on local biodiversity.\n\nIllegal sand extraction can have negative social and economic impacts on local communities.\n\nIt can lead to the displacement of communities that depend on riverbanks for their livelihoods, such as fishing and agriculture.\nIt can also exacerbate conflicts between various stakeholders, including sand miners, local communities, and government authorities.\nSand mining often involves hazardous working conditions, with workers at risk of accidents, injuries, and exposure to harmful substances. Unregulated mining operations can pose health and safety risks to workers and nearby communities.\nThe removal of sand from riverbeds can undermine the stability of bridges, embankments, and other infrastructure, leading to structural damage and maintenance costs.\n\nThe illegal sand trade often involves smuggling sand across borders and the operation of a black market. This can contribute to organized crime, money laundering, and corruption.\n\nIndia\n\nIn India, sand extraction grew after the rapid urbanization brought on by the economic liberalization in the 1990s.\n\nEven though the country has sand mining laws in place, a lack of proper implementation and monitoring means that the riverbeds are constantly threatened.\n\nLocals have complained about the impact of sand extraction on the migratory birds and fishes visiting River Yamuna.\n\nRead Impact of sand mining on Indian Rivers (Down to Earth) for the grim picture.\n\nRegulation and Control\n\nEfforts to regulate and control sand extraction vary by region and country. Some common approaches include:\n\nLicensing and Permitting: Requiring sand mining operations to obtain licenses or permits, which may include environmental impact assessments.\nZoning and Land Use Planning: Designating specific areas for sand extraction and excluding sensitive habitats.\nEnvironmental Laws: Enforcing laws that protect natural resources, water quality, and ecosystems.\nMonitoring and Enforcement: Regular monitoring and inspections to ensure compliance with regulations.\nIndia\n\nSand is a minor mineral under Section 3(e) of the Mines and Minerals (Development & Regulation) Act, 1957 (MMDR Act).\n\nSection 15 of the MMDR Act empowers the State Governments to make rules for regulating the grant of quarry leases, mining leases, or other mineral concessions in respect of minor minerals and for purposes connected therewith.\nHence, the regulation of minor minerals comes under the legislative and administrative domain of the State Governments.\nFurther, Section 23C of the MMDR Act empowers the State Governments to make rules for preventing illegal mining, transportation and storage of minerals and for the purposes connected therewith.\n\nMinistry of Mines has prepared a \u2018Sand Mining Framework\u2019 in consultation with Mining Departments of the States incorporating best practices amongst States with the objectives of sustainability, availability, affordability, and transparency in sand mining.\n\nThe \u2018Sand Mining Framework\u2019 has been circulated to all the State Governments for necessary action.\nMoreover, the Ministry of Environment, Forest & Climate Change has issued Sustainable Sand Mining Management Guidelines, 2016, which, inter-alia, addresses the issues relating to the regulation of sand mining.\n\nAccording to the 2020 Sand Mining Regulations, the permission to extract sand given to any mining contractor would be audited mandatorily every two years based on the replenishment rate of sand and gravel after every monsoon. Further mining can be done only after this.\n\nWay forward\n\nTo address the negative impacts of sand mining, various sustainable alternatives are being explored.\n\nResearchers are investigating the use of alternative materials like recycled construction waste and crushed rock. Along with innovations, implementing environmentally friendly quarrying practices, such as reclamation and reforestation should be practiced.\n\nPromoting responsible consumption and construction practices to reduce the demand for sand is also significant.\n\nOverall, sand mining is a complex issue with economic, environmental, and social dimensions. Balancing the need for sand with responsible and sustainable mining practices is essential to mitigate its negative impacts and protect the environment and communities that depend on it.\n\n-Article by Swathi Satish"

Despite this, there are still only 1,249 Yangtze finless porpoises.\nThe South American River Dolphin Initiative has also demonstrated the power of partnerships, by bringing organizations together to advance science, satellite tag river dolphins to discover more about their movement and behavior, and raise awareness about the role of river dolphins \u2013 and the threats to their survival.\n\nAlso read:\u00a0Major Rivers of the World\n\nGlobal Declaration of River Dolphins\n\nThe Global Declaration for River Dolphins aims to halt the decline of all river dolphin species and increase the most vulnerable populations.\n\nIt will scale up collective efforts to safeguard the remaining river dolphin species, by developing and funding measures to eradicate gillnets, reduce pollution, expand research, and increase protected areas.\nIt also aims to enhance the health of rivers, which are the lifeblood of many communities and economies as well as sustaining critical ecosystems from rainforests to deltas.\n\nThe eight pillars of the Declaration are:\n\nCreating a network of protected areas\nEnhancing management of river dolphin sites\nExpanding research and monitoring\nEngaging local communities and Indigenous Peoples\nEradicating unsustainable fishing practices\nImproving water quality and quantity\nCelebrating World River Dolphin Day to raise awareness\nIncreasing resource allocation and partnerships\n\nRiver dolphin range states that adopted the Global Declaration for River Dolphins include Bangladesh, Bolivia, Brazil, Cambodia, Colombia, Ecuador, India, Nepal, Pakistan, Peru, and Venezuela. There was also a representative from the regional government in Indonesia that was responsible for the Mahakam River.\n\nIndia\u2019s Efforts for Conservation of Dolphin\n\nAs per studies conducted on river dolphins, the population of Gangetic dolphin in the mainstream Ganga is known to be stable, although there has been a decline in tributaries.\n\nThe important steps taken by the Government for the conservation of the Gangetic dolphin include:\n\nGangetic river dolphin is listed in Schedule \u2013I of the Wild Life (Protection) Act, 1972, according to the highest degree of protection.\nGangetic river dolphin has been designated as the National Aquatic Animal of India.\nThe Ministry has included the Gangetic River dolphin as one of the 22 critically endangered species for providing financial assistance to States under the Centrally sponsored scheme \u2018Development of Wildlife Habitats\u2019.\nImportant habitats of Gangetic River dolphins along the Ganges River have been notified as Protected Areas, such as Vikramshila Dolphin Sanctuary, Bihar.\nA comprehensive action plan (2022-2047) has been developed to ensure the well-being of the river dolphin and aquatic habitats, the role of various stakeholders and line Ministries have been identified.\nProject Dolphin is an Indian government initiative to conserve both riverine and oceanic dolphin species launched in 2021.\nIndia\u2019s first center for research on conserving the endangered Gangetic river dolphin, the National Dolphin Research Centre (NDRC), located close to the Ganga River in Patna, was inaugurated on March 4, 2024.\n\nRead:\u00a0Wildlife Conservation Projects\n\nWay forward\n\nProtecting river dolphins, which are among the world\u2019s most endangered cetaceans, requires a combination of conservation measures, research, and community engagement.\n\nHabitat Conservation: Protect and restore the natural habitats of the species, which often include river systems and their associated ecosystems. This includes efforts to reduce pollution and preserve freshwater ecosystems.\n\nWater Quality Management: Implement strict water quality standards to reduce pollution, including the discharge of industrial and agricultural chemicals into rivers. This will help maintain healthy habitats for them.\n\nBycatch Mitigation: Develop and implement bycatch reduction strategies to prevent accidental entanglement in fishing gear. Education and training of local fishers are essential.\n\nConservation Legislation: Enact and enforce laws and regulations that protect the species and their habitats. This includes designating critical habitats, regulating fishing practices, and imposing penalties for illegal activities that harm them.\n\nMonitoring and Research: Conduct research and long-term monitoring of populations to better understand their behavior, biology, and the threats they face. This data is essential for informed conservation decisions.\n\nEco-Tourism and Sustainable Livelihoods: Promote eco-tourism as a means of generating income for local communities while raising awareness about the species. This can provide economic incentives for conservation.\n\nHydropower Development: Implement hydropower projects with a focus on minimizing environmental impacts on river ecosystems and ensuring safe fish passage. It\u2019s important to balance energy development with conservation goals.\n\nInternational Collaboration: Collaborate with neighboring countries to protect river dolphins that migrate across borders. International cooperation can be critical for the conservation of transboundary species.\n\nAwareness and Education: Raise public awareness about the importance of the species and their conservation. Education programs in schools and communities can help change attitudes and behaviors.\n\nRed List and Conservation Status: Ensure that the species are appropriately categorized on the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) Red List. This classification can influence funding, legal protection, and conservation priorities.\n\nConservation Funding: Secure funding for targeted conservation initiatives through grants, donations, and government support. Funding is crucial for research, monitoring, and conservation activities.\n\nClimate Change Mitigation: Address climate change, which can affect river ecosystems and freshwater resources. Efforts to mitigate climate change can indirectly benefit the species.\n\nLegal Frameworks: Advocate for the inclusion of their conservation in international agreements and conventions, such as the Convention on Migratory Species and the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora.\n\nTranslocation and Rescue: In extreme cases, consider translocating or rescuing individuals to establish or reinforce populations in safer habitats. However, this should be a last resort and based on a thorough scientific assessment.\n\n-Article by Swathi Satish"

The boundary aims to limit global warming to a level that avoids catastrophic climate change impacts.\nBiosphere Integrity: This boundary focuses on the preservation of biodiversity and the integrity of ecosystems. It aims to prevent species extinctions and maintain the functioning of ecosystems, as biodiversity is crucial for ecosystem services that support human well-being.\nStratospheric Ozone Depletion: This boundary addresses the depletion of the ozone layer in the Earth\u2019s stratosphere, which protects living organisms from harmful ultraviolet (UV) radiation. Efforts have been made to reduce the use of ozone-depleting substances, leading to the partial recovery of the ozone layer.\nLand System Change: This boundary concerns the conversion of natural ecosystems into agricultural land, urban areas, or other forms of land use change. It aims to prevent the loss of crucial ecosystem services and the disruption of carbon and nutrient cycles.\nFreshwater Change: This boundary relates to the consumption of freshwater resources. It focuses on maintaining sustainable water use to ensure the availability of clean water for various human needs and ecosystem health.\nBiogeochemical Flows: This boundary covers the global cycling of essential elements like phosphorus and nitrogen. It seeks to prevent excessive nutrient pollution, which can lead to problems like eutrophication and harmful algal blooms in water bodies.\nOcean Acidification: This boundary addresses the increasing acidity of the oceans due to the absorption of excess atmospheric CO2. Ocean acidification can harm marine ecosystems and fisheries.\nAtmospheric Aerosol Loading: This boundary relates to the release of human-made aerosols (tiny particles) into the atmosphere, which can have both cooling and warming effects on the climate. Managing aerosol loading is essential for understanding and mitigating climate change.\nNovel entities: This boundary pertains to the release of synthetic chemicals and pollutants (microplastics, endocrine disruptors, and organic pollutants) into the environment. It aims to reduce chemical pollution that can harm ecosystems, wildlife, and human health.\nBreach of boundaries\n\nThe latest planetary boundaries framework update finds that six of the nine boundaries are transgressed, suggesting that Earth is now well outside of the safe operating space for humanity.\n\nThe value of atmospheric CO2 concentration contributing to climate change was set at 350 parts per million (ppm) by the researchers. Currently, this has reached 417 ppm.\nFor biosphere integrity, the researchers kept a limit of less than 10 extinctions per million species-years. Human-induced species extinctions have far exceeded the safe limit.\nThe study estimated the extinction rate was greater than 100 extinctions per million species-years. It is estimated that around one million of the 8 million plant and animal species are threatened with extinction.\nIn the last 150 years, over 10% of the genetic diversity of flora and fauna has been wiped out.\nThe global forest land area has dropped below the safe limit of 75%, currently standing at only 60%.\nBoth blue water (surface and groundwater) and green water (available water for plants) have experienced impacts beyond their safe thresholds.\nFlows of nutrients like phosphorus and nitrogen in the environment have surged beyond safe limits.\nHuman influence on novel entities, including microplastics, endocrine disruptors, and organic pollutants, has transgressed the zero boundary.\nStratospheric ozone depletion, aerosol loading, and ocean acidification were found to be within the planetary boundary as of now.\nInternational initiatives\n\nThere is not a single international initiative solely dedicated to addressing breaches of planetary boundaries, several global efforts and agreements are aimed at addressing environmental challenges that contribute to or intersect with these boundaries. Some of these initiatives include:\n\nUnited Nations Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs): The SDGs, particularly Goal 13 (Climate Action), Goal 14 (Life Below Water), and Goal 15 (Life on Land), address critical aspects of planetary boundaries such as climate change, biodiversity loss, and ecosystem degradation.\nParis Agreement: The Paris Agreement, adopted under the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC), aims to limit global warming to well below 2 degrees Celsius above pre-industrial levels. It addresses one of the most significant planetary boundary concerns, climate change.\nConvention on Biological Diversity (CBD): The CBD focuses on preserving biodiversity and preventing its loss, directly related to the planetary boundary of biosphere integrity.\nAichi Biodiversity Targets: These are a set of 20 global targets under the CBD, aimed at halting biodiversity loss and the degradation of ecosystems.\nConvention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora (CITES): CITES regulates international trade in endangered species to ensure their survival and prevent overexploitation.\nSustainable Agriculture Initiatives: Various international initiatives, such as the Sustainable Agriculture Goals and the Global Soil Partnership, work to address planetary boundaries related to land use, agriculture, and soil degradation.\nCircular Economy Initiatives: The Ellen MacArthur Foundation and other organizations promote the transition to a circular economy to reduce waste, minimize resource depletion, and reduce the pressure on planetary boundaries related to resource use.\nOceans and Marine Conservation: Initiatives like the United Nations Decade of Ocean Science for Sustainable Development, marine protected area networks, and efforts to combat plastic pollution in the oceans aim to address planetary boundaries related to marine ecosystems and ocean health.\nInternational Climate Finance: Programs like the Green Climate Fund (GCF) and the Global Environment Facility (GEF) provide financial support for climate mitigation and adaptation projects in developing countries.\nInternational Cooperation on Air and Water Quality: Agreements like the Convention on Long-Range Transboundary Air Pollution and the Ramsar Convention on Wetlands address air and water quality issues that can impact planetary boundaries.\nCorporate Sustainability Initiatives: Many multinational corporations have adopted sustainability goals and initiatives to reduce their environmental footprint and contribute to addressing planetary boundaries.\n\nWhile these initiatives are diverse and address various aspects of planetary boundaries, there is growing recognition of the need for a more integrated approach to address the interconnected challenges of climate change, biodiversity loss, pollution, and resource depletion.\n\nRecent development\n\nAquatic deoxygenation as a new planetary boundary\n\nAuthors of a new paper in Nature Ecology and Evolution, \u201cAquatic deoxygenation as a planetary boundary and key regulator of Earth system stability\u201d, among whom are experts of the IOC Global Ocean Oxygen Network (GO2NE) expert working group, are calling for freshwater and marine oxygen concentrations to be recognised as a new planetary boundary.\n\nOxygen is a fundamental requirement of life, and the loss of oxygen in water, referred to as aquatic deoxygenation, is a threat to life at all levels.\nThe new paper emphasises the threat that deoxygenation presents to aquatic life and human society dependent on it, as we all are.\nRecognition of aquatic deoxygenation as a planetary boundary acknowledges its critical interlinkages with other boundaries and helps to focus international monitoring, research and policy efforts.\nWay forward\n\nThe Planetary Boundaries Framework is intended to guide policymakers, scientists, and society in managing Earth\u2019s resources and environment sustainably.\n\nCrossing these boundaries could result in abrupt and potentially irreversible environmental changes, with severe consequences for human well-being.\n\nHence, staying within these boundaries is crucial for maintaining a stable and habitable planet for future generations.\n\nIt\u2019s important to note that ongoing scientific research and assessments may refine the boundaries and add new dimensions to our understanding of Earth\u2019s limits.\n\nAchieving a sustainable future will require continued global cooperation and efforts to stay within planetary boundaries while meeting human development needs.\n\nAlso read:\u00a0Prithvi Vigyan\n\n-Article by Swathi Satish"

There is a global movement involving numerous agencies and countries pushing to criminalize environmental destruction.\n\nEcocide is derived from Greek and Latin, and translates to \u2018killing one\u2019s home\u2019 or \u2018environment\u2019.\n\nTable of Contents\n\nWhat is Ecocide?\nHistory of Ecocide\nChallenges in Addressing Ecocide\nIndia\u2019s stand\nConclusion\nWhat is Ecocide?\n\n\u201cEcocide\u201d is a term used to describe extensive and severe environmental damage or destruction, often as a result of human activities.\n\nIt refers to actions or processes that cause widespread harm to ecosystems, biodiversity, and the natural environment on a scale that significantly disrupts the balance of nature and poses a threat to life on Earth.\nWhile the term \u201cecocide\u201d is not a universally recognized legal concept, it has gained attention in discussions about environmental law and international criminal law.\n\nThe idea behind \u201cecocide\u201d is to acknowledge and potentially criminalize acts that cause severe and lasting harm to the environment, similar to the way crimes against humanity and genocide are treated under international law.\n\n\ud83d\udc49 Which year are YOU targeting for success in the IAS/IPS/IFS Exam? \ud83d\ude80\n\n(1) \u21d2 UPSC 2025: Prelims cum Mains\n\n(2) \u21d2 UPSC 2026: Prelims cum Mains\n\n(3) \u21d2 UPSC 2027 Prelims cum Mains\n\nTip: Know more about ClearIAS Courses (Online/Offline)\n\nProponents argue that recognizing ecocide as an international crime could hold individuals, corporations, and governments accountable for actions that lead to large-scale environmental destruction.\n\nEfforts to formally include ecocide in international law are ongoing, with some activists and legal experts advocating for its inclusion in the Rome Statute of the International Criminal Court (ICC).\n\nIn 2021, a panel of criminal and environmental lawyers from around the world created a legal definition for \u201cecocide\u201d as the basis of a push to criminalize mass damage and destruction of ecosystems.\n\nThe definition was made available for states to consider and is part of an ongoing effort by NGO Stop Ecocide to add environmental damage to the list of international crimes at the International Criminal Court.\nCurrently, ecocide is a crime in 11 countries \u2013 including Russia and Ukraine \u2013 and it is being considered in another 27 countries, according to the Thomson Reuters Foundation.\nHistory of Ecocide\n\nIn 1972, the Swedish prime minister, Olof Palme, gave a speech at the UN Conference on the Human Environment, in which he said:\n\n\u201cThe immense destruction brought about by indiscriminate bombing, by large-scale use of bulldozers and herbicides is an outrage sometimes described as ecocide, which requires urgent international attention.\u201d\n\nWhile the term itself has gained prominence more recently, the idea of environmental harm and its consequences has a long history.\n\nThroughout history, humans have altered their environments to meet their needs. This has sometimes led to localized environmental degradation, such as deforestation, soil erosion, and pollution, which could be considered early forms of ecocide.\n\nIndustrial Revolution and Pollution:\n\nThe Industrial Revolution, which began in the late 18th century, brought about significant technological advancements but also increased pollution and environmental damage. Factories, coal mines, and increased use of fossil fuels contributed to air and water pollution.\n\nSilent Spring (1962):\n\nRachel Carson\u2019s influential book \u201cSilent Spring\u201d brought attention to the harmful effects of pesticides, particularly DDT, on the environment and wildlife. It played a pivotal role in raising awareness about the unintended ecological consequences of human activities.\n\nEnvironmental Movements:\n\nThe mid-20th century saw the rise of environmental movements, such as the conservation movement, Earth Day (established in 1970), and the Greenpeace organization.\nThese movements highlighted concerns about environmental degradation and called for conservation and sustainability\n\nRead: Doomsday clock\n\nEmergence of the Term \u201cEcocide\u201d:\n\nThe term \u201cecocide\u201d itself gained prominence in the late 20th century. It was used by environmentalists and scholars to describe the large-scale destruction of ecosystems, often linked to activities like deforestation, oil spills, and habitat destruction.\nIn 1970, biologist Arthur Galston was the first to draw a connection between environmental devastation and genocide (which is recognized as an international crime).\nHe made this link when addressing the U.S. military\u2019s utilization of Agent Orange, an herbicide, during the Vietnam War.\n\nRome Statute and Ecocide:\n\nIn recent years, there have been efforts to establish ecocide as an international crime. The proposed inclusion of ecocide as the fifth international crime under the Rome Statute of the International Criminal Court (ICC) is one notable example.\nThe term \u201cecocide\u201d has been proposed as a potential fifth international crime under the jurisdiction of the International Criminal Court (ICC), alongside genocide, crimes against humanity, war crimes, and aggression.\n\nThe concept of ecocide remains the subject of ongoing debate, with discussions around its legal definition and implications.\n\nSome argue that recognizing ecocide as a crime could provide legal mechanisms for addressing environmental destruction on a global scale.\n\nChallenges in Addressing Ecocide\n\nRecognizing ecocide as a crime and addressing its challenges is a complex and evolving issue. Here are some key challenges associated with addressing ecocide:\n\nLegal Definition and Recognition:\n\nOne of the primary challenges is to establish a clear and internationally recognized definition of ecocide as a crime. While there have been discussions about including ecocide as the fifth crime against peace in the Rome Statute of the International Criminal Court (ICC), achieving consensus on the specific language and scope of the definition has proven difficult.\n\nEnforcement Mechanisms:\n\nEven if ecocide is defined as a crime, establishing effective enforcement mechanisms is challenging. This includes the identification of responsible parties, jurisdictional issues, and practical difficulties in investigating and prosecuting ecocide cases, particularly when transnational corporations or state actors are involved.\n\nPolitical and Economic Interests:\n\nThe interests of powerful economic and political actors can be a significant barrier to addressing ecocide. Industries that contribute to environmental destruction, such as fossil fuels, mining, and deforestation, often have considerable influence and resources to protect their interests.\n\nProof and Attribution:\n\nEstablishing a direct causal link between specific actions and environmental harm can be complex. Additionally, proving intent or negligence in cases of ecocide may require substantial evidence and expertise, making prosecution challenging.\n\nJurisdictional Issues:\n\nEcocide can occur across borders, and jurisdictional issues may arise when multiple countries are affected by the same environmental harm. Determining which legal system should handle such cases can be a contentious issue.\n\nAccountability of Corporations:\n\nHolding corporations accountable for ecocide poses particular challenges due to their complex legal structures and global operations. Existing legal frameworks may not be sufficient to address the responsibility of multinational corporations for environmental harm.\n\nIndigenous Rights and Land Disputes:\n\nMany cases of ecocide involve conflicts over land and resources, often affecting indigenous communities. Respecting indigenous rights, addressing land disputes, and involving affected communities in decision-making are essential but challenging aspects of addressing ecocide.\n\nPolitical Will and Public Awareness:\n\nBuilding political will to recognize and address ecocide can be difficult, as it may require overcoming powerful interests and a shift in public perception. Generating public awareness and support for ecocide as a crime is an ongoing challenge.\n\nScientific Uncertainty:\n\nScientific uncertainty about the long-term ecological impacts of certain activities can complicate efforts to establish ecocide as a crime. Critics may argue that harm was not foreseeable or that the connection between the action and harm is uncertain.\n\nInternational Cooperation:\n\nAddressing ecocide often requires international cooperation, as environmental harm can cross borders. Developing a coordinated global response to ecocide is challenging due to differing national interests and priorities.\nIndia\u2019s stand\n\nIndia had not explicitly defined its stance on ecocide as a legally recognized international crime.\n\nIndia, like many other countries, has not officially adopted the term \u201cecocide\u201d as a distinct international crime within its legal framework.\nAlso, India has neither signed nor ratified the Rome Statute of the International Criminal Court and has not expressed any official position on the proposal to criminalize ecocide at the international level.\n\nHowever, India, as a member of the international community, is committed to addressing environmental issues and concerns through various international agreements and conventions.\n\nThese include agreements related to climate change, biodiversity conservation, and sustainable development such as:\n\nThe Convention on Biological Diversity\nThe United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change\nConvention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora.\n\nIndia\u2019s approach to environmental issues is often based on the principles of equity and common but differentiated responsibilities, emphasizing the need for developed countries to take the lead in addressing global environmental challenges.\n\nIndia has been actively involved in negotiations related to climate change, including the Paris Agreement, where it has pledged to reduce its greenhouse gas emissions and enhance its resilience to climate impacts.\n\nConclusion\n\nDespite these challenges, there is a growing global movement advocating for the recognition of ecocide as a crime and the development of legal mechanisms to address it.\n\nIt is a complex and evolving area of law and policy, and addressing ecocide will likely require sustained efforts at both national and international levels, as well as collaboration among governments, civil society, and the private sector.\n\nThe discussions surrounding the recognition of ecocide as an international crime are ongoing within international legal and environmental circles.\n\nThe precise definition and consequences of ecocide, as well as its inclusion in international law, remain subjects of debate.\n\nFor more environmental notes click here.\n\n-Article by Swathi Satish"

It seeks to understand how environmental factors, such as climate, geology, and land use, influence the distribution, abundance, behaviour, and adaptation of living organisms in natural and human-altered landscapes.\n\nWhat is Bio-diversity?\n\nBiodiversity is the short form of biological diversity. It refers to the variety of life on Earth.\n\nBiodiversity can be understood at several levels:\n\n\ud83d\udc49 Which year are YOU targeting for success in the IAS/IPS/IFS Exam? \ud83d\ude80\n\n(1) \u21d2 UPSC 2025: Prelims cum Mains\n\n(2) \u21d2 UPSC 2026: Prelims cum Mains\n\n(3) \u21d2 UPSC 2027 Prelims cum Mains\n\nTip: Know more about ClearIAS Courses (Online/Offline)\n\nSpecies Diversity: This is the simplest level of biodiversity and refers to the variety of different species in a particular area or on the entire planet. A diverse range of species is important for ecosystem stability and resilience.\nGenetic Diversity: Genetic diversity focuses on the genetic variation within species. It\u2019s crucial for the adaptability of species to changing environmental conditions and for breeding programs in agriculture and conservation.\nEcosystem Diversity: This level of biodiversity looks at the variety of ecosystems, such as forests, grasslands, wetlands, and coral reefs, and the interactions between different ecosystems in a region. Ecosystem diversity supports various ecological functions and services.\nWhat is Climate Change?\n\nClimate change refers to long-term alterations in the average weather patterns and conditions on Earth. It encompasses shifts in temperature, precipitation, wind patterns, and other climatic factors over an extended period, typically decades to millions of years. Climate change can manifest as both natural variations and human-induced alterations to the Earth\u2019s climate system.\n\nThere are two primary components of climate change:\n\nNatural Climate Change: Earth\u2019s climate has undergone natural variations throughout its history. Factors such as changes in the Earth\u2019s orbit, volcanic eruptions, and variations in solar radiation have historically contributed to natural climate fluctuations over geological timescales.\nHuman-Induced Climate Change: In recent history, human activities have become a significant driver of climate change. The burning of fossil fuels (such as coal, oil, and natural gas), deforestation, industrial processes, and agricultural practices have released greenhouse gases, primarily carbon dioxide (CO2), into the atmosphere. These gases trap heat from the sun, leading to the greenhouse effect, which causes the Earth\u2019s average temperature to rise\u2014an effect commonly referred to as global warming. The increase in global temperatures is a hallmark of modern human-induced climate change.\nGeneral Issues on Environmental Ecology, Bio-diversity and Climate Change\n\nThe world is at a pivotal moment in history, where environmental ecology, biodiversity, and climate change converge to create a complex web of challenges.\n\nAs we grapple with the consequences of our actions on the planet, it becomes increasingly evident that we must address these interconnected issues collectively and urgently.\n\nIn this blog post, we will explore the general issues surrounding environmental ecology, biodiversity, and climate change, highlighting their interdependence and the critical need for global action.\n\n1. Environmental Ecology: Understanding Our Ecosystems\n\nEnvironmental ecology is the study of the relationships between living organisms and their surrounding environments. It examines the intricate balance that sustains life on Earth, from the tiniest microorganisms to the grandest ecosystems. However, human activities have disrupted this balance in many ways:\n\na) Habitat Destruction: Urbanization, deforestation, and industrialization have led to the destruction of natural habitats. This disrupts ecosystems and threatens countless species with extinction.\n\nb) Pollution: Pollution from industries, agriculture, and transportation has contaminated air, water, and soil. This not only harms wildlife but also endangers human health.\n\nc) Over-exploitation: Overfishing, hunting, and the extraction of resources have pushed many species to the brink of extinction and depleted vital ecosystems.\n\nKnow more about Environmental Ecology\u2026\n\n2. Biodiversity: The Web of Life\n\nBiodiversity, the variety of life on Earth, is a measure of an ecosystem\u2019s health and resilience. It encompasses the rich variety of species, genes, and ecosystems that make up our planet. Biodiversity provides numerous benefits to humanity, such as clean air and water, food security, and medicines. However, it faces severe threats:\n\na) Mass Extinctions: Human activities have accelerated the rate of species extinction to alarming levels, causing the sixth mass extinction event in Earth\u2019s history.\n\nb) Invasive Species: The introduction of non-native species disrupts ecosystems and often outcompetes native species.\n\nc) Genetic Erosion: The loss of genetic diversity within species reduces their ability to adapt to changing conditions.\n\nKnow more about Biodiversity\u2026\n\n3. Climate Change: The Looming Crisis\n\nClimate change is perhaps the most pressing issue of our time. It is driven by the accumulation of greenhouse gases, primarily carbon dioxide, in the atmosphere. The consequences of climate change are profound:\n\nKey aspects of climate change include:\n\na. Rising Global Temperatures: The Earth\u2019s average surface temperature has been steadily increasing over the past century, with the most rapid warming observed in recent decades. This increase in temperature has numerous far-reaching effects.\n\nb. Melting Ice and Rising Sea Levels: As global temperatures rise, glaciers and polar ice caps are melting, leading to rising sea levels. This threatens coastal communities and low-lying areas.\n\nc. Extreme Weather Events: Climate change contributes to more frequent and severe weather events, including hurricanes, heatwaves, droughts, floods, and wildfires.\n\nd. Ocean Acidification: Increased CO2 levels in the atmosphere also lead to higher CO2 concentrations in the world\u2019s oceans, causing ocean acidification, which can harm marine ecosystems.\n\ne. Shifts in Climate Patterns: Climate change can alter long-term climate patterns, affecting seasonal weather, precipitation patterns, and temperature ranges. This can disrupt agriculture, water resources, and ecosystems.\n\nf. Impacts on Biodiversity: Changing climates can force species to adapt, migrate, or face extinction as their habitats shift or become inhospitable.\n\nKnow more about Climate Change\u2026\n\nThe Interconnectedness of the Issues\n\nGeneral issues on Environmental Ecology, Biodiversity and Climate Change are not isolated; they are intricately linked.\n\nFor example, deforestation contributes to both habitat destruction and climate change.\n\nThe loss of forests reduces the planet\u2019s capacity to absorb carbon dioxide, exacerbating global warming.\n\nLikewise, climate change can affect biodiversity by altering habitats and migration patterns.\n\nThe Call for Global Action\n\nAddressing these issues requires collective and immediate action on multiple fronts:\n\na) Conservation Efforts: Protecting and restoring natural habitats, implementing sustainable practices in agriculture and fisheries, and combating pollution are vital for preserving biodiversity and mitigating climate change.\n\nb) Renewable Energy Transition: Shifting from fossil fuels to renewable energy sources like solar and wind power is essential to reduce greenhouse gas emissions.\n\nc) International Cooperation: Climate agreements like the Paris Agreement and conservation initiatives like the Convention on Biological Diversity exemplify the importance of global collaboration.\n\nHow to study General Issues on Environmental Ecology, Bio-diversity and Climate Change?\n\nReaders may note that this article on Environmental Ecology, Bio-diversity and Climate Change is just an overview of the topic. There is a lot more to learn about the general issues of Environmental Ecology, Bio-diversity and Climate Change.\n\nWe recommend the below sources to learn the subject.\n\nJoin\u00a0ClearIAS Video Course (Prelims cum Mains).\nGo through\u00a0ClearIAS notes on Environmental Ecology, Bio-diversity and Climate Change.\nRead\u00a0books on Environmental Ecology, Bio-diversity and Climate Change.\nConclusion\n\nEnvironmental ecology, biodiversity, and climate change are inextricably linked, forming a complex tapestry of challenges that humanity must address.\n\nThe consequences of inaction are dire, with potential repercussions for our planet\u2019s ecosystems, species, and future generations. To secure a sustainable future, we must acknowledge the interconnectedness of these issues and take decisive action to protect the delicate balance of life on Earth.\n\nBy nurturing our environment, preserving biodiversity, and mitigating climate change, we can forge a path towards a more harmonious and resilient planet."

            "[CONTENT]": "Although it\u2019s been debated for decades, the topic of tidal energy has dominated the headlines of late. What is it, what benefits does it offer and what\u2019s the potential for its future use? Where does India\u2019s Tidal energy potential lie? Read the article to know more about tidal power.\n\nIndia has a coastline of approximately 7,500 kilometers and experiences significant tidal variations, making it a potential candidate for harnessing tidal energy. While tidal energy is in its early stages of development in India, there have been efforts to explore its potential as a renewable energy source.\n\nThe energy from nature- the sun, the wind, waves, tides, etc. can be converted into a usable form. We can make use of the energy from tides as a source of renewable energy.\n\nHow is tidal energy potential distributed?\n\nHow can we convert tidal energy into power?\n\nTable of Contents\n\nWhat is Tidal Energy?\nHow does Tidal Energy generate power?\nMethods of Harnessing Tidal Energy\nTidal Stream Generator\nTidal Barrage\nTidal Lagoon\nAdvantages of Tidal Energy\nLimitations\nTidal Energy Potential in India\nGovernment Initiatives\nChallenges\nWay forward\nWhat is Tidal Energy?\n\nTidal energy is produced by the gravitational interaction of the Earth, the sun, and the moon, which causes the tides to rise and fall naturally.\n\n\ud83d\udc49 Which year are YOU targeting for success in the IAS/IPS/IFS Exam? \ud83d\ude80\n\n(1) \u21d2 UPSC 2025: Prelims cum Mains\n\n(2) \u21d2 UPSC 2026: Prelims cum Mains\n\n(3) \u21d2 UPSC 2027 Prelims cum Mains\n\nTip: Know more about ClearIAS Courses (Online/Offline)\n\nTidal waters can be used to make electricity by forming a reservoir or basin behind a barrage and then sending them through turbines in the barrier.\nTidal energy is formed by the movement of tides and seas, and the intensity of the water from the rise and fall of waves is a type of kinetic energy.\nA tidal generator converts the energy of tidal flows into power.\nIt is gravitational hydropower that creates electricity by using the movement of water to propel a turbine.\n\nTidal power is a form of renewable energy that harnesses the kinetic and potential energy of ocean tides to generate electricity.\n\nHow does Tidal Energy generate power?\n\nTides are caused by the gravitational interactions between the Earth, the Moon, and the Sun, resulting in the rise and fall of water levels in oceans and seas. Tidal energy is generated by capturing the movement of water during these tidal cycles.\n\nOceanic tides are used to generate electricity by building floodgate dams across sea/ocean inlets.\nDuring high tide, water flows into the inlet and is trapped when the gate is closed.\nThe floodgate\u2019s retained water is piped back to the sea.\nAfter the tide falls outside the floodgate, this water is sent via a turbine that generates electricity.\nMethods of Harnessing Tidal Energy\n\nThere are two main methods of harnessing tidal power:\n\nTidal Stream Generator\n\nTidal stream generators, like wind turbines, utilize the kinetic energy of moving water to power turbines.\n\nThese turbines are placed on the seabed in areas with strong tidal currents. As the tides flow in and out, the movement of water causes the turbines to rotate, generating electricity. Tidal stream systems can be installed in areas such as tidal channels, straits, and estuaries.\n\nSome tidal generators can be fitted into existing bridge constructions or be fully buried.\nHigh velocities can be generated at specific sites by land constrictions such as straits or inlets, which can be captured using turbines.\nHorizontal, vertical, open, and ducted turbines are all available.\nTidal Barrage\n\nTidal range systems like tidal barrages and tidal lagoons take advantage of the potential energy difference between high and low tides.\n\nTidal barrages generate potential energy by utilizing the difference in height (or hydraulic head) between high and low tides. Tidal barrages are large dams or barriers built across the entrance of an estuary or bay. Sluice gates and turbines are used to control the flow of water through the barrage, allowing water to flow in during high tide and releasing it during low tide to generate electricity.\n\nWhen using tidal barrages to create power, the potential energy from a tide is captured by constructing specialized dams.\nWhen the water level rises and the tide begins to come in, the momentary spike in tidal power is diverted into a wide basin behind the dam, which retains a large amount of potential energy.\nAs the tide recedes, this energy is converted to mechanical energy as the water is released via massive turbines that generate electrical power through generators. Barrages are like dams that run the length of a tidal estuary.\nTidal Lagoon\n\nTidal lagoons are similar to barrages but are constructed within a bay, creating an enclosed area with a tidal range.\n\nA modern tidal energy design idea is to build circular retaining walls outfitted with turbines that can catch the potential energy of tides.\nThe reservoirs built are similar to tidal barrages, but the area is artificial and there is no pre-existing ecology.\nAdvantages of Tidal Energy\n\nTidal energy is a renewable resource, as tides are caused by the gravitational forces of the Moon and the Sun, which are predictable and consistent.\n\nAs technology progresses, tidal energy will become more economical and efficient.\nThese systems typically have lower environmental impacts compared to fossil fuel-based power generation. They do not produce greenhouse gas emissions or air pollutants.\nIt defends against coastal floods because of its stability under varied design situations.\nTidal lagoons can absorb storm surges and waves once every 500 years.\nTidal power equipment and infrastructure have a significantly longer lifespan and are less expensive than other renewable technologies.\nLimitations\nThe construction of tidal power facilities is now more expensive, because of the significant capital needs.\nTidal barrages can impact local ecosystems by altering water flow and sediment distribution. They can also affect fish migration patterns.\nThe main environmental issues are the impacts of blades on fish seeking to enter the lagoon, auditory output from turbines, changes in sedimentation processes, and habitat alteration.\nMaintenance and repair of equipment can be complex.\nEnergy demand is restricted. Powerful tides only occur on average for 10 hours per day, tidal energy storage capacity must be built.\nIt is challenging to offer tidal energy to coastal areas since the energy of the tides is typically a long distance from where the electricity would be needed inland.\nTidal Energy Potential in India\n\nIndia\u2019s coastline has several locations with strong tidal currents and significant tidal ranges, particularly in the Gulf of Cambay (Khambhat) in Gujarat and the Gulf of Kutch. These areas have been identified as having the highest tidal energy potential in the country.\n\nThe tidal cycle is caused by the moon\u2019s gravitational influence and occurs every 12 hours.\nThe difference in water height between low and high tide is referred to as \u201cpotential energy.\u201d\nTo capture enough power from the tidal energy potential, the high tide must be at least five meters (16 feet) higher than the low tide.\n\nOnly around 20 areas on the earth get such high tides. India is one of them. On the west coast of Gujarat, the Gulf of Cambay and the Gulf of Kutch have maximum tidal ranges of 11m and 8m, respectively, with average tidal ranges of 6.77m and 5.23m.\n\nResearch and development activities related to tidal energy are ongoing in various institutions and organizations in India. These activities focus on turbine design, deployment strategies, environmental impact assessments, and resource assessments.\n\nGovernment Initiatives\n\nIndia has collaborated with countries such as France and the United Kingdom to share knowledge and expertise in the field of tidal energy. These collaborations aim to accelerate technological advancements and project implementation.\n\nThe Gujarat government inked an agreement in 2011 with\u00a0 Gujarat Power Corporation Limited (GPCL), Atlantis Resource Corporation (UK), and Power Monitoring Expert Systems, Singapore to build a 250 MW tidal power plant in the Gulf of Kutch.\nThe first phase of a 50 MW tidal power plant in Mandavi in the Kutch area has commenced.\nThe Ministry of New and Renewable Energy (MNRE) sanctioned a demonstration project in 2008 to develop a 3.75 MW tidal power plant in Durgaduani Creek in the Sunderbans of West Bengal, but it never saw the light of day.\nChallenges\n\nIt\u2019s been only 40 years since India began attempts to study and harness tidal energy. A legislative commission has now asked the Indian government to reconsider the potential of tidal power in India. It also asked to explore the realistically exploitable potential, do additional research in the sector, and build a tidal power pilot project.\n\nIndia commenced construction on two tidal power facilities in West Bengal and Gujarat, with an installed capacity of 3.75 and 50 megawatts, respectively, in 2007 and 2011. Both of these initiatives, however, were put on hold due to high expenses.\n\nExorbitant prices and environmental dangers are two primary reasons why India has yet to establish tidal power facilities.\nTidal energy projects need to be developed carefully to minimize their impact on marine ecosystems and local communities. Environmental impact assessments play a crucial role in ensuring sustainable project development.\nTidal power is not being pursued on a worldwide scale due to a variety of constraints.\nWay forward\n\nAlthough tidal energy offers more significant potential than wave or offshore wind energy, only a few locations are suitable for tidal stream energy extraction.\n\nTidal stream energy extraction technology is still in its infancy. It has immense potential to become a significant element of a site\u2019s future energy mix. Tidal barrages and other technologies have been investigated to better understand how to harness ocean energy. Tidal energy, while not yet a popular commercial energy source, has the potential to be employed as a commercial renewable energy source.\n\nThe sector has the potential to expand, boosting economic growth, lowering carbon footprints, and creating jobs not only along the coasts but also inland along supply networks. It is more relevant now because India has vowed to cut its emission intensity by 33 to 35 percent compared to 2005, by 2030.\n\nArticle Written\u00a0 By: Atheena Fathima Riyas"

            "[CONTENT]": "Vulture conservation in India is a crucial effort aimed at protecting and reviving the declining populations of vultures in the country. The population decline was noticed in the 1990s, and since then numerous efforts have been made to reclaim the vulture population. Read here to learn more.\n\nResearchers have recorded the first instance of captive breeding of the Himalayan vulture (Gyps himalayensis)\u00a0in India at the Assam State Zoo, Guwahati.\n\nCategorized as \u2018Near Threatened\u2019 on the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) Red List of threatened species, the Himalayan vulture is a common winter migrant to the Indian plains and a resident of the high Himalayas.\n\nVultures play a significant role in maintaining ecological balance by scavenging and consuming animal carcasses, thereby preventing the spread of diseases and maintaining the cleanliness of the environment.\n\nVultures, also known as condors, are large birds of prey with over 20 species in the world.\n\nTable of Contents\n\nWhy did the Vulture population decline?\nVulture population in India\nVulture Conservation in India\nNews on vulture conservation in India\nWay forward\nWhy did the Vulture population decline?\n\nThe vulture population decline is a significant conservation concern that has been observed in various regions around the world, including India.\n\n\ud83d\udc49 Which year are YOU targeting for success in the IAS/IPS/IFS Exam? \ud83d\ude80\n\n(1) \u21d2 UPSC 2025: Prelims cum Mains\n\n(2) \u21d2 UPSC 2026: Prelims cum Mains\n\n(3) \u21d2 UPSC 2027 Prelims cum Mains\n\nTip: Know more about ClearIAS Courses (Online/Offline)\n\nThe decline in vulture populations has been particularly severe in South Asia, including India, Pakistan, and Nepal.\nIn the late 1990s and early 2000s, India witnessed a drastic decline in vulture populations, primarily due to the widespread use of a veterinary drug called diclofenac.\nThis drug, when consumed by livestock, caused severe kidney failure in vultures that fed on the carcasses of treated animals.\nAs a result, vulture populations declined by over 97% in some regions, leading to an ecological crisis.\n\nThe primary reasons for the vulture population decline are as follows:\n\nDiclofenac Poisoning: The widespread use of the veterinary drug diclofenac in livestock led to the sharp decline of vulture populations in South Asia. When vultures feed on carcasses of animals that were treated with diclofenac, they suffer from severe kidney failure and die. This drug was widely used to treat cattle, and the contamination of animal carcasses with diclofenac proved to be lethal for vultures.\nSecondary Poisoning: In addition to diclofenac poisoning, vultures are also affected by secondary poisoning. Scavengers, including vultures, consume the carcasses of animals that were poisoned by pesticides or other toxic substances. As a result, vultures face the risk of ingesting these harmful chemicals, leading to further declines in their populations.\nHabitat Loss: The loss of natural habitats due to urbanization, deforestation, and agricultural expansion has negatively impacted vultures. Destruction of nesting sites, roosting areas, and food sources reduces the availability of suitable habitats for vultures.\nCollisions with buildings: Vultures are susceptible to collisions with power lines, wind turbines, and other infrastructure. These accidents can lead to injuries or fatalities, further contributing to the decline in their numbers.\nPoaching and Hunting: In some regions, vultures have been deliberately targeted and killed due to superstitions, traditional beliefs, or for use in illegal wildlife trade.\nLead Poisoning: Vultures may be exposed to lead poisoning by consuming carcasses of animals that were hunted using lead ammunition. Lead poisoning can be fatal to vultures.\nDisease Outbreaks: Outbreaks of diseases such as avian pox and avian flu have also had adverse effects on vulture populations.\n\nThe drastic decline in vulture populations has ecological consequences, as vultures play a critical role in maintaining a clean environment and preventing the spread of diseases by scavenging on animal carcasses.\n\nRecognizing the severity of the situation, conservation efforts have been initiated to address these challenges.\n\nMeasures include the banning of diclofenac, the establishment of vulture conservation breeding centers, rescue and rehabilitation programs, public awareness campaigns, and collaboration with international organizations for research and conservation efforts.\n\nWhile some progress has been made in stabilizing vulture populations in certain areas, continued efforts are essential to ensure the recovery and long-term survival of these ecologically important birds.\n\nVulture conservation remains a global priority to protect these valuable scavengers and the vital ecological services they provide.\n\nVulture population in India\n\nThe Indian subcontinent is home to 9 vulture species.\n\nIUCN Category\n\n\t\nVulture species\n\t\n\nScientific name\n\n\n\nCritically endangered\n\t\nOriental White-backed Vulture\nLong-billed Vulture\nSlender-billed Vulture\nRed-headed Vulture\n\t\nGyps bengalensis\nGyps indicus\nGyps tenuirostis\nSarcogyps calvus\n\n\nEndangered\n\t\nEgyptian vulture\n\t\nNeophron percnopterus\n\n\nNear Threatened\n\t\nHimalayan Vulture\nCinereous Vulture\nBearded Vulture\n\t\nGyps himalayensis\nAegypius monachus\nGypaetus barbatus\n\n\nLeast concern\n\t\nEurasian griffon\n\t\nGyps fulvus\nVulture Conservation in India\n\nTo address the vulture decline and conserve these important birds, several conservation initiatives and strategies have been implemented in India, including:\n\nIndia\u2019s Action Plan for Vulture Conservation 2020-2025 has also laid down various measures, including enhancement of conservation breeding programs, monitoring populations, and setting up rescue centers.\n\nVulture Safe Zones: Identifying and designating vulture safe zones, where the use of diclofenac and other harmful veterinary drugs is banned, to provide safe feeding areas for vultures.\n\nBan on Diclofenac: The government of India took measures to ban the veterinary use of diclofenac to prevent its consumption by livestock.\n\nRecently, other drugs like Ketoprofen and Aceclofenac have also been banned in 2023.\n\nVulture Conservation Breeding Centers: Establishing vulture conservation breeding centers to breed and rear vultures in captivity releasing them back into the wild to augment wild populations.\n\nVulture Restaurants: Creating vulture restaurants where safe food is provided to vultures to supplement their diet and ensure their survival.\n\nRescue and Rehabilitation: Setting up facilities for the rescue, rehabilitation, and treatment of injured or sick vultures.\n\nResearch and Monitoring: Conducting research and monitoring programs to study vulture populations, behavior, and ecological requirements.\n\nPublic Awareness Campaigns: Educating and raising awareness among the public, farmers, veterinarians, and other stakeholders about the importance of vultures and the threats they face.\n\nInvolving local communities in vulture conservation efforts, as their cooperation is essential for the success of conservation initiatives.\n\nCollaborating with international organizations and experts to share knowledge, expertise, and best practices in vulture conservation.\n\nNews on vulture conservation in India\n\nIndia\u2019s first captive breeding of the Himalayan vulture (Gyps himalayensis) has been successfully conducted at Guwahati Zoo.\n\nBombay Natural History Society (BNHS) and the Assam Forest Department conducted this project.\nCaptive- breeding program aims to conserve healthy populations of animals in captivity while safeguarding the genetic health of the animals.\nThe Himalayan vulture is a common winter migrant to the Indian plains. As the Himalayan Vulture is a high-altitude bird, it is not usual for the species to breed in low land with tropical and humid climates.\nFrance was the first country where the species was bred in captivity.\n\nAugust 2024: A new peer-reviewed study published in the\u00a0American Economic Association Journal\u00a0reveals that the vulture decline has had severe repercussions for human health.\n\nThe absence of vultures, which acted as nature\u2019s sanitation workers, allowed bacteria and pathogens to increase, causing approximately 100,000 additional human deaths annually between 2000 and 2005.\nThe study compared human death rates and other health metrics in districts with formerly high vulture populations to those with historically low numbers. The results showed a 4% increase in death rates in areas where vultures once thrived.\nThe spread of diseases such as rabies, exacerbated by the rise in stray dog populations and poor waste management, contributed to this increase.\n\nAlso read: Critically Endangered Animal Species of India\n\nWay forward\n\nAs a result of these conservation efforts, there has been some success in stabilizing vulture populations in certain regions of India.\n\nHowever, continuous efforts are needed to ensure the long-term survival and recovery of vulture species.\n\nBeyond safety measures, there needs to be awareness about the role vultures play in the ecosystem.\n\nVulture conservation in India remains an ongoing priority, and the concerted efforts of the government, conservation organizations, researchers, and local communities are crucial to safeguarding these ecologically important birds.\n\nAlso read: Biodiversity Protection: Steps Taken By Indian Government\n\n-Article by Swathi Satish"

The plan aims to mitigate the increasing energy consumption associated with cooling needs.\nPromote Sustainable Cooling Technologies: The plan emphasizes the use of environmentally friendly and energy-efficient cooling technologies, such as natural cooling methods, energy-efficient air conditioners, and low-GWP (Global Warming Potential) refrigerants.\nStrengthen Policy and Regulatory Framework: ICAP aims to strengthen the policy and regulatory framework related to cooling technologies and practices. It includes developing and implementing standards and labels for energy-efficient appliances and phasing out high GWP refrigerants.\n\nOther elements of ICAP are:\n\nThe plan focuses on skill development and training programs for technicians and professionals in the cooling sector to promote the adoption and maintenance of sustainable cooling technologies.\nICAP encourages research and development efforts to promote innovative and sustainable cooling solutions, including the development of climate-friendly refrigerants and cooling technologies.\nThe plan aims to raise awareness among the public about sustainable cooling practices and the importance of energy efficiency.\nIt seeks to engage stakeholders, including industry, consumers, and policymakers, in promoting climate-friendly cooling.\nICAP recognizes the importance of international collaboration and cooperation in addressing cooling-related challenges. India aims to learn from and contribute to global efforts in promoting sustainable cooling technologies and practices.\nImplementation strategy\nTowards promoting passive cooling in buildings, the Bureau of Energy Efficiency (BEE) has brought out the Energy Conservation Building Code (ECBC) for all large commercial (non-residential) buildings and Eco-Niwas Samhita (ECBC-R) for residential buildings.\nStudies on promoting non-Ozone Depleting Substances (ODSs) and low Global Warming Potential based technologies in Cold Chain, building sector, and Public Procurement have been undertaken.\nUp-skilling and certification of 43,450 Refrigeration and Air-conditioning (RAC) service technicians have been undertaken under the national skill qualification framework (NSQF) of the Pradhan Mantri Kaushal Vikas Yojana (PMKVY) of the Ministry of Skill Development and Entrepreneurship (MSDE).\nCooling solutions under ICAP\n\nRecently, the Centre for Science and Environment published a guidance document that cites a range of sustainable cooling solutions that do not rely on conventional practices.\n\nEvaporative cooling\n\nEvaporative cooling is an extremely effective way of cooling that has been used extensively in hot and dry conditions for centuries.\nOne simple device that employs this form of cooling is the desert cooler. The process involves hot air passing through a medium that is saturated with water.\nThe hot air then transfers heat to the water, causing it to evaporate and turn into vapor. As a result, the air is cooled and becomes more humid, providing thermal comfort for occupants.\n\nGeothermal properties of earth\n\nA few meters below Earth\u2019s surface, the temperature remains constant at around 24 degrees Celsius.\nBuildings can have earth air tunnels constructed through which filtered ambient air is made to pass, exchanging heat with the earth in the process.\nBy the time this air is introduced to indoor spaces, the air is cooler, hence providing thermal comfort to occupants while eliminating the requirement for an air conditioner to a large extent.\n\nArchitectural design\n\nPassive principles of architectural design refer to design strategies that use natural elements and features to improve the energy efficiency, comfort, and sustainability of buildings, and eliminate or reduce their reliance on active or mechanical systems.\nMicroclimate enhancement with the help of trees and vertical gardens has also been used to bring down the ambient temperature\n\nDistrict cooling system\n\nDistrict cooling system employs one central chilled water source for several buildings.\nThis is in contrast with conventional heating, ventilation, and air-conditioning (HVAC) systems that utilize either window units in each room in small buildings, or centralized air-conditioning in large buildings.\nDistrict cooling systems are more energy efficient and require lesser installed capacity than conventional air conditioning.\nHaving a centralized chilled water production and heat rejection mechanism opens up several other doors toward low-carbon cooling.\nDistrict cooling offers the possibility of converting excess heat into chilled water with the help of vapor absorption machines (VAM).\n\nDehumidification\n\nThis renewable source of fuel/heating can be used in various other forms to provide occupant thermal comfort.\nA desiccant-based evaporative cooler (DEVAP) system has been proposed that dehumidifies the air with help from excess/renewable heat and then uses evaporative cooling to bring the air to a comfortable level.\nSignificantly more energy is required to achieve the same results as traditional air-conditioning.\n\nRadiant Cooling technology\n\nRadiant cooling is a type of cooling system that works by absorbing heat from indoor spaces through radiation.\nUnlike traditional air-conditioning systems that use air to transfer heat, radiant cooling uses chilled water or other fluids circulating through pipes embedded in the ceilings, walls, or floors of a building to remove heat.\nThis cools down the surfaces which then use radiation to absorb heat from sources such as humans and equipment.\nAs a result, the temperature of the room drops, creating a comfortable and consistent cooling effect.\nRelevance of the Indian Cooling Action Plan\n\nThe India Cooling Action Plan is aligned with India\u2019s commitments under the Kigali Amendment to the Montreal Protocol, which aims to phase down the use of high GWP refrigerants to mitigate climate change.\n\nIndia is a signatory to major global environmental conventions and treaties including:\n\nUnited Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change\nUnited Nations Convention to Combat Desertification\nConvention on Biological Diversity\nParis Agreement\nMontreal Protocol on Substances that Deplete the Ozone Layer\nStockholm Convention on Persistent Organic Pollutants\nMinamata Convention on Mercury\n\nIndia has taken ambitious targets in support of global environmental goals as evidenced in its-\n\nNationally Determined Contributions for Combating Climate Change under the Paris Agreement\nRatification of the Kigali Amendment to the Montreal Protocol for the phase-down of Hydrofluorocarbons\nRestoration of 26 million hectares of degraded land by 2030 under the United Nations Convention to Combat Desertification and conserving 30% of land and oceans by 2030.\n\nIndia engaged constructively with all member states in the fifth United Nations Environment Assembly (UNEA 5.2) in 2022 to develop a consensus on the resolution for driving global action on plastic pollution.\n\nConclusion\n\nIssues relating to climate change and environmental protection are discussed in the various international environmental conventions and treaties comprising representatives from both developed and developing countries.\n\nCommitments including decisions in such conventions and treaties are arrived at after extensive discussions and following a process of consensus.\n\nIndia has raised the issue of disproportionate usage of the global carbon budget by developed countries that have led to global warming; their high levels of current emissions and their need to reach net zero much ahead of 2050.\n\nBy promoting sustainable cooling solutions and reducing greenhouse gas emissions, the plan contributes to India\u2019s broader efforts to combat climate change and achieve its climate goals.\n\n-Article by Swathi Satish"

While lowering the danger of pests and diseases, in-situ management techniques can assist maintain the health and fertility of the soil.\n\nSeveral of the techniques used to manage in-situ crop residues are listed below:\n\nMulching is the practice of leaving crop residue on the soil surface to protect the soil from erosion and retain moisture. Mulching also helps to suppress weeds and provides nutrients to the soil.\nNo-till farming involves planting crops without disturbing the soil. Crop residue is left on the soil surface, and seeds are planted through it. This method helps to conserve soil moisture and reduce soil erosion.\nStrip-till farming is similar to no-till farming but involves tilling only a narrow strip of soil where the seeds will be planted. Crop residue is left on the soil surface in between the tilled strips. This method helps to conserve soil moisture and reduce soil erosion while also providing a suitable environment for seed germination.\nCover crops are planted in between cash crops to provide ground cover and add nutrients to the soil. Cover crops can also be left on the soil surface as a form of mulch.\nCrop rotation involves alternating the type of crops grown on a field each season. This method can help to reduce soil erosion and nutrient depletion while also improving soil health.\nCrop residue ex-situ management\n\nEx-situ management of crop residue refers to the removal of agricultural waste from the field for use as compost, firewood, or animal feed.\n\nEx-situ management techniques offer a natural source of nutrients for the soil and can assist lower air pollution brought on by burning agricultural leftovers. These ex-situ crop residue management techniques are frequently employed:\n\nBiomass power generation: Crop residues can be used as a source of fuel for biomass power generation. This method involves burning crop residues to produce electricity or heat.\nAnimal feed: Crop residues can be used as a source of animal feed, particularly for livestock such as cattle, sheep, and goats. Crop residues can be baled and stored for use as animal feed during the dry season when forage is scarce.\nComposting: Crop residues can be composted to produce a nutrient-rich soil amendment. This method involves collecting the crop residues and mixing them with other organic materials such as manure, leaves, and grass clippings. The compost can then be used to improve soil fertility and structure.\nBiochar production: Biochar is a type of charcoal that is produced by heating crop residues in the absence of oxygen. Biochar can be used as a soil amendment to improve soil fertility, water retention, and crop productivity.\nIndustrial uses: Crop residues can be used in various industrial processes, such as the production of paper, textiles, and building materials.\nAdverse effects of crop residue burning\nLoss of nutrients: It is estimated that the burning of one tonne of rice straw accounts for the loss of 5.5 kg of Nitrogen, 2.3 kg of phosphorus, 25 kg of potassium, and 1.2 kg of sulfur besides, organic carbon.\nGenerally, crop residues of different crops contain 80% of Nitrogen (N), 25% of Phosphorus (P), 50% of Sulphur (S), and 20% of Potassium(K). If the crop residue is incorporated or retained in the soil itself, it gets enriched, particularly with organic C and N.\nImpact on soil properties: Heat from burning residues elevates soil temperature causing the death of beneficial soil organisms.\nFrequent residue burning leads to complete loss of microbial population and reduces levels of N and C in the top 0-15 cm soil profile, which is important for crop root development.\nEmission of greenhouse and other gases: Crop residues burning is a potential source of Green House Gases (GHGs) and other chemically and radiative important trace gases and aerosols such as CH4, CO, N2O, NOX, and other hydrocarbons.\nCrop Residue Management guidelines\n\nAccording to the updated rules, bilateral agreements between the beneficiary/aggregator and enterprises using paddy straw will build techno-commercial pilot projects for the supply chain of paddy straw, according to a statement from the agricultural ministry.\n\nGovt shall provide financial assistance on the capital cost of machinery and equipment.\n\nThe required working capital may be financed either by the Industry and Beneficiary jointly or utilizing the Agriculture Infrastructure Fund (AIF), NABARD Financial, or Financing from the Financial Institutions by the beneficiary.\nThe land for storage of the collected paddy straw will be arranged and prepared by the beneficiary as may be guided by the end-use industry.\nProject proposal-based financial assistance will be extended for machines and equipment such as Higher HP Tractor, Cutters, Tedder, Medium to Large Balers, Rakers, Loaders, Grabbers, and Telehandlers which are essentially required for the establishment of a paddy straw supply chain.\nState Governments shall approve these projects through a project sanctioning committee.\n\nFinancial support break-up:\n\nThe government (jointly by Central and State Governments) will provide financial support of 65% of the project cost\nIndustry as the primary promoter of the project will contribute 25% and will act as the Primary consumer of the feedstock collected\nFarmers or groups of Farmers Rural Entrepreneurs Cooperative Societies of Farmers or Farmers Producer Organizations (FPOs), or Panchayats will be the direct Beneficiary of the project and will contribute the balance 10%.\n\nThe Outcomes of the above interventions are:\n\nThe initiative will supplement the efforts of paddy straw management through in-situ options\nDuring the three-year tenure of the interventions, 1.5 million metric tonnes of surplus paddy straw are expected to be collected which would otherwise have been burnt in fields.\nAbout 333 biomass collection depots of capacity 4500 MT will be built in the States of Punjab, Haryana, Uttar Pradesh, and Madhya Pradesh.\nAir pollution caused by stubble burning will be considerably reduced.\nIt would generate employment opportunities of about 9,00,000-man days.\nThe interventions will encourage a robust supply chain management of paddy straw which shall further help in making paddy straw available for various end uses i.e., power generation, heat generation, bio-CNG, etc. by Power/bio-CNG/bio-ethanol producers\nThe establishment of a supply chain would result in new investments in Biomass in the biofuel and energy sectors.\n\nAlso read: Genetically Modified Crops and Regulations in India\n\nOther government initiatives\n\nIn 2018, a new Central Sector Scheme on \u2018Promotion of Agricultural Mechanization for In-Situ Management of Crop Residue\u2018 in the States of Punjab, Haryana, Uttar Pradesh, and NCT of Delhi was launched.\n\nNational Policy for Management of Crop Residue (NPMCR)\n\nControl of burning of crop residue to prevent environmental degradation and loss of soil nutrients and minerals by promotion of in-situ management (incorporation in soil, mulching, baling/binding for use as domestic/industrial fuel, fodder) of crop residue.\nDiversified use of crop residue for various purposes like charcoal gasification, power generation, as industrial raw material for the production of bio-ethanol, packing material, paper/board/panel industry, composting and mushroom cultivation, etc.\nCapacity building and awareness about the ill effects of crop residue burning and its effective utilization and management.\nFormulation and implementation of suitable laws and legislative/policy measures to curb the burning of crop residue.\nWay forward\n\nCrop residue management through conservation agriculture can improve soil productivity and crop production by maintaining soil organic matter levels.\n\nReduced soil carbon sequestration with increased crop residue management is a practical method for reducing agriculture\u2019s environmental impact.\nCrop residue management techniques should ideally be chosen to maximize agricultural yields with a minimum negative impact on the environment.\n\nVarious effects of crop residue management practices on harvested yield have been found, according to the findings of numerous tests.\n\nMultiple intricate interactions including residue quality, soil-related variables, the health of the preceding crop, the possible vulnerability of the next crop, and management choices like cultivar selection, crop rotation, and planting date lead to contradictory results.\n\nThe findings imply that no crop residue management solution is preferable in every situation.\n\nTherefore, farmers must make management choices that would maximize agricultural yields and reduce adverse effects on the environment.\n\nDesigning the best site-specific solutions for crop residue management practices to increase agricultural production and sustainability while reducing environmental impacts requires multidisciplinary and coordinated efforts by a range of scientists.\n\nFood security and environmental improvement depend on soil carbon, a

Over the years, the contribution of agriculture to the GDP has diminished considerably. However, it continues to be the largest source of livelihood in India.\n\nThe agriculture sector in the country is critically poised to address issues of its long-term sustainability.\n\nThis requires the sector to fully integrate environmental concerns in its policies, plans, and programs, to ensure that the sector\u2019s negative environmental impacts are mitigated and positive contributions are enhanced.\nTherefore, environmental mainstreaming is of crucial importance, especially in the context of the changing climate.\n\nThe GoI and other partners invest significantly in Protected Area management to support and conserve a host of globally significant species.\n\nThus, these different streams of Government investments are often misaligned and incompatible with each other leading to agricultural and environmental activities acting at cross-purposes, resulting in net economic loss to the country and wasted financing.\n\nGreen agriculture aims to catalyze the sustainable

Eastern Region (MOVCDNER)\nSubmission on Agroforestry (SMAF)\nPer Drop More Crop (PDMC) under Pradhan Mantri Krishi Sinhchayee Yojana (PMKSY).\n\nRainfed Area Development under NMSA focuses on Integrated Farming System (IFS) for enhancing productivity and minimizing risks associated with climatic variability.\n\nUnder this system, the crops/cropping system is integrated with activities like horticulture, livestock, fishery, agro-forestry, apiculture, etc.\n\nAlso read: E-technology in the aid of farmers\n\nNational Innovations in Climate Resilient Agriculture (NICRA)\n\nTo meet the challenges of sustaining domestic food production in the face of changing climate, the Indian Council of Agricultural Research (ICAR), Ministry of Agriculture, and Farmers Welfare, Government of India has launched a flagship network project called National Innovations in Climate Resilient Agriculture (NICRA).\n\nThe project aims to develop and promote climate-resilient technologies in agriculture to address vulnerable areas of the country and to help the districts and regions prone to extreme weather conditions like droughts, floods, frost, heat waves, etc. to cope with such extremes.\nShort-term and long-term research programs with a national perspective have been taken up involving adaptation and mitigation covering crops, horticulture, livestock, fisheries, and poultry.\n\nThe main thrust areas covered are:\n\nidentifying the most vulnerable districts/regions\nevolving crop varieties and management practices for adaptation and mitigation\nassessing climate change impacts on livestock, fisheries, and poultry and identifying adaptation strategies.\n\nNICRA project has developed several resilient technologies to mitigate climate change.\n\nClimate

promote the usage of alternative fertilizers and balanced use of chemical fertilizers.\n\nThe scheme included a bouquet of various projects that would boost farmers\u2019 income, strengthen natural/organic farming, rejuvenate soil productivity, and ensure food security.\nFermented Organic Manures (FOM)/Liquid FOM/Phosphate Rich Organic Manures (PROM) produced as by-products from bio-gas plants/Compressed Biogas (CBG) plants set up under the umbrella Gobardhan initiative will be promoted.\nThe reduction in urea consumption by a state will be compared to its average consumption of urea over the previous three years. This calculation will determine the eligibility for subsidy savings and grants.\nThe scheme will be financed by the savings of existing fertilizer subsidies under schemes run by the Department of Fertilizers, Ministry of Chemicals & Fertilizers.\n\nSubsidy Savings and Grants:\n\nThe Centre will provide 50% of the subsidy savings to the states as a grant.\nOut of the grant, 70% can be used to create assets related to the technological adoption of alternative fertilizers and production units at various levels.\nThe remaining 30% can be used to reward and encourage farmers, panchayats, and other stakeholders involved in fertilizer reduction and awareness generation.\nNeed for green agriculture\n\nMajor concerns arising out of past agricultural practices are-\n\nNitrate and pesticide residue pollution arising from agriculture.\nLoss of biodiversity due to pollution, agronomic practices such as mono-cropping, destruction of natural habitats, and over-exploitation of natural stocks of fish and forests.\nSoil nutrients, organic matter, and natural resource degradation, including\nsalinification associated with irrigation.\nAgricultural carbon footprint due to fossil fuel use in the production of chemical inputs, in farming practice, in food processing, and related agro-industries. Transport of agricultural produce to distant markets.\nAgricultural water use footprint is caused by excessive water use in intensive agricultural production and competition with other use, particularly drinking water as well as effects on water quality through pollution.\nAgriculture\u2019s contribution to climate change, both in terms of its contribution of greenhouse gases CO2 but also methane; and its role in climate change mitigation strategies (biofuel production, but also a range of bio-production systems with benign or beneficial environmental consequences, carbon sequestration)\nWay forward\n\nThe green agriculture-related initiatives by the government with FAO\u2019s key strategic priorities like to make agriculture, forestry, and fisheries more productive and sustainable.\n\nThe initiatives also align with SDG 2 (Zero Hunger), SDG 5 (Gender equality), SDG 12 (Sustainable Consumption and Production), SDG 13 (Climate Action), and SDG 15 (Life on Land).\n\nPromoting the usage of organic and biofertilizers will help advance sustainable farming methods. As a result, the soil will be more fertile, environmental pollution will be decreased, and agricultural output will increase over time.\n\nRelated Posts:\n\nGreen Revolution\nGenetically Modified Crops and Regulations in India\nSustainable Agri-Food Systems\nEnvironmentally friendly fertilizers\nAgri-food policies for Soil, water, air, and biodiversity\nShould India focus on natural farming?\n\n-Article by Swathi Satish"

encourage the construction of buildings and other infrastructure using sustainable technologies and materials.\n\nFor each green credit action, the initiative will set criteria and benchmarks.\n\nThe environmental result that can be achieved by any Green Credit activity will be based on the equivalence of resource requirements, parity of scale, scope, size, and other relevant parameters, and will be considered for allocation of one unit of Green Credit in respect of each activity, to maintain fungibility across sectors.\nEven digital processes, such as self-evaluations of Green Credit-eligible activities, activity registration, the issuing of Green Credits, performance monitoring, and other pertinent processes, will be designed and implemented for the Programme.\n\nThe project will be run by the Indian Council of Forestry Research and Education.\n\nThe institution will design the program\u2019s implementation guidelines, methods, and procedures, as well as methodologies, standards, a registration process, and related measuring, reporting, and verification systems.\n\nThe green credits will be exchangeable, and people who earn them will be able to sell them on a hypothetical domestic market platform.\n\nSignificance of the Green Credit Programme\n\nThe goal of the Green Credit Programme is to encourage people, private businesses, cooperatives, small-scale industries, forestry companies, and farmer-produce groups to take voluntary environmental action.\n\nIt\u2019s a ground-breaking tool that aims to assess and reward several ecosystem services so that green initiatives may maximize profits beyond carbon.\nThe programme will provide project proponents extra access to carbon markets.\nThe standards would be very helpful for organic farms and FPOs and bring together ways to measure and promote ecosystem services.\nOne of the major highlights of the draft notification is to provide regulatory provisions to account for individual and community actions, besides corporate and businesses, and incentivize them.\nIts provisions provide incentives for sustainable agriculture, forestry, water conservation, air pollution reduction, waste management, sustainable building and infrastructure, and eco-labelling activities.\nIn addition to receiving Carbon Credits from the same environmental activity under the carbon market, the environmental activity generating Green Credits under the Green Credit Programme may also include climatic co-benefits such as a decrease or elimination of carbon emissions.\n\nBy taking the innovative and novel legislative step of introducing the Green Credit Programme, which goes well beyond merely carbon and includes all of the key components of environmental and social sustainability, India may significantly boost its position as a worldwide leader in environmental sustainability.\n\nChallenges\n\nThere is a concern about greenwashing through such market-based mechanisms.\n\nAt a time when there is an urgent need to reduce emissions, market-based methods for carbon reductions have proven to be too incremental.\nThere is a significant risk of \u201cgreenwashing\u201d if this approach is used in other ecosystems and polluted places.\nGreenwashing is the appearance of doing a lot of good without actually having a significant positive impact.\n\nSerious doubts are also raised regarding who should be in charge of reducing pollution and conserving biodiversity, as well as how rigorous monitoring would be maintained.\n\nResources that could have been redirected to more revolutionary pollution control and biodiversity conservation activities, controlled and required by the government, will instead be used to build the capability that will be needed to monitor these systems and avoid fraud.\n\nIn news\n\n2024: Amid concerns that the Green Credit Programme (GCP), which encourages organisations and individuals to invest in afforestation projects in \u2018degraded\u2019 forest lands for \u2018green credits,\u2019 may encourage tree planting for financial gains, the Union Environment Ministry \u2013 the overall coordinator of the programme \u2013 has clarified that primacy must be accorded to restoring ecosystems over merely tree planting.\n\nForest departments of 13 States have offered 387 land parcels of degraded forest land worth nearly 10,983 hectares.\nIndividuals and companies can apply to the Indian Council of Forestry Research and Education (ICFRE), an autonomous body of the Environment Ministry, to pay to \u201crestore\u201d these forests.\nThe actual afforestation will be carried out by State forest departments. Two years after planting and following an evaluation by the ICFRE, each such planted tree could be worth one \u2018green credit.\u2019\nThese credits can be claimed by the financing organisation and used in two ways: either using it to comply with existing forest laws that require organisations, which divert forest land for non-forestry purposes, to recompense by providing an equivalent amount of land elsewhere.\nOr be used for reporting under environmental, social and governance leadership norms or to meet corporate social responsibility requirements.\nWay forward\n\nFor the market to be stable and viable, it will be essential to make sure that the methodology and standards are sound and that there is adequate demand for green credits.\n\nThe Green Credit System has to be carefully evaluated before being put into practice, especially given its emphasis on afforestation and tree planting.\n\nUnresolved issues with forest ownership and governance, problems with biodiversity and the environment, and global criticisms of carbon credit programmes should all be taken into account.\n\nTo resolve these issues, internal deliberations and public hearings are crucial.\n\nAlso read: Oil and Gas Industry in India\n\n-Article by Swathi Satish"

as:\n\nBio-Medical Waste\nGeneral Waste\nOther Wastes\n\nBiomedical waste means any waste, which is generated during the diagnosis, treatment, or immunization of human beings or animals or research activities pertaining thereto or in the production or testing of biological or health camps.\n\nBio-Medical waste includes all the waste generated from the Health Care Facility which can have any adverse effect on the health of a person or to the environment in general if not disposed of properly.\nAll such waste that can adversely harm the environment or health of a person is considered infectious and such waste has to be managed as per Biomedical Waste Management (BMWM) Rules, 2016.\nThe quantity of such waste is around 10% to 15% of total waste generated from the Health Care Facility.\nThis waste consists of the materials that have been in contact with the patient\u2019s blood, secretions, infected parts, biological liquids such as chemicals, medical supplies, medicines, lab discharge, sharps metallic and glassware, plastics, etc.\n\nBiomedical Waste Management Rules, 2016 categorizes the bio-medical waste generated from the health care facility into four categories based on the segregation pathway and color code.\n\nVarious types of biomedical waste are further assigned to each one of the categories, as detailed below:\n\nYellow Category\nRed Category\nWhite Category\nBlue Category\nGeneral waste\n\nThe general waste consists of all the waste other than bio-medical waste which has not been in contact with any hazardous or infectious, chemical, or biological secretions and does not include any waste sharps.\n\nThis waste consists of mainly:\n\nNewspaper, paper, and card boxes (dry waste)\nPlastic water bottles (dry waste)\nAluminum cans of soft drinks (dry waste)\nPackaging materials (dry waste)\nFood Containers after emptying residual food (dry waste)\nOrganic / Bio-degradable waste \u2013 mostly food waste (wet waste)\nConstruction and Demolition wastes\n\nThese general wastes are further classified as dry wastes and wet wastes and should be collected separately.\n\nThis quantity of such waste is around 85 % to 90 % of the total waste generated from the facility.\n\nSuch waste is required to be handled as per Solid Waste Management Rules, 2016, and Construction & Demolition Waste Management Rules, 2016, as applicable.\n\nAlso read: Microplastics\n\nOther wastes\n\nOther wastes consist of used electronic wastes, used batteries, and radio-active wastes which are not covered under biomedical wastes but have to be disposed of as and when such wastes are generated as per the provisions laid down under E-Waste (Management) Rules, 2016, Batteries (Management & Handling) Rules, 2001, and Rules/guidelines under Atomic Energy Act, 1962 respectively.\n\nBiomedical waste management\n\nAt the central level, the Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB) ensures strict compliance with biomedical waste management rules and scientific disposal of waste.\n\nAt the state level, the Chief Secretaries of all the States/UTo oversee compliance and ensure that authorization is secured by every healthcare facility in their respective jurisdiction and also there is adherence to the norms.\nAt the district level, the District Magistrate by the District Environmental Plans.\n\nThe management of bio-medical waste can overall be summarized in the following steps:\n\nWaste Segregation in color-coded and barcode-labeled bags/ containers at the source of generation\nPre-treat Laboratory and Highly infectious waste\nIntra-mural transportation of segregated waste to the central storage area\nThe temporary storage of biomedical waste in the central storage area\nTreatment and Disposal of biomedical waste through Common Biomedical Waste Treatment Facility (CBWTF) or Captive facility.\n\nThe first five steps (Segregation, Collection, pre-treatment, Intramural Transportation, and Storage) are the exclusive responsibility of the Health Care Facility (HCF).\n\nWhile Treatment and Disposal are primarily the responsibility of the CBWTF operator except for lab and highly infectious waste, which is required to be pre-treated by the HCF.\n\nPre-treatment of the laboratory waste, microbiological waste, blood samples, and blood bags is through disinfection or sterilization on-site in the manner prescribed by the World Health Organization (WHO) or by the National AIDS Control Organisation (NACO).\n\nIt is the responsibility of the in charge of the healthcare facility to ensure the occupational safety of the healthcare workers and other staff involved in the handling of Biomedical waste in the healthcare facility.\n\nRisks of biomedical waste\n\nHealthcare waste contains potentially harmful microorganisms that can infect hospital patients, health workers, and the general public.\n\nOther potential hazards may include drug-resistant microorganisms which spread from health facilities into the environment.\n\nAdverse health outcomes associated with healthcare waste and by-products also include:\n\nsharps-inflicted injuries;\ntoxic exposure to pharmaceutical products, in particular, antibiotics and cytotoxic drugs released into the surrounding environment, and to substances such as mercury or dioxins, during the handling or incineration of health care wastes;\nchemical burns arising in the context of disinfection, sterilization, or waste treatment activities;\nair pollution arising as a result of the release of particulate matter during medical waste incineration;\nthermal injuries occurring in conjunction with open burning and the operation of medical waste incinerators;\nradiation burns\nChallenges to waste management\nLack of awareness about the health hazards related to healthcare waste\nInadequate training in proper waste management\nAbsence of waste management and disposal systems\nInsufficient financial and human resources\nLow priority is given to the topic\nMany countries either do not have appropriate regulations or do not enforce them.\n\nAlso read: Waste to Wealth\n\nWay forward\n\nThe management of healthcare waste requires increased attention and diligence to avoid adverse health outcomes associated with poor practice, including exposure to infectious agents and toxic substances.\n\nKey elements in improving healthcare waste management are:\n\npromoting practices that reduce the volume of wastes generated and ensure proposer waste segregation;\ndeveloping strategies and systems along with strong oversight and regulation to incrementally improve waste segregation, destruction, and disposal practices with the ultimate aim of meeting national and international standards;\nwhere feasible, favoring the safe and environmentally sound treatment of hazardous health care wastes (e,g, by autoclaving, microwaving, steam treatment integrated with internal mixing, and chemical treatment) over medical waste incineration;\nbuilding a comprehensive system, addressing responsibilities, resource allocation, handling, and disposal. This is a long-term process, sustained by gradual improvements;\nraising awareness of the risks related to healthcare waste, and of safe practices; and\nselecting safe and environmentally-friendly management options, to protect people from hazards when collecting, handling, storing, transporting, treating, or disposing of waste.\n\nGovernment commitment and supporters are being put in for universal, long-term improvement, although immediate action should be taken locally by the healthcare and related facilities.\n\n-Article by Swathi Satish"

It highlights the achievement of equilibrium between preserving forest health and variety and the growing demand for forest products and services.\nA framework (or management practice) called Scientific Forest Management directs us toward achieving sustainable forest management.\n\nScientific maintenance of forests not only serves to balance the population\u2019s need for food, fuel, and forest products and generates benefits for the nation in the near term, but also guarantees the forests\u2019 long-term health.\n\nScientific maintenance of forests may solve current issues such as the improvement of forests, poverty, and the impact of climate change while preserving biodiversity and ecological balance.\n\nIt includes the decreased effect of logging, including timber waste, selective logging, providing safer animal habitats, and timely harvesting of tree crops, to minimize the environmental impact on forests and soil.\n\nAlso read: Forest \u2013 Know the Different Types\n\nSustainable Forest Management\n\nSustainable management of forests aims to ensure that forests supply goods and services to meet both present-day and future needs and contribute to the sustainable development of communities.\n\nThe United Nations General Assembly in 2007 recognizes sustainable management of wilderness as a dynamic and evolving concept that aims to maintain and enhance the economic, social, and environmental values of all types of forests for the benefit of present and future generations, considering the following seven thematic elements as a reference framework:\n\nthe extent of forest resources\nforest biodiversity\nforest health and vitality\nproductive functions of forest resources\nprotective functions of forest resources\nsocio-economic functions of forests\nlegal, policy, and institutional framework\n\nSustainable management of forests encompasses the administrative, legal, technical, economic, social, and environmental aspects of the conservation and use of forests.\n\nIt implies various degrees of human intervention, ranging from actions aimed at safeguarding and maintaining forest ecosystems and their functions to those favoring specific socially or economically valuable species or groups of species for the improved production of goods and services.\n\nAlso read: Mangrove Forest in India\n\nConclusion\n\nMany of the world\u2019s forests and woodlands are not being managed sustainably and scientifically, especially in the tropics and subtropics.\n\nMany countries lack appropriate forest legislation, regulations, and incentives to promote Sustainable and scientific management of forests.\n\nMany have inadequate funding and human resources for the preparation, implementation, and monitoring of forest governance plans and lack mechanisms to ensure the participation and involvement of all stakeholders in forest governance, planning, and development.\n\nWhere governance of forest plans exists, they are frequently limited to ensuring the sustained production of wood. They lack sufficient attention to the sustainable production of non-wood products and ecosystem services and the maintenance of social and environmental values.\n\nAlso, other land uses may appear more economically attractive to land managers than the management of the forests, thus leading to forest degradation and deforestation.\n\n-Article by Swathi Satish"

But many of these additives can extend the life of products if they become litter, with some estimates ranging to at least 400 years to break down.\nHow do Plastics move around the World?\n\nMost of the plastic trash in the oceans, Earth\u2019s last sink, flows from land.\n\nTrash is also carried to sea by major rivers, which act as conveyor belts, picking up more and more trash as they move downstream.\nOnce at sea, much of the plastic trash remains in coastal waters. But once caught up in ocean currents, it can be transported around the world.\nOn Henderson Island, an uninhabited atoll in the Pitcairn Group isolated halfway between Chile and New Zealand, scientists found plastic items from Russia, the United States, Europe, South America, Japan, and China. They were carried to the South Pacific by the South Pacific gyre, a circular ocean current.\n\nOnce at sea, sunlight, wind, and wave action break down plastic waste into small particles, often less than half a centimeter across.\n\nThese so-called microplastics are spread throughout the water column and have been found in every corner of the globe, from Mount Everest, the highest peak, to the Mariana Trench, the deepest trough.\nMicroplastics are breaking down further into smaller and smaller pieces.\nPlastic microfibers or even smaller nanofibers, meanwhile, have been found in municipal drinking water systems and drifting through the air.\nImpact of Plastic Pollution\n\nPlastic pollution has emerged as one of the most urgent environmental challenges.\n\nImpact on wildlife\n\nWildlife, be it terrestrial, avian, or aquatic are greatly affected by plastics.\n\nMillions of animals are killed by plastics every year, from birds to fish to other marine organisms.\nNearly 700 species, including endangered ones, are known to have been affected by plastics.\nSeals, whales, turtles, and other animals are strangled by abandoned fishing gear or discarded six-pack rings.\nMicroplastics have been found in more than 100 aquatic species, including fish, shrimp, and mussels destined for our dinner plates.\nIn many cases, these tiny bits pass through the digestive system and are expelled without consequence.\nBut plastics have also been found to have blocked digestive tracts or pierced organs, causing death.\nPlastics have been consumed by land-based animals, including elephants, hyenas, zebras, tigers, camels, cattle, and other large mammals, in some cases causing death.\nImpact on human life\n\nPhthalates, bisphenol A (BPA), and polybrominated diphenyl ether (PBDE), among other chemicals used in plastics, have come under intense examination and regulation.\n\nAlong with medications, colognes, and cosmetics, they can be found in computers, food packaging, automotive upholstery, flooring materials, and medical gadgets.\n\nAll these compounds have been detected in humans and are known to disrupt the endocrine system.\n\nGendered impact of plastic pollution\n\nThe gendered effects of this expanding risk are still not taken into account and are not appropriately addressed.\n\nWomen, who are frequently marginalized, are leading the fight against the effects of our addiction to plastic. They are particularly susceptible since they work both as main consumers and in the unregulated trash industry in India.\n\nA substantial portion of disadvantaged populations including women, children, and recent immigrants make up the urban informal waste management economy, which is essential in recycling 30% of India\u2019s annual plastic garbage.\nThe risks linked with landfills and dumpsites disproportionately impact women, who make up 49% of garbage pickers in India.\n\nWomen consume more plastic than men do.\n\nProducts like sanitary napkins, which are created around 90%, are composed of plastic.\nWomen are key consumers of single-use plastics for food and home products since they are the domestic decision-makers.\nSocial norms have mandated women\u2019s greater consumption of plastic-packed beauty products.\nWay forward\n\nThe expense of removing plastics from the environment would be exorbitant given the worldwide scope of plastic pollution. Therefore, the majority of approaches to the issue of plastic pollution concentrate on avoiding improper disposal or even on restricting the initial use of some plastic products.\n\nIn recent years, India\u2019s government has launched several audacious projects as a decisive reaction to the pressing problem of plastic pollution.\n\nCornerstones in the fight against this environmental threat are the Swachh Bharat Abhiyan (Clean India Mission), Lifestyle for Environment, which encourages thoughtful consumerism, the Plastic Waste Management Rules 2016, and banning Single-use Plastics.\n\nThe United Nations Environment Programme or the United Nations Development Programme could work together with NITI Aayog to lead research to fill the evidence vacuum and comprehend the particular difficulties, effects, and needs at the junction of women and the plastics sector.\n\nWaste management regulations must be enhanced to acknowledge and address the gendered effect of plastic pollution, from bettering working conditions and guaranteeing fair salaries to providing protective equipment and access to healthcare.\nGreater partnerships and synergy between government programs and efforts, like the Swachh Bharat Mission and the Smart Cities movement, must be added to this.\nRelated posts\nPlastic Waste Management: Rules and Regulations\nSingle-use Plastics\nBiotransformation Technology\nEnvironmental Pollution and Degradation\nMicroplastics\nPlastic Overshoot Day\nArctic plastic crisis\n\n-Article written by Swathi Satish"

They laid down some calculations based on four scenarios:\n\nBusiness as usual (BAU): Based on production in 2030 and the technologies being used currently, GHG emissions will grow 2.5 times by 2030 compared to 2020-21.\nLow-carbon growth pathway: Based on emission targets set by the National Steel Policy 2017, a reduction of 12.5 percent (82 million tonnes or MT) from the BAU scenario is possible.\nImproved low-carbon growth pathway: Based on voluntary targets by large steel companies, a reduction of 22.5 percent (148 MT) from the BAU scenario can be aimed for.\nAccelerated low-carbon growth pathway: CSE\u2019s proposal, which is based on the best available technologies and options for decarbonization of the sector, will lead to deeper emission reductions of 419 to 519 MT by 2030.\n\nIn the iron and steel sector, the manufacturing process determines the amount of CO2 an industrial unit will produce.\n\nCoal is key to the production of iron in a blast furnace, as well as for making steel through a basic oxygen furnace.\nThis makes decarbonizing iron and steel sector difficult until the coal or fossil fuels can be replaced.\n\nThe other way to manufacture iron is the direct reduced iron (DRI) or sponge iron method.\n\nIn this, iron is extracted using reducing agents like coal or gas, and steel is produced thereafter through an electric arc or induction furnace.\nThis production process is easier to decarbonize as coal can be replaced by natural gas; also, steel scrap can replace iron ore completely.\nDirect reduction process by hydrogen\n\nIn the production of steel, a technique known as direct reduction by hydrogen (DR-H) uses hydrogen gas to convert iron oxide (Fe2O3) into metallic iron (Fe) without the need for a blast furnace.\n\nBecause it greatly lowers the carbon emissions produced by conventional steelmaking methods, this technology is sometimes referred to as the \u201cgreen route\u201d for the manufacturing of steel.\n\nIron ore lumps or pellets are commonly mixed with hydrogen gas in a reactor vessel during the direct reduction process at temperatures between 600 and 800 \u00b0C.\n\nUsing Hydrogen as a reducing agent produces only water vapor as a by-product making it a much cleaner alternative to coal/coke.\n\nGovernment efforts for decarbonizing Iron and steel production\n\nMinistry of Steel is committed to a Net-Zero target by 2070.\n\nTowards this, in the short term (FY 2030), the reduction of carbon emissions in the steel industry through the promotion of energy and resource efficiency, renewable energy, etc. is the focus.\nFor the medium term (2030-2047), Green Hydrogen and Carbon Capture, Utilisation, and Storage are the focus areas.\nFor the long term (2047-2070), disruptive alternative technological innovations can help achieve the transition to net zero.\n\nOther steps taken to promote decarbonization in the steel industry include:\n\nThe government is promoting green steel as an alternative to reduce emissions from the sector.\nSteel Scrap Recycling Policy, 2019 enhances the availability of domestically generated scrap to reduce the consumption of coal in steel making.\nMinistry of New and Renewable Energy (MNRE) has announced National Green Hydrogen Mission for green hydrogen production and usage. The steel sector has also been made a stakeholder in the Mission.\nMotor Vehicles (Registration and Functions of Vehicles Scrapping Facility) Rules September 2021, shall increase the availability of scrap in the steel sector.\nNational Solar Mission launched by MNRE in January 2010 promotes the use of solar energy and also helps reduce the emission of the steel industry.\nPerform, Achieve and Trade (PAT) scheme, under National Mission for Enhanced Energy Efficiency, to incentivize the steel industry to reduce energy consumption.\nThe steel sector has adopted the Best Available Technologies (BAT) available globally, in the modernization and expansion projects.\nJapan\u2019s New Energy and Industrial Technology Development Organization (NEDO) Model Projects for Energy Efficiency Improvement have been implemented in steel plants.\nThe financial impact on the steel sector due to climate transition will be contingent on the actual measures taken to achieve the Net-Zero target by 2070.\n\nAlso read: Decarbonising Transport Sector\n\nWay forward\n\nDecarbonizing the steel sector will help numerous companies to perform better in the global market.\n\nSignificant emissions reductions may be achieved more effectively through investments and strategies put in place today, especially when considering the long-term horizon of developing or renovating industrial sites.\n\nThe transition to net-zero steel production would probably need cooperative action from regulators, governments, and industry stakeholders to alter the economics of production, make it easier to acquire necessary financing, and boost demand.\n\nInstalling carbon-capture machinery at existing steel plants is one way to decarbonize the steelmaking process. This would enable steel manufacturers to keep operating their facilities without harming the environment.\n\nAnother strategy is constructing brand-new steel facilities with low or no CO2 emissions. In contrast to the traditional steel factories of today, these would utilize green hydrogen to power the direct reduction of iron ore, which would then be fed into electric arc furnaces, which would also use renewable energy.\n\nRelated posts\n\nCCUS: Carbon Capture, Utilization and Storage Policy\nCOP26: UN Climate Change Conference 2021\nDecarbonising Transport Sector\n\n-Article written by Swathi Satish"

Crude oil contains sulfur, and when being transported, ships release this gas.\nIn addition to being detrimental to human health and causing respiratory and human diseases, SOx also causes acid raid, which is seriously detrimental to crops, ocean species, and the acidification of the oceans.\n\nThe International Maritime Organisation (IMO) has taken a strong stand against these sulfur emissions and has issued the requirement IMO Sulphur 2020.\n\nTo this requirement, all ships must switch to an alternative fuel oil that emits less than 0.50% sulfur into the atmosphere from the 1st of January 2020.\nThis can result in a 77% decrease in the ships\u2019 SOx emissions, lowering air pollution.\nIt is noteworthy that between 2020 and 2025, over a million premature deaths might result from sulfur emissions if they are not decreased.\nGreen Shipping Strategies\n\nSeveral initiatives and strategies are already being used by the shipping industry in an attempt to reduce emissions, some of the strategies are:\n\nLNG as an alternative fuel\n\nLiquified Natural Gas is an alternative fuel option for ships. However this alternative raises many safety issues.\nUsing LNG as a fuel will reduce CO2 by 20%, along with considerably reducing SOx and NOx.\nGreen methanol is the forgotten green fuel in case of marine, and aviation transportation sectors.\n\nSlow steaming\n\nSlowing down the speed of the ship is one of the efficient green shipping methods to reduce emissions.\nSlow steaming is an under-the-budget practice that has both economic and environmental benefits, as by reducing the speed by 10% it can reduce emissions by 19%.\nSlow steaming also helps reduce the time waiting for a port call where a considerable amount of energy is emitted.\n\nReducing empty containers\n\nEvery third container in the cargo is shipped empty which adds to the cost to the shipping industry each year in terms of storage fees, handling fees, and low utilization charges.\nThis also adds up to an enormous amount of CO2 just in empty containers.\nCarriers can collaborate with other companies and share their containers with them and move them from surplus to deficit locations.\n\nWater management\n\nBig container ships use water as a ballast to maintain their stability when it is not carrying any cargo. It reduces stress on the hull, makes the ship stable, helps to maneuver the ship, and improves propulsion.\nThe water pumped into the ballast becomes a host environment for organisms like bacteria, microbes, larvae, cysts, and so on.\nThe water is then pumped out at the port when cargo is loaded onto the ship and these newly bred organisms enter the water ecosystem where they are aliens, thereby infecting the ecosystem and posing threats.\nIn the 1980s, this was brought to the attention of IMO\u2019s Marine Environment Protection Committee (MEPC).\nNow in the new system, the water in the ballast goes through filtration and electro-chlorination (EC). The water is first filtered to remove sediments and microorganisms and then disinfected using medium-pressure UV lamps or hypochlorite from the EC process.\n\nRenewable energy\n\nThe energy of the wind and sun can be harnessed to power all kinds of ships which helps to reduce fuel consumption, emissions, and greenhouse gases.\nGreen shipping in India\n\nIndia has been selected as the first country under IMO Green Voyage 2050 project to conduct a pilot project related to Green Shipping.\n\nFor this, the Ministry of Ports, Shipping, and Waterways has launched the Green Tug Transition Programme (GTTP) and inaugurated India\u2019s first Centre of Excellence in Green Port & Shipping (NCoEGPS).\nThe program will start with \u2018Green Hybrid Tugs\u2019, which will be powered by Green Hybrid Propulsion systems, and subsequently adopt non-fossil fuel solutions like (Methanol, Ammonia, and Hydrogen).\nIt is to foster carbon neutrality and a circular economy in the shipping sector in India.\nIndia intends to increase the share of renewable energy to 60% of the total power demand of the major ports (presently less than 10%). This will be through solar and wind-generated power.\nThe ports have also aimed to reduce Carbon emissions per ton of cargo handled by 30% by 2030.\nParadip Port, Deendayal Port, and V.O.

In reality, the Paris Climate Agreement makes special safeguards to guarantee that women are supported in coping with climate change\u2019s dangers.\n\nTable of Contents\n\nClimate change and women\u00a0\nVulnerability of women to climate change\nParticipation of women in Climate decisions\nGrowth in the representation of women\nWay forward\nBest Practices\nConclusion\nClimate change and women\u00a0\nLack of resources: Climate change exacerbates the inequalities and prejudice faced by marginalised girls and young women. These females will be most affected, yet they won\u2019t have the knowledge or tools to deal with it.\nLong-distance trips: Women are frequently the ones who face the burden of having to spend a lot of time travelling to far-off water resources and coming home to provide water for their families during droughts and water shortages. The drought in East Africa has forced pastoral farmers to go far further in search of water.\nSexual assaults: Following catastrophes, women are more likely than men to be forced to flee their homes, experience sexual assault, become the target of violence, and experience other human rights abuses.\nHigh vulnerability: Women are more vulnerable than men due to characteristics like age, poverty, marginalisation, ethnicity, and gender intersections.\nFood security: In times of food scarcity, girls are also more likely than boys to receive less food, rendering them more vulnerable to malnutrition and illnesses, particularly vector-borne illnesses that are becoming more common due to climate change.\nLimited alternatives for a living: Due to societal conventions, women who rely on resources that are impacted by climate change have few options for a living.\nMigration: Men can go to jobs with higher pay elsewhere, but women are unable to do so because they must take care of their families. Due to their obligations to their families, women are often forced to work longer hours for less money, which leads to inequality and unstable income.\nVulnerability of women to climate change\n\nWomen are more vulnerable to climate change compared to men.\n\nIncreased Work: Because they are generally the ones who gather food, water, and fuel, poor women often bear the brunt of shortages brought on by or exacerbated by the climate crisis.\nLack of land rights: Because they frequently lack land rights, they are also more vulnerable to being uprooted during natural catastrophes. According to a UN estimate, women make up about 80% of those displaced due to climate change.\nGender-based violence: Violence against women is made worse by the climate catastrophe. The likelihood of sexual exploitation, early marriage, and forced marriage increases for women and girls as a result of climate change.\nLack of representation: They don\u2019t have enough representation to have an impact on regional and international decision-making.\nParticipation of women in Climate decisions\n\nSince the majority of the world\u2019s poor are women, they frequently face additional risks and burdens from the effects of climate change.\n\n\ud83d\udc49 Which year are YOU targeting for success in the IAS/IPS/IFS Exam? \ud83d\ude80\n\n(1) \u21d2 UPSC 2025: Prelims cum Mains\n\n(2) \u21d2 UPSC 2026: Prelims cum Mains\n\n(3) \u21d2 UPSC 2027 Prelims cum Mains\n\nTip: Know more about ClearIAS Courses (Online/Offline)\n\nDue to their disproportionate representation in the workforce and decision-making processes, women frequently cannot fully participate in climate-related planning, policy development, and implementation.\nDue to their local expertise and leadership in areas like sustainable resource management and/or promoting sustainable practises at the household and community levels, women can play a crucial role in the fight against climate change.\nWomen\u2019s political participation has increased political responsiveness to citizen concerns, frequently fostering cooperation across party and ethnic divides and fostering more enduring peace.\nGrowth in the representation of women\n\nSince 2013, female representation has increased in eight organisations, most notably the adaptation committee, according to UNFCC.\n\nOnly 12% of national environmental ministries were led by women, according to IUCN data from 2015. It was 15%\u00a0 in 2020. The progress in growth in the representation of women is inadequate. Few national climate policy initiatives and international organisations effectively mainstream gender issues. Men predominantly make up major panels and decision-making committees.\n\nWay forward\nGender-responsive strategies must be adopted. Any effort to combat climate change must have a substantial gender-responsive approach. This entails going beyond initiatives to guarantee that there is an equal representation of men and women on panels of experts or that projects and programmes benefit an equal number of men and women.\nAddressing underlying social issues can be a good solution. By raising awareness, we may start to address the structural power imbalances and socioeconomic marginalisation that cause women to be more severely impacted by climate change than men.\n\u00a0Successful, long-term solutions to climate change can result from acknowledging the significant contributions made by women as decision-makers, stakeholders, educators, careers, and experts across sectors and at all levels.\nClimate Change Gender Action Plans must be undertaken. Investing in participative, multi-stakeholder, and multi-sectoral plans can assist nations in developing comprehensive action that incorporates gender issues and builds on women\u2019s distinctive knowledge and perspectives.\n\u00a0It\u2019s crucial to give women and men the same space and resources to engage in climate change decision-making and action at all levels.\nBest Practices\n\nHere are a few best practices for the effective involvement of women in climate change plans.\n\nCharlot Magayi is assisting Kenyan women in switching from filthy cook burners to clean ones. In addition to enhancing community health outcomes, this lowers greenhouse gas emissions.\nAn African programme run by women called Solar Sister assists localities in creating small-scale solar systems so they can become energy-independent. These grids also lower greenhouse gas emissions and air pollution. To develop and manage clean energy sources in local communities, Barefoot College teaches women to be solar engineers.\nIn laboratories and research departments all over Africa, female scientists are bridging gender gaps by contributing first-hand knowledge of local conditions and agriculture.\nConclusion\n\nWomen remain a resource that is generally underutilised. They frequently are unable to play a full part in combating climate change due to limited land rights, access to financial resources, a lack of education and technology, and restricted access to political decision-making spheres.\n\nWomen must participate in decision-making even though they are disproportionately impacted by climate change and are essential to adaptation and mitigation efforts.\n\nRead:\u00a0Climate Change and Health;\u00a0Ecofeminism\n\nArticle Written By: Atheena Fathima Riyas"

Also, ancient Indian texts have references to Ecological principles as follows: The classical texts of the Vedic Period such as the Vedas, the Samhitas, the Brahmanas, and the Aranyakas-Upanishads contain references to ecological concepts\n\nComponents of ecology\nEcology mainly involves the study of biotic and abiotic factors within the environment\nBiotic components\u00a0include the living factors of an ecosystem.\nExamples include bacteria, animals, birds, fungi, plants, etc.\nAbiotic components\u00a0include the non-living chemical and physical factors of an ecosystem\nExamples include sunlight, soil, air, moisture minerals, etc.\nCategories of Ecology\n\nThe following are the various branches of ecology\n\nMicrobial Ecology:\nMicrobial ecology looks at the smallest fundamental levels of life, that is, the cellular level\nHere, the connections are made between microbes and their relationships with each other and their environments\nThis is particularly important in the analysis of evolutionary connections and events leading to the existence\nOrganism/Behavioural Ecology:\nThis is the study of the organism at its fundamental levels and can encompass microbial ecology.\nIn this type of ecology, the main goal is to understand the organism\u2019s behaviors, adaptations for such behaviors, the reason for those behaviors as explained through the lens of evolution, and the way all these aspects mesh together\nPopulation Ecology:\nPopulation ecology focuses on the population, defined as a group of organisms of the same species living in the same area at the same time\nHere, attention is given to things such as population size, its density, the structure of the population, migration patterns, and the interaction between organisms of the same population.\nCommunity Ecology:\nCommunity ecology takes a look at the community, defined as all the populations that live in a given area. This includes all the different species populations.\nThe focus here is usually on the interactions between the different species and how their numbers and sizes all mesh together and how change in one population changes the dynamic of the whole community\nEcosystem Ecology:\nEcosystem ecology makes a unique contribution to understanding ecology by adding abiotic (non-living) factors to the items analyzed, alongside the biotic (living) factors involved.\nThis interaction, therefore, involves all aspects of the environment and how they interact\nGlobal Ecology: Biosphere\nGlobal ecology is principally important in understanding all the ecosystems affecting the entire globe.\nThis includes all the different biomes, with considerations of aspects such as climate and other environmental geography\nExamples of Ecology study\nIn recent years, the red panda population has dropped significantly, leading conservation groups to classify it as a vulnerable or endangered species\nEcologists have found that biotic factors, such as logging of trees and the introduction of diseases from domestic dogs, played a major role in the decline of red panda populations\nAbiotic factors have been less important to date, but changing temperatures could cause further habitat loss in the future\nSo, understanding the main ecological factors responsible for the decline in red panda numbers helps ecologists form conservation plans to protect the species\nLevels of Organisation\n\nLevels of the organization are natural systems that are frequently described by part-whole relationships, with higher ones being made up of lower levels. The individual, population, community, ecosystem, biome, and biosphere are the levels of organization in ecology. Ecosystems can be researched on a local or large scale. From the smallest to the greatest, the levels of the organization are detailed below:\n\nOrganism \u2192 Population \u2192 Community \u2192 Ecosystem \u2192 Biome \u2192 Biosphere\n\n\ud83d\udc49 Which year are YOU targeting for success in the IAS/IPS/IFS Exam? \ud83d\ude80\n\n(1) \u21d2 UPSC 2025: Prelims cum Mains\n\n(2) \u21d2 UPSC 2026: Prelims cum Mains\n\n(3) \u21d2 UPSC 2027 Prelims cum Mains\n\nTip: Know more about ClearIAS Courses (Online/Offline)\n\nIndividual, Species, Organism:\nOrganisms at this level can act or function independently.\nHere, Individuals do not breed with individuals from other groups.\nIn ecology, the term organism is a living being that is capable of acting or functioning on its own.\nAn organism can respond to stimuli, reproduce, grow, adapt, and stay in a state of equilibrium.\nAny animal, plant, fungus, protist, bacterium, or archaeon on the planet would be considered an organism.\nThese organisms can be categorized in a variety of ways. The most basic classification is based on their cells such as unicellular and multicellular organisms.\nIndividual species include creatures like dogs, cats, and cows.\nPopulation:\nA group of individuals of a given species that live in a specific geographic area at a given time.\nPopulations include individuals of the same species but may have different genetic makeup such as hair/eye/skin color and size between themselves and other populations.\nA population is a\u00a0collection of\u00a0creatures from the\u00a0same species\u00a0living in the same region and interacting with one another.\nA species, on the other hand, is a group of genetically related people that can reproduce to produce children.\nIndividuals are not considered members of the same species if they are unable to generate offspring capable of having children.\nFor example, a group of dogs or a group of cats are examples of Population.\nCommunity:\nIt includes all the populations in a specific area at a given time. A community includes populations of organisms of different species.\nThese are generally named after the dominant plant species.\nA community is made up of all the\u00a0populations of various species\u00a0that dwell in the same area and interact.\nA community is made up of all of an area\u2019s biotic components.\nOrganisms in a stand of pine trees, on a coral reef, and in a cave, a valley, a lake, or a stream are examples of communities\u00a0 in an ecology\nTYPES OF COMMUNITY\n\nCommunities can be classified into two groups based on their size and degree of relative independence:\n\nMAJOR COMMUNITY:\nThese are huge, well-organized, and self-sufficient organizations. They rely solely on solar energy from the outside and are unaffected by the inputs and outputs of neighboring communities.\nFor instance, tropical evergreen forests in the Northeast.\nMINOR COMMUNITY:\nThese are often referred to as\u00a0societies\u00a0because they are reliant on adjacent communities.\nThey are secondary aggregations within a larger community, and so are not self-contained in terms of energy and nutrient dynamics.\nA lichen mat on a cow dung pad, for instance.\nEcosystem:\nEcosystems include more than a community of living organisms (biotic) interacting with the environment (abiotic).\nEverything that lives in an ecosystem is dependent on the other species and elements that are also a part of the ecological community.\nThe\u00a0living\u00a0organisms (all populations) in a certain area, as well as the\u00a0non-living\u00a0features of the environment, make up an ecosystem.\nIn an ecology: Nutrient cycles and energy flows bind these biotic and abiotic components together.\nPhotosynthesis brings energy into the system, which is absorbed into plant tissue.\nBiome:\nA Biome is a set of ecosystems sharing similar characteristics with their abiotic factors adapted to their environments.\nThe biosphere\u2019s\u00a0terrestrial portion\u00a0is divided into vast sections known as biomes.\nBiomes are\u00a0defined by climate, flora, animal life, and general soil type.\nThere are no two biomes that are alike.\nThe biome boundaries and the abundance of plants and animals found in each one are determined by the climate.\nTemperature and precipitation are the most important climatic elements.\nTundra, Boreal Forests, Grasslands, Deserts, Temperate Forests, Tropical Rain Forests, Tropical Deciduous Forests and Savannah are all biomes.\nBiosphere:\nWhen we consider all the different biomes, each blending into the other, with all humans living in many different geographic areas, we form a huge community of humans, animals and plants, and micro-organisms in their defined habitats. A biosphere is the sum of all the ecosystems established on planet Earth.\nThe biosphere refers to the\u00a0portion\u00a0of the\u00a0planet\u00a0that contains\u00a0living\u00a0beings.\nThe biosphere encompasses the majority of the Earth\u2019s surface, as well as a portion of the\u00a0oceans\u00a0and\u00a0atmosphere.\nIn other words, the biosphere encompasses the sum of all living organisms and their surroundings.\nThus the atmosphere, lithosphere and hydrosphere are all included in the biosphere.\nPrinciples of Ecology\n\nThe following are the principles of ecology\n\nEvolution organizes ecological systems into hierarchies:\nIndividual organisms combine into populations, populations combine into species, and species combine into higher taxa like genera and phyla.\nEach can be characterized by its abundance and diversity (number of kinds) in a given ecosystem or study plot\nThe sun is the ultimate source of energy for most ecosystems:\nLife runs on the carbon-rich sugars produced by photosynthesis; every ecosystem\u2019s sugar output depends on how much solar energy and precipitation it receives\nOrganisms are chemical machines that run on energy:\nThe laws of chemistry and physics limit the ways each organism makes a living and provide a basic framework for ecology.\nThe supply of chemical elements and the sugars needed to fuel their assembly into organisms limit the abundance and diversity of life\nChemical nutrients cycle repeatedly while energy flows through an ecology:\nThe atoms of elements like Carbon, Nitrogen, and Sodium go back and forth from spending time in living to spending time in dead parts of an ecosystem.\nBut the photons of solar energy can be used only once before they are lost to the universe\nOrganisms interact\u2014do things to each other\u2014in ways that influence their abundance:\nIndividual organisms can eat one another, compete for shared resources, and help each other survive.\nEach pair of species in an ecosystem can be characterized by the kind and strength of these interactions\nEcosystems are organized into webs of interactions\nThe abundance of a population is influenced by the chains of interactions that connect it to the other species in its ecosystem\nThis often leads to complex behavior, and a key challenge in ecology is to determine what patterns of abundance and diversity can be predicted\nHuman populations have an outsized role in competing with, preying upon, and helping other organisms in an ecology:\nHumans are one of the millions of species embedded in Earth\u2019s ecosystems. The ability of humans to change the planet, abetted by our large population size and technological prowess, increases our ability to shape the biosphere\u2019s future\nEcosystems provide essential services to human populations:\nThese include products like timber, fiber,r and food, regulating water and air quality, and cultural benefits like recreation. A key goal of ecology is to use the above principles to preserve ecosystem services.\nConclusion\n\nThe different levels of organization assist in classifying the various types of interactions that take place in the environment. It aids scientists in distinguishing the habitats of different animals. Besides, we can make informed policy decisions on how to manage our wildlife resources if we understand these relationships.\n\nArticle written by: Aseem Muhammed"

Beta particles are negatively charged electrons, and gamma rays are neutral electromagnetic radiations.\nThe earth\u2019s crust contains naturally occurring radioactive elements.\nThree NORM (Naturally Occurring Radioactive Materials) series contaminate water resources: uranium, thorium, and actinium.\nWhat is Radioactive Pollution?\nRadioactive Pollution\u00a0is defined as the increase in the natural radiation levels in the environment that pose a serious threat to humans and other life forms.\nRadioactive contamination is the deposition of or presence of radioactive substances on surfaces or within solids, liquids, or gases (including the human body), where their presence is unintended or undesirable (International Atomic Energy Agency definition).\nRadioactive pollution occurs when radioactive materials are present or deposited in the atmosphere or environment, especially when their presence is unintentional and poses a risk to the environment due to radioactive decay\nThe radioactive materials destroying emitting hazardous ionizing radiation (radioactive decay) such as beta or alpha particles, gamma rays, or neurons into the environment where they exist.\nHuman activities are considered to be responsible for around 20% of the radiation we are exposed to.\nActivities involving radioactive materials, such as mining, handling and processing radioactive materials, handling and storage of radioactive waste, and the use of radioactive reactions to generate energy (nuclear power plants), as well as the use of radiation in medicine (e.g. X-rays) and research, are all examples of human activities that can release requestion.\nTypes of Radiation\n\nRadioactivity is a phenomenon of spontaneous fission of a proton (alpha-particles), electrons (beta-particles), and gamma rays (short-wave electromagnetic waves) due to the disintegration of atomic nuclei of some elements.\n\nThese cause radioactive pollution. Radiations can be categorized into two groups namely non-ionizing radiations and ionizing radiations.\n\n\ud83d\udc49 Which year are YOU targeting for success in the IAS/IPS/IFS Exam? \ud83d\ude80\n\n(1) \u21d2 UPSC 2025: Prelims cum Mains\n\n(2) \u21d2 UPSC 2026: Prelims cum Mains\n\n(3) \u21d2 UPSC 2027 Prelims cum Mains\n\nTip: Know more about ClearIAS Courses (Online/Offline)\n\nNon-ionizing radiations\nNon-ionizing radiation is a type of lower energy radiation that cannot detach electrons from atoms or molecules, whether they are part of matter or living things.\nVisible, infrared, and ultraviolet light, microwaves, radio waves, and radiofrequency energy from cell phones are all examples of non-ionizing radiation.\nThey have a limited ability to penetrate and have an impact on the chemicals and cells that they absorb.\nThe majority of non-ionizing radiation types, though, are carcinogenic.\nThese waves have energies enough to excite the atoms and molecules of the medium through which they pass, causing them to vibrate faster but not strong enough to ionize them.\nThey may damage eyes which reflections and cause direct blindness) directly looking towards the sun during an eclipse.\nThey injure the cells of skin and blood capillaries reddening blisters and reddening sunburns.\nIonizing radiations\nIonizing radiation is a type of radiation that has enough energy to separate electrons from atoms or molecules, which results in atomic-level alterations when it interacts with anything, including living things.\nThe word \u201cionizing\u201d radiation refers to changes that typically result in the formation of ions (atoms or molecules that are Explicitly charged).\nExamples: X-rays, cosmic rays, and atomic radiations are some of them (radiations emitted by radioactive elements).\nIonizing radiation has a strong ability to penetrate matter and can shatter large molecules.\nMolecular damage may result in Long-range (delayed) or short-range (immediate).\nIonization is when an atom or a molecule acquires a negative or positive charge by gaining or losing electrons to form ions, often in conjunction with other chemical changes.\nSources of Radioactive Pollution\n\nSources of radioactive pollution can be widely classified as Natural sources and man-made sources of radioactive pollution.\n\nNatural Sources of Radioactive Pollution\n\nThe following are the natural sources of radioactive pollution:\n\nEXPOSURE TO COSMIC RADIATION\nCosmic radiation is constantly bombarding the Earth\u2019s outer atmosphere.\nCosmic radiation is made up of fast-moving particles that exist in space and can come from a variety of places, including the sun and other celestial occurrences.\nProtons make up the majority of cosmic rays, although they can also be other particles or wave energy.\nTERRESTRIAL RADIATION\nTerrestrial radiation is produced by the Earth itself. Natural radioactive materials can be found in soil and rock.\nNatural reserves of uranium, potassium, and thorium, which produce modest amounts of ionizing radiation during natural decay, are the principal sources.\nUranium and thorium are \u201cubiquitous,\u201d which means they can be found almost wherever.\nRADIATION THROUGH INHALATION\nInhalation of radioactive gases created by radioactive materials found in soil and bedrock accounts for the majority of variations in natural radiation exposure.\nThe decay of uranium- releases colorless odorless and colorless radioactive gas. It is an inert gas, which means it does not react with the matter around it.\nRadon can easily migrate up through the ground and into the sky since it does not react.\nThoron is a thorium-derived radioactive gas.\nThe amount of radon and thoron in the air varies greatly depending on the soil and bedrock makeup.\nMan-Made (Anthropogenic) Sources of Radioactive Pollution\n\nThe following are the anthropogenic sources of radioactive pollution:\n\nNUCLEAR POWER PLANTS\nThe nuclear fusion process in nuclear power plants is the prime culprit for the generation of radioactive waste.\nThese processes generate radioactive wastes such as uranium mill tailings, spent (used) reactor fuel, and other various wastes which are hazardous environmental hazards associated with nuclear power plants.\nFor thousands of years, these elements can stay radioactive and are harmful to human health.\nNUCLEAR WASTE HANDLING AND DISPOSAL\nNuclear waste handling and disposal can produce low to medium levels of radioactivity time.\nThe radioactivity has the potential to pollute and spread through the air, water, and soil.\nAs a result, their impacts may be difficult to discern and anticipate. Furthermore, certain nuclear waste sites may go undetected.\nThe primary problem with radioactive waste is that it cannot be decomposed chemically or handled biologically.\nNUCLEAR WEAPONS\nNuclear weapons testing began with the advent of the atomic era, resulting in the radioactive pollution of a vast number of locations around the world.\nAccording to statistics from the Stockholm International Peace Research Institute platform, between 1945 and 2006, 2053 nuclear tests were conducted globally.\nThis was one of the major sources of radioactive pollution.\nEffects of radioactive Pollution\n\nMany ill effects are occurring due to radioactive\u00a0 pollution listed as follows:\n\nGenetic Mutations\nWhen it comes to genes and genetics, radiation has negative consequences.\nIt causes DNA strand damage, which leads to\u00a0genetic disintegration\u00a0over time.\nThe degree of genetic mutation leading to\u00a0changes in DNA composition\u00a0varies depending on the amount and type of radiation one has been exposed to.\nIf a person or animal is exposed to too much radiation through the atmosphere, food, or even water, their bodies are likely to have already absorbed the radiation.\nBecause energy cannot be eliminated, it remains active once within the body.\nAs a result of the\u00a0mutation, one is extremely vulnerable to\u00a0cancer.\nDiseases\nOur health is severely harmed by radioactive pollution.\u00a0Acute radiation syndrome\u00a0is a rare condition that is one of the most deadly side effects of radioactive pollution.\nIt is, however, a result of high-level radioactive radiation. Within a few hours, this condition causes nausea and vomiting.\nIf the situation is extremely bad, the person may die in a matter of days or weeks.\nRadiation can also cause\u00a0cancer, which is by far the most common side effect.\nSoil Infertility\nRadiation is prevalent in soils due to its exposure to the atmosphere.\nRadioactive compounds in the soil react with various nutrients, causing the\u00a0nutrients\u00a0to be\u00a0destroyed\u00a0and the soil to become\u00a0infertile\u00a0and very\u00a0poisonous.\nSuch soil results in the harvest of\u00a0crops\u00a0that are contaminated with radiation and consequently unsafe for\u00a0human\u00a0and\u00a0animal consumption.\nImpact on Marine Life\nFor decades, power plants have been releasing radioisotopes into the water as a source of nuclear energy and chemical processing.\nThey include Cesium, Radon, Crypton, Ruthenium, Zinc, and Copper, to name a few.\nThe fact that the waste is emitted at a \u201cpermissible\u201d level does not imply that it is safe.\nThese radionuclides can be found in the fishes\u2019 soft tissues as well as their bones.\nThe radioisotope of ruthenium was believed to be present in the seaweed used in bread.\nThe shells and tissues of all shelled fishes are polluted with radionuclides.\nMeasures to Control Radioactive Pollution\n\nRadiation can still be found in radioactive waste. As a result, it cannot be disposed of in the same manner as regular waste.\n\nProper Method of Disposing of Radioactive Waste\nBecause seepage is a possibility, this waste should be stored in large, thick concrete containers.\nSince storage may not be practicable, another alternative is to dilute the radiation.\nProper Labeling\nAny material containing radioactive material must be labeled, with the required precautions stated on the label\u2019s content.\nThe reason for this is that even light contact with radioactive material can allow radiation to enter the body.\nContainers containing such materials should be clearly labeled to encourage the use of protective equipment when handling them.\nProhibition of Nuclear Tests\nIt has already been established that nuclear power possesses a great deal of latent destructive force.\nNonetheless, the tests conducted to perfect the energy play a significant role in the overall presence of radioactive materials.\nFurthermore, although being conducted in the deserts, these tests wind up leaking into other ecosystems, impacting the livelihoods of many people.\nAlternative Energy Sources\nInitially, the development and usage of nuclear power were not dreadful things.\nHowever, given the harm and threats it poses to the environment, it is past time for its use to be phased out in favor of alternative and ecologically friendly energy sources, such as renewable energy sources (solar, hydroelectric, and wind power).\nWhen radioactivity is used to generate energy in nuclear power plants, for example, the waste emitted from the various processes and combustion results in more radiation being discharged into the atmosphere.\nRegulatory Measures\nThe Department of Atomic Energy (DAE), which was founded in 1954, is the executive agency for all nuclear energy-related activities.\nNuclear installation locations are selected with safety considerations in mind.\nSeveral structural barriers are planned to prevent any serious radiation leakage from the reactor.\nEvery month, the radiation exposure of employees is assessed.\nThe exposure limit for personnel has been set at 30 millisieverts (mSv) by the Atomic Energy Regulatory Board (AERB).\nThis conforms to the International Commission on Radiological Protection\u2019s (ICRP) level (ICRP).\nThe Atomic Energy Regulatory Board, an independent arm of the Atomic Energy Commission, executes all safety and regulatory duties mandated by the Atomic Energy Act of 1962, which applies to all Department of Atomic Energy institutions.\nAdditionally, it has the authority to make decisions about the location, planning, execution, and maintenance of all nuclear installations.\nConclusion\n\nIt is important to control radioactive pollution both at the individual level and at the government level. Using radiation exposure protection, proper labels, and appropriate storage and disposal are a few of them. All locations that utilize potentially hazardous levels of radioactive material urgently require increased security measures.\n\nThe best preventive approach to dealing with this kind of pollution may be to speed the development of low-cost alternatives for radioactive materials in a wide range of applications through research programs and incentives.\n\nArticle written by Aseem Muhammed"

It refers to the peat soil and the wetland habitat growing on its surface. They are a type of wetland that occurs in almost every country on the globe, currently covering 3% of the global land surface.\nThey occur in different climate zones. While in tropical climates, they can occur in mangroves, Arctic regions,\nPeatland landscapes are varied \u2013 from blanket bog landscapes with open, treeless vegetation in the Flow Country of Scotland \u2013 a tentative World Heritage site \u2013 to swamp forests in Southeast Asia.\nThey are formed due to the accumulation of partially decomposed plant remains over thousands of years under conditions of water logging. Peatlands are terrestrial wetland ecosystems in which waterlogged conditions prevent plant material from fully decomposing.\nPeats are a heterogeneous mixture of plant material that has accumulated in a water-saturated region and is only partly decomposed due to the lack of oxygen (vascular plants, mosses, and hummus).\nConsequently, the production of organic matter exceeds its decomposition, which results in a net accumulation of peat. Over millennia this material builds up and becomes several meters thick.\nIn permafrost regions towards the poles and at high altitudes, in coastal areas, under tropical rainforests and in boreal forests, they are mainly found. Russia, Canada, Indonesia, the USA, Finland, etc. are the countries with the highest peatland areas.\nPeatlands are the largest natural terrestrial carbon store. They are important not just for their carbon but also for their crucial role in the storage and cycling of water and nutrients.\nPeatlands provide drinking water, mitigate the risk of climate change and flood risk and secure the livelihoods of communities that live in these landscapes.\nDamaged peatlands are a major source of greenhouse gas emissions, annually releasing almost 6% of global anthropogenic CO2 emissions.\nThere are several international and regional agreements and conventions exist, such as the Ramsar Convention, the United Nations Environmental Assembly Resolution, and the Brazzaville Declaration on Peatlands, with provisions for the sustainable management of peatlands and their protection.\nCongo basin has the world\u2019s largest tropical peatlands, discovered in 2017. Also known as the Cuvette Centrale peats, the world\u2019s largest tropical complex covers over 145,500 square kilometers.\nWhat are the threats to Peatland?\n\nThe peatlands face significant threats due to hydrocarbon exploration, logging, palm oil plantations, hydroelectric dams, and climate change.\n\nA lack of awareness: of the benefits of peatlands means that they have been severely overexploited and damaged as a result of actions including drainage, agricultural conversion, burning, and mining for fuel, among others.\nDrainage for agriculture: Drained peatlands are mainly used for agriculture and forestry, and peat is extracted for horticulture and energy production. CO2 emissions from drained peatlands are estimated at 1.3 gigatonnes of CO2 annually. This is equivalent to 5.6% of global anthropogenic CO2 emissions.\nCommercial Forestry: It is the second greatest cause of land-use changes in peatland mostly prevalent in Scandinavian countries, the UK, Russia, South-East Asia, etc.\nPeat extraction and usage:\u00a0Peat as a source of energy is being used on a large scale by households. It is also used as raw material for producing growing media for professional horticulture and for home gardening.\nInfrastructure Development: Conversion of peatlands in coastal areas to meet the urban development, waste disposal needs, and development of roads and other infrastructure.\nWhen peatlands are degraded or destroyed: Peatland destruction leads to releasing vast amounts of CO2; \u2013 Burning, draining, and degrading peat bogs emit carbon dioxide equivalent to more than one-tenth of the global emissions released from burning fossil fuels.\nPeatlands and climate change\nPeatlands are a type of wetland that is critical for preventing and mitigating the effects of climate change, preserving biodiversity, minimizing flood risk, and ensuring safe drinking water.\nIt is the largest natural terrestrial carbon store. They store more carbon than all other vegetation types in the world combined.\nDamaged peatlands are a major source of greenhouse gas emissions,\u00a0responsible for almost 5% of global anthropogenic CO2 emissions.\nThis terrestrial restoration can reduce emissions significantly.\nCountries should include peatland conservation and restoration in their commitments to international agreements, including the Paris Agreement on climate change.\n\nAlso read: Ramsar sites (Wetlands) in India: Memorize faster\n\nWhat are the Conservation Efforts?\nThere are several international and regional agreements and conventions, such as the Ramsar Convention, the United Nations Environmental Assembly Resolution, and the Brazzaville Declaration on Peatlands, with provisions for the sustainable management of peatlands and their protection.\nHowever, there is an urgent need to strengthen national institutions and frameworks for the effective application and implementation of these agreements and commitments, the report\n\u00a0In some areas, year-round waterlogged conditions slow the process of plant decomposition to such an extent that dead plants accumulate to form peat.

It will also examine the importance of peats for national economies.\nBrazzaville Declaration:\nIt was signed to promote better management and conservation of the Cuvette Centrale Region in the Congo Basin in the backdrop of the 3rd Conference of Partners of the Global Peatlands Initiative (GPI), 2018.\n\nAlso read: Ramsar Sites In India\n\n\ud83d\udc49 Which year are YOU targeting for success in the IAS/IPS/IFS Exam? \ud83d\ude80\n\n(1) \u21d2 UPSC 2025: Prelims cum Mains\n\n(2) \u21d2 UPSC 2026: Prelims cum Mains\n\n(3) \u21d2 UPSC 2027 Prelims cum Mains\n\nTip: Know more about ClearIAS Courses (Online/Offline)\n\nImportance of Peatlands\n\nPeatlands are critical for preserving global biodiversity, providing safe drinking water, minimizing flood risk, and helping address climate change.\n\nPeatlands are highly significant to global efforts to combat climate change, as well as wider sustainable development goals. The protection and restoration of these lands are vital in the transition towards a low-carbon and circular economy. Damaged peats are a major source of greenhouse gas emissions, annually releasing almost 6% of global anthropogenic CO2 emissions. Peatland restoration can therefore bring significant emissions reductions.\nPeatlands are the largest natural terrestrial carbon store; the area covered by near natural peatlands worldwide (>3 million km2) sequesters 0.37 gigatonnes of carbon dioxide (CO2) a year \u2013 storing more carbon than all other vegetation types in the world combined.\nSupporting the water cycle: controlling water flow, exerting a cooling effect by evaporation and cloud formation during hot periods, playing an important role in the conservation of contaminants and nutrients and purification of water, counteracting eutrophication of water bodies, and also preventing saltwater intrusion.\nSupporting rare and critically endangered biodiversity: A variety of endangered species, including Sumatran tigers, gorillas, and orangutans, live in tropical peats.\nSupporting livelihoods: in the boreal and temperate regions, they are the source of fruit, mushrooms, and medicinal plants and of non-timber forest products in the tropical regions. The peat itself is also used as fuel. In many parts of the world, they supply food, fiber, and other local products that sustain local economies.\nAs a cultural landscape and archive: some of the most evocative geological finds of recent decades, such as the \u2018sweet tracks\u2019 of the 4th millennium BCE footpath, also preserve important ecological and archaeological information such as pollen records and human artifacts.\nWay forward\nTo preserve these endangered habitats and their services to people, a landscape approach is crucial and good practices in peatland management and regeneration must be communicated and applied across all peatland landscapes.\nRewetting: It is a vital phase in the regeneration of peatlands since their sustainability depends on waterlogged conditions.\nPlaudiculture and sustainable management techniques: This is a method of growing crops on damp soils, particularly in peatlands. Fish farming or the pursuit of ecotourism may be other sustainable techniques.\nLegal and Fiscal environment and Policies: It is important to properly enforce various policies that have been placed in place at both global and domestic levels.\nWith the protection of conventional non-destructive uses and the implementation of novel management alternatives, local communities should obtain funding for the sustainable management of their peatlands.\nBuilding a market to finance the maintenance of peatlands: using financing instruments such as green bonds, private capital (equity and debt), government funding, etc.\nInstitutional structure for collective action: It is important to develop integrated global partnerships.\nLimiting new agricultural and industrial practices that threaten their long-term sustainability and designing policies for long-term land use that encourage peatland conservation and protection.\nCapacity building: Focused action is needed for capacity building, outreach, and awareness raising with funding from developed countries.\nTo better understand their size and status and to enable us to safeguard them, a thorough mapping of peatlands worldwide is important.\nUPSC Previous Year Questions\n\nIn the context of mitigating the impending global warming due to anthropogenic emission of carbon dioxide, which of the following can be the potential sites for carbon sequestration?\n\nAbandoned and Uneconomic coal seams\nDepleted oil and gas reservoirs\nSubterranean deep saline formations\n\nSelect the correct answer using the code given below:\n\n(a) 1 and 2 only\n\n(b) 1 and 3 only\n\n(c) 3 only\n\n(d) 1, 2 and 3\n\nAnswer (d)\n\nArticle written by: Aseem Muhammed"

These biomes are made up of tiny bodies of water like creeks, lakes, streams, and rivers. These bodies of water are freshwater and salt-free. There are significant differences between fresh and salted water. Most plants and animals cannot thrive in the absence of freshwater biomes.\n\nStanding Freshwater Biomes\n\nPonds and lakes are examples of standing freshwater biomes. Ponds are often smaller than lakes and shallow enough that sunlight can reach the bottom. At least some of the water in lakes is too deep for sunlight to penetrate. As a result, lakes, like the ocean, can be classified into zones based on the availability of sunlight for producers.\n\nThe littoral zone is defined as the water nearest to the shore. The water in the littoral zone is generally shallow enough that sunlight can enter and allow photosynthesis to take place. Phytoplankton and plants that float in the water are both producers in this zone.\nThe top layer of lake water distant from the coast is known as the limnetic zone. This zone covers a large portion of the lake\u2019s surface, yet it only extends as deep as sunlight can penetrate. This is a maximum distance of 200 metres.\nThe profundal zone is the deep water towards the lake\u2019s bottom where no sunlight can reach. Because photosynthesis is impossible, there are no producers in this zone.\nThe bottom of the lake receives sunlight near the coast, where the water is shallow, and plants can grow in the sediments. Crayfish, snails, and insects are also found in and around the plants near the coast.\n\nAlso Read: Environment and Ecology- Important Terminologies \u2013 ClearIAS\n\nLAKES AND PONDS\n\nSome ponds appear and go. Some have been around for a long time. Because a lake or pond is usually isolated from other bodies of water, not all plants and animals can live in this freshwater biome. They can be found in a variety of settings and on all continents. They might be as small as a few square metres or as large as thousands of square kilometres.\n\nThere are many freshwater fish species in lakes and ponds, just as there are many in rivers and streams. They are significant because they provide a fresh source of water for the animals that live nearby.\n\nWETLANDS\n\nWetlands are areas where there is standing water. It can be compared to water-saturated land. Swamps, bogs, marshes, flood plains, and prairie potholes are examples. They can be found all over the world and are frequently found near huge quantities of water such as lakes and rivers.\n\nWetlands are significant because they prevent flooding by absorbing excess water. They also aid in the purification of water. Hydrophytes are plants that dwell in wetlands. Wetland plants include milkweed, water lilies, grasses, tamarack, sedges, duckweed, cattail, cypress trees, and mangroves.\n\nWetlands are also home to a variety of amphibians, reptiles, mammals, and birds. Beavers, minks, raccoons, and deer are just a few examples.\n\nAlso Read:\u00a0 Ramsar Sites In India \u2013 ClearIAS\n\nRunning Freshwater Biomes\n\nStreams and rivers are examples of running freshwater biomes. Streams are often less in size than rivers. Streams can begin as surface runoff, glacial melting, or spring water seeping out of the ground. Water flows downhill if the land is not flat. As it runs across the land, the water joins other streams and finally rivers. The water eventually drains into a pond, lake, or ocean.\n\nSTREAMS AND RIVERS\n\nA river or stream is a body of water that only runs one way. Rivers and streams, unlike ponds and lakes, are always in motion. The temperature at the source is lower than the temperature at the mouth. Streams and rivers can be found all over the world and can traverse thousands of kilometres before joining an ocean. A spring, lake, or snowfall starts the construction of a river or stream and eventually leads to an ocean or other body of water.\n\nFreshwater Biome Creatures\n\nAs previously said, the Freshwater Biome provides an ideal habitat for both plants and animals, and many do. These animals and plants thrive because the water is free of the harsh salt present in other locations. The freshwater biome benefits humans as well.\nThe following animals can be found in the Freshwater Biomes:\n\nFrogs\nMosquitos\nTurtles\nRaccoons\nShrimp\nCrab\nTadpoles\nSnakes\nPlants from the Freshwater Biome\n\nIn the freshwater biome, two common plants are grass and sedge. Trees are uncommon in these locations, however they can be observed on occasion. Most of the plants found in freshwater biomes are unrecognisable to most of us.\nSome of the plants that can be found in the freshwater biome are:\n\nMangroves\u00a0\nSpike Rush\nWater Lily\nCattail\nBull Rush\nPickerel Weed\n\nFreshwater ecosystems are composed of land-based water that is constantly cycling and has a low salt content (always less than 5 ppt).\n\nMarine biomes\n\nMarine biomes are bodies of water with salt concentrations that are equivalent to or greater than that of seawater (i.e., 35 ppt or above). Marine ecosystems, which live in salty waters, are the largest of the Earth\u2019s aquatic ecosystems.\n\nAs previously stated, freshwater habitats contain less salt than saltwater ones. Marine biomes are aquatic biomes found in the ocean\u2019s saline water.\n\nThe three major marine biomes are neritic, oceanic, and benthic. Intertidal zones, estuaries, and coral reefs are examples of marine biomes.\n\nNeritic Biomes\nNeritic biomes are found in ocean water around the continental shelf.\nThey extend from the low-tide water line to the continental shelf\u2019s edge.\nBecause the water is shallow here, there is enough sunlight for photosynthesis.\nThe water is also high in nutrients, which have been washed into it from neighbouring land.\nBecause of these favourable conditions, neritic biomes support high concentrations of phytoplankton.\nThey generate adequate food for many other creatures, including zooplankton and nekton.\nAs a result, neritic biomes have high biomass and diversity.\nSeveral types of insects and fish live in them. In reality, neritic biomes are home to the majority of the world\u2019s major saltwater fishing locations.\n\nAlso Read: Biodiversity Hotspots in India \u2013 ClearIAS\n\nOceanic Biomes\nOceanic biomes are found beyond the continental shelf in the open ocean.\nBecause dissolved nutrient contents are lower away from shore, the oceanic zone has a lower organism density than the neritic zone.\nThe oceanic zone is further subdivided into zones based on sea depth.\nThe epipelagic zone is defined as the top 200 metres of water, or the depth to which sufficient sunlight may enter for photosynthesis.\nThe bathypelagic zone extends from 1,000 to 4,000 metres below sea level. Because sunlight does not penetrate below 1,000 metres, this zone is completely dark.\nBetween 4,000 and 6,000 metres below sea level lies the abyssopelagic zone.\nThe hadopelagic zone is located in deep ocean trenches beneath 6,000 metres of water.\n\nAlso Read : Grasslands: Types, Features, and Significance \u2013 ClearIAS\n\nBenthic Biomes\n\nBenthic biomes are found at the ocean\u2019s bottom, where benthos live.Certain benthos, such as sponges, are sessile, meaning they cannot move and reside glued to the ocean floor.Some benthos, such as clams, dig through ocean floor sediments.\n\nThe benthic zone is further subdivided dependent on how much below sea level the ocean bottom is.\n\nThe sublittoral zone is the area of the ocean floor near the shoreline that comprises the continental shelf.\nThe bathyal zone is the section of the ocean floor that forms the continental slope. It is located between 1,000 and 4,000 metres below sea level.\nThe abyssal zone is a section of the deep open ocean\u2019s ocean floor. It ranges between 4,000 and 6,000 metres below sea level.\nIn deep ocean trenches, the hadal zone is the ocean bottom below 6,000 metres. The only species known to dwell in this zone are found around hydrothermal vents, where invertebrates like tubeworms and clams can be discovered. For feeding, they rely on minute archaea species.\nIntertidal zone\nThe intertidal zone is a short strip of land between the high- and low-tide water lines.\nIt is also known as the littoral zone.\nThe regular passage of the tides in and out is a prominent aspect of this zone.\nThis happens twice a day in most places.\nThis zone alternates between being underwater at high tide and being exposed to the air at low tide due to tides.\nThe high tide brings in coastal water with its heavy supply of dissolved nutrients on a regular basis.\nThere is also an abundance of sunshine for photosynthesis.\nAlso, the shallow water keeps bigger predators out of the intertidal zone, such as whales and huge fish.\nEstuary\nA bay where a river drains into the ocean is known as an estuary.\nIt is normally semi-enclosed, which makes it a safe setting.\nThe water is nutrient-rich from the river and shallow enough to allow sunlight to penetrate for photosynthesis.\nAs a result, estuaries are teeming with marine life.\nCoral reef\nA coral reef is an underwater limestone structure formed by corals, which are microscopic invertebrate organisms.\nCoral reefs can only be found in shallow tropical ocean water.\nCorals release calcium carbonate (limestone) to construct an exterior skeleton.\nCorals live in colonies, and the skeletal material accumulates over time to form a reef. Coral reefs are teeming with marine life, including over 4,000 tropical fish species.\nImportance of Aquatic Biomes\nThe health of aquatic biomes is vital to the general health of the planet.\nThe oceans, with their fish, weeds, invertebrates, and mammals, as well as the world\u2019s rivers, lakes, streams, marshes, and ponds, are all important biodiversity reservoirs.\nThe waters also help to regulate global temperature and keep carbon out of the atmosphere.\nWhilst we should all try to eat less fish, there is no denying that fish and other aquatic creatures are important food sources for many terrestrial animals (i.e. animals that live on land).\nAquatic biomes recycle nutrients, purify water, minimise flooding, increase and maintain streamflow, recharge groundwater, and serve as wildlife habitats and recreational areas.\nIn addition to contributing to biodiversity and ecological productivity, they serve a variety of services for human populations, including water for drinking and irrigation, recreational activities, and habitat for economically important fisheries.\nConclusion\n\nAround the world, there are many different types of aquatic ecosystems, each of which is home to some wonderful species. Scientists think that because our marine habitats are so vast and enigmatic, they have only documented about 10% of the creatures that live there. Nevertheless, pollution, carbon emissions, and overfishing pose major risks to these aquatic ecosystems. The Great Barrier Reef, one of the world\u2019s natural wonders, is already dying before our eyes. It is vital that we all act now to protect the world\u2019s aquatic ecosystems for future generations. This can be accomplished by reducing emissions, preventing the use of harmful chemicals that can leach into the oceans and rivers, and removing fish from the food chain.\n\nArticle Written By: Atheena Fathima Riyas\u00a0"

Functions of ecosystem include:\n\nEcosystem functions are natural processes or energy exchanges that take place in various plant and animal groupings across the globe\u2019s biomes.\nGreen leaves, for example, prepare food, while roots take nutrients from the earth; herbivores and predators consume the leaves and roots.\nDecomposers are responsible for converting complex organic resources into simple inorganic chemicals that producers can use.\nThe transfer of energy and nutrients in the food chain is the essence of ecosystem operations.\nThese interactions ensure the survival of plant and animal life on Earth, as well as organic matter decomposition and biomass formation.\nAll of the ecosystem\u2019s functions are carried out through precisely balanced and regulated procedures.\n\nThe following broad categories can be used to study ecological functions:\n\n\ud83d\udc49 Which year are YOU targeting for success in the IAS/IPS/IFS Exam? \ud83d\ude80\n\n(1) \u21d2 UPSC 2025: Prelims cum Mains\n\n(2) \u21d2 UPSC 2026: Prelims cum Mains\n\n(3) \u21d2 UPSC 2027 Prelims cum Mains\n\nTip: Know more about ClearIAS Courses (Online/Offline)\n\nEnergy Flow\nNutrient cycling\nEcological succession or ecosystem development\nThe Flow of Energy\nEnergy flow refers to the movement of energy through living organisms in an environment.\nA food chain can be built by dividing all living species into producers and consumers.\nA trophic level is a name given to each nutritional level in the food chain.\nNutrient Cycling\nThe nutrient cycle is a concept that describes the transfer of nutrients from the physical environment to living beings and back again.\nThe passage of nutrients from the environment to plants and animals and back again is required for life to exist.\nThis cycle is an essential component of each region\u2019s ecology.\nTo keep an organism alive for a long time, the nutrition cycle must be balanced and steady in any given environment.\nEcological Succession\nSuccession is a universal process of directional change in plants on an ecological time scale.\nSuccession occurs when a number of communities are displaced by large-scale natural or man-made calamities.\nThis cycle is repeated until a stable, adult community arises, with one group displacing another.\nSuccession is a chain of circumstances that leads to the establishment of a relatively stable peak community.\n\nEcological succession refers to the process through which the species and environment mix in a given area changes over time. These communities gradually supersede one another until a \u201cclimax community,\u201d such as a mature forest, forms or a disruption occurs, such as a fire.\n\nEcological succession\n\nSuccession is a universal process of directional change in plants on an ecological time scale.\n\nSuccession occurs when a series of communities are displaced by a large-scale natural or man-made tragedy.\nThis cycle is repeated until a stable, adult community arises, with one group displacing another.\nThe pioneer community is the first plant to settle in a new area. The final stage of succession is the climax community. The seral, or successional, stages are those that precede the climax community.\nWhen an abandoned farm field in midwestern India is left alone for several years, it gradually evolves into a meadow, then a few bushes, and finally trees completely cover the field, resulting in a forest.\nSuccession is characterised by improved productivity, a movement of resources from reservoirs, greater species diversity with increased niche formation, and a progressive increase in the complexity of food webs.\n\nEcological succession includes primary succession, secondary succession, autogenic succession, allogenic succession, autotrophic and heterotrophic succession.\n\nAlso read: Bioremediation\n\nPrimary Succession\nPrimary succession occurs when there is no plant life on the landscape, such as after a lava flow or glacial retreat.\nDuring primary succession, organisms must begin from the beginning.\nLichens may cling to rocks first, followed by the emergence of a few small plants capable of thriving without soil. \u201cPioneer species\u201d is what they\u2019re called.\nWhen these plants decompose, soil forms and more and larger plants inhabit the area.\nA climax community, akin to a forest, forms after enough soil has accumulated and enough nutrients are available.\nIf the site is disturbed after this stage, secondary succession occurs.\nSecondary Succession\nSecondary succession occurs when a disturbance impacts a climax or intermediate community.\nThe succession cycle has been restarted, but not completely\u2014soil and nutrients remain.\nSecondary succession can thus be defined as the development of biotic communities in sequential order following the whole or partial demise of the prior community.\nFollowing a forest fire, for example, that eliminates all of the mature trees on certain terrain, grasses may grow, followed by shrubs and a variety of tree species, until the pre-fire community recovers.\nAutogenic and Allogenic Succession\nAutogenic succession refers to ecological succession that is driven by biotic factors or living organisms in that specific community.\nIn contrast, allogenic succession is an ecological succession that is impacted by abiotic or external community forces.\nAdditionally, biotic variables such as vegetation and organic matter accumulated in the soil influence the ecological community in autogenic succession, whereas exogenous phenomena such as volcanoes, flooding, forest fires, and global warming influence the ecological community in allogenic succession.\nSecondary succession starts with autogenic succession and advances to autogenic succession, whereas primary succession starts with allogenic succession and then progresses to autogenic succession.\nAutotrophic and Heterotrophic Succession\nThe term autotrophic succession refers to succession in which green plants predominate at first.\nHeterotrophic succession, on the other hand, refers to succession in which heterotrophs are abundant.\nThe succession would be faster in the area that lies in the middle of the large continent.\nThis is due to the fact that all pollen grains or seeds of plants from diverse seres would arrive faster, settle, and finally result in a climax community.\nImportance of Ecological Succession\nDespite popular belief that succession is an out-of-date topic, new investigations and reviews reveal that it continues to play a significant role in modern ecological theory and practice.\nEcological succession is essential for the growth and development of an ecosystem.\nIt promotes the colonisation of new areas as well as the recolonization of areas damaged by biotic and environmental factors.\nAs a result, organisms can learn to adapt to changing environments and exist in them.\nHomeostasis in Ecosystem\n\nEcosystems are capable of remaining in a state of balance. They can manipulate the structure and functional processes of their own species. Homeostasis refers to the ecosystem\u2019s ability to self-regulate. An ecosystem\u2019s sustainability is dependent on equilibrium balance. Hence, environmental homeostasis refers to the equilibrium of species in an ecosystem.\n\nConcept of Homeostasis in Ecosystem\nEquilibrium is critical for ecosystem homeostasis. Something is in equilibrium when it is balanced.\nThey can manipulate the structure and function of their own species. The ability of an ecosystem to self-regulate is referred to as homeostasis.\nWhen an organism strives to maintain a consistent internal (body) environment that permits all biochemical reactions and physiological activities to run as effectively as possible, therefore boosting the species\u2019 overall fitness. This procedure is known as homeostasis.\nThis consistency could be expressed in terms of ideal temperature or osmotic concentration of body fluids.\nRegardless of changing external environmental variables that disrupt the organism\u2019s homeostasis, the organism should strive to maintain a stable internal (within the body) environment (a process termed homeostasis).\nHence, homeostasis refers to an ecological system\u2019s ability to sustain stable system properties in the face of disruptions.\n\nMethods to have homeostasis include regulation, conform, migration and suspension.\n\nAlso read: Ecosystem- In layman\u2019s Language\n\nRegulate\nCertain species can maintain homeostasis through physiological (or behavioural \u2013 migrating to tree shade) techniques that assure constant body temperature, constant osmotic concentration, and so on.\nAll birds and mammals, as well as a few lower vertebrate and invertebrate taxa, are capable of this regulation (thermoregulation and osmoregulation).\nMammals\u2019 \u201csuccess\u2019 stems partly from their capacity to maintain consistent body temperature and thrive whether in Antarctica or the Sahara Desert.\nPlants, on the other hand, lack such internal temperature-control mechanisms.\nConform\nThe vast majority of animals and nearly all plants are unable to sustain a stable interior environment. Their body temperature varies with the temperature outside.\nThe osmotic concentration of bodily fluids in aquatic animals varies with the osmotic concentration of ambient water. These creatures and plants are nothing more than conformists.\nMigrate\nThe creature can temporarily relocate to a less stressful environment and then return after the stressful phase is ended.\nEvery winter, thousands of migratory birds from Siberia and other extremely cold northern regions visit Rajasthan\u2019s famous Keoladeo National Park (Bharatpur).\nSuspend\nSeveral types of thick-walled spores are generated in bacteria, fungi, and lower plants to assist them survive adverse conditions; they germinate when a suitable environment is available.\nSeeds and other vegetative reproductive structures in higher plants serve as a means of surviving stressful periods as well as aiding in spreading.\nIf an organism is unable to move, it may prevent stress by fleeing in time. The well-known example of bears hibernating throughout the winter is an example of a timely escape.\nSome snails and fish enter aestivation to avoid the summer\u2019s issues of heat and desiccation.\nSeveral zooplankton species in lakes and ponds are known to enter diapause, a stage of suspended development, under adverse conditions.\nExamples of Homeostasis\n\nThere are a lot of examples of Homeostasis in the environment.\n\nHIBERNATION\nHibernation is a voluntary state that an animal enters in order to conserve energy and minimise exposure to the elements during the winter months when food is limited.\nHibernation causes an animal\u2019s body temperature, respiration, heart rate, and metabolic rate to decrease (the rate at which its body uses energy).\nHibernation in grizzly bears is a great illustration of homeostasis.\nBears hibernate during the winter in most regions of the world.\nHence, bears\u2019 hibernation habit is an example of homeostasis.\nOSMOREGULATION\nOsmoregulation is another example of homeostasis. Osmosis is the net flow of water molecules from a high-concentration area to a low-concentration area.\nTo maintain water balance, salmon (a species of fish) regulates osmosis.\nSalmon live their full lives in both freshwater and saltwater.\nThey are born in freshwater but spend most of their life in salt water. When they go from fresh to saline water, the water balance in their bodies changes.\nAs a result, osmoregulation in salmon is an example of homeostasis.\nTHERMOREGULATION\nThermoregulation is an outstanding illustration of human body homeostasis.\nIt refers to the regulation of the body\u2019s homeostatic temperature.\nThe human body has a tendency to maintain the set point, also known as the internal temperature, which is approximately 98.6 degrees Fahrenheit (98.6 F, equivalent to 37 degrees Celsius).\nIts core temperature is regulated by the neurological system, specifically the anterior hypothalamus and the preoptic section of the brain.\nWhen the ambient temperature is lower than the skin temperature, heat loss occurs.\nThis means that in colder circumstances (such as winter), the body loses heat mostly through the hands and feet.\nAs a result, the core temperature drops.\n\nAlso Read: Environmental Laws in India \u2013 ClearIAS\n\nRegulation of Homeostasis\n\nHomeostasis is maintained by three mechanisms:\n\nEffector: The effector is a mechanism that responds to control centre commands. It has the potential to either neutralise or intensify the stimulation.\nReceptor: As the name implies, a receptor is a sensory component that monitors and responds to changes in the external or internal environment.\nControl centre: The entire process is always attempting to maintain homeostasis.\nConclusion\n\nAs people have had a greater impact on the global environment than ever before, the concept of ecological succession is being studied from new angles. When more refinements to the initial concept were incorporated, new insights that are beneficial to humans involved with natural resource management emerged.\n\nHomeostasis is a defining feature of existence. Homeostasis is the term used to describe resistance to change. Hence, homeostasis helps organisms maintain stable internal and external environments in which they can function optimally. Above all, they regulate the internal factors required to support life.\n\nFunctions of ecosystem include maintaining a balance of ecosystem-making interactions between species and their surroundings. Even tiny changes in an ecosystem, such as the extinction or introduction of a single species, can have a large impact on the functions of the ecosystem.\n\nThese ecosystem disturbances can be induced by both natural changes and human intervention. Pollution, whether on land, in the water, or in the air, is a severe threat to ecosystems. Pollution can threaten or kill ecosystem-critical animals, generating an imbalance in the ecosystem.\n\nArticle Written By: Atheena Fathima Riyas\u00a0"

This process involves the release of nutrients and chemical energy in the form of heat, which can be utilized as food. The energy flow (transfer of organic molecules) in the ecosystem is unidirectional and is non-cyclic (is not available again for reuse).\n\nTrophic Levels\n\nThere are 4 Trophic Levels in energy flow.\n\nTrophic Level 1 belongs to Primary Producers or Autotrophs\nTrophic Level 2 belongs to Herbivores\nTrophic Level 3 belongs to Carnivorous\nTrophic Level 4 belongs to Omnivores\n\nGreen plants, also known as primary producers or autotrophs, capture radiant solar energy or sunlight to create food in the form of organic matter through the process of photosynthesis. This conversion of solar energy into chemical energy enables autotrophic or phototrophic green plants to develop their tissues, and the stored energy is held within the primary producers at the base of the trophic levels.\n\nThe chemical energy stored at trophic level 1 becomes the source of energy either directly or indirectly to all of the animals at different trophic levels in a food chain in a natural ecosystem. As energy moves from trophic level 1, a portion of it is lost due to respiration, while the remaining chemical energy is transferred to herbivores, which belong to trophic level 2.\n\nSome portion of plants falls without being consumed by herbivores of trophic level 2 on the ground surface and is ultimately consumed by detrivores or decomposers and thus some energy is also transferred from trophic level 1 to the decomposers living in the soils.\n\nIt may be pointed out that the transfer of energy from trophic level 1 (green plants, primary producers, or autotrophs) is performed through the intake of organic tissues (which contain potential chemical energy) of green plants by the herbivorous animals (when a cow grazes grasses, the chemical energy stored in grasses is transferred to the cow).\n\nThus the chemical energy consumed by herbivorous animals (derived from trophic level 1 through food intake) helps in the building of their tissues at trophic level 2 and thus the energy is stored in them. This stored energy in the bodies of herbivores now becomes the source of energy for carnivorous animals (secondary consumers) at trophic level 3.\n\nA substantial portion of chemical energy is lost through respiration from herbivores at trophic level 2 because the animals have to consume energy for their movement to get food from green plants. To perform work, energy is necessary, and when work is done, energy is released in a dissipated form. This occurs when one type of energy is converted into another form, which is governed by the second law of thermodynamics.\n\nAt trophic level 3, carnivorous animals receive a portion of potential chemical energy through the consumption of herbivores. Meanwhile, some energy is lost by herbivores through waste products, such as dung and urine, which are decomposed by detrivores or decomposers. When herbivores die, decomposers break down their remains, allowing for the release of the remaining stored energy.\n\nA substantial portion of potential chemical energy stored in the bodies of carnivores is lost through respiration from trophic level 3 because the carnivorous animals have to run for greater distances to catch their prey. A portion of chemical energy is transferred to trophic level 4 or trophic level represented by omnivores (those animals that eat both plants and animals, man is the most important example of omnivores). The animals at trophic level 4. mainly humans also take energy from trophic levels 1 and 2. Again some portion of the energy is released through respiration from trophic level 4 by omnivores. The omnivores, after their death, are decomposed by the decomposers.\n\nAlso read: Bioremediation\n\nSummary\n\nThus it is obvious from the above discussion that there are three ways. pathways of the flow of energy in the natural ecosystem as follows:\n\nTransfer of chemical energy from each trophic level to the next higher trophic level (i.e. from trophic level 1 to 2, from 2 to 3, and from 3 to 4) and direct transfer of chemical energy from trophic levels 1 and 2 to trophic level 4 (top trophic level);\nTransfer of chemical energy from dead organisms of each trophic level to decomposers, and\nLoss of energy in the form of heat through respiration from each trophic level and decomposers. All of the heat energy released by organisms through respiration is lost to the atmosphere and cannot be reused by those organisms. As a result, energy flow in the ecosystem is unidirectional and non-cyclic.\n\nAlso read: Functions of Ecosystem: Ecological Succession and Homeostasis\n\nFirst Law of Thermodynamics\n\nThe first law of thermodynamics states that energy cannot be created or destroyed in a constant mass system, but it can be converted from one type to another and that the energy inflow or input in a system is equal to the energy outflow or output. This principle applies to the energy flow in the ecosystem as described earlier, where solar radiation is converted by autotrophic green plants through photosynthesis into chemical energy or food energy.\n\nLindeman Theory\n\nThe chemical energy is released as heat energy through respiration by the organisms at different trophic levels R.L. Lindeman (1942) has formulated the following five principles regarding the relationships between different trophic levels and energy flow in a natural ecosystem.\n\nPrinciple I: As the distance between the organisms of a given trophic level and the initial source of energy (trophic level 1) increases, the probability of the organisms depending exclusively on the preceding trophic level for energy decreases. In other words, the organisms at trophic levels 3 and 4 do not depend for their energy only on trophic levels 2 and 3 respectively rather they receive energy from more than one source (trophic level) which means that organisms at trophic level 3 and beyond tend to be \u2018generalists\u2019 rather than \u2018specialists\u2019 in terms of their feeding habit.\n\nPrinciple II: The relative loss of energy due to respiration is progressively greater from higher trophic levels because the species at higher trophic levels being relatively larger have to move and work more to get food and therefore more energy is lost due to respiration.\n\nPrinciple III: Species at progressively higher trophic levels appear to be progressively more efficient in using their available food supply because increased activity by predators increases their chances of encountering suitable prey species, and in general predators are less specific than their prey in food preferences.\n\nPrinciple IV: \u2018Higher trophic levels tend to be less discrete than the lower ones\u2019 because the organisms at progressively higher trophic levels receive energy from more than one source (trophic level) and are generalists\u2019 in their feeding habit and they are more efficient in using their available food supply.\n\nPrinciple V: \u2018Food chains tend to be reasonably short. Four vertical links are a Common maximum\u2019 because the loss of energy is progressively higher for higher trophic levels and species at higher levels tend to be less discrete.\n\nAlso read: Environmental Flows Monitoring System\n\nArticle Written By: Priti Raj"

Pollutant volatilization and discharge into the environment are also reduced.\nBioventing was one of the first large-scale technologies to be developed in the 1990s, and it is now widely used in commercial applications.\nBioventing can be performed actively or passively.\nIn passive bioventing, gas exchange from vent wells is merely affected by atmospheric pressure, whereas in active bioventing, the air is forced into the ground by a blower, sometimes in conjunction with vacuum extraction of the gas.\nBIOSPARGING\nThe method of injecting pressurised air or gas into a contaminated area to increase in-situ aerobic biological activity is known as biosparging.\nThis approach targets chemical substances that can be biodegraded under aerobic circumstances, such as mineral oils and benzene, toluene, ethylbenzene, xylene, and naphthalene (BTEXN), and is used to remediate soluble and residual pollutants in the saturation zone.\nThe injection of air (and gaseous nutrients if needed) encourages the development of the aerobic microbial population and so increases the bioavailability of contaminants by providing oxygen to the microorganisms and enhancing the interactions between air, water, and the aquifer.\nA sparging system aims to promote pollutant biodegradation while reducing volatile and semi-volatile organic compound volatilization.\nThe flow rate of air injection is set to provide the amount of oxygen required to promote bacterial contamination degradation.\nHowever, depending on the operation mode and design chosen, some volatilization may occur, needing air capture and treatment.\nBIOAUGMENTATION\nIt entails investigating local indigenous varieties to determine whether biostimulation is feasible.\nBioaugmentation refers to adding more archaea or bacterial cultures to increase pollutant breakdown, whereas biostimulation refers to providing nutritional supplements to increase bacterial metabolism.\nIf the indigenous bacteria detected in the area are capable of metabolizing the pollutants, more indigenous bacterial cultures will be introduced into the area to hasten the breakdown of the contaminants.\nIf the indigenous species lack the metabolic ability to heal itself, exogenous microorganisms with such sophisticated pathways are introduced.\nIndustrial wastes that contain inhibiting or harmful constituents that can be addressed using bioaugmentation products include acetone, acrylic acid, ammonia, nitrite, furfural, phenolic compounds, and methyl ethylamine.\n\nAlso read: Ecosystem- In layman\u2019s Language\n\nEx-situ Bioremediation Techniques\n\nEx-situ bioremediation is a biological approach in which excavated soil is placed in a lined above-ground treatment area and then aerated to assist the indigenous microbial population in degrading organic contaminants.\n\nUnder aerobic conditions, organic pollutants such as petroleum hydrocarbon mixtures, polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAH), phenols, cresols, and some pesticides can be used as a source of carbon and energy by specific microbes and then degraded to carbon dioxide and water.\nAlthough adding microbial communities is uncommon, it is usual to need to assess nutrient requirements and supplement the soil\u2019s basic nutrients and organic substrate if any of these elements are insufficient or lacking.\nOxygen (via the introduction of air) is essential to allow the microbial population to form cultures capable of sustaining degradation.\n\nEx-situ, bioremediation techniques include Landfarming, Biopiles, Bioreactors, Composting\n\nLANDFARMING\nLand farming is the most fundamental kind of bioremediation.\nBefore being tilled into the ground, contaminated soils are combined with soil additives such as bulking agents and fertilisers.\nInland farming, they are excavated and spread them in layers of around 0.3m thickness on a lined treatment area.\nBioremediation can be aided by regular bed flipping and the addition of nutrients.\nContaminants are degraded, converted, and immobilized by microbiological and oxidative processes.\nControlling soil conditions optimizes the rate of pollutant breakdown.\nMoisture content, aeration frequency, and pH are all modifiable variables.\nLandfarming techniques require huge areas and are often not feasible for small sites due to the restricting thickness of soil layers (0.3m), yet they can be the most cost-effective type of bioremediation.\nBIOPILES\nA Biopile is a sort of ex-situ treatment that employs biological processes to convert pollutants into non-hazardous byproducts.\nIt is frequently used to reduce petroleum component concentrations in soils through the bioremediation process. Biopiles are a form of remediation technology that is only employed for a limited duration.\nExcavated soil or silt is placed over an impermeable base or pad with aeration to increase and manage the rate of biodegradation.\nPads are frequently provided with a cover and adequate drainage to manage precipitation exposure, as well as probes to measure temperature, moisture content, and pollutant concentrations.\nOptional equipment may include a moisture addition system, leachate collection system, and off-gas treatment, depending on the site\u2019s attributes and regulatory needs.\n\nAlso Read: E-Waste: Causes, Concerns and Management \u2013 ClearIAS\n\nBIOREACTORS\nA bioreactor is any piece of manufactured equipment or system that supports a biologically active environment.\nThe bioreactor method is a biochemical processing system that uses microbes to remove toxins from wastewater or pumped groundwater, as well as the solid and liquid (slurry) stages of contaminated soil remediation.\nThis process could be aerobic or anaerobic.\nThese bioreactors are commonly cylindrical in design, with diameters ranging from liters to cubic meters, and are made of stainless steel.\nSlurry bioreactors are one of the most sophisticated bioremediation systems on the market, as well as one of the most successful ex-situ options for treating polluted soils with resistant pollutants in a controlled environment.\nA slurry bioreactor\u2019s proper operation is based on the presence of balanced suspension, aeration, and mixing conditions.\nCOMPOSTING\nCompost bioremediation is the use of a biological system of microorganisms in a mature, cured compost to adsorb or break down contaminants in water or soil.\nThe two most common composting processes are aerated static pile composting (compost is shaped into heaps and aerated with blowers or vacuum pumps) and windrow composting (compost is dumped in long piles (windrows) and occasionally stirred with mobility equipment).\nWindrow composting is frequently regarded to be the most cost-effective technique of composting, however, it may also produce the most fugitive emissions.\nCompost is referred to as \u201ctailored\u201d or \u201cdesigned\u201d compost in bioremediation since it is made precisely to treat specific pollutants at specific places.\nExcavated contaminated soil is mixed with bulking agents and organic additions such as wood chips, hay, manure, and vegetable (e.g., potato) wastes.\nCompost bioremediation has successfully decomposed or altered several types of contaminants, including chlorinated and non-chlorinated hydrocarbons, wood-preserving chemicals, solvents, heavy metals, pesticides, petroleum products, and explosives.\nThe ultimate goal of any remediation operation is to return the land to its pre-contamination state, which often includes revegetation to sustain the treated soil.\nCompost helps to achieve this goal by boosting plant development while also lowering pollution levels.\nCompost is both a soil conditioner and a source of nutrients for a wide variety of plants.\n\nAlso read: Functions of Ecosystem: Ecological succession and Homeostasis\n\nPhytoremediation\nLive plants are employed in phytoremediation technologies to clean up contaminated soil, air, and water.\nIt is defined as \u201cthe use of green plants and associated bacteria, as well as appropriate soil amendments and agronomic approaches, to either contain, eliminate, or render harmless dangerous environmental chemicals.\u201d\nSeveral plants, such as mustard, alpine pennycress, hemp, and pigweed, have been shown to hyper-accumulate toxins at toxic waste sites.\nPhytoremediation has been effectively utilized to restore abandoned metal mine workings, sites where polychlorinated biphenyls were deposited during production, and mitigation of ongoing coal mine discharges, reducing pollutants in soils, water, and air.\nPhytoremediation efforts around the world have reduced metals, pesticides, solvents, explosives, and crude oil and its derivatives.\n\nAlso Read: Plastic Waste Management: Rules and Regulations \u2013 ClearIAS\n\nBenefits of Bioremediation\nThe most notable advantage of using bioremediation technology is the favorable environmental impact. In bioremediation, nature is used to repair nature.\nWhen performed properly by competent employees using specialized bioremediation equipment, this is the safest and least invasive soil and groundwater treatment.\nBioremediation can treat organic pathogens, arsenic, fluoride, nitrate, volatile organic compounds, metals, and a number of other pollutants like ammonia and phosphates.\n\u00a0It effectively removes pesticides and herbicides from aquifers, as well as seawater intrusion.\nThere is no transportation risk: The majority of work is done on-site, reducing transportation concerns.\nOther than a few particular parts, very little equipment is necessary.\nMaintenance and input expenses are both minimal.\nBecause poisons are less likely to escape, liability is minimized.\nCompared to incineration and landfilling, there is very little energy consumed.\nDisadvantages of Bioremediation\nThe main limitation of the bioremediation technique is that it can only treat biodegradable pollutants.\nResearchers have also discovered that the new product formed as a result of biodegradation is sometimes more damaging to the environment than the original component.\nFinally, the technique takes time, especially ex-situ bioremediation, which requires excavation and pumping.\nConclusion\n\nBioremediation is increasingly commonly used as a treatment for pharmaceutical pollution. However, the key barriers to converting lab-scale research to the field are a lack of understanding of microbial processes in the contaminated niche, pollutant bioavailability, non-native species survival, and a lack of an integrated multi-disciplinary approach.\n\nArticle Written By: Atheena Fathima Riyas"

This can lead to consumer deception and potential health risks.\nOverexploitation: According to the World Bank, nearly 90% of all marine fish populations are currently overfished or completely exploited, which is a problem due to overfishing, illegal fishing, and other unsustainable methods of producing aquatic food.\nAcceptance of Blue Food: The popularity of sea cucumbers and related varieties is still very low. It requires a shift in eating behaviours.\nTechnology and Capital Intensive sector: One of the major challenges with blue food is the need for high-end technology and capital.\nLack of skilled labour and resources: It needs rarely skilled labour.\nLack of proper cuisine and dishes: More R&D activities are required by chefs and scientists to make dishes loved by the masses.\nThe danger of invasive species: There may be a threat of invasive species in case of imports for culturing in a country.\nBlue Food Schemes\n\nSome of the important schemes related to Blue food are,\n\nDraft Blue Economy Policy:\n\nThe draught Blue Economy policy has been released by the Ministry of Earth Sciences (MoES), which is seeking comments and suggestions from different stakeholders.

This assists in forecasting how wildlife will respond to current and future environmental changes. It was designed to ensure their survival because global warming, farming, population increase, pollution, and hunting pose significant threats to them.\n\nAlso read: Elephant Reserves in India\u00a0\n\nVarious Wildlife Conservation Projects\n\nThe government of India has initiated many wildlife conservation projects like Project Snow Leopard, Project Tiger, Indian Rhino Vision 2020, Project Hangul, Crocodile Conservation Initiative, etc.\n\nProject Snow Leopard\n\nSnow Leopards can be found in the Himalayan region as well as in states such as Jammu & Kashmir, Uttarakhand, Arunachal Pradesh, Sikkim, and Himachal Pradesh. The species is listed in CITES and CMS, indicating that they have the greatest conservation status both nationally and internationally.\n\nEvery year on October 23rd, International Snow Leopard Day is observed. The Indian government issued the \u201cFirst National Protocol on Snow Leopard Population Assessment\u201d in 2019. This entails using technology such as camera traps and scientific surveys.\n\nCONSERVATION STATUS\nThe IUCN-World Conservation Union\u2019s Red List of Endangered Species classifies the snow leopard as Vulnerable.\nIt is also included in Appendix I of the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species (CITES).\nThe Indian Wildlife (Protection) Act of 1972 includes it in Schedule I.\nIt is also included in the Convention on Migratory Species (CMS), giving the species the highest conservation status both globally and in India.\n\nThis program was created as part of the Global Snow Leopard and Ecosystem Protection Program\u2019s global protocol. This programme is a collaboration of 12 snow leopard range countries: India, Pakistan, Nepal, Russia, China, Bhutan, Afghanistan, Tajikistan, Uzbekistan, Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, and Mongolia. Several countries collaborated in the Population Assessment of the World\u2019s Snow Leopard (PAWS).\n\nThe Protected Areas include:\n\nThe Sacred Himalayan Landscape\nKibber Wildlife Sanctuary\nGreat Himalayan National Park\nHemis National Park\nDibang Wildlife Sanctuary\nPin Valley National Park\nProject Tiger\n\nThe population of Indian Tigers was rapidly dropping at the end of the twentieth century. As a result, a nationwide Tiger Census was conducted in 1972 to estimate the tiger population.\n\nLarge-scale development operations like as dams, mines, railway projects, and the construction of enterprises resulted in deforestation and increased habitat loss. Tigers were slaughtered in large numbers because their body parts are employed in traditional Chinese medicine. All of these factors combined to cause a drop in the tiger population.\n\nProject Tiger was established in the Palamau Tiger Reserve, Jim Corbett National Park, Uttarakhand, in 1973. This is a Ministry of Environment and Forests-sponsored initiative. It is primarily governed by the Wildlife Act of 1972. The National Tiger Conservation Authority, which was founded in December 2005, oversees the project.\n\nThe project\u2019s goal is to save tigers from extinction by ensuring that the animal has a viable population in its native habitat. The Project began with nine reserves in 1973-74 and has now expanded to fifty reserves. The Initiative has had tremendous success in restoring the habitat and population of tigers in the protected regions.\n\nCONSERVATION STATUS OF TIGER\nIndian Wildlife (Protection) Act, 1972: Schedule I\nInternational Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) Red List: Endangered.\nConvention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora (CITES): Appendix I.\nTIGER TASK FORCE\n\nIt is critical that a legislative authority with sufficient legal backing be established for proper Project implementation. The National Board for Wildlife suggested the formation of a Task Force to investigate problems encountered during the execution of tiger conservation projects across the country. The Tiger Task Force was formed as a result of this. The TTF proposed the formation of the National Tiger Conservation Authority (NTCA).\n\nProject Elephant\n\nProject Elephant is a federally funded program that began in 1992. Elephants are threatened with attrition rather than extinction like Tigers are. The project intends to help with elephant management and protection in states with free-roaming wild elephant populations.\n\nThe Elephants\u2019 Protection Act of 1879 was also drafted to safeguard elephants throughout the country. Although India has approximately 27,000 elephants dispersed over 26 elephant reserves, only 65% of the elephant corridors are protected.\n\nThe protection of elephants is particularly crucial because it has been classified as a national heritage of the country.\n\nThe Government of India did this in 2010, following the recommendations of the Standing Committee on the National Board of Wildlife. This step was done to raise awareness about the elephant\u2019s diminishing number so that people would actively engage in its protection.\n\nPROTECTION STATUS OF ASIAN ELEPHANT\nIUCN Red List: Endangered.\nWildlife (Protection) Act, 1972: Schedule I.\nCITES Appendix I\n\nThe project\u2019s goals are as follows:\n\nPreservation of elephants, elephant corridors, and their habitats; prevention of man-animal conflicts; and protection of domesticated elephants.\nThis initiative is critical because it protects elephants from poachers and hunters, hence reducing illegal ivory trade.\nELEPHANT CORRIDORS\nElephant Corridors are short swaths of forested terrain that serve as a link between bigger elephant habitats. This conduit is critical for elephant migration and increasing the species\u2019 survival rate in the wild.\nThe corridors are divided into two categories: high ecological priority and medium ecological priority.\nThe classification is based on the frequency with which elephants move, the size of the population, the area of habitats connected, and the presence of other routes nearby. The corridors are also rated for conservation feasibility.\nIndian Rhino Vision 2020\nIndian Rhino Vision 2020, which was launched in 2005, was an ambitious initiative to achieve a wild population of at least 3,000 larger one-horned rhinos scattered throughout seven protected areas in the Indian state of Assam by the year 2020.\nKaziranga, Pobitora, Orang National Park, Manas National Park, Laokhowa Wildlife Sanctuary, Burachapori Wildlife Sanctuary, and Dibru Saikhowa Wildlife Sanctuary are the seven protected places.\nWild-to-wild translocations were a crucial aspect of IRV2020 \u2013 relocating rhinos from densely inhabited parks like Kaziranga NP to ones in need of more rhinos, like Manas NP.\nThe International Rhino Foundation, Assam\u2019s Forest Department, the Bodoland Territorial Council, World Wide Fund \u2013 India, and the US Fish and Wildlife Service are among the organisations involved.\nAsia has three rhino species: Greater one-horned (Rhinoceros unicornis), Javan, and Sumatran.\nPoaching for rhino horns and habitat destruction are the two most serious risks to Asia\u2019s rhinos\u2019 survival.\nThe five rhino range countries (India, Bhutan, Nepal, Indonesia, and Malaysia) have signed the \u2018New Delhi Declaration on Asian Rhinos 2019\u2019 for species conservation and protection.\nPROTECTION STATUS OF RHINO\nAccording to the IUCN Red List, the Javan and Sumatran rhinos are severely endangered, while the Greater one-horned (or Indian) rhino is vulnerable.\nAll three are listed in Appendix I (CITES).\nThe Larger One-Horned Rhinoceros is protected in Schedule I of the Wildlife Protection Act of 1972.\n\nRead: Rhinoceros: Global conservation efforts\n\nProject Hangul\n\nThe Jammu and Kashmir governments, in collaboration with the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) and World Wildlife Fund (WWF), developed a program in the 1970s to protect and conserve the Kashmir Red Stag and its habitat. This initiative was dubbed Project Hangul.\n\nThe Hangul, also known as the Kashmir Red Stag, is a subspecies of the Central Asian Red Deer that is native to northern India. It is typically found in the deep riverine forests of Kashmir Valley, Himachal Pradesh, Sindh Valley, Dachigam National Park, and the Kishtwar forests.\n\nThe effort began after Hanguls were added to the IUCN\u2019s list of severely endangered species. The species is spread across 141 square kilometers of Dachigam National Park.\nIt has been considered one of the most endangered mammal species in the Indian subcontinent since the 1950s.\nThe Hangul has been designated as a protected species under Schedule I of the Wildlife (Protection) Act of 1972.\n\u00a0The project\u2019s goal was to build enclosures for the species\u2019 artificial breeding.\nCrocodile Conservation Initiative\n\nCrocodilians were threatened in India because of an increase in indiscriminate kills. They were poached for commercial interests, causing their population to plummet dramatically. Aside from that, there has been a loss of habitat due to increased development and industrialization.\n\nIn response to this scenario, Project Crocodile was launched in 1975. The primary emphasis was on captive breeding and rearing. The initiative was launched by the Indian government in collaboration with the Food and Agricultural Organization and the United Nations Development Fund. Crocodile populations have increased as a result of the project\u2019s implementation, saving them from extinction. National Chambal Sanctuary and Katerniaghat are two of the protected sites.\n\nCrocodiles are classified into three types:\n\nGHARIAL OR GAVIALIS GANGETICUS\nIUCN Red List- Critically Endangered\nCITES- Appendix I\nWildlife Protection Act, 1972 Schedule I\nMUGGER OR CROCODYLUS PALUSTRIS\nIUCN Red List- Vulnerable\nCITES- Appendix I\nWildlife Protection Act, 1972 Schedule I\nSALTWATER CROCODILE OR CROCODYLUS POROSUS\nIUCN Red List- Least Concern\nCITES -Appendix I\nWildlife Protection Act, 1972 Schedule I\n\nThe technique selected for the rehabilitation of these species was to offer them protection in their original habitats. Captive rearing was used, and the animals were eventually freed. The \u2018grow and release\u2019 and rear and release\u2019 strategies were used.\n\nThis initiative aims to safeguard the species\u2019 remnant population, promote research that will aid in better management, promote habitat reconstruction, and stimulate local public participation.\n\nThe project spared the species from extinction, as it was designated as critically endangered on the IUCN Red List. It has also aided in the establishment of wetland sanctuaries, which has resulted in the active management of other species.\n\nAlso read: Wildlife Sanctuaries in India\n\nThe Manipur Brow-antlered Deer Project\n\nThis was started in Manipur in 1981 to conserve the brow-antlered deer (Cerevus eldi eldi), which is on the verge of extinction.\n\nThe ecosystem consists of 35 square kilometres of park and sanctuary. The deer population has expanded from 18 to 27.\nThe brow-antlered deer, or sangria, is the state animal of Manipur.\nThe animal\u2019s coat is a dark reddish brown in the winter and a much lighter tint in the summer.\nThese animals, which are native to Cambodia, China, India, Laos, and Myanmar, were previously widely distributed over ecosystems in south and southeast Asia.\nDepending on the country, deer habitat can range from shrubland and grassland to dry forests and wetlands.These animals can only be found in Manipur\u2019s renowned Loktak Lake.\nWhile habitat degradation has been a major worry in the conservation of this deer worldwide, hunting poses an additional challenge in Manipur.\nPROTECTION STATUS OF MANIPUR BROW-ANTLERED DEER\nEndangered according to the IUCN Red List.\nWPA 1972: Schedule-I\nCITES Appendix I\nProject Himalayan Musk Deer\n\nThis was started in 1981 to conserve the endangered musk deer, which is on the verge of extinction. Captive breeding has shown positive effects.\n\nThe musk deer, which was previously abundant throughout the Himalayas, has been persecuted by man for its musk used in the manufacture of perfumes and medicine. This, combined with habitat degradation, resulted in a significant drop in its population. With the collaboration of the Government of India, a conservation project was initiated at the Kedarnath sanctuary in Uttar Pradesh (now Uttarakhand) under the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) and Natural Resources\u2019 Endangered Deer Programme.\n\nPROTECTION STATUS OF MUSK DEER\nIt is under lower risk (near threatened) status of the IUCN Red List of threatened species\nAppendix I of Convention on International Trade of Endangered flora and fauna (CITES)\nProtected species of National Parks and Wildlife Conservation Act, 1973, Nepal (HMG/Nepal 2002).\nLesser Cats Project\n\nThe project was initiated in 1976 with the aid of WWF in India for the protection of four species of smaller cats found in Sikkim and the northern portion of West Bengal, namely, Felis bengalensis Kerr, Felis marmorta Martin, Felis lemruinki Vigors Horsfield, and Felis viverrine Bennet.\n\nThe Gir Lion Sanctuary Project\n\nThe Asiatic lion, which previously roamed the northern and central Indian subcontinents, is now confined to Gujarat\u2019s Gir forest. This last remaining habitat of the species sustains roughly two hundred Asiatic lions which were under great threat due to over-grazing by domestic livestock, depletion of prey species, etc. The Gujarat State Government created a management system for the Gir lion sanctuary in 1972, complete with conservation rules. The Central Government gives help for habitat protection and enhancement.\n\nPROTECTION STATUS OF ASIATIC LION\nIUCN Red List: Endangered\nCITES: Appendix I\nWildlife (Protection) Act 1972: Schedule I\nSea Turtle Project\n\nEvery winter, a major fraction of the world\u2019s Olive Ridley Turtle population migrates to Indian coastal waters to breed, primarily along the eastern coast.\n\nWith the goal of conserving olive ridley turtles and other endangered sea turtles, the MoEF launched the Sea Turtle Conservation Project in 1999 in conjunction with UNDP, with the Wildlife Institute of India, Dehradun serving as the implementing agency.\n\nThe project is being carried out across ten coastal states of the country, with a particular emphasis on the state of Orissa.\nThe project assisted in the creation of an inventory map of sea turtle breeding locations, the identification of nesting and breeding habitats along the beach line, and the formulation of guidelines to protect and minimize turtle mortality.\n\nOne of the significant accomplishments has been the demonstration of the use of Satellite Telemetry to locate the migratory route of Olive Ridley Turtles in the sea, as well as sensitizing fishermen and the State Government to the use of Turtle Exclusion Devices (TED) in fishing trawlers to reduce turtle mortality in fishing nets.\n\nOLIVE RIDLEY SEA TURTLE STATUS\n\nOlive ridley turtles are the smallest and most numerous sea turtles on the planet. The name of these carnivorous turtles comes from their olive-colored carapace.\n\nProtection Status Wildlife Protection Act of 1972 Schedule I\nIUCN Red List -Vulnerable\nCITES Appendix I\nGanges Dolphin\n\nThe Ganges River Dolphin has been designated as the National Aquatic Animal by the Ministry of Environment and Forests.\nThe Ganges-Brahmaputra-Meghna and Karnaphuli-Sangu river systems of Nepal, India, and Bangladesh are home to the River Dolphin.\n\nThe Ganges Dolphin is one of the world\u2019s four \u201cobligate\u201d freshwater dolphins, the others being the \u2018baiji\u2019 of the Yangtze River (China), the \u2018bhulan\u2019 of the Indus (Pakistan), and the \u2018boto\u2019 of the Amazon River (Latin America).\nAlthough most marine dolphin species have ranges that include some freshwater habitats, these four species only reside in rivers and lakes.\n\nCONSERVATION STATUS\nIndian Wildlife (Protection), Act 1972: Schedule I.\nInternational Union for the Conservation of Nature (IUCN): Endangered.\nConvention on International Trade in Endangered Species (CITES): Appendix I (most endangered).\nConvention on Migratory Species (CMS): Appendix II (migratory species that need conservation and management or would significantly benefit from international cooperation).\n\nThe Ganges River Dolphin is threatened in India by river water pollution and siltation, unintentional entanglement in fishing nets, and oil poaching.

All naturally occurring living and non-living things are included in the work environment.\nThe word primarily refers to how the components of the earth interact with its resources, weather, organisms, and climate to influence economic and human activity. All of the microorganisms, vegetation, atmosphere, soil and other natural occurrences make up its ecological system.\nEcology is the study of how a creature interacts with its physical and chemical environment. The functional and structural unit of the ecosystem is represented by ecology. It is made up of a group of biotic organisms and several abiotic elements that engage with one another throughout their energy cycle.\nAccording to Odum, the founder of contemporary ecology, ecology is the study of ecosystem form and function. The word ecology was first used by Reiter, and it was created by Ernst Haeckel.\nThe terms \u2018Oikos\u2019, which means \u2018home,\u2019 and \u2018logos,\u2019 which means study,\u2019 are the origin of the word \u2018ecology. The area of biology known as ecology is concerned with how organisms interact with one another, their physical surroundings, and the movement of energy and minerals.\nTerminologies Related to Environment and Ecology\n\nEcosystems serve as the structural and functional building blocks of ecology. It is a colony of living entities that engage in interactions with abiotic components through energy and nutrition cycles.\n\nThe natural setting in which biotic (living) and abiotic (non-living) elements interact with one another is called the environment. An organism\u2019s habitat and ecosystem are shaped by these exchanges.\n\nAbiotic Factors:\nAbiotic factors or components are non-living organisms that comprise the ecology\u2019s physical parts. Non-living and inorganic components of an ecosystem constitute the abiotic components like soil, water, air, sunlight, etc.\nAdaptation:\nAn adaptation is, \u201cthe appearance or behavior or structure or mode of life of an organism that allows it to survive in a particular environment\u201d.\nAdaptation may be:\nMorphological \u2013 when trees grew higher, the giraffe\u2019s neck got longer;\nPhysiological \u2013 in the absence of an external source of water, the kangaroo rat in North American deserts is capable of meeting all its water requirements through its\u00a0internal fat oxidation\nAmensalism:\nThis environment terminology is an interaction between the two species where one is harmed, and others remain unaffected. For example, penicillin and bacteria.\nApplied ecology:\nDeals with the conservation of economic advantages of species\nAtmosphere:\nThe atmosphere is a physical mixture of atmospheric gases, water vapour, and suspended particulates surrounding the earth from all sides. It is bounded to the surface by the gravity of the planet.\nAutotrophs:\nIt means organisms that produce food from inorganic substances like CO2 and water are called autotrophs. They are also known as primary producers.\nAuto Ecology:\nThe ecological study of a particular individual or species for the environment is regarded as auto ecology.\nIt deals with organisms, their adaptations, and their interactions with their surroundings.\nAquatic ecology:\nDeals with aquatic organisms, e.g., Marine, freshwater, etc.\nAcute Toxicity:\nThe ability of a substance to cause poisonous effects resulting in severe biological harm or death soon after a single exposure or dose. Also, it is any severe poisonous effect resulting from a single short-term exposure to a toxic substance.\nAssimilation Efficiency:\nIn an animal, the percentage of the energy content of ingested food is absorbed across the gut wall. In plants, the percentage of solar visible light is fixed by photosynthesis. The term may also be used to refer to the percentage assimilation of ingested inorganic nutrients (such as nitrate or phosphate) by plants or animals, or of drugs by animals.\nAtmospheric Inversion (Temperature Inversion):\nA relatively stable atmospheric condition in which cool air is trapped beneath a layer of warmer air.\nBenthic Animals:\nThis Environment Terminology means the animals that live at the bottom of the water body are benthic animals.\nBioaccumulation:\nIt is the process of increase in the concentration of toxic elements within the body of a particular organism (i.e., it refers to how a part first made an entry into the food chain),\nand in general, the concentration of such pollutants becomes higher in the body of the organism compared to the external environment like air, water, etc.\nBiodiversity:\nThis Ecology term means the total of all plants, animals, and microorganisms representing an ecosystem\u2019s biodiversity. It is also described in terms of interspecies and intraspecies variations of biotic components of an ecosystem.\nBio-Geochemical Cycles:\nThe circular pathways from which the essential elements, like nitrogen, carbon, etc., circulate from organisms to the environment and vice versa are called biogeochemical cycles.\nBiome:\nThis Ecology Terminology means natural forests and grasslands connected with climatic regimes or the distribution of sunshine, temperature, and rainfall.\nA\u00a0biome\u00a0is a\u00a0large naturally occurring community of flora and fauna occupying a major habitat. E.g. Rainforest biome or tundra biome.\nPlants and animals in a biome have common characteristics due to similar climates and can be found over a range of continents.\nBiomass:\nThe amount of living matter present in an organism at a given time is known as the biomass of that organism.\nBiosphere:\nIt is the most important ecosystem on the surface of the earth, and its presence indicates a continuous interaction and interdependence between all three spheres of the world, i.e., atmosphere, hydrosphere, and lithosphere.\nThe\u00a0biosphere includes all living organisms on earth, together with the dead organic matter produced by them.\nBiotic Component:\nThis environmental terminology means the living components of an ecosystem form part of the biotic components of the ecosystem.\nBrood Parasitism:\nA unique form of parasitism in birds is where a parasitic bird lays its eggs in the host\u2019s nest and lets the host incubate them.\nCarnivores:\nAnimals depending upon herbivores or primary consumers for food and energy are known as carnivores.\nClimate Change:\nThis Ecology Terminology means the shifting pattern of weather and climate parameters makes it uncertain, unpredictable, and fluctuating. This is climate change.\nClimax:\nIt is the last stage of the process of succession. The species at which the process concludes is known as a climax community.\nCo-extinctions:\nIt is a situation When a species becomes extinct, and the plant and animal species associated with it also become extinct.\nComposting:\nThis Environment Terminology means decomposing organic solid wastes under aerobic conditions (in the presence of oxygen).\nCommensalism:\nA type of interaction between the two species When one of the organisms benefits and others remains neutral in an association.\nFor example, epiphyte and mango; barnacles growing on the back of a whale.\nCompetition:\nType of interaction between the two species where both are negatively impacted (harmed). Example- plants and herbivores.\nConservation:\nJudicious use of natural resources (both living and non-living) to prevent them from being lost, wasted, or extinct.\nCryosphere:\nThis Environment Terminology means the area covered by the earth\u2019s surface by ice and glaciers.\nDetrivores:\nThe microorganisms which decompose the detritus are detrivores.\nDecomposer:\nOrganisms like bacteria, fungi, etc., are involved in the bio decomposition of dead plants and animals.\nDeciduous:\nTrees shed all their leaves for a certain period.\nDemography:\nStatistical study of the population size of humans.\nDDT:\nThe organochlorine chemical is used as an insecticide/pesticide for agricultural uses.

Such genes are reproduced more in a population due to natural selection.\nIndividuals and Species:\nThe organism is an individual living being that can act or function independently.\nSpecies are a\u00a0group\u00a0of living organisms consisting of\u00a0similar individuals capable of exchanging genes or of\u00a0interbreeding.\nPopulation:\nThe population is a community of interbreeding organisms (same species), occupying a defined area during a specific time.\nPopulation growth rate can be positive due to birth and/or immigration or negative due to death and/or emigration.\nCommunity:\nCommunities in most instances are named after the\u00a0dominant plant form.\nFor example, a grassland community is dominated by grasses, though it may contain herbs, trees, etc.\nSpeciation:\nSpeciation is the process by which\u00a0new species are formed,\u00a0and\u00a0evolution is the mechanism by which speciation is brought about.\nA species comprises many populations. Often different populations of a species remain isolated due to some geographic barrier such as a mountain, ocean, river, etc.\nSynecology:\nIt studies diverse species that live in a community and interact with the circumstances. Synecology is further classified into terrestrial and aquatic ecology.\nSystem ecology:\nDeals with the branch of ecology that takes the benefits of modern technology to understand the ecosystem.\nSynthetic Organic Chemical (SOC):\nMan-made (anthropogenic) organic chemicals.

Read further to know more.\n\nIndia has many communities of fishermen, and fishing has been a traditional employment here.\n\nAdditionally, the 12th FYP recommended that the Fisheries sector be given fresh attention by modernising fishing trawlers, introducing mother vessels, and improving cold storage facilities.\n\nTable of Contents\n\nWhat is Deep Sea fishing?\nMain types of Deep sea fishing\nIssues and Challenges in Deep sea fishing\nOverfishing:\nBycatch:\nHabitat destruction:\nIllegal, unreported, and unregulated fishing:\nClimate change:\nTechnological limitations:\nInsufficient Conservation Efforts:\nThreatens Livelihood of Traditional Fishers:\nThreat to Food Security:\nThreatens Endangered Species:\nThe recent judgment of the Supreme Court\nWhat is Purse Seine Fishing?\nWay forward\nWhy in News?\nConclusion\nUPSC Civil Services Examination Previous Year Questions (PYQs)\nWhat is Deep Sea fishing?\n\nFishing at least 100 feet deep in waters far from the shore is known as deep-sea fishing, also known as large game or offshore fishing. Fishing operations in the open ocean, beyond the continental margin, are referred to as deep-sea fishing.\n\nThe country\u2019s Blue Revolution goal to fully utilise fishing resources within the 200 nautical mile exclusive economic zone has included deep sea fishing as a key component (EEZ).\n\nMain types of Deep sea fishing\n\nFishing that takes place in the open ocean, typically far from the shore, is referred to as deep-sea fishing. Here are a few typical techniques for deep-sea fishing:\n\nTrolling: This is a technique in which a lure or bait is drawn through the water behind a moving boat. The lure is designed to attract fish to bite.\nBottom fishing: This is a technique in which the bait is dropped to the bottom of the sea. The trick can be left on the bottom or lifted slightly off the bottom to attract fish.\nJigging\u00a0is a technique in which a weighted lure is dropped to the bottom of the sea and lifted and lowered to attract fish.\nDrifting: This is a technique in which the boat is allowed to drift along with the current while bait is deployed. The bait can be on the surface or suspended at a depth to attract fish.\nChumming: This is a technique in which fish bait is scattered over the water to attract fish.\nDeep dropping: This is a technique in which the bait is dropped to the bottom of the sea, usually in depths of several hundred meters, to catch deep-sea species\nIssues and Challenges in Deep sea fishing\n\nAs far as we are aware, it is an industrial trawling technique. Thus, increased fishing or overfishing, which has a significant ecological impact on the fish population, is driven by financial considerations.\n\n\ud83d\udc49 Which year are YOU targeting for success in the IAS/IPS/IFS Exam? \ud83d\ude80\n\n(1) \u21d2 UPSC 2025: Prelims cum Mains\n\n(2) \u21d2 UPSC 2026: Prelims cum Mains\n\n(3) \u21d2 UPSC 2027 Prelims cum Mains\n\nTip: Know more about ClearIAS Courses (Online/Offline)\n\nOverfishing:\nOverfishing is one of the greatest problems with deep-sea fishing. The populations of many fish species are declining as a result of fishing at a pace that is outpacing their capacity to reproduce.\nThis could have a major effect on marine ecosystems and cause fish numbers to collapse.\nBycatch:\nBycatch, a term for the accidental capture of non-target species during deep-sea fishing, occurs frequently. This can include fish species, seabirds, and marine mammals, many of which are in peril of extinction.\nHabitat destruction:\nDeep-sea fishing techniques can cause substantial damage to the seafloor and the habitats of deep-sea species. Bottom trawling, for example, entails dragging heavy nets along the seafloor, which can destroy coral reefs and other critical habitats.\nIllegal, unreported, and unregulated fishing:\nDeep sea fishing is frequently done by boats that don\u2019t follow local, national, and foreign fishing laws. This may result in illegal commerce in fish and seafood products as well as overfishing and other unsustainable fishing methods.\nClimate change:\nThe oceans and the marine creatures that live in them are being significantly impacted by climate change.\nFish populations may diminish as a result of rising ocean temperatures and acidification, necessitating the modification of fishing methods to the new environmental circumstances.\nTechnological limitations:\nDeepwater fishing can be expensive and logistically difficult. Fishing access to deep-sea fish populations may be challenging due to inadequate technology and gear, which may reduce the potential for sustainable fishing methods.\nInsufficient Conservation Efforts:\nThe court\u2019s ruling appears more focused on administrative and transparency measures to control fishing than it is on conservation efforts and legal obligations under the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea (UNCLOS).\nThe EEZ\u2019s living and non-living resources must be utilised, conserved, and controlled by coastal states by UNCLOS to prevent overexploitation.\nCoastal States must establish the total allowable catch (TAC) in the EEZ to avoid overexploitation.\nWithout controlling fishing techniques, limiting the purse seine to two days of fishing is insufficient.\nThreatens Livelihood of Traditional Fishers:\nContrary to traditional fishers using traditional fishing gear, purse seiners frequently overfish, endangering the traditional fisher\u2019s means of subsistence.\nIt is a non-targeted fishing technique that catches any fish that gets in the net\u2019s path, including young fish.\nAs a result, they seriously harm aquatic resources.\nThreat to Food Security:\nThe diminishing supply of oil sardines, a favourite of fish eaters in Kerala, is a serious worry.\nJust 3,297 tonnes of sardines were taken in by Kerala in 2021, a significant drop from the 3.9 lakh tonnes taken in 2012.\nThreatens Endangered Species:\nA possible trade embargo may be threatened by the non-selective fishing techniques used by purse seines that result in the bycatch of other marine living species, some of which may be endangered.\nThe recent judgment of the Supreme Court\n\nThe Indian Supreme Court has authorised fishing in Tamil Nadu\u2019s Exclusive Economic Zone (EEZ) (200 nautical miles) and the outside territorial waters (12 nautical miles), subject to some restrictions. The highest court has also approved the use of the purse seine fishing technique. The purse seine fishing technique had previously been outlawed by the Tamil Nadu administration.\n\nA purse seine is formed of a long wall of netting that is framed by floating and leadline and has purse rings hanging from the bottom of the gear. A purse line made of steel wire or rope passes through the purse rings and allows the net to be pulled through.\n\nWhat is Purse Seine Fishing?\nA purse seine is made of a\u00a0long wall of netting framed with floating and leadline and having purse rings hanging from the lower edge of the gear,\u00a0through which runs a purse line made from steel wire or rope which allow the pursing of the net.\nThe technique is\u00a0considered to be an efficient form of fishing\u00a0and has been widely deployed on India\u2019s western coasts.\nIt is used in the open ocean to\u00a0target dense schools of single-species pelagic (midwater) fish\u00a0like tuna and mackerel.\nWay forward\n\nThough India needs a \u201cblue revolution\u201d and modern technology, it should not come at the cost of the livelihood of traditional fishermen. A more comprehensive approach including all stakeholders and technological innovation funded by govt is needed.\n\nAddressing these issues and challenges requires a comprehensive approach that involves better regulation, improved monitoring and surveillance, and the adoption of sustainable fishing practices that prioritize the long-term health of the ocean and its inhabitants.\n\nWhy in News?\n\nMurari committee report\u00a0in the mid-1990s and the\u00a0deep-sea fishing policy of 2004, though meant to revive this sector, actually led to its further decline. There was a sharp reduction in the number of large fishing vessels operating under joint ventures as a result of this policy. This left the bulk of the fishing resources of India\u2019s vast exclusive economic zone (EEZ) either unexploited or underexploited. Also, there is, therefore, little scope for raising fish output in waters up to a depth of 200 metres.\n\nSupreme Court (SC)\u00a0has given\u00a0permission to fishermen using\u00a0Purse Seine Fishing\u00a0gear to fish beyond territorial waters (12 nautical miles) and within the\u00a0Exclusive Economic Zone (EEZ) (200 nautical miles) of Tamil Nadu but observing certain restrictions. This comes in the\u00a0backdrop\u00a0against the\u00a0banning of purse seine fishing by the Tamil Nadu Government\u00a0in February 2022.\n\nSC has restricted the purse seiner to fish on two days, Monday and Thursday from 8 am to 6pm revoking the complete ban imposed by Tamil Nadu government.\n\nConclusion\n\nGarrett Hardin\u2019s concept of the\u00a0\u2018Tragedy of the Commons,\u2019\u00a0which suggests that \u201cFreedom in a commons brings ruin to all,\u201d should serve as a compelling argument for authorities, fishermen, particularly purse seiners, to work together and adhere to conservation efforts.\n\nUPSC Civil Services Examination Previous Year Questions (PYQs)\n\nQ.

Elephants in Asia and Africa are in danger of going extinct due to illicit poaching for the huge demand for ivory, tusks, and other body parts.\n\nThere are currently roughly 28,000 elephants residing in India, with Karnataka housing about 25% of them.\nAsian elephants, African forest elephants, and African bush elephants are the three distinct species of elephants. The three subspecies that make up the Asian elephant are the Indian, Sumatran, and Sri Lankan species.\nThe Indian subspecies make up the majority of the remaining elephants on the continent and have the broadest range.\nAccording to a 2017 census, India is home to the largest population of wild Asian elephants, with an estimated 27,312 elephants, or roughly 55% of the species\u2019 total global population.\nThey can be found in India\u2019s 32 elephant reserves, which are spread out over 65,270 square kilometres of wooded areas in northeast, central, northwest, and south India. Each reserve contains ten different elephant landscapes.\nHowever, these reserve areas are not exclusively for elephants unless the elephant reserve is situated inside an already protected Reserve Forest or the Protected Area network.\nIn India, elephant reserves are not the only officially protected environments. Indian elephants are superb rovers and spend the majority of their day grazing.\nThey also leave a lot of faeces in their wake, which helps to germinate seeds spread out as they travel.\nIn addition to grasses and other plants, Indian elephants also eat a lot of tree bark, roots, leaves, and small branches. Indian elephants favour eating planted foods including rice, sugarcane, and bananas.\nThey always choose a route that is closer to a freshwater source because they need to drink at least once every day.\nAsian Elephants vs African Elephants\n\nHere is the explanation of Asian Elephants vs African Elephants\n\nAsian Elephants\n\nThere are three subspecies of Asian elephants: the Indian, Sumatran, and Sri Lankan.\n\nGlobal Population: Estimated 20,000 to 40,000.\nThe Indian subspecies have the widest range and account for the majority of the remaining elephants on the continent.\nThere are around 28,000 elephants in India with around 25% of them in Karnataka.\nIUCN Red List Status: Endangered.\nWildlife (Protection) Act, 1972: Schedule I.\nCITES status \u2013\u00a0 Appendix I.\nAfrican Elephants\n\nThere are two subspecies of African elephants, the Savanna (or bush) elephant, and the Forest elephant.\n\nGlobal Population: Around 4,00,000.\nIUCN Red List Status:\nAfrican Forest elephant: critically endangered\nSavanna elephant: endangered\nEarlier in July 2020, Botswana (Africa) witnessed the death of hundreds of elephants.\nDifference between Asian and African elephants\nAsian elephants are smaller than their African relatives, and they lack the huge, fan-like ears that the African type has.\nWhile both male and female African elephants can acquire tusks, only some male Asian elephants do.\nThe savanna elephant and the forest elephant are two different types of elephants that may be found on the African continent, and they differ from one another in a number of ways.\nProject Elephant\n\nProject Elephant, an effort backed by the Central Government, was started in February 1992.\n\nUnder the Project Elephant strategy for the conservation and management of elephants, the government provides assistance to the states that have a population of wild elephants living in the wild.\n\nIt ensures the preservation of elephant corridors and habitats to ensure the survival of the elephant population in its natural state. The project aims to protect elephant migration routes and habitats to ensure the survival of the elephant population in the wild. Arunachal Pradesh, Assam, Andhra Pradesh, Chhattisgarh, Jharkhand, Kerala, Karnataka, Meghalaya, Maharashtra, Nagaland, Orissa, Tamil Nadu, Uttaranchal, Uttar Pradesh, and West Bengal are the 16 states or union territories that primarily adhere to this elephant conservation plan out of the 28 states or union territories in India.\n\nThe union government provides these states with the financial and technical support necessary to carry out and finish Project Elephant. Field supervisors receive training to prevent and minimise man-elephant conflict in addition to helping with the census.\n\nThe project has three main objectives: the preservation of the well-being of domesticated elephants through the protection of elephants, their habitats, and elephant corridors. minimising and avoiding conflict between people and elephants.\n\nAlso read: Wildlife Sanctuaries in India\n\nNational Heritage Animal\n\nThe Indian government selected the elephant as the country\u2019s national heritage animal in 2010 in accordance with the recommendations of the standing committee of the national board for wildlife. This was carried out to guarantee that elephants received proper protection prior to their numbers declining to alarming levels, as occurred to tigers. The Wildlife Protection Act of 1972 may need to be changed in order to establish a National Elephant Conservation Authority (NECA) that would be similar to the NTCA.\n\nMIKE Program for Project Elephant\n\nFollowing the adoption of a CITES resolution by the conference of parties, the Monitoring of Illegal Killing of Elephants (MIKE) programme was introduced in South Asia in 2003. The goal of MIKE was to deliver the knowledge required for the nations that make up the elephant range to manage their elephant populations effectively and long-term protect them. The objectives of the MIKE programme are to keep an eye on the levels and trends of illegal poaching and make sure that the strategies for conserving elephants change. to determine the reasons behind these changes and to assess how the CITES conference affected parties\u2019 choices.\n\nElephant Task Force\n\nIn a similar way to how the Tiger Task Force was established, the government created the Elephant Task Force in reaction to the mounting unrest brought on by the practice of murdering elephants as retaliation and the conflict between humans and elephants. The principal goal of the Elephant Task Force was to offer practical solutions for the long-term protection of elephants. In India, there are between 25,000 and 29, 000 wild elephants. However, India\u2019s tuskers (male) elephant population is barely around 1200, making them just as vulnerable as tigers. Threats to Asian elephants include poaching for ivory, habitat loss, and human-elephant conflicts\n\nThis problem is particularly serious in India, which is home to nearly 50% of all Asian elephants in the world. Since Project Elephant was able to keep the elephant population in India at a steady and sustainable level, many conservationists view it as a success.\n\nProject RE-HAB\n\nIn order to lessen conflict between people and elephants, the Karnataka state government has launched a pilot initiative called RE-HAB (Reducing Elephant-Human Attacks Using Bees) that involves placing bee boxes along the edge of the forest and in the communities.\n\nThese areas are situated on the outskirts of the well-known conflict zone known as Nagarahole National Park and Tiger Reserve.\nIt aims to use beehive \u201cbee fences\u201d to prevent elephant attacks on human settlements.\nThe Khadi and Village Industries Commission is the organisation behind the scheme (KVIC).\nIt is a part of the National Honey Mission of KVIC.\nHaathi Mere Saathi\n\nThe Ministry of Environment and Forest (MoEF) launched the campaign Haathi Mere Saathi in collaboration with the Wildlife Trust of India (WTI). At the 2011 \u201cElephant- 8\u201d Ministerial meeting held in Delhi, the campaign was introduced.\n\nIndia, Botswana, the Republic of the Congo, Indonesia, Kenya, Sri Lanka, Tanzania, and Thailand make up the E-8 nations.\n\nThis public campaign aims to raise awareness among the populace and foster compassion and friendship between people and elephants.\n\nElephant Corridor\n\nA tract of land, whether it be forested or not, that connects bigger habitats with elephant populations and functions as a passageway for wildlife migration between the habitats is referred to as a \u201celephant corridor.\u201d\n\nIncreased species survival and birth rates are a result of this trend.\n\nIn India, 88 elephant pathways have been discovered.\n\nThere are 88 corridors in all, with 20 in the south, 12 in the northwest, 20 in the centre, 14 in northern West Bengal, and 22 in the northeast of the country.\n\nThreats to Elephant Corridor\nHabitat loss resulting in habitat fragmentation and destruction is a result of development activities like building new homes, roads, trains, and resorts and installing solar-powered electric fencing, among other things.\nThe two \u201csingle largest dangers\u201d to elephant routes in central India are coal mining and iron ore mining.\nThe mineral-rich states of Orissa, Jharkhand, and Chhattisgarh also have the most elephant corridors in the nation, which makes them notorious for elephant-man clashes.\nDue to the high value of elephant ivory from the tusks, there is also a significant poaching issue.\nElephants require large grazing areas, which are not available in most reserves. If the size of the protected areas is insufficient, elephants may look for food elsewhere. Conflicts with people happen frequently as a result of elephant raiding.\nConclusion\n\nMeasures are taken to reduce the number of wild elephant deaths by educating the local inhabitants. The Ministry of Environment and Forests of India established the Elephant Task Force, which delivered its report, titled \u201cGajah,\u201d to the Ministry in 2010. The National Elephant Conservation Authority (NECA) is now being created, in accordance with one of the Elephant Task Force\u2019s recommendations. To prevent the deaths of elephants by speeding trains, the Ministries of Environment Forests and Climate Change (MoEF&CC) and the Ministry of Railways have jointly issued recommendations to all the affected states.\n\nArticle Written By: Atheena Fathima Riyas\u00a0"

Read further to know more.\n\nBiodiversity is referred to as the diversity of plant and animal species in a specific habitat. The two main factors that make up biodiversity are species evenness and species richness.\n\nIndia is renowned for having a diverse ecosystem, and 23.39% of its land is covered in trees and forests with nearly 91,000 identified animal species and 45,500 documented plant species.\n\nFour of the world\u2019s 36 biodiversity hotspots are located in India: The Himalayas, Western Ghats, Indo-Burma area, and Sundaland. Two of these, the Indo-Burma area and Sundaland, are distributed throughout South Asia and are not precisely contained within India\u2019s formal borders.\n\nTable of Contents\n\nWhat are Biodiversity Hot Spots?\nCriteria to be satisfied for a biodiversity hotspot\nWho Declares Biodiversity Hotspots?\nBiodiversity Hot Spots in India\nHimalayas\nThreats to Himalayan Biodiversity\nIndo-Burma\nThreats to Indo-Burma\nWestern Ghats\nThreats to the Western Ghats\nSundaland\nThreats to Biodiversity in Sundaland\nConclusion\nWhat are Biodiversity Hot Spots?\n\nSubscribe to the ClearIAS YouTube Channel for more informative videos on UPSC preparation, tips, and strategies.

In other words, it must be threatened.\nWho Declares Biodiversity Hotspots?\n\nHotspots were first defined and promoted by Conservation International. Conservation International was founded in 1989, just one year after scientist Norman Myers published the article that popularised the idea of safeguarding these beautiful places.\n\nBiodiversity Hot Spots in India\n\nThere are four Biodiversity Hotspots in India:\n\nHimalaya\nIndo-Burma\nWestern Ghtas\nSundaland\n\n\u00a0\n\nHimalayas\n\nAll of the world\u2019s mountain peaks higher than 8,000 meters, including Mt. Everest (8,849 metres), are found within the Himalayan hotspot, which spans more than 3,000 kilometres across northern Pakistan, Nepal, Bhutan, and the northwest and northeastern states of India. It also has several of the deepest river gorges in the world.\n\nThe Himalayan Mountain range is nearly 7.5 million square kilometres in size and is divided into the Eastern Himalaya, which includes parts of Nepal, Bhutan, the northeastern Indian states of West Bengal, Sikkim, Assam, and Arunachal Pradesh, and the Western Himalaya, which includes parts of Kumaon-Garhwal, northwest Kashmir, and northern Pakistan.\n\nThe Himalayan mountains are home to a variety of ecosystems, including :\n\nMixed conifer and conifer forests in the higher hills\nAlpine meadows above the tree line, the tallest alluvial grasslands in the world\nSubtropical broadleaf forests along the foothills\nTemperate broadleaf forests in the mid hills\n\nEven at heights higher than 6,000 meters, vascular plants have been discovered. Numerous big bird and mammal populations, including vultures, tigers, elephants, rhinos, and wild water buffalo, can be found in the hotspot.\n\nThe worldwide hotspot regions were reviewed and revised in light of species distribution, threats, and changes in threat status. The Himalayan hotspot was delineated and identified as separate from the Indo-Burma hotspot.\n\nThreats to Himalayan Biodiversity\nPromoting both outside immigration and internal migration and leading to an exponential increase in the human population in some of the locations with the greatest biodiversity.\nDue to widespread legal and illegal logging, especially on steep slopes, as well as the substantial removal of forests and meadows for farming, there has been serious erosion.\nDuring the summer, the area is frequently burned to make way for livestock, which provides an extra hazard to the forest because fires can occasionally go out of control.\nRapid deforestation and habitat fragmentation were the results of the conversion of forests and grasslands for agriculture and settlements, mainly in Nepal and the Indian states of Sikkim, West Bengal (Darjeeling), and Assam.\nAdditionally, certain forest ecosystems have been severely harmed by anthropogenic activities such as domestic cattle overgrazing, overharvesting plants for traditional medicine, collecting fuel wood, and extraction of non-timber forest products.\nUnplanned and poorly managed tourism operations exacerbate environmental damage.\nIn the Himalayas, illegal poaching is a significant problem; tigers and rhinoceroses are targeted for their body parts for use in traditional remedies, whilst snow leopards and red pandas are targeted for their stunning pelts.\nIndo-Burma\n\nThe Indo-Burma hotspot is the largest of the world\u2019s 36 recognised hotspots, covering a total area of 2,373,000 km2.\n\nThe Indo-Burma hotspot formerly encompassed parts of northeastern India, Bangladesh, and Malaysia.\n\nHowever, Bangladesh, India, and Malaysia are regarded as extralimital to the hotspot for the purposes of the ecosystem profile because northeastern India is included in the Himalayan hotspot and the hotspot only barely extends into Bangladesh and Malaysia.\n\nThe hotspot has an incredible geographic diversity, ranging from the tallest peak in Southeast Asia to coastlines along the Bay of Bengal, Andaman Sea, Gulf of Thailand, and South China Sea.\n\nAlong with several of Asia\u2019s greatest rivers and their lush floodplains and deltas, it also comprises the eastern extensions of the Himalayas, remote massifs, and plateaus.\n\nDue to the diversity of its landforms and climatic zones, the Indo-Burma hotspot supports a wide range of habitats and, as a result, a high level of overall biodiversity.\n\nIn the past 12 years, six new species of big mammals have been identified in this area:\n\nLarge-antlered Muntjac\nAnnamite Muntjac\nGrey-shanked Douc\nAnnamite Striped Rabbit\nLeaf Deer\nSaola\n\nThe majority of the endemic freshwater turtle species found in this hotspot are in danger of going extinct because of overfishing and habitat destruction.\n\nThe severely endangered White-eared Night-heron, Grey-crowned Crocias, and Orange-necked Partridge are among the 1,300 bird species that exist.\n\nThe hotspot\u2019s most diverse ecosystems are its forests. From evergreen forests with a great diversity of canopy tree species to semi-evergreen and mixed deciduous forests with few tree species, the hotspot supports a wide range of forest types.\n\nThe hotspot\u2019s limestone karst formations are home to extremely rare ecosystems with high levels of endemism, especially in plants, reptiles, and molluscs\u2014species that are entirely unique and are found nowhere else.\n\nThreats to Indo-Burma\n\nIndo-Burma is one of the top five most endangered biodiversity hotspots, according to Conservation International, due to the rate of resource extraction and habitat loss.\n\nThe greatest threats to this hotspot\u2019s biodiversity are logging, over-exploitation of natural resources, industrial agriculture, trade and consumption of wildlife, the building of massive infrastructures including dams, highways, and ports, and climate change.\nIn Indo-Burma, commercial timber exploitation ranks second among the causes of deforestation.\nThe loss of habitat has had an effect on other landforms, including wetlands and freshwater floodplain swamps.\nLarge tracts of mangroves have been contained within aquacultural ponds, and many rivers have been dammed and altered.\nMangroves, lagoons, marshes, and other natural wetlands, including several Ramsar sites in the hotspot\u2019s coastal zones, have undergone substantial conversion into shrimp and fish farms or have been removed for charcoal and fuelwood.\nWestern Ghats\n\nThe Western Ghats sometimes referred to as the Sahyadri Hills locally, are made up of the Malabar Plains and a group of mountains that extend 30 to 50 kilometres inland and parallel to India\u2019s western coast.\n\nWith just the 30 km Palakkad Gap in between, they span 1,600 km from the southernmost point of the nation to Gujarat in the north, covering an area of over 160,000 km2.\n\nBy blocking the southwestern monsoon winds, the Western Ghats control the amount of rain that falls on peninsular India.\n\nEvery year, a lot of rain falls on the western slopes of the mountains, with most of it falling during the southwest monsoon between June to September.\n\nRainfall drops off as you move from south to north, while the eastern slopes are drier.\n\nNumerous rivers, including the three main eastward-flowing rivers on the peninsula, originate in these highlands. As a result, they serve as essential sources of power, irrigation, and drinking water.\n\nThere are many different types of vegetation in the Western Ghats due to the region\u2019s complicated geography and varying rainfall patterns.\n\nThey include scrub forests in low-lying rain shadow regions and on the plains, deciduous and tropical rainforests up to a height of roughly 1,500 m, and an exceptional mosaic of montane forests and rolling grasslands above that altitude.\n\nThreats to the Western Ghats\nThe forests of the Western Ghats have been heavily fragmented and selectively cut across their whole range.\nFor monoculture plantations of tea, coffee, rubber, oil palm, teak, eucalyptus, and wattle as well as to make room for reservoirs, highways, and railways, forests have been removed.\nMore forests are lost due to encroachment into protected areas. On slopes that were once covered in forest, cattle and goat grazing inside and close to protected zones severely erodes them.\nThe majority of the remaining forest cover is made up of disturbed secondary growth or wood plantations.\nIntense hunting pressure, fuelwood extraction, and the harvesting of non-timber forest products are placed on the few surviving forest sections.\nOther concerns include unrestrained tourism and forest fires.\nThe conflict between humans and wildlife has increased as a result of population growth in protected zones and other woods. In an effort to stop more harm, wild animals are routinely killed or hurt, and farmers are typically under-compensated.\nSundaland\n\nThe Sundaland hotspot includes the western half of the Indo-Malayan archipelago, which is made up of about 17,000 equatorial islands. Borneo (725,000 km2) and Sumatra are two of the largest islands in the world (427,300 km2).\n\nAlmost all of Malaysia including Peninsular Malaysia and the East Malaysian states of Sarawak and Sabah in northern Borneo, Singapore at the tip of the Malay Peninsula, Brunei Darussalam, and the western half of Indonesia, including Kalimantan, are included in Sundaland. A small portion of southern Thailand the provinces of Pattani, Yala, and Narathiwat is also included the Indonesian portion of Borneo, Sumatra, Java, and Bali.\n\nIndia is in charge of the Nicobar Islands, which are also included.\n\nThe 7,100 islands of the Philippines Hotspot are direct to the northeast of Wallacea, which is separated from Sundaland Hotspot by the renowned Wallace\u2019s Line.\n\nThreats to Biodiversity in Sundaland\nThe stunning flora and wildlife of the Sundaland Hotspot are being rapidly destroyed by industrial forestry on these islands\nGlobal traffic in animals, uses tigers, monkeys, and turtle species for food and medicine in other nations.\nOnly in this area are orangutans located, and their population is rapidly declining.\nThe Indonesian islands of Java and Sumatra are also home to some of the final refuges for two Southeast Asian rhino species.\nLike many other tropical regions, the forests are being destroyed for business.\nThe production of pulp, oil palm, and rubber are three of the most harmful factors endangering biodiversity in the Sundaland Hotspot.\nConclusion\n\nIndia is renowned for having the world\u2019s richest flora, with over 18000 species of blooming plants, and has a diverse climate, topography, and habitat. Three thousand different plant species can be found in India\u2019s eight primary floristic zones, which are the Western and Eastern Himalayas, the Indus and Ganges, Assam, the Deccan, Malabar, and the Andaman Islands.\n\nThe good climatic conditions, fertile soil, suitable temperature, and an abundance of precipitation, which promote the growth of numerous plants, are the causes of the vast diversity of Indian biodiversity hotspots. These regions are heavily wooded, with savanna grasslands and tropical and subtropical forests.\n\nThey are distinguished by the nation\u2019s largest rivers, have rich alluvial soil, and can therefore support a wide variety of animals and plants. In terms of ecology and energy production, these regions are incredibly productive.\n\nArticle written by Aryadevi E S"

As one of the world\u2019s 17 mega-biodiverse nations, it confronts particular difficulties in preserving its biodiversity.\n\nWith 600 protected areas spread across 161,221 sq. km., India\u2019s biodiversity protection initiatives have been incredibly successful. 4.9% of the overall geographic area of the nation is made up of protected areas.\n\nCurrently, only a tiny portion of the ocean, or 6%, is designated as a marine protected area, of which 2.4% is completely protected and the remaining 3.6% is protected to some degree.\n\nTable of Contents\n\nWhat are Marine Protected Areas?\nMarine Protected Areas in India\nClassification of Marine Protection area\nCoastal Regulation Zone (CRZ)\nList of some of the major Marine Protected Areas\nImportance of MPAs\nChallenges of MPAs\nGlobal Efforts\nWay ahead\nConclusion\nWhat are Marine Protected Areas?\nA region of the ocean or the littoral where human activities are subject to stricter regulations than those that apply to the surrounding waters is known as a marine protected area. The federal, state, local, and regional governments have provided these areas extra protection for marine wildlife.\nThe marine variety of India has been identified by the International Union for Conservation of Nature as one of the top twenty biodiversities worldwide. As a result, stringent regulations have been enacted to protect wildlife in national parks and marine water bodies spread across nine states and all of the nation\u2019s union territories.\nAn oceanic region designated as a marine protected area (MPA) has restrictions on human activity. Many MPAs permit residents to use the region in environmentally friendly ways. Some\u00a0ban\u00a0fishing. Some don\u2019t let anyone in the neighbourhood at all.\nBecause the ocean and the creatures that live there are in danger frequently, MPAs have been created. Overfishing, litter, river pollution, and climate change are all dangers to the ocean. Numerous fish, marine mammals, and other water creatures have seen population declines due to these dangers.\nMarine parks, marine conservation zones, marine reserves, marine sanctuaries, and no-take zones are just a few of the names given to marine protected regions. Around the globe, more than 5,000 MPAs have been created. They enclose 0.8 per cent of the water as a whole.\nThere are numerous aquatic habitats where marine protected areas can be created. There are some MPAs in the open seas. A lot of MPAs safeguard coasts. Others deal with estuaries, which are where waterways meet the ocean. Freshwater and saltwater combine in estuaries. Some freshwater habitats, such as the Great Lakes\u2019 protected zones, are also regarded as MPAs.\nMarine Protected Areas in India\nAccording to IUCN Recommendations, India has marine protected areas. They restrict human activity and resource exploitation in these regions. The IUCN\u2019s definition of a protected area has received widespread acceptance around the globe.\nIndia has designated sections of its oceans and estuaries as marine protected areas to preserve the country\u2019s native wildlife. The abundant biodiversity in these areas enables local and national governments to make significant earnings from marketing and tourism.\nThe shoreline of India is home to 31 marine protected areas. Within the next seven years, there must be a significant increase in the number of new MPAs established to meet the goal of 30% protection.\nA few examples of marine protected areas in India are the Andaman and Nicobar Islands, the Gulf of Munnar in Tamil Nadu, Thane creek in Maharashtra, Sundarbans in West Bengal, etc.\nUnder the provisions of the Wild Life (Protection), Amendment Act of 2002, the Maine protected area seeks to preserve and protect the natural marine ecosystems in their pristine state.\nLocal, state, territorial, native, regional, or national officials have granted these areas special protection for their natural or historic marine resources.\nThe Wildlife Institute of India has designated 106 coastal and marine locations as Important Coastal and Marine Areas (ICMBAs) to help India meet National Biodiversity Target 2 and Aichi Biodiversity Target 11.\nNumerous kinds of fish, mammals, birds and other marine organisms live in India\u2019s vast and varied marine ecosystem.\nIndia has created a network of marine protected areas (MPAs) to conserve and sustainably manage its marine resources in response to the critical importance of the marine environment.\nIndia defines marine protected areas (MPAs) as areas of land put aside for the preservation and sustainable use of marine and coastal biodiversity.\nThe unique ecosystems and the species that rely on them are protected and preserved in these areas.\nIndia has passed laws for coastal and marine conservation, including the Wildlife (Protection) Act of 1972, the Environment (Protection) Act of 1986, the Coastal Regulation Zone Notification of 1991, the National Biodiversity Act of 2002, and the Environment (Protection) Act of 1986.\nClassification of Marine Protection area\n\nMarine Protection Areas (MPA) are classified are below,\n\nCategory I: covers National Parks and Sanctuaries having entire areas in intertidal/sub-tidal or mangroves, coral reefs, creeks, seagrass beds, algal beds, estuaries, and lagoons.\n\n\ud83d\udc49 Which year are YOU targeting for success in the IAS/IPS/IFS Exam? \ud83d\ude80\n\n(1) \u21d2 UPSC 2025: Prelims cum Mains\n\n(2) \u21d2 UPSC 2026: Prelims cum Mains\n\n(3) \u21d2 UPSC 2027 Prelims cum Mains\n\nTip: Know more about ClearIAS Courses (Online/Offline)\n\nCategory II: includes Islands, which have major parts in the marine ecosystem and some parts in the terrestrial ecosystem.\n\nCategory IIIA: includes sandy beaches beyond the intertidal line but occasionally interacting with the seawater.\n\nCategory IIIB: includes evergreen or semi-evergreen forests of islands.\n\nCoastal Regulation Zone (CRZ)\n\nCRZ notification was first issued in 1991, then amended in 2011 and again in 2018. CRZ notification, 2018 came after considering the recommendations made by Dr Shailesh Nayak\u2019s Committee (constituted by MOEFCC).\n\nCRZ-I: Ecologically sensitive areas like Mangroves, Coral Reefs, Salt Marshes, Turtle nesting grounds, nesting grounds of birds, seagrass beds, Sand Dunes, NP, Marine Park, WS etc.\nCRZ-II: Areas which are developed up to or close to the shoreline and falling within municipal limits.\nCRZ-III:\u00a0Areas that fall neither in CRZ I nor\u00a0CRZ II\u00a0and also include rural and urban areas that are not substantially developed.\nCRZ-IV: Aquatic area from low tide line up to territorial limits.\nList of some of the major Marine Protected Areas\n\nThe following is the list of marine protected areas in or near the mainland of India:\n\nState/ UT\u2019s\tName of Marine Protected Area\nMarine National Parks in India\nOdisha\tBhitarkanika\nGujarat\tGulf of Kachchh\nWest Bengal\tSundarbans\nTamil Nadu\tGulf of Mannar\nMarine Sanctuary in India\nMaharashtra\tThane Creek Flamingo Sanctuary\nWest Bengal\tWest Sundarbans\nDadra & Nagar Haveli\tDadra & Nagar Haveli Wildlife Sanctuary\nOdisha\tGahirmatha\nDaman & Diu\tFudam\nAndhra Pradesh\tKrishna\nGoa\tChorao Island\nMaharashtra\tMalvan Marine Wildlife Sanctuary\nOdisha\tChilika (Nalabana)\nOdisha\tBalukhand Konark\nGujarat\tKhijadia\nAndhra Pradesh/Tamil Nadu\tPulicat Lake\nAndhra Pradesh\tCoringa\nWest Bengal\tHoliday Island\nWest Bengal\tSajnakhali\nWest Bengal\tLothian Island\nOdisha\tBhitarkanika\nTamil Nadu\tPoint Calimere\nKerala\tKadalundi-Vallikkunnu (Community Reserve)\nImportance of MPAs\nBiodiversity Conservation: For threatened and endangered species, such as fish, marine mammals, birds, and other aquatic organisms, MPAs provide essential habitats.\nEcosystem protection: Important maritime ecosystems like coral reefs, mangroves, and seagrass beds are safeguarded by MPAs.\nSustainable resource use: MPAs can aid in ensuring that marine resources are used sustainably and that future generations will have access to these resources by preserving marine ecosystems and species.\nClimate change mitigation: By protecting marine ecosystems and the species that depend on them, MPAs can lessen the effects of climate change. These ecosystems and species are crucial for regulating the Earth\u2019s temperature and weather patterns.\nEconomic benefits: MPAs can offer both commercial advantages like boosted fish stocks and better water quality as well as economic advantages like increased tourism and recreational possibilities.\nChallenges of MPAs\nLack of enforcement: Regulations within MPAs can be difficult to implement, especially in places that are far away and have scant patrols.\nPorous boundary: It makes it challenging to stop illicit fishing, poaching, and other practices that may seriously harm ecosystems and marine life.\nConflicts with local communities: MPAs may occasionally interfere with local fishing groups\u2019 and other coastal users\u2019 ability to maintain their way of life.\nLimited financial and institutional support: MPAs need a lot of money to be managed effectively, including money for enforcement, monitoring, and study.\nLimited scientific understanding: The intricate marine ecosystems and the species that inhabit them are poorly understood from a scientific standpoint. This makes it challenging to manage MPAs successfully and to develop conservation strategies that are supported by sound scientific evidence.\nGlobal Efforts\nThe Convention on Biological Diversity (CBD) is a global treaty signed by 196 countries, including India, to conserve biodiversity, promoting sustainable use of its components, and ensuring the fair sharing of benefits from genetic resources.\nPreviously, the 15th Conference of Parties (COP15) to the CBD held in Kunming, China in 2021, emphasized the role of marine protected areas (MPAs) in conserving marine biodiversity and promoting sustainable use of marine resources.\nWay ahead\nMPAs are essential for maintaining India\u2019s coastal communities and preserving its unique marine heritage. However, MPAs must operate effectively to be successful.\nDespite these difficulties, MPAs are becoming increasingly important for protecting and effectively managing India\u2019s marine resources.\nConclusion\n\nIndia\u2019s marine protected areas are home to a wide array of wildlife that draws tourists from around the world. The Wildlife Conservation Society has worked hard to protect marine biodiversity ever since the Wildlife Protection Act was enacted in 1972. Large swaths of land are still vulnerable. The animals that make our country proud and are a part of our rich heritage must be protected, and that is something that we Indians must resolve to do.\n\nGreater cooperation between governmental organisations, academic schools, and local communities is required to address these issues.\n\nArticle written by Aseem Muhammed"

Read further to know more.\n\nClimate action is urgently needed, as stated in the newly released IPCC Assessment Report from Working Group I, \u201cClimate Change 2021: The Physical Scientific Basis.\u201d It offers one of the most thorough scientific analyses of the causes, effects, and science of climate change.\n\nSea levels have risen 15 to 25 cm (6 to 10 inches) since 1900, and the rate of rise is quickening, particularly in some tropical regions, according to UN climate experts.\n\nThe World Meteorological Organization just released the paper \u201cGlobal Sea-level Rise and Consequences\u201d (WMO). By the end of the century, the oceans could have risen by approximately one metre (39 inches) around the islands in the Pacific and Indian Oceans if current warming trends continue.\n\nTable of Contents\n\nWhat is Sea Level Rise?\nWhy is the Global sea level rise a Major Concern?\nFactors leading to Global sea level rise\nThermal Expansion:\nGlobal Warming:\nSeasonal Change:\nImpact of Global sea level rise\nCoastal Flooding:\nDestruction of Coastal Biodiversity:\nDangerous Storm Surges:\nLateral and Inland Migration:\nEffect on Communications Infrastructure:\nThreat to Inland Life:\nTourism and Military Preparedness:\nSubmergence:\nFood insecurity:\nWhat\u2019s the difference between Global sea level rise and local sea levels?\nVulnerability to Island Nations due to Global sea level rise\nVulnerability in India due to Global sea level rise\nVarious steps are taken to tackle Global sea level rise\nRelocation:\nBuilding Sea Wall:\nUsing Beaches as Barriers:\nBuilding Enclosures:\nCreating Natural Infrastructure:\nArchitecture to Steer Flow of Water:\nGlobal Plans to reduce the impacts of Sea Level rise:\nWay Forward\nConclusion\nWhat is Sea Level Rise?\nSea level rise is an increase in ocean depth brought on by climate change, particularly global warming, and is primarily caused by three things: thermal expansion, glacier melting, and the loss of Greenland and Antarctica\u2019s ice sheets.\nTide stations and satellite laser altimeters are the main tools used to measure sea level.\nLess than a centimetre has been added to the sea\u2019s average height annually over the past century, but those tiny increases add up.\nIt is anticipated that in 2016, the rate will be 3.4 millimetres per year, up from roughly 3.2 millimetres per year in 2000.\nThroughout the past century, the sea level has been rising, and recently, the rate has quickened. Between 1880 and 2015, the average worldwide sea level increased by 8.9 inches. Compared to the previous 2,700 years, that is substantially faster.\nSLR varies from country to country. Due to subsidence, upstream flood control, erosion, regional ocean currents, changes in land height, and compressive weight of Ice Age glaciers, regional SLR may be higher or lower than global SLR.\nThe Special Report on the Ocean and Cryosphere in a Changing Climate, published by the IPCC, highlighted the catastrophic changes occurring in oceans, glaciers, and ice deposits on land and at sea. According to the analysis, oceans should rise between 10 and 30 inches by 2100 and temperatures should rise 1.5 degrees.\nWhy is the Global sea level rise a Major Concern?\nBecause oceans warm slowly, sea level rise will continue even after emissions stop growing.\nEven in the low emissions scenarios, sea level rise has consequences for the future because it is irreversible on a century scale.\nWarm ocean waters expand, land-based glaciers melt, and the ice sheets in Greenland and Antarctica melt, all of which contribute to sea level rise.\nProjections based on organised expert opinions suggest that a sea level rise of up to 2.3 metres by 2100 cannot be completely ruled out.\nThe world is expected to see a temperature increase of more than 3\u00b0C this century, according to the UN Environment Programme Emissions Gap Report (double the Paris Agreement aspiration). Also, predictions of sea level rise for warming exceeding 3\u00b0C are incredibly questionable.\nIt is essential to comprehend the threats posed by climate change and sea level rise in the twenty-first and twenty-second centuries.\nFactors leading to Global sea level rise\n\nExperts concur that human activity is substantially to blame for the climate changes that are currently being seen and that climate change is what is causing sea levels to increase. There are three main causes of the change in sea levels, all of which are brought on by ongoing global climate change:\n\nThermal Expansion:\nWater expands as a result of a rise in temperature, which causes oceans to occupy more area and the sea level to rise.\nWater expands as it warms up. Warmer oceans simply take up more space, which accounts for around half of the sea level rise over the past 25 years.\nGlobal Warming:\nGlobal warming has grown as a result of the ice sheets in West Antarctica and Greenland melting. This process is harmed by freshwater seepage from the surface because it causes the ice streams to slide more quickly by acting as a lubricant.\nIn other words, the ice sheets are pumped with clean, fresh water, which causes the ice to melt, weaken, and collapse into the sea, raising the sea level.\nLarge ice structures like glaciers and ice caps are subject to melting but do not reform. During the summer, these enormous frozen formations frequently partially decomposed, but when winter temperatures arrived, they resumed their solid form.\nDue to global warming, snowfall is softer, winters last longer, and springtime arrives earlier, causing ice to not recombine as frequently or in the same amount.\nSeasonal Change:\nAn important factor in the intra-annual rise in sea level is the annual warming/cooling cycle, which occurs in each hemisphere and causes the seas to warm and expand in the summer before cooling and contracting in the winter.\nBecause of this, sea levels in both hemispheres are higher in the summer and early autumn and lower in the winter and early spring.\nMoreover, more water is held on land during the Northern Hemisphere winter than in the ocean, which lowers the global average sea level at this time of year.\nImpact of Global sea level rise\n\nA significant economic, social, and humanitarian challenge is the sea level rising. According to the research, it endangers human life and means of subsistence as well as coastal farmlands, water reserves, and infrastructure resilience.\n\nCoastal Flooding:\nEight of the top ten largest cities on the planet are located close to a shoreline, which is at risk from coastal flooding.\nJakarta (Indonesia) is renowned as the city that sinks into the ground at the quickest rate in the entire globe, roughly 25 centimetres every year.\nGuangzhou, Jakarta, Miami, Mumbai, and Manila are more cities that frequently appear on lists of cities at risk from climate change.\nDestruction of Coastal Biodiversity:\nSLR may result in severe erosion, inundation of wetlands, salt pollution of aquifers and agricultural soil, and loss of biodiversity habitat.\nDangerous Storm Surges:\nHurricanes and typhoons are becoming more dangerous due to rising sea levels, which is resulting in loss of life and property.\nLateral and Inland Migration:\nPeople are being displaced and evicted due to flooding in low-lying coastal areas, which is contributing to a global refugee crisis.\nEffect on Communications Infrastructure:\nBasic services like internet connectivity are in danger due to the possibility of rising coastal water levels.\nThreat to Inland Life:\nIncreasing sea levels might endanger life further inland by contaminating soil and groundwater with salt.\nTourism and Military Preparedness:\nA rise in SLR will also have a severe impact on military readiness and coastal tourism.\nSubmergence:\nAlthough the sea-level rise is not uniform globally and differs locally, the report warns that prolonged and increasing sea-level rise would encroach on coastal infrastructure and settlements and expose low-lying coastal ecosystems to submersion and destruction.\nFood insecurity:\nIncreases in the frequency, intensity, and severity of droughts, floods, and heatwaves, as well as continued sea level rise, will increase risks to food security in vulnerable regions. Climate change will also put increasing pressure on food production and access, particularly in vulnerable regions, undermining food security and nutrition.\nWhat\u2019s the difference between Global sea level rise and local sea levels?\nThe relative sea level trend and the global sea level trend are two distinct metrics. In the same way that the Earth\u2019s surface is not flat, neither is the ocean\u2019s surface; as a result, worldwide sea level changes do not occur at the same rate.\nDue to a variety of local factors, such as subsidence, upstream flood control, erosion, regional ocean currents, variations in land height, and whether the land is still recovering from the compressive weight of Ice Age glaciers, sea level rise at particular locations may be greater or less than the global average.\nTide stations and satellite laser altimeters are the main tools used to measure sea level. The height of the sea as measured along the shore about a particular place on land is what tide stations all around the world tell us about what is happening locally.\nWe can determine the average height of the entire ocean from satellite readings.\nThese resources, when combined, show us how our ocean sea levels are altering throughout time.\nVulnerability to Island Nations due to Global sea level rise\nThe IPCC report noted that the global mean sea level in the Indian Ocean is rising at a rate of 3.7 metres per year and that extreme sea level events, which were previously seen roughly every year, will now be more common and severe, leading to coastal flooding in low-lying areas and coastal erosion.\nFor the Indian Ocean\u2019s low-lying island nations like the Maldives and others, this poses a serious concern.\nSea level rise poses a serious threat to even the coastal regions of countries like India and Africa.\nThe coasts will be the hardest damaged by sea level rise. If we don\u2019t reduce the quantity of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere, land that is currently home to between 470 and 760 million coastal dwellers will be submerged by sea level rise related to a 4-degree Celsius warming in the next centuries. This group resides largely in urban areas.\nStorms are already more dangerous due to sea level rise, which also increases flooding and damage in populated areas. Also, it will have varying effects around the globe, with some regions of the planet being particularly heavily struck.\nVulnerability in India due to Global sea level rise\nIndia\u2019s coastal communities are at risk from storms and sea level rise.\nThe frequency and severity of storms will increase due to climate change. Flooding, torrential rain, and storm surges will accompany them.\nEven the 0.1 to 0.2-metre rise projected for India over the next few decades has the potential to often flood the shore.\nVarious steps are taken to tackle Global sea level rise\n\nIn particular, at the coast, urban systems are essential, interconnected areas for enabling climate-resilient development. Given that, as of 2020, 896 million people resided in the Low Elevation Coastal Zone worldwide, and that number may rise to more than 1 billion by 2050, coastal towns and communities are crucial to the transition to more climate-resilient development.\n\n\ud83d\udc49 Which year are YOU targeting for success in the IAS/IPS/IFS Exam? \ud83d\ude80\n\n(1) \u21d2 UPSC 2025: Prelims cum Mains\n\n(2) \u21d2 UPSC 2026: Prelims cum Mains\n\n(3) \u21d2 UPSC 2027 Prelims cum Mains\n\nTip: Know more about ClearIAS Courses (Online/Offline)\n\nThese individuals, along with related coastal development and ecosystems, confront growing climate-related hazards, such as sea level rise.\n\nRelocation:\nRelocation has been planned as a mitigation technique in many coastal cities. For instance, Kiribati Island intends to move to Fiji, whereas Jakarta, the capital of Indonesia, is being moved to Borneo.\nBuilding Sea Wall:\nTo shield the city from floods, the Indonesian government started a coastal construction project in 2014 known as the Big Sea Wall, or \u201cGiant Garuda.\u201d\nUsing Beaches as Barriers:\nLike seawalls, beaches and dunes can serve as a natural barriers to block storm surges.\nMore water can be prevented from reaching homes and highways the bigger the beach or the bigger the dune. Sand can be added by towns to expand beaches or stop them from eroding.\nIt is possible to prevent flooding while protecting public beaches by using this kind of natural infrastructure.\nBuilding Enclosures:\nTo shield 15 countries in Northern Europe from rising sea levels, researchers have proposed the Northern European Enclosure Dam (NEED), which would completely enclose the North Sea.\nIt was also determined that such gigantic enclosures could be beneficial in the Persian Gulf, Mediterranean, Baltic, Irish, and Red Seas.\nCreating Natural Infrastructure:\nRestoration of natural infrastructure by coastal towns can serve as a safeguard against storms and coastal flooding.\nBarrier islands, oyster and coral reefs, mangroves, seagrass beds, and salt marshes are examples of natural structures that can absorb storm surges on their own or in conjunction with man-made structures like seawalls.\nArchitecture to Steer Flow of Water:\nBarriers, drainage, and avant-garde architectural elements like a \u201cwater square\u201d with temporary ponds were constructed by Dutch City Rotterdam.\nGlobal Plans to reduce the impacts of Sea Level rise:\nA $40 billion project in Jakarta aims to build an 80-foot seawall to safeguard the city.\nThe Global Center on Adaptation is located in Rotterdam, which has provided other cities looking to fight flooding and land loss with a model.\nThe Dutch city has constructed barriers, drainage systems, and avant-garde architectural elements like Water Square with its temporary ponds.\nWay Forward\nUncertainty about a metre or more of sea level rise before 2100 is due to ignorance and the inability to run models accurately enough. It can be risky to ignore the unknowns.\nMany actions must be taken in addition to stronger coastal management as part of the adaptation to sea-level rise.\nCoastal populations should be warned and safeguarded during extreme weather conditions.\nTo preserve some susceptible places, natural and other barriers should be taken into consideration in a restricted way.\nFor some very low-lying places, retreat should be a part of the adaptive methods.\nConclusion\n\nChanges in sea level are a key indicator of global warming. Sea levels increased during the twentieth century at a rate of up to 0.06 m every ten years. The rate of sea-level rise has accelerated every decade since the 1950s. Model trials show that natural processes alone are insufficient to account for the rise in sea level over the 20th century.\n\nThe artificial forcing of greenhouse gases is the main factor causing the current sea-level rise. The geological history of the last three glacial-interglacial cycles shows a substantial positive correlation between atmospheric CO2 concentrations and sea levels.\n\nCommunities working together to tackle sea level rise are coming up with creative and ingenious solutions that are being seen around the world. Such solutions may serve as a model for other cities.\n\nArticle written by Aseem Muhammed"

Conservation\n\nIn India, there are two types of protected area systems: community reserves and conservation reserves. Local communities and private organisations work together to administer these reserves.\n\nCommunity-led wildlife protection initiatives now can be recognised and legally supported thanks to changes made to the Wildlife Protection Act in 2003.\nIt provides a flexible framework for protecting wildlife without compromising the demands of the local population.\nDue to private land ownership and use, protection in and around existing or prospective protected areas has declined. This has led to the creation of these categories.\nExamples of Community Conserved Areas in India\n\nSome examples Community Conserved Areas in India are discussed below :\n\nFor more than 20 years, Gond tribal people in Maharashtra\u2019s Mendha (Lekha) village have been defending 1800 acres of reserved and protected forest. This is a result of the conflict over tribal self-rule.\nIn Uttaranchal, the residents of Jardhargaon village have been in charge of regenerating and safeguarding 600\u2013700 ha of Reserved Forests and grasslands, as well as fighting against limestone mining and preserving hundreds of indigenous crop types in situ.\nThe Kolavipalam fisherfolk group in Kerala protects sea turtle eggs, hatchlings, and nesting locations.\nThe Painted Stork and Spot-billed Pelican nesting places at Kokkare Bellur village, Karnataka, have historically been protected by the locals.\nIn the Loktak Lake basin, the Ronmei tribe of Manipur\u2019s Tokpa Kabui hamlet has restored 600 acres of village forest. Hunting is prohibited in this area for the critically endangered Sangai deer (Brown Antlered Deer). Despite their imminent extinction, local groups all over the country are preserving thousands of sacred groves.\nThe NGO Tarun Bharat Sangh is in charge of promoting forest regeneration, the resurrection of traditional water harvesting systems, the controlled use of water and forest resources, and the prohibition of villagers hunting wild animals in and around Rajasthan\u2019s Sariska National Park.\n\nAlso read: Hotspots \u2013 World Heritage Sites \u2013 Biosphere Reserves \u2013 National Parks \u2013 Sanctuaries \u2013 Tiger Reserves\n\nConclusion\n\nIf the land is totally privately owned, uninhabited, and used for sustenance by communities, it is recognised as a community area. Conservation areas are those same places. Due to private land ownership and use, protection in and around existing or prospective protected areas has declined. This has led to the creation of these categories. The rights of residents of Community Reserves are the same as those of residents of Conservation Reserves.\n\nArticle Written By: Atheena Fathima Riyas"

Read further to know more.\n\nA tiger reserve is made up of two areas: a \u201cCore\u201d or \u201cCritical Tiger Habitat\u201d that must be managed as a protected space, and a \u201cBuffer\u201d or \u201cPeripheral\u201d region that borders the Core area but may get less habitat protection. This is how a Tiger Reserve is typically zoned.\n\nThe National Tiger Conservation Authority, which oversees Project Tiger, is in charge of the Indian tiger reserves, which were established in 1973.\n\nIn India, tiger reserves have been established in 54 protected regions as of right now.\n\nTable of Contents\n\nTiger population in India\nList of Tiger reserves in India\nWhat is National Tiger Conservation Authority (NTCA)?\nWhat is Project Tiger?\nTiger Density In India\nInternational Tiger Day\nSt Petersburg Declaration\nTiger Reserves in India\nRanipur Tiger Reserve Chitrakoot, Uttar Pradesh\nSteps Taken by the Government\u00a0for Tiger Conservation\nLegal Steps\nAdministrative Steps\nFinancial Steps\nInternational Cooperation\nConservation Assured | Tiger Standards (CA|TS)\nRecent News\nUPSC Previous Year Questions on Environmental Conventions & Protocols\nTiger population in India\n\nNote: Subscribe to the ClearIAS YouTube Channel to learn more.\n\nMore than 70% of the tigers in the world are found in India. 15 different species of wild cats may be found in India, which is home to 40% of all known species. Nine of the fifteen cats are sadly threatened, vulnerable, or endangered.\nIn the past 150 years, the global tiger population has decreased by approximately 95%, placing these magnificent animals in danger of going extinct.\nThe International Union for the Conservation of Nature (IUCN) declared the tiger extinct in Vietnam, Cambodia, and Laos in July 2022.\nThe fourth iteration of India\u2019s national tiger status assessment for the years 2018\u201319 included 381,400 km2 of forested habitats spread across 20 states.\nWhen consistently sampled areas were examined from 2006 to 2018, it was found that tigers were growing in India at a rate of 6% annually. The most recent estimate puts the number of tigers at 2967.\nTiger became the national animal of India in 1973\u00a0as the lion was a national animal before.\nJim Corbett National Park was created in 1936 for tiger conservation\nClassified as\u00a0Endangered as per IUCN\u00a0Red Databook\nSchedule 1 animal\u00a0as per Wildlife Protection Act, 1972\nTiger can be killed under two conditions- Diseased or disabled beyond recovery\u00a0 and the threat to human life\nIn no case, the tiger can be declared vermin.\nList of Tiger reserves in India\nIn order to investigate the tiger population in India, the Indian government has divided the country\u2019s territory into five zones. By classifying them into these zones, it is possible to study every tiger reserve in India.\nShivalik Hills and Gangetic Plains\nCentral India and Eastern Ghats\nWestern Ghats\nNE Hills and Brahmaputra Plains\nSundarban\n2967 Tiger live in India, according to the most recent Tiger Census, which was done in 20 states across the country in 2018\u201319. Compared to the 2006 tiger census, the population growth rate of Tiger is 6% annually.\nRanipur Tiger Reserve, in the Chitrakoot district of Uttar Pradesh, is the newest of India\u2019s 54 Tiger Reserves, having been established on October 19, 2022.\nThe National Tiger Conservation Authority has named the combined territory of Guru Ghasidas National Park (Sanjay National Park) and Tamor Pingla Wildlife Sanctuary in Chhattisgarh as India\u2019s 53rd Tiger Reserve.\nMadhya pradesh with 6 tiger reserves (Maharashtra also have 6, because Pench tiger reserve is part of both Madhya Pradesh and Maharashtra), but tiger population of MP is greatest in India.\nBor tiger reserve in Maharashtra is the smallest tiger reserve in India with size of 138 sq km.\nNagarjunsagar-Srisailam Tiger Reserve (NSTR) with size of 3,728 km2.\u00a0In state of Andhra Pradesh is the Largest Tiger reserve in India.\nWhat is National Tiger Conservation Authority (NTCA)?\nThe Wildlife (Protection) Act of 1972, as revised in 2006, gives the National Tiger Conservation Jurisdiction, a statutory agency under the Ministry of Environment, Forests, and Climate Change, authority over wildlife.\n\u00a0The authority is headed by the Minister in charge of the Ministry of Environment and Forests, and its other members include three members of Parliament, the Secretary to the Ministry of Environment and Forests, and the Minister of State.\nThe mandate includes Project Tiger implementation and monitoring, tiger preservation efforts on the ground, science-based tiger and habitat monitoring utilising cutting-edge technological techniques, and financial and technical support for tiger reserves in India.\nWhat is Project Tiger?\nIn order to protect our national animal, the TIGER, India started the Project Tiger initiative in 1973.\nProject Tiger keeps an eye on 54 tiger reserves in India, which makes up roughly 2.21% of the nation\u2019s total land area.\nThe Ministry of Environment, Forests, and Climate Change\u2019s Project Tiger is a centrally sponsored programme that offers tiger reserve states in India centralised support for tiger conservation. The NTCA oversees project tiger\u2019s execution.\nTiger reserves in india are\u00a0declared by the NTCA, constituted with two components.\nCore Area\u2013 the core areas have the legal status of a national park or a sanctuary, exclusive tiger agenda is followed in the core areas.\nBuffer Area-\u00a0buffer or peripheral areas are a mix of forest and non-forest land, managed as a multiple use area, an inclusive people oriented agenda is followed in the buffer zone.\nTiger Density In India\nThe density of tigers in the Sunderbans, India, may have reached the carrying capacity, according to a new study on the area\u2019s tiger population. The Wildlife Institute of India undertook the survey in order to determine the population density in the Sunderbans.\nThe Sunderbans is a sizable region of wetlands and mangrove trees that lies on the border between Bangladesh and India. Numerous tigers and other animals reside there. Human growth and activities like fishing and timber harvesting are putting more pressure on the forests.\nTiger Density in India: Only a fixed number of tigers can coexist in a given ecosystem. Carrying capacity is the largest population that an ecosystem can sustain. The number of tigers that can coexist peacefully in a region is constrained by a variety of factors, such as food availability, habitat size, and human-tiger conflict. The number of tigers that can coexist in a given location depends on the amount of available prey.\nThe ecosystem\u2019s carrying capacity is determined by limiting constraints.\nLimiting considerations include things like food, water, oxygen, and space.\nEach ecosystem has a limited quantity of area and resources that can support life. When a species\u2019 population grows faster than its environment can support it, the ecosystem may no longer be suited for the species to exist.\nAs people and animals struggle for dwindling resources, this may result in increasing levels of human-wildlife conflict in the reserve\u2019s peripheral areas. Ecosystems must be managed in a way that doesn\u2019t drive species above their ecological limits in order to prevent such a situation from occurring.\nInternational Tiger Day\nSince 2010, the 29th of July is celebrated as Global Tiger Day.\nAt the Saint Petersburg Tiger Summit in Russia in 2010, the first International Tiger Day was established.\nThe purpose of the day is to increase public awareness of the wild tiger population\u2019s decline and to support efforts to conserve them.\nGovernments of countries with tigers pledged to double the tiger population by 2022 in a statement issued during the Saint Petersburg Tiger Summit.\nOver 70% of the world\u2019s tigers are found in India, which has 54 tiger reserves distributed over 18 states, as indicated in the article above.\nThe population of tigers increased, according to India\u2019s most recent tiger census from 2018.\nNotably, India beat the St. Petersburg Declaration on Tiger Conservation\u2019s goal of doubling the number of tigers by 4 years.\nSt Petersburg Declaration\nThe first \u201cTiger Summit\u201d took place in St. Petersburg, Russia, in November 2010.\nAt the conference, the Global Tiger Recovery Program was announced with the goal of halting the tigers\u2019 rapid population decline and tripling their numbers by 2022.\nOne of the 13 nations in the tiger range that attended the conference was India.\nThe 13 Tiger range countries are:-Bangladesh, Bhutan, Cambodia, China, India, Indonesia, Lao PDR, Malaysia, Myanmar, Nepal, Russia, Thailand and Vietnam.\nThe leaders of these\u00a0nations committed to drawing up action plan to \u2013\nIndia\u2019s tiger reserves\nStrikes against poachers\nFinancial support should be made available to sustain a healthy tiger population.\nTiger Reserves in India\n\n\ud83d\udc49 Which year are YOU targeting for success in the IAS/IPS/IFS Exam? \ud83d\ude80\n\n(1) \u21d2 UPSC 2025: Prelims cum Mains\n\n(2) \u21d2 UPSC 2026: Prelims cum Mains\n\n(3) \u21d2 UPSC 2027 Prelims cum Mains\n\nTip: Know more about ClearIAS Courses (Online/Offline)\n\n\tState\tName of Tiger Reserve\tTotal area (sq. km.)\n1\tUttarakhand\tRajaji\t1075.17\n2\tUttarakhand\tCorbett\t1288.31\n3\tUttar Pradesh\tPilibhit\t730.24\n4\tUttar Pradesh\tRanipur\t529.89\n5\tUttar Pradesh\tDudhwa\t2201.77\n6\tBihar\tValmiki\t899.38\n7\tAndhra Pradesh\tNagarjunsagar Srisailam\t3296.31\n8\tChhattisgarh\tAchankamar\t914.01\n9\tChhattisgarh\tIndravati\t2799.07\n10\tChhattisgarh\tUdanti Sitanadi\t1842.54\n11\tJharkhand\tPalamau\t1129.93\n12\tMadhya Pradesh\tVeerangana Durgavati\t2339.12\n13\tMadhya Pradesh\tBandhavgarh\t1598.1\n14\tMadhya Pradesh\tKanha\t2051.79\n15\tMadhya Pradesh\tPanna\t1578.55\n16\tMadhya Pradesh\tPench\t1179.63\n17\tMadhya Pradesh\tSatpura\t2133.30\n18\tMadhya Pradesh\tSanjay Dubri\t1674.50\n19\tMaharashtra\tBor\t138.12\n20\tMaharashtra\tMelghat\t2768.52\n21\tMaharashtra\tNawegaon-Nagzira\t653.67\n22\tMaharashtra\tPench\t741.22\n23\tMaharashtra\tSahyadri\t1165.57\n24\tMaharashtra\tTadoba-Andhari\t1727.59\n25\tOdisha\tSatkosia\t963.87\n26\tOdisha\tSimilipal\t2750\n27\tRajasthan\tMukandra Hills\t759.99\n28\tRajasthan\tRanthambore\t1411.29\n29\tRajasthan\tSariska\t1213.34\n30\tRajasthan\tRamgarh Vishdhari\t1052.12\n31\tTelangana\tAmrabad\t2611.39\n32\tTelangana\tKawal\t2019.12\n33\tKarnataka\tBandipur\t1456.3\n34\tKarnataka\tBhadra\t1064.29\n35\tKarnataka\tBiligiri Ranganatha Temple\t574.82\n36\tKarnataka\tDandeli Anshi\t1097.51\n37\tKarnataka\tNagarhole\t1205.76\n38\tKerala\tParambikulam\t643.66\n39\tKerala\tPeriyar\t925\n40\tTamil Nadu\tAnamalai\t1479.87\n41\tTamil Nadu\tKalakad Mundanthurai.

The presence of their pugmarks indicates that tigers from the surrounding Panna region frequent this area. Only 150 kilometres separate the two protected areas.\nRanipur Tiger Reserve is a crucial corridor for tigers\u2019 migration, according to the National Tiger Conservation Authority\u2019s assessment on the status of tigers, co-predators, and prey in India (NTCA).\nThe tiger reserve spans a total of 529.89 square kilometres (km2), including a 230 km2 core area that was established as the Ranipur Wildlife Sanctuary in 1977 and a 299.58 km2 buffer zone.\nNumerous creatures live in the tropical dry deciduous woods of the Ranipur Tiger Reserve, including tigers, leopards, sloth bears, spotted deer, sambhar, and chinkara, as well as other birds and reptiles.\nSteps Taken by the Government\u00a0for Tiger Conservation\n\nThe Indian government has made numerous efforts to preserve tigers.\n\nLegal Steps\nIn order to create the National Tiger Conservation Authority and the Tiger and Other Endangered Species Crime Control Bureau, the Wild Life (Protection) Act, 1972 was amended to become the Wild Life (Protection) Act, 2006.\nIncreased penalties for crimes committed in a tiger reserve or its main area\nAdministrative Steps\nStepping up efforts to combat ant poaching, including developing a unique monsoon patrolling plan.\nThe creation of the Tiger Conservation Foundation and state-level steering committees presided over by chief ministers.\nForming a special force to protect tigers (STPF)\nFinancial Steps\nUnder a number of Centrally Sponsored Schemes, including Project Tiger and Integrated Development of Wildlife Habitats, the States receive financial and technical assistance.\nInternational Cooperation\nIndia and Nepal have a bilateral agreement on preventing transboundary illegal wildlife trade.\nIndia and China have agreed to a tiger conservation protocol.\nIndia and Bangladesh have a conservation agreement for the Royal Bengal Tiger.\nIn collaboration with the Russian Federation, a sub-group on tiger and leopard conservation has been established.\nThere has been established a Global Tiger Forum of Tiger Range Countries to address global concerns about tiger conservation.\nIndia is a CITES member.\nAccording to CITES\u2019 historic ruling, \u201ctigers shall not be bred for trade in their parts or derivatives.\u201d\nConservation Assured | Tiger Standards (CA|TS)\nA set of standards called CA|TS enables tiger sites to determine whether their management will successfully advance tiger conservation.\nSeven organising pillars and 17 important management activity components make up CA|TS.\nExperts in tigers and protected areas created CA|TS.\nWith its official introduction in 2013, CA|TS is a crucial component of Tx2, a global initiative to double the number of wild tigers by the year 2022.\n\u201cProviding safe havens for tigers is the long-term objective of CA|TS.\u201d\nRecent News\n\n2024: The Supreme Court said that continuing mining activities within a radius of one km from the boundaries of critical tiger reserves would be in contempt of court.\n\nThe apex court had in its April 26, 2023 verdict directed that mining within a national park and wildlife sanctuary and an area of one km from their boundary shall not be permissible.\nUPSC Previous Year Questions on Environmental Conventions & Protocols\n\nKind of questions that are asked in Prelims with reference to Tiger reserves in India\n\n1.

All the states that have ratified the original convention are not required to abide by the modifications made by protocols.\n\nWhat is Ramsar Convention?\nAn international agreement known as the Ramsar Convention on Wetlands was signed in 1971 in the Iranian city of Ramsar, which is located along the southern shore of the Caspian Sea.\nFor India, it went into effect in 1982.\nWetlands that are significant internationally are designated as Ramsar sites.\nThe goal of the Convention is to contribute to global sustainable development by conserving and wisely using all wetlands through local, national, and international collaboration.\nThe List of Wetlands of International Importance includes wetlands, and the Montreux Record is a list of those wetlands where ecological characteristics have changed, are changing, or are likely to change as a result of human activity such as technological advancements, pollution, or other interference. It is kept up as a component of the Ramsar\nIn India, there will be 54 declared wetlands as of 2022.\nCurrently, Loktak Lake and Keoladeo National Park (Rajasthan) are the only two wetlands from India to appear in the Montreux Record (Manipur).\nKhijadia Wildlife Sanctuary in Gujarat and Bakhira Wildlife Sanctuary in UP were recognised as two new Ramsar sites (Wetlands of International Importance) in honour of World Wetlands\nDay 2022, which is observed on February 2nd each year.\nWhat is Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora?\nStates and regional economic integration groups voluntarily accede to CITES, an international pact.\nIt was created in response to a decision made by the International Union for Conservation of Nature\u2019s members in 1963 during a meeting (IUCN).\nCITES became operative in July 1975.\nThere are 184 Parties as of right now (including countries or regional economic integration organizations).\nIt tries to make sure that the survival of wild animals and plants is not endangered by international trade in their specimens.\nThe United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP) is in charge of running the CITES Secretariat, which is based in Geneva, Switzerland.\nIt aids in the coordination, advice, and support functions of the Convention.\nThe Conference of the Parties (COP) to CITES, which is made up of all of the Convention\u2019s Parties, is the highest decision-making body.\nCITES is a binding agreement between the Parties, although national laws still apply.\nInstead, it offers a framework that each Party must adhere to in order to ensure that CITES is put into effect at the national level. Each Party is required to develop its own domestic law to do this.\nWhat is Bonn Convention?\nThe Convention of Migratory Species of Wild Animals is another name for it (CMS). It is the sole treaty that addresses taking or gathering wild-caught species. 173 migratory species from all over the world are currently protected by it.\nThe 13th COP of the CMS was held in Gandhinagar, Gujarat, on Indian soil from February 17\u201322, 2020.\nIn 1983, the Convention became operative. In 1984, the Secretariat that runs the Convention was created.\nThe Convention had 133 Parties as of November 1st, 2019.\nThe Convention has\u00a0two Appendices:\nAppendix I:\u00a0Lists migratory species that are endangered or threatened with extinction.\nAppendix II:\u00a0Lists migratory species which have unfavourable conservation status and which require international agreements for their conservation and management.\nAccording to CMS, States have a responsibility to safeguard any species that resides inside or passes through their territorial or legal authority.\nWhat is International Union for Conservation of Nature?\nIUCN is a membership organisation that is exclusively made up of governmental and non-governmental organisations.\nIt was founded in 1948 and is the foremost expert on the state of the environment and the steps that must be taken to protect it.\nIts main office is in Switzerland.\nThe world\u2019s most thorough inventory of the global conservation status of plant and animal species is the IUCN Red List of Threatened Species.\nIt assesses the likelihood of species extinction using a set of quantitative criteria. All global regions and the majority of species are affected by these criteria.\nThe extinction danger of a species is determined by the IUCN Red List Categories. There are nine categories, ranging from Extinct to Not Evaluated (NE) (EX). Species that are regarded to be in risk of going extinct include those that are Critically Endangered (CR), Endangered (EN), and Vulnerable (VU).\nIt is regarded as the most reliable resource for information on the state of biological diversity.\nIt serves as a crucial indicator for both the Aichi (Biodiversity) Targets and the Sustainable Developmental Goals (SDGs).\nWhat is Global Tiger Forum?\nThe GTF is the only intergovernmental organisation created with participants from willing nations to launch a global campaign to safeguard the tiger.\nOn the advice of a global conference on tiger conservation held in New Delhi, India, it was established in 1993.\nIt\u2019s in India\u2019s capital city of New Delhi.\nWhat is Rio Earth Summit?\nThe United Nations Conference on Environment and Development (UNCED), which took place in Rio de Janeiro in June 1992, is sometimes known by this name.\nThe Earth Summit served as a forum for Member States to coordinate conservation initiatives.\nRio Declaration on Environment and Development, Agenda 2, and Forest Principles are significant results.\nThe Rio Declaration set forth 27 guiding principles for the future sustainable development of nations. It was endorsed by more than 175 nations.\nWhat is United Nations Convention to Combat Desertification (UNCCD)?\nIn order to safeguard a more secure, fair, and sustainable future, UNCCD was founded in 1994.\nIt is the only structure created by law that addresses the causes and impacts of desertification and drought.\nThe UNCCD\u2019s COP15 was recently held in Cote d\u2019Ivoire, and the Union Minister for Environment, Forests and Climate Change of India spoke there (Western Africa).\nThe Convention has 197 Parties, including the European Union and 196 nation Parties (EU).\nThe Convention is a global agreement to reduce the effects of land degradation and safeguard the land in order to ensure that all people have access to food, water, shelter, and economic opportunity. It is built on the concepts of participation, cooperation, and decentralisation.\nTo repair and manage the world\u2019s land, the Convention brings together governments, scientists, politicians, the commercial sector, and communities.\nWhat is United Nations Framework Convention On Climatic Change (UNFCCC)?\nA global environmental pact addressing climate change is the UNFCC.\nAccords were negotiated and signed in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, in June 1992 at the UN (CED) Conference on Environment and Development (Earth Summit).\nHeadquartered in Bonn; entered into effect on March 21, 1994; 197 parties.\nThe goal is to maintain atmospheric greenhouse gas (GHG) concentrations at a level that prevents harmful human involvement with the climate system.\nInitially, it did not have any mechanisms for enforcement and did not impose any legally enforceable caps on national GHG emissions.\nThis approach was used to negotiate the Kyoto Protocol (1997).\nThe UNFCCC Climate-Tech Centre Network, which serves as the organization\u2019s operational arm, is governed by the COP. It encourages technology transfer for low-carbon and climate-resilient development.\nWhat is United Nations Convention On Biodiversity (UNCBD)?\nA multinational agreement with legal force. UNCBD adopted in the 1992 Rio de Janeiro Earth Summit.\n1993 entry into effect; 196 countries have ratified; secretariat in Montreal, Canada.\nThe USA has signed the agreement but has not yet ratified it.\nFor the first time, it acknowledged that humankind as a whole shares a concern for biological variety conservation.\nThe goals are to preserve biological diversity, utilise biological resources (or its components) sustainably, and share gains from the utilisation of genetic resources fairly and equally.\nIn December 2010, the UN named the years 2011 through 2020 the \u201cUnited Nations Decade on Biodiversity.\u201d\nIndia passed the \u201cBiological Diversity Act\u201d in 2002 to put the CBD\u2019s requirements into practise.\nWhat is United Nations Environmental Programme?\nA worldwide environmental authority known as UNEP (UN Environment) supports the consistent application of the environmental dimension of sustainable development within the framework of the United Nations.\nFollowing the United Nations Conference on the Human Environment (Stockholm Conference) in June 1972, it was established by the UN General Assembly (UNGA).\nIn order to evaluate climate change based on the most recent scientific findings, UNEP and the World Meteorological Organization (WMO) founded the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) in 1988.\nThe UNEP has been instrumental in the creation of global environmental agreements ever since its founding (MEAs).\nUNEP now hosts the secretariats for the following nine MEAs:\nConvention on Biological Diversity (CBD)\nConvention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora (CITES)\nConvention on the Conservation of Migratory Species of Wild Animals (CMS)\nVienna Convention for the Protection of the Ozone Layer\nMinamata Convention on Mercury\nBasel Convention on the Control of Trans-boundary Movements of Hazardous Wastes and Their Disposal\nStockholm Convention on Persistent Organic Pollutants\nRotterdam Convention on the Prior Informed Consent Procedure for Certain Hazardous Chemicals and Pesticides in International Trade.\nWhat is Montreal Protocol\nIt relates to the elements that weaken the ozone layer and is a protocol to the Vienna Convention.

In 1971, an international treaty for wetlands conservation and sustainable use was signed at Ramsar. The Convention\u2019s mission is \u201cthe conservation and wise use of all wetlands\u00a0through local and national actions and international cooperation, as a contribution towards achieving sustainable development throughout the world\u201d.\n\nMore than 2300 wetlands of international importance!\n\nToday, the Ramsar List is the world\u2019s largest network of protected areas.\nThere are currently over 2,300 Ramsar Sites around the world. They cover over 2.5 million square kilometres, an area larger than Mexico.\nThe world\u2019s first Site was the Cobourg Peninsula in Australia, designated in 1974.\nThe largest Sites are Ngiri-Tumba-Maindombe in the Democratic Republic of Congo and Queen Maud Gulf in Canada; these Sites each cover over 60,000 square kilometres.\nThe countries with the most Sites are the United Kingdom with 175 and Mexico with 142.\nBolivia has the most significant area with 148,000 km2 under Ramsar protection.\nSignificance of being designated a Ramsar Site\nThese wetland areas are listed on the Convention\u2019s List of Wetlands of International Importance as Ramsar sites once they have received the designation.\nWhen a wetland is designated as a Ramsar site, nations commit to establishing and maintaining a management framework for its preservation and responsible usage.\nThe Convention defines smart to use as maintaining the ecological integrity of a wetland.\nThe List of Wetlands of International Importance includes wetlands based on their ecological, botanical, zoological, limnological, or hydrological importance.\nRamsar Convention on Wetlands\n\nThe first contemporary international, intergovernmental environmental treaty is the Convention on Wetlands.\n\nThe convention was negotiated throughout the 1960s by nations and non-governmental organisations who were worried about the growing destruction and loss of migratory waterbird habitats.\nRamsar is a full partner in the \u201cbiodiversity-related cluster\u201d of treaties and accords even though it is not a member of the Multilateral Environmental Agreements (MEAs) system of the United Nations.\nA Contracting Party must nominate at least one location for the Ramsar List of Wetlands of International Importance when it joins the Convention (the \u201cRamsar List\u201d).\nA site is given the distinction of international recognition when it is added to the Ramsar List, and the government expresses its commitment to take all necessary action to guarantee the ecological character of the site is protected.\nThe Convention works together with a wide range of international partners to accomplish its objectives. Among them are important private enterprises, international and national non-governmental organisations, as well as global conventions and agencies.\nThe first Site in the world was established in 1974 on the Cobourg Peninsula in Australia.\nThe largest Sites, each comprising more than 60,000 square kilometres, are Rio Negro in Brazil (120,000 square kilometres), Ngiri-Tumba-Maindombe in the Democratic Republic of the Congo, and Queen Maud Gulf in Canada.\nThe United Kingdom (175) and Mexico have the most Sites (142).\nWith 148,000 square kilometres, Bolivia is the country with the most land declared for protection under the Convention; over 100,000 square kilometres each have been designated by Canada, Chad, Congo, and the Russian Federation.\n\nAlso read: Ramsar sites (Wetlands) in India: Memorize faster\n\n\ud83d\udc49 Which year are YOU targeting for success in the IAS/IPS/IFS Exam? \ud83d\ude80\n\n(1) \u21d2 UPSC 2025: Prelims cum Mains\n\n(2) \u21d2 UPSC 2026: Prelims cum Mains\n\n(3) \u21d2 UPSC 2027 Prelims cum Mains\n\nTip: Know more about ClearIAS Courses (Online/Offline)\n\nRamsar Convention: Structure\n\nThe structure of the Ramsar convention is as follows:\n\nConference of the Parties Contracting: This body, which governs the convention, is composed of all the countries that have ratified the pact.\nThis highest authority evaluates the convention\u2019s development, sets new priorities, and assigns participants work schedules.\nIn addition, the COP has the authority to amend the convention, create expert advisory bodies, review member-nation progress reports, and collaborate with other international organisations and agreements.\nThe Standing Committee is the intercessional executive body that represents the COP in between its triennial meetings, as determined by the COP\u2019s decisions.\nThe contracting parties that make up the Standing Committee are chosen to serve three-year terms at each COP meeting.\nThe Conference of Contracting Parties, the Standing Committee, and the Ramsar Secretariat receive recommendations from the Scientific and Technical Review Panel on scientific and technical issues (STRP).\nSecretary of State: The Secretariat oversees the daily coordination of the convention\u2019s activities. Its base of operations is in Gland, Switzerland, which also serves as the IUCN\u2019s global headquarters.\nWith the assistance of the international organisation partners and on the recommendation of the subsidiary expert body, the Scientific and Technical Review Panel (STRP), the Conference of Contracting Parties, the Standing Committee, and the Secretariat continue to collaborate in order to implement the Ramsar Convention (IOPs).\nThree pillars of the Ramsar Convention\n\nUnder the \u201cthree pillars\u201d of the Convention, the Contracting Parties commit to:\n\nWork towards the wise use of all their wetlands;\nDesignate suitable wetlands for the list of Wetlands of International Importance (the \u201cRamsar List\u201d) and ensure their effective management;\nCooperate internationally on transboundary wetlands, shared wetland systems and shared species.\nThe Montreux Record\n\nThe Montreux Record is a register of wetland sites on the List of Wetlands of International Importance where changes in ecological character have occurred, are occurring, or are likely to occur as a result of technological developments, pollution or other human interference. It is maintained as part of the Ramsar List.\n\nRamsar Sites in India\n\nIndia is one of the Contracting Parties to the Ramsar Convention, signed in Ramsar, Iran, in 1971. India signed it on 1st Feb 1982. From 1982 to 2013, a total of 26 sites were added to the list of Ramsar sites, however, during 2014 to 2022, the country has added 49 new wetlands to the list of Ramsar sites.\n\nIn 2022, India added 11 more wetlands to the list of Ramsar sites to make the total number of Ramsar sites 75 covering an area of 13,26,677 ha. Tamil Nadu has the maximum no. of Ramsar sites (14 nos), followed by UP (10 nos).\n\nIn 2024, five more Indian wetlands have been added to the global list of wetlands of international importance under the Ramsar Convention, taking the total number of such highly recognized waterlogged ecosystems in the country to 80.\n\nThe wetlands added are Magadi Kere Conservation Reserve, Ankasamudra Bird Conservation Reserve, and Aghanashini Estuary from Karnataka; and Karaivetti Bird Sanctuary and Longwood Shola Reserve Forest from Tamil Nadu.\n\nJune 2024: India marked World Environment Day by designating Nagi Bird Sanctuary and Nakti Bird Sanctuary as its newest Wetlands of International Importance.\n\nThese \u201cRamsar Sites\u201d are both man-made reservoirs situated in the Jhajha forest range of Jamui District in Bihar, India.\nThese additions take the total tally to 82 in India.\n\nAugust 2024:\u00a0India has added three more Ramsar sites to the network, taking the tally to 85.\n\nNanjarayan Bird Sanctuary and Kazhuveli Bird Sanctuary in Tamil Nadu and Tawa Reservoir of Madhya Pradesh have been added to India\u2019s Ramsar sites list.\nRamsar sites (Wetlands) in India: State-wise compilation\n\nRamsar sites in India are listed below:\n\nState/Union Territories\n\t\nRamsar Wetland sites\n\n\nJammu and Kashmir\n\t\n\nHokera Wetland\n\nSurinsar- Mansar lakes\n\nWular lake\n\nTsomoriri Lake\n\nHygam Wetland Conservation Reserve\n\nShallbugh Wetland Conservation Reserve\n\n\n\nUT of Ladakh\n\t\n\u00a0Tso Kar Wetland Complex\n\n\nPunjab\n\t\nBeas Conservation Reserve\n\nHarike Wetlands\n\nKanjli Wetland\n\nKeshopur-Miani Community Reserve\n\nNangal Wildlife Sanctuary\n\nRopar Wetland\n\n\n\nHimachal Pradesh\n\n\u00a0\n\n\t\n\u00a0Chandra Taal\n\nPong Dam Lake\n\nRenuka lake\n\n\n\nUttarakhand\n\t\nAsan Barrage\n\n\nRajasthan\n\n\u00a0\n\n\t\nKeoladeo National Park\n\nSambhar Lake\n\n\n\nUttar Pradesh\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\n\n\t\nNawabganj Bird Sanctuary\n\nParvati Agra Bird Sanctuary\n\nSaman Bird Sanctuary\n\nSamaspur Bird Sanctuary\n\nSandi Bird Sanctuary\n\nSarsai Nawar Jheel\n\nSur Sarovar\n\nUpper-Ganga River (Brijghat to Narora Stretch)\n\nHaiderpur Wetland\n\nBakhira Wildlife Sanctuary\n\n\n\nBihar\n\t\nKanwar Lake or Kabal Taal\n\nNagi Bird Sanctuary\n\nNakti Bird Sanctuary\n\n\n\nWest Bengal\n\n\u00a0\n\n\t\nEast Kolkata Wetlands\n\nSunderban Wetland\n\n\n\nOdisha\n\n\u00a0\n\n\t\nChilika Lake\n\nBhitarkanika Mangroves\n\nSatkosia Gorge\n\nTampara Lake\n\nHirakud Reservoir\n\nAnsupa Lake\n\nYashwant Sagar\n\n\n\nMadhya Pradesh\n\n\u00a0\n\n\t\nBhoj Wetlands\n\nSirpur wetland\n\nSakhya Sagar\n\nYashwant Sagar\n\nTawa Reservoir\n\n\n\nGujarat\n\t\n\u00a0Nalsarovar Bird sanctuary\n\nThol Lake Wildlife Sanctuary\n\nWadhvana Wetland\n\nKhijadia Wildlife Sanctuary\n\n\n\nMaharashtra\n\t\nNandur Madhameshwar\n\nLonar Lake\n\nThane Creek\n\n\n\nAndhra Pradesh\n\t\nKolleru lake\n\n\nTamil Nadu\n\n\u00a0\n\n\t\nPoint Calimere Wildlife and Bird Sanctuary\n\nKoonthankulam Bird Sanctuary\n\nKarikili Bird Sanctuary\n\nPallikaranai Marsh Reserve Forest\n\nPichavaram Mangrove\n\nGulf of Mannar Marine Biosphere Reserve\n\nVembannur Wetland Complex\n\nVellode Bird Sanctuary\n\nVedanthangal Bird Sanctuary\n\nUdhayamarthandapuram Bird Sanctuary\n\nChitrangudi Bird Sanctuary\n\nSuchindram Theroor Wetland Complex\n\nVaduvur Bird Sanctuary\n\nKanjirankulam Bird Sanctuary\n\nKaraivetti Bird Sanctuary\n\nLongwood Shola Reserve Forest\n\nNanjarayan Bird Sanctuary\n\nKazhuveli Bird Sanctuary\n\n\n\nKerala\n\t\nVembanad Kol Wetland\n\nSasthamkotta lake\n\nAshtamudi Wetland\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\nAssam\n\t\n\u00a0Deepor Beel\n\n\nTripura\n\t\nRudrasagar Lake\n\n\nManipur\n\t\nLoktak lake\n\n\nHaryana\n\t\nSultanpur National Park\n\nBhindawas Wildlife Sanctuary\n\n\n\nKarnataka\n\t\nRanganathituu BS\n\nMagadi Kere Conservation Reserve\n\nAnkasamudra Bird Conservation Reserve\n\nAghanashini Estuary\n\n\n\nGoa\n\t\nNanda Lake\n\n\nMizoram\n\t\n\u00a0Pala wetland\nInteresting facts about Ramsar\u00a0Convention/Sites\nThe number of contracting parties is 171.\nAt the time of joining the Convention, each Contracting Party undertakes to designate at least one wetland site for inclusion in the list of Wetlands of International Importance.\nThe inclusion of a \u201cRamsar Site\u201d in the List embodies the government\u2019s commitment to take the steps necessary to ensure that its ecological character is maintained.\nWetlands included in the List acquire a new national and international status: they are recognized as being of significant value not only for the country or the countries in which they are located but for humanity as a whole.\nThere are\u00a0nine criteria for identifying wetlands of international importance.\nThere are six Ramsar regions.\nThe\u00a02nd of February each\u00a0year is World Wetlands Day, marking the date of the adoption of the Convention on Wetlands on 2 February 1971.\nThe Ramsar Sites Information Service (RSIS) is a searchable database which provides information on each Ramsar Site.\nThe Ramsar Convention works closely with six other organisations known as International Organization Partners (IOPs).

Territorial waters and areas included in forest reserves are exempt from this rule.\nIt is a secure environment for animals with the primary objective of giving the animals a healthy life with ease because they are such an important component of our ecosystem.\nNumerous wildlife sanctuaries are home to massive mountains, thickly forested areas, and lengthy rivers that provide animals with water.\nThe Sanctuary was created to conserve, enhance, or develop wildlife or its surroundings. People who reside in the Sanctuary may be awarded specific rights.\nWhat are Wildlife Sanctuaries in India?\nGeographically speaking, a wildlife sanctuary is a protected region where wildlife is safeguarded (preserved). Its objective is to safeguard various animal species from poaching, competition, hunting, and other threats.\nThe State Government may designate some areas as wildlife sanctuaries under the Wild Life (Protection) Act of 1972 if they are thought to be of significant ecological, geomorphological, and natural value.\nIUCN Category IV protected areas, India\u2019s wildlife sanctuaries cover 122564.86 km2 or 3.73% of the country\u2019s total land area. There are 567 wildlife sanctuaries in the country.\nIndia\u2019s wildlife sanctuaries enjoy a special position in the globe thanks to the country\u2019s second-largest biodiversity base. Numerous endangered animals and bird species can be found living in these serene wildlife areas.\nThe Collector may also permit the continuation of any person\u2019s entitlement to any land within the Sanctuary while the resolution of claims before officially notifying the Sanctuary after consulting with the Chief Wildlife Warden.\nManas National Park or Manas Wildlife Sanctuary in Assam, India, is the first sanctuary or national park to be established in the country. It serves as a national park, UNESCO Natural World Heritage site, Project Tiger reserve, elephant reserve, and biosphere reserve all in one.\nThe largest wildlife sanctuary in India is the Ranthambore National Park, which is situated in the state of Rajasthan. It serves as a tiger national reserve.\nThe smallest wildlife preserve in the world is called the \u201cBor Tiger reserve.\u201d It was founded in 1970 in Maharashtra. The Bor Tiger Reserve Sanctuary is spread out over a total area of 121.1 km2.\n\nAlso read: Project Elephant: All About Elephants\n\nProvisions for Wildlife Sanctuary\n\nThere are some provisions

Government\nIf the State Government determines that a particular area has sufficient ecological, faunal, floral, geomorphological, natural, or zoological significance for conserving, enhancing, or developing wildlife or its environment, it may notify the public of its intention to create a sanctuary there.\nThe State Government may issue a notification detailing the borders of the sanctuary and stating that the indicated region shall be a sanctuary as of the date mentioned in the notification after the original notification has been issued and the deadline for filing claims has passed.\nDeclaration by Central Government\nIf the Central Government determines that a particular region has sufficient ecological, faunal, floral, geomorphological, natural, or zoological significance to preserve, develop, or propagate wildlife or its habitat, it may notify the public that the place is a sanctuary.\nBoundaries of the Wildlife Sanctuary\nThe notification must be as specific as feasible in describing the issue and the area\u2019s borders.\nWhen territorial waters are involved, the limits must be decided in conjunction with the Chief Naval Hydrographer of the Central Government after sufficient steps have been made to safeguard the professional interests of nearby fishermen.\nA sanctuary\u2019s limits cannot be altered without the National Board for Wild Life\u2019s approval.\nTerritorial seas in regions designated as sanctuaries for the preservation of offshore marine flora and fauna were included in the Amendment Act of 1991.\nSettlement of Rights\nThe State Government shall make alternate arrangements for making fuel, fodder, and other forest produce available to persons affected by their rights.\nAccording to the Act, the State Government chooses an individual to serve as a \u201cCollector,\u201d who is tasked with investigating and establishing the existence, nature, and scope of any person\u2019s rights in or over the land included in the sanctuary that needs to be notified.\nAfter the issuing of a notice for the declaration of the Protected Area, no right may be acquired in, on, or over the land included within the boundaries of the area designated in such notification, except through succession, testamentary or intestate.\nClaim of Rights\nThe Collector must issue an order admitting or rejecting the claim in full or in part if there is a claim to a right in or over any of the aforementioned lands.\nIf such a claim is partially or fully accepted, the Collector has two options:\nExclude such land from the proposed sanctuary\u2019s boundaries or proceed to acquire such land or rights unless such owner or holder has agreed to surrender his rights in or over such land to the Government in exchange for such compensation as provided in the Land Acquisition Act, 1894, under an agreement between such owner or holder and the Government.\nEnable the continuation of any person\u2019s right to any land inside the bounds of the sanctuary after consulting with the Chief Wild Life Warden.\nEntry into a Protected Area\nNo one else except:\nA public servant on the job\nA person who has been granted permission to reside within the boundaries of the sanctuary by the Chief Wild Life Warden or an authorised officer.\nA person who has any right to immovable property within the sanctuary\u2019s boundaries.\nA person travelling on a public highway through the sanctuary.\nThe dependents of the person referred to in clauses (a), (b), or (c) above\nExcept as provided under and by the terms of the permission issued, no one is allowed to enter or live in the sanctuary.\nGrant of Permit for Entry\nThe Chief Wild Life Warden may, upon request, authorise any individual to visit or stay in a sanctuary for all or all of the following purposes:\ninvestigation or study of wildlife and related purposes\nphotography\nscientific research\ntourism\ntransaction of lawful business with any person residing in the sanctuary\nAll Protected Areas are under the direction, management, and maintenance of the Chief Wild Life Warden.\nOn issues relating to activity limits in certain regions, as well as on the creation and management of sanctuaries, the National Board for Wild Life may offer recommendations.\nOn the creation and administration of protected areas, the State Board for Wild Life shall provide advice to the State Government.\nImportance of Wildlife Sanctuaries\n\nBecause they provide numerous benefits for both people and nature, sanctuaries serve as a natural resource that must be protected at all costs.\n\nHelp Preserve Wildlife\nSince it takes time and money to relocate endangered species, they are preserved in their native habitat where they can be watched over, reproduce, and increase in population while still being under the close supervision of the sanctuary.\nBiologists and other researchers can learn more about the traits and behaviours of the animals by visiting these sanctuaries.\nFurthermore, because they are in their native environment, they are unrestricted in their movement and are free to roam.\nHelp with Landscape Protection\nForests are going extinct. Previously, we could only see trees in our immediate surroundings; currently, we only saw buildings. To create space for settlements, cities, and villages, these forests were removed.\nThe forests in these protected regions, however, are conserved and allowed to grow naturally rather than being cut down.\nAdditionally, this helps to preserve natural features like rivers, valleys, waterfalls, hills, and mountains.\nDue to protection, they are shielded from exploitation, development, and pollution.\nContribute to the Preservation of Culture and History\nSome tribes that have lived there for millennia also call the woodlands that these sanctuaries occupy home. Additionally, tribes that live in woods, like the Saara adivasis in Odisha, support the preservation of those forests.\nBecause they do not have to contend with developers who would otherwise destroy the forest, the tribes that reside in these sanctuaries are likewise protected. Additionally, this helps to preserve their customs and culture.\nEndangered Species Protection\nMany plant and animal species are on the edge of extinction as a result of our habits and wants.\nSanctuaries offer us a secure setting wherever human activities can not negatively impact nature and wherein nature can develop unhindered by humans.\nBiodiversity Conservation\nThe number of habitats, ecosystems, and species diversity on Earth has been declining as a result of human activity.\nSanctuaries protect an area from humans and their activities that could damage the ecology, assisting in the conservation of all biodiversity there.\nIn-situ conservation, which maintains the ecosystem in its original state and configuration, is another term for this sort of conservation.\nEcotourism\nEcotourism is the practice of visiting environmentally significant locations with the goal of observing and contributing to the protection of animals.\nAnimals can be viewed by the general public in their natural habitat, cage-free, with their young, and without concern about their safety.\nOne of the main benefits of ecotourism is that admission fees can be utilised to raise money for conservation efforts. The refuge can then be developed using this money.\nEducation and Public Use\nThe benefits of sanctuaries are not commonly known to the general public.\nBut more and more individuals are learning about sanctuaries and joining the committees that support their implementation.\nCelebrities who adopt animals and start charities in support of sanctuaries both in India and throughout the world also help to spread awareness.\nSteps Taken for the Protection of Wildlife Sanctuaries\nTo save plant and animal species, the government created the \u00a0Wildlife Protection Act in 1972.\nThis law forbade the killing of animals for sport and prevented the legal preservation of their habitats.\nThe federal and state governments have created numerous wildlife sanctuaries and national parks to conserve forests and wildlife.\nThe government has started a variety of initiatives to protect threatened animals including the one-horned rhino and the tiger.\nA collaborative management scheme has been implemented by the government.

Exposure for more that 8 hours to constant noise 85dB may be hazardous.\nStatistics\nAs per UNEP Annual Frontier Report 2022, Dhaka has been ranked as the noisiest city in the world which is followed by Moradabad, Uttar Pradesh. Five Indian cities have been ranked in this list of being among the noisiest cities in the world which are Asansol, Jaipur, Kolkata, New Delhi, and Moradabad.\nAccording to the WHO: About 1.1 billion young people (aged between 12\u037435 years) are at risk of hearing loss due to exposure to noise.\nLong-term exposure to environmental noise contributes to 12,000 premature deaths annually in Europe.\nCauses of noise pollution\nIndustrialization:\nThe growing industries in urban areas are a major cause of noise pollution these days which use various machines that are capable of generating a large amount of noise.\nImproper Planning of Urban Areas:\nImproper and poor urban planning plays a major role in creating noise pollution, mostly in developing countries due to congested houses, small space, poor parking facilities and frequent fights over basic amenities which disrupts the environment of society.\nSocial Events:\nIn several social events, songs are often played on full volume by the people which makes the living condition pretty worse thus creating noise pollution. Weddings, public gatherings involve loudspeakers to play music resulting in the production of unwanted noise in the neighbourhood.\nVehicles and transportation:\nIncreased number of vehicles on the roads is one of the reasons for noise pollution.\nFor example, traffic jams, underground trains, aircraft, etc produces heavy noise which may lead to a situation of hearing disability.\nConstruction Sites:\nVarious construction activities which include mining, construction of bridges, dams, buildings, etc contributes greatly to creating noise pollution.\nAgriculture:\nAgricultural machines such as tractors, trolleys, harvesters creates louder noises >> and most of farmers are unaware of its adverse health consequences\nEffects of noise pollution\n1. Health Issues\nHypertension:\nLonger exposure to loud noise result in elevated blood levels which can cause hypertension in humans.\nHearing Disability:\nConstant exposure to loud noise which is beyond the range of normal sound intensity can damage the eardrums, thus resulting in hearing disability.\nSleeping disorders:\nNoise pollution can also affect the sleep cycle of an individual which may lead to sleeping disorder, low energy level and fatigue.\nCardiovascular issues:\nLoud noises also results in an increase in normal blood pressure level and causes several cardiovascular diseases in a normal person.\nMental disorders\nHigher prevalence of mental disorders have been observed in people living in crowded areas and areas that are prone to a high level of noise pollution\nSocio-economic issues:\nSince noise pollution leads to sleep disturbance and health issues >> it affects the individual\u2019s work performance during the day >> it leads to poor labour productivity.\nIt also negatively affects school performance in children.\nCommunication troubles:\nHigh decibel noise can put trouble and may not allow two people to communicate freely. Constant sharp noise can give you a severe headache and disturb emotional balance.\nDamages buildings:\nNoise has harmful effects on non-living materials too.\nNumerous examples can be cited where old buildings and even new constructions have developed cracks under the stress of explosive sounds.\nChild development:\nChildren appear to be more sensitive to noise pollution, and a number of noise-pollution-related diseases and dysfunctions are known to affect children, from hearing impairment to psychological and physical effects.\nEffects on Wildlife and Marine Life\nOur oceans are no longer quiet. Thousands of oil drills, sonars, seismic survey devices, coastal recreational watercraft and shipping vessels are now populating our waters, and that is a serious cause of noise pollution for marine life.\nWhales are among the most affected, as their hearing helps them orient themselves, feed and communicate.\nNoise pollution thus interferes with cetaceans\u2019 (whales and dolphins) feeding habits, reproductive patterns and migration routes, and can even cause hemorrhage and death.\nOther than marine life, land animals are also affected by noise pollution in the form of traffic, firecrackers etc., and birds are especially affected by the increased air traffic.\nInitiatives:\nCentral Pollution Control Board (CPCB):\nThe CPCB is mandated to track noise levels, set standards as well as ensure, via their State units, that sources of excessive noise are controlled.\nThe agency has a manual monitoring system where sensors are installed in major cities and few cities have the facility to track noise\nlevels in real time.\nAir (Prevention and Control of Pollution) Act, 1981\nSection 2 (a) of the Air (Prevention and Control of Pollution) Act, 1981 includes noise in the definition of \u2018air pollution\u2019.\nNoise emanating from industry is regulated by State Pollution Control Boards / Pollution Control Committees (SPCBs / PCCs) for states / Union territories under the Air (Prevention and Control of Pollution) Act, 1981.\nNoise Pollution (Regulation and Control) Rules, 2000\nNoise pollution and its sources are regulated under The Noise Pollution (Regulation and Control) Rules, 2000 under The Environment (Protection) Act, 1986.\nThe Act has defined ambient acceptable noise levels, silence zones, restrictions on the use of loudspeakers, horns, sound-emitting construction equipment, and bursting of crackers.\nIt has also laid down the responsibility for enforcement. \u0083\nAt present, violation of noise pollution rules is a criminal offence\u00a0 punishable under Environment (Protection) Act, 1986\nEnvironment (Protection) Rules, 1986\nNoise standards for motor vehicles, air-conditioners, refrigerators, diesel generators and certain types of construction equipment are prescribed under the Environment (Protection) Rules, 1986.\nNational Ambient Noise Monitoring Network (NANMN)\n70 noise monitoring stations under the NANMN was established in 2011, across seven cities.\nSilence zones:\nThese are declared by the state governments >> around hospitals, educational institutions and courts.\nJudicial initiatives:\nRevising fines for violations of noise pollution norms:\nThe National Green Tribunal in 2019, while hearing a case related to noise pollution, had asked the Central Pollution Control Board to look at revising fines for violations of noise pollution norms.\nBan on loudspeakers during night time at public places:\nThe Supreme Court in 2005 banned the use of loudspeakers and music systems between 10 pm to 6 am (except in the cases of public\nemergencies) at public places citing serious effects of noise pollution on health of the people living in such areas.\nUse of loudspeaker \u2013 not a fundamental right:\nIn 2016, the Bombay High Court ruled that the use of loudspeaker was not a fundamental right.\nThe Bombay High Court observed that no religion or sect could claim that the right to use a loudspeaker or a public address system was a fundamental right conferred by Article 25 of the Constitution of India.\nSuggestions:\nWorker\u2019s safety:\nTo provide protective devices like ear muffs or cotton plugs to the workers who work in various industries and construction sites.\nZoning:\nTo enforce acoustic zoning by distancing human settlements from industrial areas, aerodromes and railway stations.\nTraffic management:\nHighway traffics should be diverted through bye-passes and over-bridges and should not be allowed to pass through the towns and cities.\nAwareness building:\nDecibel metres should be installed along highways and in factories to check and control the intensity of noise pollution.\nSound proofing machines in industrial units:\nSound-proof chambers should be installed for the machines generating loudnoise.\nCreation of \u2018green belt\u2019 to check noise pollution\nIt has been seen that plants are efficient absorbers of noise, especially noise of higher frequency.\nIn metropolitan areas a green belt of vegetation and open spaces in general may have a great value in noise control as in air purification\nSilence zones:\nSilence zones should be created for educational institutes, hospitals and important offices.\n\nArticle written by Aseem Muhammed"

If areas exceeding 10 km contain bigger ecologically significant \u201csensitive corridors,\u201d the Union government may additionally declare those areas to be ESZs.\n\nProcedure for Declaring Ecologically Sensitive Zones (ESZ)\nA Committee is made of wildlife experts, ecologists, revenue department officials, and officials from local administration to study the activities happening around protected areas.\nThis committee prepares an audit report based on the study of land use patterns, different types of activities, and industrial operations around protected areas and wildlife corridors.\nChief Wildlife Warden then categorizes the activities under prohibited, restricted, or permissible categories.\nThe final proposals of the committee are sent to the Ministry of Environment, Forest, and Climate change for further consideration, processing, and issuing notification for implementation.\nFinally, the Ministry of Environment, Forest, and Climate change declares Ecologically Sensitive Zones.\nActivities in Eco-Sensitive zones\n\nThe establishment of industries, the use of commercial timber, mining, and tourism are prohibited in these Zones.\n\nAdditionally, it is completely forbidden to produce dangerous substances, release solid or liquid waste, or engage in any activity that results in pollution of any type.\nThe lands around forests and animal corridors are frequently essential for preserving biological relationships and should be protected as a result.\nBy doing so, the loss of biodiversity and the organic expansion of flora and wildlife would be avoided.\n\nProhibited Activities: Commercial mining, sawmills, industries causing pollution (air, water, soil, noise, etc), the establishment of major hydroelectric projects (HEP), and commercial use of wood.\n\nRegulated Activities: Felling of trees, the establishment of hotels and resorts, commercial use of natural water, erection of electrical cables, drastic change of agriculture system, e.g., adoption of heavy technology, pesticides, etc, widening of roads.\n\nPermitted Activities: Ongoing agricultural or horticultural practices, rainwater harvesting, organic farming, use of renewable energy sources, and adoption of green technology for all activities.\n\nNeed for Eco-sensitive zones\n\nThe establishment of ecologically sensitive zones aims to preserve biodiversity and ecological balance in various parts of the nation where the rapid expansion of various development projects, such as the establishment of industry, mining, the construction of dams, and the building of roads, pose a threat to the natural environment and animal habitat.\n\nDue to rising pollution, these development efforts have resulted in the depletion of forest lands and hampered their natural expansion.\n\nThe regions designated for the survival and development of native plants and animals must be shielded from human interference by erecting a barrier around them.\n\nThe impact of human-made activities, such as industrialization and other developmental activities, would be reduced in areas designated as ecologically sensitive zones.\nBy providing a sustainable environment, creating ecologically sensitive zones helps to avoid the loss of forestland, preserve biodiversity, stop soil deterioration, and lessen human-animal conflict.\nThese areas were established to safeguard the environment while taking the socio-economic development of nearby populations into account.\nImproving the local environment helps the people living in around the zones as well.\nThe creation of the ESZ around protected places like national parks and wildlife sanctuaries serves as a safeguard to lessen the detrimental effects of pollution and the generation of hazardous waste.\nThese are site-specific, based on local characteristics, and deal with the preservation of a particularly endangered species through safeguarding their natural environment.\nConcerns\n\nThe Eco-sensitive Zones regulations outline the 10 km perimeter around protected areas that, in many jurisdictions, fall inside habitat zones and have an impact on development activities.\n\nThe limits may impact the locals\u2019 ability to go about their daily lives, therefore they have generated some concerns.\nThe locals\u2019 traditional customs have been negatively impacted by the current restrictions, which has raised concerns that it may worsen their socioeconomic situation.\nExecution of The Environmental Protection Act 1986 and the Wildlife Protection Act 1972 makes the authorities ignore forest communities\u2019 rights and impact their life and livelihood.\nIn 2022, MoEFCC removed the clauses requiring recognition of forest rights and gram sabha\u2019s consent as preconditions for proposals under the forest rights act 2006.\n\nTourism is being encouraged in ESZ which if not regulated will tend to environmental degradation and displacement of the local population from the area.\n\nWay forward\n\nTo deal with these challenges, the government proposed that the boundary of ESZs had to be determined based on region-specific requirements.\n\nA team of representatives from the forest department, revenue department, and Panchayat should discuss together to decide on the zone selection considering the interest and concerns of local groups.\nIt is important to involve local communities in the decision-making process for the management of ESZs.\n\nBy preserving biodiversity and the organic development of flora and fauna, natural parks and wildlife refuges provide a substantial contribution to the ecological balance.\n\nTherefore, it is essential to safeguard these places from the negative effects of human involvement and to maintain the ideal ecological equilibrium.\n\nAlso, it is pertinent that the livelihood of local people dependent on the eco-sensitive zines should be protected and alternate options should be made available to them.\n\n\u00ad-Article written by Swathi Satish"

Westoby. The National Commission on Agriculture (NCA, 1976) first recognized it as an important component of forestry for meeting rural needs.\n\nSocial forestry means the management and protection of forests and afforestation on barren lands and the practice of forestry on lands outside the conventional forest area with the purpose of helping in environmental, social, and rural development.\n\nTable of Contents\n\nImportance of Social Forestry\nClassification of Social Forestry\nUrban Forestry\nRural Forestry\nAgro-forestry\nCommunity Forestry\nFarm Forestry\nBenefits of Social Forestry\nGovernment Measures\nNational Forest Policy, 1988\nSocial Forestry Schemes\nImportance of Social Forestry\n\nSocial forestry offers an alternative form of forest management.

They will also function as urban lungs.\n\nRural Forestry\n\nRural forestry lays emphasis on the promotion of agro-forestry and community forestry.\n\nAgro-forestry\n\nAgro-forestry is the raising of trees and agricultural crops on the same land inclusive of the waste patches. It combines forestry with agriculture, thus, altering the simultaneous production of food, fodder, fuel, timber, and fruit.\n\nSub-Mission on Agroforestry (Har Medh Par Ped) Scheme was launched in 2016-17 to encourage tree plantation on farmland along with crops/ cropping systems to help the farmers get additional income and make their farming systems more climate resilient and adaptive.\n\nThe Agro-forestry scheme envisages a lot of quantifiable benefits like additional income, protection from crop damage, and higher carbon sequestration along with climate change adaptation and mitigation.\n\nCommunity Forestry\n\nPlanting trees on public or community land, such as schoolyards, roadsides, canal banks, village pastures, and temple grounds, is known as community forestry.\n\nThe goal of community forestry programs is to benefit the entire community. Community forestry provides a means under which the people of landless classes can associate themselves with tree raising and thus, get those benefits that otherwise are restricted for landowners.\n\nAccording to a study that was published in the journal Nature Sustainability, community-forest management led to a 37 percent relative decrease in deforestation and a 4.3 percent relative decrease in poverty.\n\nFarm Forestry\n\nFarm forestry is the term used to describe the practice of farmers growing trees on their fields for both commercial and non-commercial purposes. Non-commercial farm forestry refers to the practice of growing trees in a variety of places, including the margins of agricultural fields, grasslands and pastures, the land surrounding dwellings, and cow sheds.\n\nFarm Forestry can take many different forms, such as timber belts, plantations, woodlots, widely spaced tree plantings, and the sustainable management of existing native plant stands.\n\nBenefits of Social Forestry\n\nThe benefits of Social Forestry are:\n\nIncreased Biodiversity: Growing trees in barren lands within the community helps to increase the forest coverage hence helping in increasing the biodiversity.\n\nCarbon Removal: Trees act as carbon sinks In the fight against the global warming effect. It plays an essential role in the removal of carbon from the environment. So it is seen as the best way to reduce carbon dioxide in urban settings.\n\nCurbing Global Warming: Areas with tree cover will be substantially cooler than areas without it, helping in lowering energy consumption.\n\nSoil Conservation: Tree roots prevent soil erosion by holding soil in place, mitigating the negative effects of soil erosion.\n\nHealth Benefits: Trees and nature are natural remedies for stress and anxiety along with other health benefits\n\nNoise Pollution: Embracing social forestry in urban areas can mitigate the effects of noise pollution. Trees reflect and absorb sound energy reducing noise pollution.\n\nImprove Air Quality: Although it is mostly related to the removal of carbon dioxide from the environment, it also helps to clean and improve the quality of air.\n\nGovernment Measures\n\nThe respective State Government/UT Administration implements a number of legislation, including the Forest (Conservation) Act of 1980, the Indian Forest Act, of 1927, the Wildlife Protection Act of 1972, and other central/state laws as applicable to a State/UT, for the preservation and protection of forest and wildlife.\n\nNational Forest Policy, 1988\n\nThere are provisions under the National Forest Policy, 1988 to encourage a need-based and time-bound program of afforestation and tree planting through afforestation, social forestry & farm forestry with the involvement of local communities.\n\nThe Policy encourages the planting of trees alongside roads, railway lines, rivers and streams, and canals, and on other unutilized lands under State/corporate, institutional, or private ownership including the creation of green belts in urban/industrial areas as well as in arid tracts.\n\nSocial Forestry Schemes\n\nThe Ministry of Environment, Forest and Climate Change encourages plantation in the country including various metropolitan cities through programs and schemes such as:\n\nNagar Van Yojana\nSchool Nursery Yojana\nCompensatory Afforestation Fund Management and Planning Authority (CAMPA)\nNational Afforestation Programme (NAP)\nNational Mission for a Green India (GIM)\n\nThe purpose of the schemes is to promote urban forestry, tree plantation on vacant lands and bunds on farmlands, etc. by involving local communities, NGOs, educational institutions, local bodies, etc.\n\nArticle Written By: Priti Raj"

The agreement, which entered into force in 2005 and was ratified by 192 Parties, has since been superseded by the Paris Agreement but remains a historic landmark in the international fight against climate change. Read here to learn more about the agreement.\n\nThe Kyoto Protocol is an addendum to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC), a global environmental agreement whose objective is to \u201cstabilize greenhouse gas concentrations in the atmosphere at a level that would prevent dangerous anthropogenic interference with the climate system.\u201d\n\nTable of Contents\n\nKyoto Protocol, 1997\nThe Doha Amendment\nSignificance of the Kyoto Protocol\nSome facts about Kyoto Protocol\nDifference between the Paris Agreement and Kyoto Protocol\nIndia and Kyoto Protocol\nConclusion\nKyoto Protocol, 1997\n\nThe Kyoto Protocol was an agreement among developed nations to reduce carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions and greenhouse gases (GHG) to minimize the impacts of climate change.\n\nThe Protocol applied to 6 greenhouse gases:\n\ncarbon dioxide\nmethane\nnitrous oxide\nhydrofluorocarbons\nperfluorocarbons\nsulfur hexafluoride.\n\nThe Kyoto Protocol was adopted on 11 December 1997.\n\nDue to a complex ratification process, it entered into force on 16 February 2005. Currently, there are 192 Parties to the Kyoto Protocol.\n\n\ud83d\udc49 Which year are YOU targeting for success in the IAS/IPS/IFS Exam? \ud83d\ude80\n\n(1) \u21d2 UPSC 2025: Prelims cum Mains\n\n(2) \u21d2 UPSC 2026: Prelims cum Mains\n\n(3) \u21d2 UPSC 2027 Prelims cum Mains\n\nTip: Know more about ClearIAS Courses (Online/Offline)\n\nIn short, the Kyoto Protocol operationalizes the UNFCCC by committing industrialized countries and economies in transition to limit and reduce greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions by agreed individual targets.\n\nThe Convention itself only asks those countries to adopt policies and measures on mitigation and to report periodically.\n\nThe Kyoto Protocol is based on the principles and provisions of the Convention and follows its annex-based structure.\n\nIt only binds developed countries and places a heavier burden on them under the principle of \u201ccommon but differentiated responsibility and respective capabilities\u201d, because it recognizes that they are largely responsible for the current high levels of GHG emissions in the atmosphere.\nIn its Annex B, the Kyoto Protocol sets binding emission reduction targets for 37 industrialized countries and economies in transition and the European Union.\nOverall, these targets add up to an average 5 percent emission reduction compared to 1990 levels over the five years 2008-2012 (the first commitment period).\n\nOne important element of the Kyoto Protocol was the establishment of flexible market mechanisms, which are based on the trade of emissions permits.\n\nUnder the Protocol, countries must meet their targets primarily through national measures.\n\nHowever, the Protocol also offers them an additional means to meet their targets by way of three market-based mechanisms:\n\nInternational Emissions Trading: countries that emit less than they are allowed to can sell this amount to industrialized countries that produce more than they should. In this way, it becomes economically beneficial to reduce emissions.\nClean Development Mechanism (CDM)\nJoint implementation (JI): With both CDM and JI countries can invest in an emission-reducing project and gain credit points.\n\nAfter becoming a signatory in 2013, Afghanistan became the 192nd and last signatory of the Kyoto Protocol. As of 2022, there remain 192 signatories.\n\nThe Doha Amendment\n\nIn Doha, Qatar, on 8 December 2012, the Doha Amendment to the Kyoto Protocol was adopted for a second commitment period, starting in 2013 and lasting until 2020.\n\nThe amendment includes:\n\nNew commitments for Annex I Parties to the Kyoto Protocol who agreed to take on commitments in a second commitment period from 1 January 2013 to 31 December 2020;\nA revised list of GHG to be reported on by Parties in the second commitment period; and\nAmendments to several articles of the Kyoto Protocol specifically referenced issues about the first commitment period and which needed to be updated for the second commitment period.\n\nDuring the second commitment period, Parties committed to reduce GHG emissions by at least 18 percent below 1990 levels in the eight years from 2013 to 2020.\n\nSignificance of the Kyoto Protocol\n\nThe Kyoto Protocol committed industrialized countries to reduce their greenhouse gas emissions by agreed individual targets.\n\nThe Kyoto Protocol also established a rigorous monitoring, review, and verification system, as well as a compliance system to ensure transparency and hold Parties to account. Under the Protocol, countries\u2019 actual emissions have to be monitored and precise records have to be kept of the trades carried out.\n\nDeveloping nations were asked to comply voluntarily, and more than 100 developing countries (non-annex countries), including China and India, were exempted from the Kyoto agreement altogether.\n\nNon-Annex I nations participated by investing in projects designed to lower emissions in their countries.\nFor these projects, developing countries earned carbon credits, which they could trade or sell to developed countries, allowing the developed nations a higher level of maximum carbon emissions for that period.\nIn effect, this function helped the developed countries to continue emitting GHG vigorously.\nSome facts about Kyoto Protocol\n192 countries are parties to the Kyoto Protocol.\n84 countries are signatories of the Kyoto Protocol.\nCanada, Andorra, The United States of America, and South Sudan are not parties to the protocol.\nIt is legally binding and only members of the UNFCCC can become parties to the Kyoto Protocol.\nIt was adopted at the 3rd session of UNFCCC\nTo meet the targets of the Kyoto Protocol, member countries cannot include international shipping and international aviation\nCountries can use Land Use (LU), land-use change (LUC), and Forestry to meet their Kyoto targets.\nChina signed the protocol in 1998.\nThe protocol did not include ozone-depleting substances which were later covered by the Montreal protocol.\nDifference between the Paris Agreement and Kyoto Protocol\n\nBoth treaties were concluded under the UNFCCC with the objective of stabilizing greenhouse gas concentrations in the atmosphere and preventing dangerous human interference with the climate system.\n\nThe Kyoto Protocol required only developed countries to reduce emissions, while the Paris Agreement recognized that climate change is a shared problem and called on all countries to set emissions targets.\nThe Kyoto Protocol did not compel developing countries, including major carbon emitters China and India, to take action. The United States signed the agreement in 1998 but never ratified it and later withdrew its signature.\nThe Paris Agreement, which now has 194 Parties, requires all countries to reduce their emissions. Governments set targets, known as nationally determined contributions, with the goals of preventing the global average temperature from rising more than 2\u00b0C above preindustrial levels and pursuing efforts to keep temperature rise below 1.5\u00b0C.\nIndia and Kyoto Protocol\nIndia was exempted from obligations to reduce greenhouse gas emissions under the law.\nIndia placed special emphasis on the differences in the burden of duty for climate action between industrialized and developing countries.\nIndia was able to uphold its responsibility for socioeconomic growth while simultaneously pressuring other industrialized nations in the Annex I category to shoulder greater responsibility for reducing greenhouse gas emissions.\nIndia has ratified the second commitment period of the Kyoto Protocol or the Doha Amendment to meet the emission targets for the period 2012-2020.\nIndia was the 80th country to accept the amendment.\nConclusion\n\nConcerns about climate change led to the creation of the Kyoto Protocol. The treaty was a pact between developed countries to cut greenhouse gas and carbon dioxide emissions.\n\nThe framework carried out the UN\u2019s goal of limiting the effects of global warming, such as an overall increase in seal populations, the extinction of some island governments, the melting of glaciers, and an increase in extreme weather events.\n\nAs one of the more important international climate change treaties, the Kyoto Protocol is generally regarded as a historic legislative accomplishment. The Paris Agreement replaced the Kyoto Protocol, yet it still holds a significant place in the history of environmental protection.\n\n-Article was written by Swathi Satish"

The sum total of all the genes of a species is called the Gene pool of the species. The variability of genes within the gene pool of a species is called genetic diversity.\n\nSpecies Diversity: It is the variety of species in different habitats on the Earth. For instance, a large variety of species of plants, animals & microorganisms are found in tropical rainforests.\n\nEcosystem Diversity: It is the variety of ecosystems in the biosphere. e.g. variety of ecosystems like wetlands, corals, estuaries, deserts, mangroves, temperate forests & so on.\n\n\ud83d\udc49 Which year are YOU targeting for success in the IAS/IPS/IFS Exam? \ud83d\ude80\n\n(1) \u21d2 UPSC 2025: Prelims cum Mains\n\n(2) \u21d2 UPSC 2026: Prelims cum Mains\n\n(3) \u21d2 UPSC 2027 Prelims cum Mains\n\nTip: Know more about ClearIAS Courses (Online/Offline)\n\nHowever, for an assessment of biodiversity, the following parameters need to be evaluated:\n\nSpecies number (i.e., Species richness)\nSpecies evenness (i.e., the relative abundance of the species), and\nSpecies dominance (the most abundant species) also needed to be evaluated.\nBiodiversity Hotspots In India\n\nA\u00a0biodiversity hotspot is a region with a significant reservoir of biodiversity that is under threat from humans. 3 regions that satisfy these criteria exist in India and they are:\n\n(1) Himalaya: Includes the entire Indian Himalayan region (and that falling in Pakistan, Tibet, Nepal, Bhutan, China and Myanmar).\n\n(2) Indo-Burma: Includes entire Northeastern India, except Assam. Andaman group of Islands is also a part of this hotspot. (and Myanmar, Thailand, Vietnam, Laos, Cambodia and southern China).\n\n(3) Sundalands: Includes Nicobar group of Islands (and Indonesia, Malaysia, Singapore, Brunei, Philippines) Western Ghats and Sri Lanka: Includes entire Western Ghats (and Sri Lanka).\n\nTypes of Biodiversity Conservation Methods\n\nConservation can broadly be divided into two types:\n\nIn Situ Conservation Methods\nEx Situ Conservation Measures\nIn Situ Conservation Methods\n\nIt is the fundamental & principal method of conservation. It means at the site & it is fundamental because it prescribes the protection of wildlife where they naturally occur. This is achieved by establishing a network of Protected areas in which different species & their natural habitats are adequately maintained & preserved.\n\nIt is considered the most appropriate way of conserving biodiversity and includes various Protected Areas. These protected areas include wildlife sanctuaries, national parks, biosphere reserves, tiger reserves, Ramsar sites etc.\n\nIn-Situ Conservation Measures in India\n\nVarious protected areas (reserves) have been established in India for protection and conservation.\n\nBesides, the government has launched various programmes like \u2018Project Tiger\u2019 for the conservation of wildlife.\n\nProtected Areas of India (In-Situ Conservation)\n\nProtected areas are those in which human occupation or at least the exploitation of resources is limited.\n\nIndia is one of the 17 mega-diverse countries of the world. With only 2.4% of the world\u2019s land area, 16.7% of the world\u2019s human population and 18% livestock, it contributes about 8% of the known global biodiversity, however, it puts enormous demands on our natural resources.\n\nThere are various types of protected areas, and the degree of protection varies according to each country\u2019s enabling legislation or the rules of the international organisations involved.\n\nThe term protected area also includes Marine Protected Areas, the boundaries of which will include some area of ocean, and Transboundary Protected Areas that overlap multiple countries which remove the borders inside the area for conservation and economic purposes.\n\nWildlife Conservation Programmes in India\nProject Hangul or Kashmir Stag, 1970\nGir Lion Project, 1972\nProject Tiger, 1973\nCrocodile Breeding Project, 1974\nBrow antlered deer (Thamin deer) Project (1977)\nRhinoceros Conservation Project, 1987\nProject Elephant, 1992\nProject Red Panda, 1996\nEx Situ Conservation Measures\n\nEx-situ conservation is the preservation of components of biological diversity outside their natural habitats. It means off the Site or away from the Site\u2019. It involves the preservation of sample populations of various species or their genes in scientific facilities, such as zoos, botanical gardens, seed banks, sperm banks, gene banks, pollen banks etc. Some of these includes:\n\nGene banks, e.g. seed banks, sperm and ova banks, field banks;\nIn vitro plant tissue and microbial culture collections;\nCryopreservation (preservation at very low temperatures) of gametes and embryos\nBotanical Gardens\nZoological Gardens or zoos\nAnimal translocations to artificial environments like zoos;\nCaptive breeding of animals and artificial propagation of plants, with possible reintroduction into the wild\nCollecting living organisms for zoos, aquaria, and botanic gardens for research and public awareness.\n\nIn agriculture, ex-situ conservation measures maintain domesticated plants which cannot survive in nature unaided. Ex-situ conservation provides excellent research opportunities on the components of biological diversity.\n\nConservation of Biodiversity: Various Measures\n\nSeveral types of actions undertaken for species conservation are described below:\n\nConservation of habitats\n\nHabitat destruction is one of the major factors in the threatening of plants and animals. If adopting eco-friendly practices during urban and other developments, the damage to the habitat can be prevented considerably.\n\nCaptive Breeding\n\nSpecies which are reduced to dangerous levels need more intensive management, and one strategy is captive breeding. It means the eggs from the nests of endangered birds are taken and hatched in captivity. Captive breeding in zoos, animal breeding parks, and research centres has also been attempted with some success.\n\nProviding Critical Resources\n\nAnother way to improve the habitat of a threatened species is to determine which resource is limiting. Identifying and providing that critical resource may help to increase the population.\n\nControl of Introduction of Alien Species\n\nAlien species can cause the existing population to decrease or even become extinct. The individuals of alien species may affect the other species by preying on them, providing tough competition for food, or destroying their habitat. The alien species can also cause a population explosion of existing species by killing off their natural predators.\n\nDevelopment of Reserves\n\nThe establishment of Biological reserves, National parks, Forest reserves, Wildlife refuges and Biosphere reserves are effective means of preserving wildlife species. Besides, the maintenance cost and requirement of resources is minimal. An important aspect of these reserves is that more than one endangered species can be protected in the same area.\n\nLegislative Measures\n\nSeveral legal approaches have been used to preserve biodiversity. One is to enact laws regulating the killing of members of certain species, with severe penalties for breaking the law. These laws may be very effective.\n\nExample: In 1975, 81 nations signed the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species (CITES) which prohibits all trade of endangered species or their products. All these laws are good only if they are enforced and are able to save animals\u2019 lives.\n\nResearch and Documentation\n\nFirst, a list of endangered species is established by various national and international agencies. Another important action used to save an endangered species is the compilation of information about it.\n\nPublic Awareness and People\u2019s Participation\n\nPublic awareness is an important aspect of the conservation of the environment and biodiversity.\n\nAlso read: Biological Diversity (Amendment) Bill 2021\n\nSignificance of Biodiversity for Human Welfare\n\nThe human interest perspective considers the significance of biodiversity for the welfare of mankind. It involves the following:\n\nFor Food Security\n\nMan in recent days is over-dependent on only a few crop varieties & crop monocultures for food production. Thus the preservation of wild varieties of crop species is inevitable to ensure global food security.\n\nFor Medicinal Purposes\n\nActive ingredients of many drugs are derived from living resources. However, we have screened only a small part of these vast resources for their medicinal applications. For instance, only 1% of the plants from tropical rainforests have been studied for their medicinal use. 99% of this wealth remains yet to be explored for its potential to cure human suffering.\n\nFor Ecological Services\n\nBiodiversity renders a variety of ecological services vital to the survival of mankind, which are usually taken for granted.\n\nThese involve, for pollination of plants by bees vital to agriculture, decomposition of dead organic material, bioremediation, soil aeration & soil fertility enrichment by earthworms and other soil microorganisms, biodegradation of sewage & contaminants, temperature moderation by plants, plants as natural sinks of carbon etc.\n\nFor Biotechnology\n\nBiotechnology mainly deals with the manipulation of genetic resources for human welfare. So. it depends on the availability of useful genes like pest-resistant genes, drought-resistant genes etc. for manipulation. The future requirements of useful genes can be met only if we perverse & maintain as diverse a gene pool as we have today.\n\nFor Natural Products\n\nMan has been using living resources from prehistoric times to produce useful materials such as various fibres (cotton, silk & spider silk), vegetable oils & fat, shellac, casein(a milk protein) etc.\n\nConservation of Western Ghats Ecology\n\nSeveral committees have been appointed to submit reports for the conservation of biodiversity of the western ghat. A few important of them are:\n\nMadhav Gadgil Committee Report on the Western Ghats\n\nGadgil Commission, formally known as the Western Ghats Ecology Expert Panel (WGEEP) submitted the to the Government of India on 31 August 2011.\n\nThe major criticism faced by the Gadgil Committee report was that it was more environment-friendly and not in tune with the ground realities. The report was cited as impractical to implement.\n\nKasturirangan committee on the Western Ghats\n\nThe Kasturirangan committee, known as the high-level working group (HLWG), was constituted to examine the WGEEP report.\n\nIf Gadgil\u2019s report laid too much importance on the environment, Kasturirangan\u2019s report was biased towards development.\n\nKasturirangan report was criticized by many as it provided loopholes for mining, which if allowed would turn detrimental to the environment, in long term will affect development too.\n\nKasturirangan report was described as anti-environmental soon after its release. But this report described anti-development too by many who fear that their livelihood and interests will be affected.\n\nOommen V Oommen Committee\n\nAs people turned violent and started protests, Kerala appointed another expert committee. The important recommendations of the committee are:\n\nThe government should make changes in the clauses of Environmentally Fragile Land (EFL) in the Western Ghats.\nThe committee found serious lapses in determining the EFL areas. The committee adopted a survey to determine EFL and even plantations and estates were included in it.\nIt also recommended stopping land acquisition proceedings as per the Kasturirangan committee report.\nThe panel has made several pro-farmer recommendations, including the exclusion of inhabited regions and plantations from the purview of ecologically sensitive areas (ESAs).\nHuman settlements should be exempted from the category of ESAS after examining the population density of these areas.\nIt also said farmers should not be prohibited from rearing hybrid varieties of milking animals.\nIt also suggested extending the grace period given to shift to organic farming from five years to 10 years.\nRelated Posts\nGadgil Report and Kasturirangan Report on Western Ghats\nWestern Ghats: Explained\nEastern Ghats: Explained\n\nArticle Written By: Priti Raj"

Let\u2019s understand Environmental Pollution and Degradation in detail.\n\nWhat is the Environment?\n\nThe environment is the physical surroundings of a person, a part of which they are, and on which they depend for activities including physiologic function, production, and consumption. The natural resources in his physical environment include air, water, and land as well as plants, animals, and ecosystems.\n\nTable of Contents\n\nPollution and Pollutants\nCategorization of Pollutant\nCauses of Environmental Degradation\nClimate Change\nPopulation\nStratospheric Ozone Depletion\nPoverty\nDegraded Air Quality\nDegraded Water Quality\nDeforestation\nEffect of Environmental Pollution and Degradation\nPublic Health\nWater-Related Challenges\nPopulation\nEcosystems & Endangered Species\nWay Forward\nConclusion\nRelated posts\nPollution and Pollutants\n\nPollution is any unfavorable alteration in the physical, chemical, or biological characteristics of our environment, including the air, water, and soil, that may or will hurt people or other species as well as the life support systems of our biosphere. Pollutants can be natural, such as volcanic ash, and can also be created by human activity, such as trash or runoff produced by factories.\n\nCategorization of Pollutant\n\nAccording to the origin, pollutants are categorized as:\n\nNatural: A natural pollutant is a pollutant created by substances of natural origin such as volcanic dust.\nAnthropogenic: Anthropogenic pollutants are created by human activities.\n\nAccording to their nature of disposal, pollutants are grouped into:\n\nBiodegradable pollutants: Biodegradable materials such as human and animal wastes, agro-based residues, and fertilizers can also pose a threat if their quantities or inputs exceed the \u201cassimilative capacity of the environment.\nNon-biodegradable pollutants: The non-biodegradable pollutants such as heavy metals, and pesticides, move through the food chain and may get magnified to dangerous levels in higher trophic level organisms. Some of these combine with other compounds and produce toxic substances.\n\nAs per their existence in nature, pollutants are categorized as:\n\n\ud83d\udc49 Which year are YOU targeting for success in the IAS/IPS/IFS Exam? \ud83d\ude80\n\n(1) \u21d2 UPSC 2025: Prelims cum Mains\n\n(2) \u21d2 UPSC 2026: Prelims cum Mains\n\n(3) \u21d2 UPSC 2027 Prelims cum Mains\n\nTip: Know more about ClearIAS Courses (Online/Offline)\n\nQuantitative Pollutants: These occur in nature and become pollutants when their concentration reaches beyond a threshold level. E.g. carbon dioxide, and nitrogen oxide.\nQualitative Pollutants: These do not occur in nature and are man-made. E.g. fungicides, herbicides, DDT etc.\n\nAccording to the form in which they persist after release into the environment, pollutants are categorized as:\n\nPrimary Pollutants: Pollutants released into the environment as a result of some natural and/or human activity, e.g., carbon dioxide, carbon monoxide, oxides of nitrogen, sulfur dioxide, suspended particulate matter, and hydrocarbons.\nSecondary Pollutants: formed by the chemical interaction of primary pollutants with atmospheric gases and moisture, often catalyzed by sunlight are known as secondary pollutants e.g. ozone (O.), peroxy acyl nitrates (PAN), aldehyde, sulphuric acid, and nitric acid.\nCauses of Environmental Degradation\n\nEnvironmental degradation is the deterioration of the environment caused by the deterioration of resources including soil, water, and air; the loss of ecosystems; and the extinction of wildlife.\n\nThe main contributors to environmental degradation include modern urbanization, industrialization, population expansion, deforestation, etc. Unplanned urbanization and industrialization have contaminated the water, air, and sound systems. \u00a0The air is additionally polluted by the smoke produced by automobiles and industries, which includes nitrogen oxide, carbon monoxide, and chlorofluorocarbon.\n\nClimate Change\n\nThe release of greenhouse gases into the atmosphere causes climate change. It mostly results from the burning of fossil fuels, agricultural emissions, and changes in land use brought on by the eradication, clearing, and burning of forests.\n\nThe biological and socioeconomic repercussions of climate change are already evident, and its anticipated effects have the potential to significantly alter the global mean surface temperature, sea level, ocean circulation, precipitation patterns, climatic zones, species distributions, and ecosystem function.\n\nPopulation\n\nThe rapid population growth and economic development in the country are degrading the environment through the uncontrolled growth of urbanization and industrialization, expansion and intensification of agriculture, and the destruction of natural habitats.\n\nOn just 2.4% of the world\u2019s land, India is home to 17% of the world\u2019s population. Population pressure on the environment is linked to environmental pressures like biodiversity loss, air and water pollution, and increased demand for arable land. Population affects the environment primarily through the use of natural resources and the generation of waste.\n\nStratospheric Ozone Depletion\n\nBecause of the pollution caused by chlorofluorocarbons\u00a0(CFCs)\u00a0in the atmosphere, stratospheric ozone is being depleted. It is a serious issue because the absence of protective ozone at high altitudes causes an increase in the amount of harmful solar ultraviolet (UV-B) radiation that penetrates the surface of the earth, leading to a variety of health problems and ecological effects.\n\nPoverty\n\nPoverty is said to be both cause and effect of environmental degradation. The fast increment of human numbers joined with urgent poverty and rising levels of utilization are draining natural resources on which the vocation of present and future ages depends.\n\nDegraded Air Quality\n\nWorldwide, Approximately a billion people live in areas that mostly comprise industrial cities, and they are said to be the ones who are most affected by air pollution. The deterioration of air quality is caused by several air pollutants, but some major ones are particulate matter, such as oxides of nitrogen, oxides of sulfur, lead, and other aromatic compounds (such as benzene).\n\nDegraded Water Quality\n\nImpurities brought on by contaminants can also seriously affect water quality, having a variety of negative repercussions on both the environment and human health.\n\nNumerous other human activities, such as mining and industrial processes that may release harmful effluents, contribute to water contamination. Other significant factors contributing to the marine environment\u2019s substantial degradation are oil spills, plastic waste buildup, and biological accumulation of persistent organic pollutants.\n\nRead:\u00a0Water Pollution Prevention\n\nDeforestation\n\nIt has been estimated that around half of the world\u2019s mature forests have been cleared by humans. Deforestation occurs for a variety of reasons, but the majority of deforestation now occurs when tropical forests are cleared for agriculture and pastoralism; destruction of trees for charcoal production, and the selective logging of forests for timber.\n\nEffect of Environmental Pollution and Degradation\n\nEnvironmental pollution and degradation have an impact on several aspects of life:\n\nPublic Health\n\nPublic health is threatened by pollution, a lack of fresh water, and population growth. According to the WHO, unhealthful settings are directly responsible for about one out of every four deaths each year.\n\nWater-Related Challenges\n\nAccording to a UNICEF report, 2.1 billion people do not have access to securely managed drinking water services, and 4.5 billion do not have access to safely managed sanitation facilities.\n\nAdditionally, diarrheal infections claim the lives of 340,000 children under five years of age every year. Water scarcity already affects four out of every 10 people and according to UNISDR, 90% of natural disasters are water-related.\n\nPopulation\n\nNatural resources are strained by rapid population growth, which causes environmental degradation. Simply said, a growing population increases the need for food, clothing, and housing.\n\nEcosystems & Endangered Species\n\nBoth ecosystems and species are impacted by the long list of environmental problems that exist on this planet. In fact, by 2050, one in ten plant and animal species is predicted to become extinct.\n\nWay Forward\nSocial Awareness: The need to raise public awareness of the consequences of pollution is urgent.\nPopulation Control: If the environment is to be protected it is essential to check population growth.\nEnvironment Conservation Acts Implementation: The Environment (Protection) Act was passed in 1986 in India to check the deterioration in the quality of the environment. Such government measures should be strictly enforced.\nControl over Industrial and Agricultural Pollution: Controlling the air and water pollution brought on by industrial development is essential for environmental conservation. The use of pesticides and chemical fertilizers should be avoided to prevent agricultural pollution.\nAfforestation: An extensive afforestation campaign should be launched in the interest of environmental protection.\nWater Management: Provisions should be made to provide rural people with clean drinking water and river water should be made clean.\nManagement of Solid Waste: Planned management of solid waste is very essential.\n\nRead: Environmental Regulatory Bodies\n\nConclusion\n\nEnvironmental pollution and degradation can have a disastrous effect on a country or region\u2019s social, economic, and environmental systems as well as the entire planet\u2019s ecosystem. Environmental catastrophes pose a threat to the legacy of a healthy and supportive environment left for future generations.

            "[CONTENT]": "According to a paper published in The Lancet Planetary Health, Pharmaceutical pollution is an urgent matter of concern. It requires actions from across the pharmaceutical, healthcare, and environmental sectors.\n\nAlmost 43 percent of the rivers in the world are contaminated with active pharmaceutical ingredients at levels that could have catastrophic effects on health.\n\nTable of Contents\n\nAbout Pharmaceutical Pollution\nCurrent Status\nWhat is API?\nStatus of the Indian Pharmaceutical Industry\nCauses of Pharmaceutical Pollution\nEffect of Pharmaceutical Pollution\nWay Forward\nAbout Pharmaceutical Pollution\n\nWastewater from pharmaceutical manufacturers often fails to filter the chemical compounds or wastewater used in manufacturing plants and is also sometimes discharged into open fields and nearby water bodies like oceans, lakes, streams, and rivers. Thereby increasing the pharmaceutical waste or their by-product load in the environment, landfills, or dumping areas.\n\nCurrent Status\n\nEvery year, more than 100,000 tonnes of pharmaceutical items are consumed worldwide. Active Pharmaceutical Ingredients (APIs), \u00a0along with other chemical constituents, are released into the environment during their production, usage, and disposal.\n\nAPIs are released in high amounts to the environment during human and veterinary consumption of drugs, as between 30 and 90% of an oral dose is excreted in the urine. As per a global review, over 600 different APIs have been found in the environment, and in some cases, the amount of substance is as high as it can pose a high risk to the environment.\n\nNowadays, pharmaceuticals have also been detected in drinking water, wastewater, sewage sludge, and soils.\n\nWhat is API?\n\nActive Pharmaceutical Ingredients (APIs) are biologically active non-biodegradable compounds present in the environment.\n\n\ud83d\udc49 Which year are YOU targeting for success in the IAS/IPS/IFS Exam? \ud83d\ude80\n\n(1) \u21d2 UPSC 2025: Prelims cum Mains\n\n(2) \u21d2 UPSC 2026: Prelims cum Mains\n\n(3) \u21d2 UPSC 2027 Prelims cum Mains\n\nTip: Know more about ClearIAS Courses (Online/Offline)\n\nThey are excreted in such a way as they are not easily metabolized in either human or animal bodies. In order to have the most impact possible on the target organisms, they are made to live longer inside the bodies of humans and animals. Due to this characteristic, these chemicals have a high level of environmental persistence, such as Amoxicillin.\n\nStatus of the Indian Pharmaceutical Industry\n\nWith a market value of $42 billion, India is one of the most significant players in the global pharmaceutical market as it is the third-largest drug producer in the world.\n\nHowever, in terms of volume, India ranks fourteenth.\n\nIndia is the largest supplier of generic drugs in the world, meeting around 60% of the demand for vaccines globally and contributing 20% of the global supply by volume.\n\nThe primary reason for India being one of the major countries producing most of the drugs is because of the:\n\nLow-cost of production: It is estimated that the cost of production of medicine in India is 33% lower than that of the US.\n\nCost efficiency: India has the ability to produce high-quality, low-cost drugs for the domestic and global markets.\n\nIncreased private sector investment: There has been an increase in investments in the R and D sector.\n\nPolicy support: The government has been extending economic and other benefits to the industry to expand and increase the production capacity by allocating funds, land, and reduction in the project approval time, providing tax benefits, etc.\n\nCauses of Pharmaceutical Pollution\n\nSeveral factors are responsible for such kind of pollution.\n\nDrug Ingestion and Excretion: Organisms expel the remaining metabolic waste products and other toxic substances from their body through urine or fecal matter that eventually be in the environment and pollute it.\n\nHealthcare Institutions Disposal: Hospitals contribute a major portion to pharmaceutical pollution where the arrangement of the disposal may not be as per the standards.\n\nDrug Manufacturer: Some of the manufacturers dispose of the drugs in a landfill, and some will flush them, among many other ways of disposing of the drugs. That leads to severe pollution of the surrounding body because of the wastewater runoff.\n\nDomestication of Animals: Not all the drugs fed to domesticated animals are metabolized by their bodies so they also excrete the excess of it.\n\nAgricultural Products: Several insecticides spray on agricultural products to save them from damage. A portion of it then pollutes the surrounding.\n\nDomestic Drug Use and Disposal Behaviour: Consumers are responsible for a significant amount of pharmaceutical and personal care products that end up in streams, groundwater, lakes, and rivers. It is common to find plenty of expired medications in homes which then get disposed of without proper care which further hurt the environment.\n\nEffect of Pharmaceutical Pollution\n\nThe effects of such pollution are:\n\nOn Human Health: As per World Health Organization, in 2016, 4,90,000 people developed multidrug-resistant TB globally and drug resistance is starting to complicate the fight against HIV and malaria, as well. Drug resistance is the reduction in a medication\u2019s ability to effectively treat a condition or disease, such as an antimicrobial or an antineoplastic. Drug-resistant infections are mostly brought on by the improper use and overuse of antibiotics.\n\nOn Aquatic Life: Various studies have shown that estrogen and substances that act similarly to it can change the female-to-male ratios in fish and have a feminizing effect on male fish. Additionally, concentrations of common antidepressants have been discovered in the fish brain tissue living downstream of wastewater treatment facilities.\n\nOn Sewage Treatment System: Antibiotics, that are used to treat infections contain substances that have the potential to interfere with the sewage treatment process and the surface water\u2019s microbial ecology. Therefore, antibiotics used in sewage treatment systems may significantly hinder the activities of sewage bacteria and thus have a negative impact on the decomposition of organic matter. Additionally, In the course of treating wastewater, antibiotics may potentially be hazardous to the nitrifying bacteria.\n\nOn Drinking Water: These medications\u2019 chemical components find their way into waterways. Due to the fact that most municipal sewage treatment systems do not remove these pharmaceutical substances from drinking water, we ingest them instead which could result in serious health issues.\n\nOn Environment: Some medicinal substances remain for a very long time in the water and the atmosphere. The chemicals start to have an impact on the environment once the concentration reaches a particular point, often around one part per million. Some medications, such as antiepileptics, are persistent, whereas others are pseudo-persistent, meaning that they eventually decay after quite some time.\n\nWay Forward\n\nThere are a few solutions to curb pharmaceutical pollution.\n\nProper Drug Disposal: Invest in public education on the proper disposal of drugs, as part of the drug take-back programs can be effective in maintaining the health of the environment.\n\nProper Regulation: To limit large-scale medicine flushing in hospitals, nursing homes, and other healthcare institutions, a robust regulation is important.\n\nInvestment in Research and Development: To advance the process of disposal mechanism and further technological enhancement.\n\nLimiting Waste and Bulk Purchases: The majority of individuals and companies buy them in quantity since doing so results in discounts that lower the price per unit. It\u2019s important to curb such actions to prevent waste.\n\nArticle Written By: Priti Raj"

But how is that possible for the world? Read here to understand.\n\nMethane (CH4) accounts for 15\u201335% of the rise in greenhouse gas emissions that are caused by human activity.\n\nOver the past ten years, the atmospheric methane growth rate (MGR) has increased significantly, most likely due to rising fossil fuel and microbial source emissions.\n\nMethane emissions increased from 9.9 parts per billion (ppb) in 2019 to around 15 ppb in 2020.\n\nHuman-related methane emissions fell by 1.2 teragrams (Tg) year in 2020.\n\nAlso read: Natural Gas Hydrates: Ocean Exploration\n\nTable of Contents\n\n\ud83d\udc49 Which year are YOU targeting for success in the IAS/IPS/IFS Exam? \ud83d\ude80\n\n(1) \u21d2 UPSC 2025: Prelims cum Mains\n\n(2) \u21d2 UPSC 2026: Prelims cum Mains\n\n(3) \u21d2 UPSC 2027 Prelims cum Mains\n\nTip: Know more about ClearIAS Courses (Online/Offline)\n\nWhat are methane emissions?\nSource of methane emissions\nWhy are methane emissions a cause of worry?\nHow can methane be reduced?\nRole of farmers\nGlobal initiatives\nIndian initiatives\nWhat are methane emissions?\n\nAn invisible gas called methane has the potential to severely worsen the climate problem. It is a hydrocarbon that makes up a sizable portion of natural gas, which is utilized as fuel for stoves, homes, and industrial power plants.\n\nMethane can form a thicker blanket than carbon dioxide, one that can warm the globe more quickly and to a greater extent.\n\nIt immediately contributes to global warming. Methane, in contrast to carbon dioxide, which stays in the atmosphere for hundreds of years, causes heat for only ten years.\n\nMethane pollution, a major contributor to ground-level ozone and released with hazardous substances like benzene, has been connected to heart disease, birth defects, asthma, and other conditions.\n\nSource of methane emissions\n\nMethane has biological origins because methanogens, or bacteria that produce methane, make it from certain chemical components.\n\nMethanogens can be found in a variety of oxygen-deficient environmental settings.\nThese habitats consist of wetlands, poorly ventilated landfills, and submerged paddy fields.\n\nAgriculture is the predominant source of methane emissions.\n\nLivestock emissions from manure and gastroenteric releases \u2013 account for roughly 32 percent of human-caused methane emissions.\n\nPopulation growth, economic development, and urban migration have stimulated unprecedented demand for animal protein. With the global population approaching 10 billion, this hunger is expected to increase by up to 70 percent by 2050.\n\nAgricultural methane doesn\u2019t only come from animals, though. Paddy rice cultivation \u2013 in which flooded fields prevent oxygen from penetrating the soil, creating ideal conditions for methane-emitting bacteria \u2013 accounts for another 8 percent of human-linked emissions.\n\nWhy are methane emissions a cause of worry?\n\nNote: Subscribe to the ClearIAS YouTube Channel to learn more.\n\nMethane is the primary contributor to the formation of ground-level ozone, a hazardous air pollutant, and greenhouse gas, exposure to which causes 1 million premature deaths every year.\n\nMethane is also a powerful greenhouse gas. Over 20 years, it is 80 times more potent at warming than carbon dioxide.\n\nMethane has accounted for roughly 30 percent of global warming since pre-industrial times and is proliferating faster than at any other time since record-keeping began in the 1980s.\n\nIn fact, according to data from the United States National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), even as carbon dioxide emissions decelerated during the pandemic-related lockdowns of 2020, atmospheric methane shot up.\n\nAlso read: Energy crisis: Causes and Global Impact\n\nHow can methane be reduced?\n\nLeveraging new technology, shifting towards plant-rich diets, and embracing alternative sources of protein are basic steps to take in order to rethink our approaches to agricultural cultivation and livestock production.\n\nThis will be key if humanity is to slash greenhouse gas emissions and limit global warming to 1.5\u00b0C, a target of the Paris climate change agreement.\n\nRole of farmers\nThey can provide animals with more nutritious feed so that they are larger, healthier, and more productive, effectively producing more with less.\nScientists are also experimenting with alternative types of feed to reduce the methane produced by cows and looking at ways to manage manure more efficiently by covering it, composting it, or using it to produce biogas.\nWhen it comes to staple crops like paddy rice, experts recommend alternate wetting and drying approaches that could halve emissions.\nRather than allowing the continuous flooding of fields, paddies could be irrigated and drained two to three times throughout the growing season, limiting methane production without impacting yield. That process would also require one-third less water, making it more economical.\n\nIt takes only about a decade for methane to break down. So, reducing methane emissions now would have an impact in the near term and is critical for helping keep the world on a path to 1.5\u00b0C.\n\nHuman-caused methane emissions could be reduced by as much as 45 percent within the decade.\nThis would avert nearly 0.3\u00b0C of global warming by 2045, helping to limit global temperature rise to 1.5\u02daC and putting the planet on track to achieve the Paris Agreement targets.\nEvery year, the subsequent reduction in ground-level ozone would also prevent 260,000 premature deaths, 775,000 asthma-related hospital visits, 73 billion hours of lost labor from extreme heat, and 25 million tonnes of crop losses.\nGlobal initiatives\nMethane Alert and Response System (MARS): MARS will integrate data from a large number of existing and future satellites that have the ability to detect methane emission events anywhere in the world, and send out notifications to the relevant stakeholders to act on it.\nGlobal Methane Pledge: At the Glasgow climate conference (UNFCCC COP 26) in 2021, nearly 100 countries had come together in a voluntary pledge, referred to as the Global Methane Pledge, to cut methane emissions by at least 30% by 2030 from 2020 levels.\nGlobal Methane Initiative (GMI): It is an international public-private partnership focused on reducing barriers to the recovery and use of methane as a clean energy source.\nIndian initiatives\nHarit Dhara\u2019 (HD): Indian Council of Agricultural Research (ICAR) has developed an anti-methanogenic feed supplement \u2018Harit Dhara\u2019 (HD), which can cut down cattle methane emissions by 17-20% and can also result in higher milk production.\nIndia Greenhouse Gas Program: The India GHG Program led by WRI India (non-profit organization), Confederation of Indian Industry (CII), and The Energy and Resources Institute (TERI) is an industry-led voluntary framework to measure and manage greenhouse gas emissions.\nNational Action Plan on Climate Change (NAPCC): NAPCC was launched in 2008 and aimed at creating awareness among the representatives of the public, different agencies of the government, scientists, industry, and the communities on the threat posed by climate change and the steps to counter it.\nBharat Stage-VI Norms: India shifted from Bharat Stage-IV (BS-IV) to Bharat Stage-VI (BS-VI) emission norms.\n\n-Article written by Swathi Satish"

This is known as the \u2018greenhouse effect \u2018.\n\nNatural Greenhouse Effect: Importance\n\nThe greenhouse effect is a natural occurrence that has been taking place on earth for millions of years.\n\nHow natural greenhouse effect caused?\n\nThe natural greenhouse effect caused by the presence of water vapour and small water particles in the atmosphere has made life on earth possible. Together, these produce more than 95 per cent of total greenhouse warming.\n\nAverage global temperatures are maintained at about 15\u00b0C due to the natural greenhouse effect.\nWithout this phenomenon, the world\u2019s average temperature could have been as low as -17\u00b0C, where life would not have been able to develop.\nGreenhouse Gases (GHGs)\n\nThere are multiple gases responsible for the greenhouse effect. They are listed below.\n\nWhich gases are responsible for the greenhouse effect?\n\nIt is a result of atmospheric gases like carbon dioxide, methane, nitrous oxide (N2O), water vapour, and chlorofluorocarbons being able to trap the outgoing infrared radiation from the earth\u2019s surface.\n\nHence these gases are known as\u00a0greenhouse gases\u00a0and the heating effect is known as\u00a0the greenhouse effect.\n\nAre all oxides of nitrogen greenhouse gas? No\n\nOxides of Nitrogen with the general formula NOx \u2013 NO, NO2 \u2013 Nitrogen oxide, Nitrogen dioxide, etc. are global cooling gasses while Nitrous oxide (N2O) is a greenhouse gas.\n\nIf greenhouse gases are not checked, by the turn of the century the temperature may rise by 5\u00b0C.\nAccording to scientists, this temperature increase will harm the environment and cause unusual climatic changes (like an increase in the frequency of El Nino), which will accelerate the melting of the polar ice caps as well as ice caps in other regions, such as the Himalayas.\n\nCryosphere: The cryosphere is the frozen water part of the Earth\u2019s water system. Polar regions and snow caps of high mountain ranges are all part of the cryosphere.\n\nHow does this impact?\n\nThis will cause the sea level to rise over a long period, submerging many coastal areas and causing the loss of coastal habitats, including the most crucial ecosystems in terms of ecological services, such as marshes and swamps.\n\nGas V/S Sources and Causes\n\nCarbon dioxide (CO2): Burning of fossil fuels, deforestation\n\nChlorofluorocarbons (CFCs): Refrigeration, solvents, insulation foams, aero propellants, industrial and commercial uses\n\nMethane (CH4): Growing paddy, excreta of cattle and other livestock, termites, burning of fossil fuel, wood, landfills, wetlands, and fertilizer factories.\n\nNitrogen oxides (N2O): Burning of fossil fuels, and fertilizers; burning of wood and crop residue.\n\nCarbon Monoxide (CO): Iron ore smelting, burning of fossil fuels, burning e-waste.\n\nCARBON DIOXIDE\nIn terms of meteorology, carbon dioxide is a very significant gas because it is transparent to solar radiation coming in but opaque to radiation leaving the earth.\nA portion of the radiation from the earth\u2019s surface is reflected toward the surface after being partially absorbed by it. The greenhouse effect can be largely attributed to it.\nIts\u00a0concentration is greater close to the earth\u2019s surface as it is denser than air.\nOZONE\nOzone is another important greenhouse gas. But it is in\u00a0very small proportions at the surface.\nMost of it is confined to the\u00a0stratosphere\u00a0where it\u00a0absorbs harmful UV radiation.\nPollutants such as NO2 react with volatile organic compounds at ground level in the presence of sunlight to produce ozone (tropospheric ozone).\nWATER VAPOUR\n\nWhy does water vapour consider a unique greenhouse gas?\n\nBecause it absorbs both incoming (part of incoming) and outgoing solar radiation.\n\nIt may account for four per cent of the air by volume in the warm and wet tropics, while it may account for less than one per cent of the air in the dry and cold desert and polar regions.\n\nWater vapour is also a variable gas in the atmosphere, which decreases with altitude.\nWater vapour also decreases from the equator towards the poles.\nMETHANE\nMethane is the\u00a0most important greenhouse gas after carbon dioxide.\nIt is produced from\u00a0the decomposition of animal wastes and biological matter.\nThe emission of this gas can be restricted by producing gobar gas from animal waste and biological matter (methane).\nNITROUS OXIDE (N2O)\nN2O or Nitrous Oxide is a greenhouse gas.\nNO and NO2 (nitric oxide or nitrogen oxide and nitrogen dioxide) emissions cause global cooling by forming (OH) radicals that destroy methane molecules, thereby offsetting the effect of GHGs.\nCARBON MONOXIDE\nCarbon monoxide is a\u00a0short-lived greenhouse gas (it is less dense than air).\nIt has an indirect radiative forcing effect by increasing methane and tropospheric ozone concentrations via chemical reactions with other atmospheric constituents (e.g., the hydroxyl radical, OH.) that would otherwise destroy them.\nThrough natural processes in the atmosphere, it is eventually\u00a0oxidized to carbon dioxide.\nFLUORINATED GASES\nCHLOROFLUOROCARBONS (CFCS)\nBecause of their role in ozone depletion (explained in Geography > Climatology > Polar Vortex), CFCs were phased out through the Montreal Protocol.\nThis anthropogenic compound is also a greenhouse gas, with a much greater capacity to amplify the greenhouse effect than CO2.\n\nKnow more about Montreal Protocol and the Kigali agreement click here:\n\nHYDROFLUOROCARBONS\nHydrofluorocarbons are used as\u00a0refrigerants, aerosol propellants, solvents, and fire retardants.\nThese chemicals were developed as a\u00a0replacement for chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs).\nUnfortunately, HFCs are potent greenhouse gases with\u00a0long atmospheric lifetimes.\nPERFLUOROCARBONS\nPerfluorocarbons are compounds that are produced as a by-product of aluminum production and semiconductor manufacturing.\nLike HFCs, PFCs generally have\u00a0long atmospheric lifetimes\u00a0and\u00a0high global warming potential.\nSULFUR HEXAFLUORIDE\nSulfur hexafluoride is also a greenhouse gas.\nIt is used in the production of magnesium and semiconductors, as well as as a tracer gas for leak detection.\nSulfur hexafluoride is used in electrical transmission equipment, including circuit breakers.\nBLACK CARBON\nBlack carbon (BC) is a solid particle or aerosol (though not a gas) that contributes to global warming.\n\nIs Black carbon and soot are same? Yes\n\nSoot is another name for black carbon. Soot is a form of particulate air pollutant, produced from incomplete combustion.\n\nWhen deposited on snow and ice, black carbon warms the earth by absorbing heat in the atmosphere and decreasing albedo (the ability to reflect sunlight).\n\nBlack carbon is the strongest absorber of sunlight and heats the air directly.\n\nFurthermore, it darkens snowpacks and glaciers through deposition and causes ice and snow to melt.\nRegionally, Black carbon disrupts cloudiness and monsoon rainfall.\nBlack carbon stays in the atmosphere for\u00a0only several days to weeks.\nAs a result, the effects of Black carbon on atmospheric warming and glacier retreat vanish within months of reducing emissions.\nBROWN CARBON\nAs a result, the effects of BC on atmospheric warming and glacier retreat vanish within months of reducing emissions.\nBiomass burning (possibly domestic wood burning) has been identified as a significant source of brown carbon.\nBrown carbon is commonly referred to as a greenhouse gas, while black carbon refers to particles produced by impure combustion, such as soot and dust.\nGHG PROTOCOL\nGHG Protocol is creating standards, tools, and online training to assist countries, cities, and businesses in tracking their progress toward their climate goals.\nThe Greenhouse Gas Protocol (GHG Protocol) establishes frameworks for measuring and managing greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions from private and public sector operations, value chains, and mitigation actions.\nThe GHG Protocol arose in the late 1990s when the World Resources Institute (WRI) and the World Business Council for Sustainable Development (WBCSD) recognized the need for an international standard for corporate GHG accounting and reporting.\n\u00a0Global Warming \u2013 Impacts\n\nMelting of the ice caps refers to?\n\nMelting of the ice caps and glaciers will lead to a rise in sea level.\n\nThe thermal expansion\u00a0also contributes to sea level rise.\n\nFertile coastal agricultural lands will be submerged, and saline water intrusions will degrade neighbouring land. Groundwater in such areas will be rendered ineffective.\n\nPopulous cities lying on the coasts will be submerged under the sea.\nFlooding in the Himalayas and Ganga plains during the wet season, and drought during the dry season will have a devastating impact on the country.\nThe amount of arable land in the high-latitude region is likely to increase as a result of the melting of snow and the reduction of frozen land.\nAt the same time,\u00a0arable land along the coastlines are bound to be reduced\u00a0as a result of rising sea level and saline water inundations.\nExtreme Climatic Events\nThe increased likelihood of extreme events such as heat waves, flooding, hurricanes, and so on will cancel out all economic gains.\nChanges in rainfall patterns (E.g. 2015 Chennai floods, and the 2018 Kerala floods) will severely impact agriculture.\nEnvironmental Degradation\nReduced hydroelectric power generation due to glacier abnormal behaviour will increase reliance on fossil fuels.\nThe widespread extinction of animal populations due to habitat loss will add to the list of \u2018threatened\u2019 and \u2018extinct\u2019 species.\nWhat are the Rising Health-Related Issues?\nThe spread of diseases (like malaria, etc.) in the tropics will put more pressure on the healthcare sector.\nThe increased frequency and severity of heat waves and other extreme weather events are expected to increase the number of deaths.\nLack of freshwater during droughts and contamination of freshwater supplies during floods jeopardize hygiene, increasing the prevalence of diseases such as cholera and diarrhea.\nHow Biodiversity Loss occurred?\nThe loss of plankton due to sea-level rise will harm the marine food chain.\nThe bleaching of coral reefs (ocean rainforests) will result in a significant loss of marine biodiversity.\nRising temperatures would necessitate more fertilizer for the same production targets, resulting in higher GHG emissions, ammonia volatilization, and crop production costs.\nRising temperatures will have an even greater impact on the physical, chemical, and biological properties of freshwater lakes and rivers, threatening many individual freshwater species.\nNo Food Security\nClimate change affects crops by influencing irrigation, insolation, and pest prevalence.\nDrought, flood, storm, and cyclone frequency are likely to increase agricultural production variability.\nCrop yields in temperate regions are expected to benefit from moderate warming (an increase of 1 to 3\u00b0C in mean temperature), while crops in lower latitudes will suffer.\nHowever, natural disasters caused by global warming may outweigh the benefits in temperature regions.\nSea level rise will exacerbate water resource constraints in coastal areas due to increased salinization of groundwater supplies.\nDeterioration of Carbon sinks\nHigh-latitude forests store more carbon than tropical rainforests.\nOne-third of the world\u2019s soil-bound carbon is in taiga and tundra areas.\nPermafrost melts as a result of global warming, releasing carbon in the form of carbon dioxide and methane.\nThe tundra was a carbon sink in the 1970s, but it is now a carbon source due to global warming. (Global warming causes even more global warming.)\nSea Level Change\nSea level change\u00a0means the fluctuations in the mean sea level over a considerably long period.\nPROCESSES THAT CAUSE CHANGE IN SEA LEVEL\nEustatic changes happen when the amount of seawater changes as a result of things like\nglobal warming and melting of ice sheets (rise in sea level) or ice ages (fall in sea level) and\nchanges in the volume of mid-oceanic ridges.\n\n2. Tectonic changes occur due to a change in the level of the land.\n\nThe addition or removal of load causes isostatic changes. During the ice ages, the weight of the glacial ice caused the landmass to sag. On the other hand, as the glacial ice is melted, landmasses rise.\nEpeirogenic movement is caused by the large-scale tilting of continents, which may cause one part of the continent to rise while the other part may sink, giving the appearance that the sea level is rising.\nOrogenic movement (mountain building) results in the formation of lofty mountains and an apparent fall in sea level.\nImportance of understanding Sea Level Changes\n\nIt provides key evidence regarding climate change in the past. It helps in estimating the rates of tectonic upliftment in the past geological periods.\n\nto determine whether coastal areas are suitable for industrial and agricultural development.\nTo protect low-lying countries by building coastal dykes and embankments.\nOnly when we are aware of the areas that will likely be affected by future sea level rise can we map the areas that will likely experience storm surges and intermittent flooding.\nIt becomes possible to build tidal power generation facilities in suitable locations by identifying the areas that may soon be submerged.\nCHANGES IN GLOBAL SEA LEVEL\n\nShort-Term\n\nShort-term changes occur during a year.\nCommonly, seasonal variations of 5-6 cm in sea level are observed in a year.\n\nShort-term\u00a0sea level change\u00a0may be due to a complex interaction of the following factors:\n\nMarine water density:\u00a0Seawater density depends on temperature and salinity. Seawater has a high density due to low temperature and high salinity, which results in a falling sea level.\nAtmospheric pressure: Low pressure results in higher local sea levels and vice versa. E.g. Storm surge.\nThe velocity of ocean currents:\u00a0The edges of fast-moving ocean currents that follow curved paths experience an increase in sea level.\nGenerally, a difference of 18 cm in sea level is observed between the two sides of a fast-flowing current.\nIce formation and fall in sea level:\u00a0Sea levels fall during the winter as a result of ocean water being trapped in the icecaps of the northern and southern hemispheres.\nPiling up of water along windward coasts: As a result of an air mass pushing water toward the coast, the sea level rises locally in coastal areas. For instance, during the monsoon season, sea levels rise in south and east Asia as a result of the air mass moving inland.\n\nThe twentieth century has observed short-term global sea level rise due to the following factors.\n\nOcean water has expanded thermally in the past century as a result of anthropogenic global warming. In other words, in the last 100 years, the sea level has increased by 10 to 15 cm.\nTo some extent, the melting of Antarctica\u2019s ice sheets, which account for about 3% of the world\u2019s total ice mass, has contributed to the rise in sea level.\nAbout 15% of the Greenland ice cap\u2019s total volume melted during the 20th century.\nOther glaciers are estimated to have contributed about 48% of the rise in sea level globally, in addition to these ice-melt regions.\n\nLong-Term\n\nOnly if the major ice sheets melt or the volume of the world\u2019s mid-oceanic ridge significantly changes are global sea level changes of more than 100 m possible.\nIMPACT OF SEA LEVEL FALL\nCoral reefs perish when the sea level drops because the continental shelves where they are formed become dry. Therefore, along the edge of the dead corals, new coral reefs appear.\nThe decrease in sea level causes more aridity in the continental hinterland where there are shallow continental shelves because there is less surface runoff.\nIce caps and glacial tongues spread out onto the continental shelves as a result of a decline in sea levels in temperate and high-latitude regions.\nIMPACT OF POSSIBLE RISE IN SEA LEVEL\n\nIf the atmosphere\u2019s temperature rises further, Antarctica\u2019s ice melt could become hazardous soon.\n\nLow-lying, densely populated coastal areas, which make up a significant portion of the populated land, will be submerged. Even the tiny islands will perish.\n\nA rise in sea levels will have an impact on the estimated one billion people living on the planet.\n\nImmense damage may be caused to coastal structures like ports, industrial establishments, etc.\nNearly 33% of the world\u2019s croplands may be submerged due to the rise in sea level (coastal plains and deltas are made up of very fertile soils).\nAccelerated coastal erosion may cause damage to and destruction of beaches, coastal dunes, and bars.\nAs a consequence, a vast section of the coastal land will remain unprotected against the direct attack of sea waves.\nGroundwater resources of the coastal regions will be severely affected by salinization due to marine water intrusion.\n\nThe destruction of the reefs, coral atolls, and deltas will cause significant harm to the ecosystem. On the periphery of the dead corals, new coral reefs will form.\n\nThe mouths of drainage basins will be submerged due to the rise in sea level. The long profiles of the rivers will need to be readjusted as a result, and they probably show a rise.\n\nThe recent rise in sea level has had the greatest impact on islands. The Carteret Islands, which are in the Pacific Ocean northeast of Papua New Guinea, and the Tuvalu Islands, which are in the South Pacific about 1000 km north of Fiji, are two of the islands that are impacted.\n\nThe United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP) established the \u201cOceans and Coastal Areas Programme Activity Centre\u201d in 1987 to investigate the phenomenon of sea level rise and to determine which nations are most at risk of submersion.\n\nReducing Carbon in the Atmosphere to Fight Climate Change.\n\nHalf of the world\u2019s electricity is generated by burning coal. Coal will remain a dominant energy source for years to come.\n\nCO2 and CO (carbon monoxide)\u00a0are the major greenhouse gas that is released during the burning of coal.\nAlong with the above gases,\u00a0nitrogen oxides (destroys ozone)\u00a0and\u00a0sulphur oxides (acid rains)\u00a0are also released.\nClean coal technology seeks to reduce harsh environmental effects by using multiple technologies to\u00a0clean coal and contain its emissions.\nSome clean coal technologies purify the coal before it burns.\n\nOne type of coal preparation, coal washing,\u00a0removes unwanted minerals\u00a0by mixing crushed coal with a liquid and allowing the impurities to separate and settle.\n\nOther systems control the coal burn to minimize emissions of sulphur dioxide, nitrogen oxides, and particulates.\n\nElectrostatic precipitators\u00a0remove particulates by charging particles with an electrical field and then capturing them on collection plates.\nGasification avoids burning coal altogether. With gasification, steam and hot pressurized air or oxygen combine with coal in a reaction that forces carbon molecules apart.\nThe resulting\u00a0syngas,\u00a0a mixture of carbon monoxide and hydrogen, is then cleaned and burned in a gas turbine to make electricity.\n\nWet scrubbers, or\u00a0flue gas desulfurization systems, remove sulphur dioxide, a major cause of acid rain, by spraying flue gas with limestone and water.\n\nLow-NOx (nitrogen oxides) burners reduce the creation of nitrogen oxides,\u00a0a cause of ground-level ozone, by restricting oxygen and manipulating the combustion process.\n\nCARBON CAPTURE AND STORAGE\n\n\u2018Carbon capture and storage catches and sequesters (hides) carbon dioxide (CO2) from stationary sources like power plants.\n\nCapture: Flue-gas separation removes CO2 and condenses it into a concentrated CO2 stream.\nAfter capture, secure containers sequester the collected CO2 to prevent or stall its re-entry into the atmosphere.\nThe two storage options are\u00a0geologic and oceanic\u00a0(must hide the CO2 until peak emissions subside hundreds of years from now).\nDue to this rise in atmospheric carbon, much emphasis has been placed on and hope placed on soil, plants, and trees\u2019 capacity to temporarily store the carbon that burning fossil fuels releases into the atmosphere.\nThe Kyoto Protocol, the primary tool used by the international community to stop global warming, suggests that reducing carbon dioxide emissions from fossil fuels while also allowing trees and soil to absorb carbon dioxide is a valid strategy.\n\nRead:\u00a0Black carbon emissions\n\nArticle Written by: Remya"

A National Knowledge Network (NKN) has been constituted with a group of experts from different reputed academic or research institutes in the country. These institutes will help the State and city level administrations in strategizing and taking up measures to tackle air pollution at local levels in a scientific, effective and efficient manner.\nThe Ministry also launched recently a national portal for the National Clean Air Program \u201cPRANA\u201d -the Portal for Regulation of Air Pollution in Non-Attainment Cities which provides all information related to various policies or programs or schemes or activities of the stakeholders along with the progress made towards improvement in air quality across the country.

A small percentage (less than 0.1%) of this is surface water, which is found in rivers, lakes, reservoirs, the atmosphere, and all living things. About half of this is frozen in snow, glaciers, and icecaps.\n\nWater is constantly circulating between the oceans, continents, and atmosphere in a system called the hydrologic cycle. This circulation is driven by a combination of the energy from the sun, geological processes, and gravity.\n\nMost of the world\u2019s freshwater is not easily accessible to humans.\n\nApproximately 69 percent of Earth\u2019s\u00a0freshwater\u00a0is locked away in the form of ice in glaciers and polar ice caps.\nAnother 30 percent of Earth\u2019s freshwater is under the surface in the form of\u00a0groundwater.\n\nThat leaves only about one percent of Earth\u2019s freshwater readily available for human use.\n\nUnfortunately, the available surface freshwater is not equally distributed throughout the world.\n\n\ud83d\udc49 Which year are YOU targeting for success in the IAS/IPS/IFS Exam? \ud83d\ude80\n\n(1) \u21d2 UPSC 2025: Prelims cum Mains\n\n(2) \u21d2 UPSC 2026: Prelims cum Mains\n\n(3) \u21d2 UPSC 2027 Prelims cum Mains\n\nTip: Know more about ClearIAS Courses (Online/Offline)\n\nBrazil, Russia, Canada, Indonesia, China, Colombia, and the United States have most of the world\u2019s surface freshwater resources.\nAs a result, approximately one-fifth of the world\u2019s population lives in water-scarce areas.\n\nThis lack of water affects people\u2019s access to clean, usable water, as well as the economic development and geopolitics of different areas.\n\nTable of Contents\n\nState of Global Water Resources report 2021\nKey findings of the Global water resources report\nRegion-wise findings of the report\nRecommendations in the report\nWay forward\nState of Global Water Resources report 2021\n\nWMO has published its first State of Global Water Resources report to assess the effects of climate, environmental and societal change on the Earth\u2019s water resources.\n\nThis annual stocktake aims to support the monitoring and management of global freshwater resources in an era of growing demand and limited supplies.\n\nThe report gives an overview of river flow, as well as major floods and droughts.\n\nThe first edition of the report looks at streamflow \u2013 the volume of water flowing through a river channel at any given time.\nIt also assesses terrestrial water storage \u2013 all water on the land surface and sub-surface and the cryosphere (frozen water).\nKey findings of the Global water resources report\n\nThe report underlined that large parts of the world were drier than normal in 2021 with cascading effects on economies, ecosystems, and our daily lives.\n\nThe year saw precipitation patterns largely influenced by climate change and the La Nina event. The general observations in the report are:\n\nThe area with below-average streamflow was approximately two times larger than the above-average area, in comparison to the 30-year hydrological average.\nAnnual glacier runoff increased initially due to the melting of glaciers until the turning point called peak water is reached after which the runoff declines.\n74% of all-natural disasters between 2001 and 2018 were water-related.\n6 billion people face inadequate access to water at least a month per year which is expected to reach 5 billion by 2050.\nThe continued melting of glaciers shows a clear trend toward an acceleration of mass loss on multidecadal timescales.\nIt highlights the lack of accessible verified hydrological data.\nRegion-wise findings of the report\n\nIn Africa, major rivers such as the Niger, Volta, Nile, and Congo had below-average water flow in 2021.\n\nThe same trend was observed in rivers in parts of Russia, West Siberia, and in Central Asia.\n\nThere were above-normal river volumes in some\u00a0North\u00a0American basins, the North Amazon and South Africa, as well as in China\u2019s Amur river basin, and northern India.\n\nThe impacts of climate change are often felt through water \u2013 more intense and frequent droughts, more extreme flooding, more erratic seasonal rainfall, and accelerated melting of glaciers are some of the cascading effects.\n\nTerrestrial cover:\n\nAside from river flow variations, overall terrestrial water storage was classified as below normal on the west coast of the United States, in central South America and Patagonia, North Africa and Madagascar, Central Asia and the Middle East, Pakistan, and North India.\n\nIt was above normal in Central Africa, northern South America \u2013 specifically the Amazon Basin \u2013 and northern China.\n\nCryosphere:\n\nThe cryosphere \u2013 namely glaciers, snow cover, ice caps, and, where present, permafrost \u2013 is the world\u2019s biggest natural reservoir of freshwater.\n\nChanges to cryosphere water resources affect food security, human health, ecosystem integrity, and maintenance, and lead to significant impacts on economic and social development.\n\nThe year saw river flooding and flash floods due to glacier lake outbursts.\n\nRecommendations in the report\n\nThere is insufficient understanding of changes in the distribution, quantity, and quality of freshwater resources, The State of Global Water Resources report\u00a0aims to fill that knowledge gap and provide a concise overview of water availability in different parts of the world.\n\nInvest in filling the capacity gap in collecting data at the national level.\nIncrease sharing of hydrological data at the international level.\nDevelopment of end-to-end drought and flood early warning systems.\nWorking together as a global hydrological community on developing annual State of Global Water Resources etc.\nThe long-term projections of glacier run-off and the timing of peak water, are key inputs to long-term adaptation decisions.\n\nThe idea is to inform climate adaptation and mitigation investments as well as the United Nations campaign to provide universal access in the next five years too early warnings of hazards such as floods and droughts.\n\nWay forward\n\nWMO\u2019s Unified Data Policy seeks to accelerate the availability and sharing of hydrological data, including river discharge and transboundary river basin information.

Acid Rain occurs when atmospheric pollutants such as oxides of nitrogen and sulphur, interact with rainwater and fall as a result.\n\nOxides of Sulphur and Nitrogen reaches the atmosphere from vehicular emissions, Industrial outlets\u2026etc.\n\nThere are two methods for acidic deposition: wet and dry.\n\nThe type of precipitation that removes acids from the atmosphere and deposits them on the earth\u2019s surface is referred to as wet deposition.\n\nDry deposition of harmful gases and particles binds to the ground through dust and smoke in the absence of precipitation.\n\nAccording to the Royal Society of Chemistry, The word \u201dacid rain\u201d was invented by Scottish chemist Robert Angus Smith in 1852.\n\n\ud83d\udc49 Which year are YOU targeting for success in the IAS/IPS/IFS Exam? \ud83d\ude80\n\n(1) \u21d2 UPSC 2025: Prelims cum Mains\n\n(2) \u21d2 UPSC 2026: Prelims cum Mains\n\n(3) \u21d2 UPSC 2027 Prelims cum Mains\n\nTip: Know more about ClearIAS Courses (Online/Offline)\n\nTable of Contents\n\nCauses of Acid Rain\nChemistry of Acid Rain\nActual Case Studies\nHarmful effects of acid rain\nImpacts on humans\nImpacts on soil\nImpacts on aquatic life\nImpacts on terrestrial life\nImpacts on microorganisms\nImpacts on buildings, monuments and materials\nAcid Rain Areas in India\nHow to control acid rain?\nCauses of Acid Rain\n\nAcid rain is caused by particles of sulphur and nitrogen that mix with rain.\n\nThe particles of sulphur and nitrogen that mix with water can be generated by two sources: either man-made emissions from industries or natural events like lightning strikes that release nitrogen oxides and sulphur oxide, into the atmosphere.\n\nChemistry of Acid Rain\n\nSix basic steps are involved in the formation of acid rain:\n\nBoth natural and artificial sources contribute sulphur and nitrogen oxides to the atmosphere.\nEither close to the source or some distance away, some of these oxides return to the ground as dry deposition.\nIn the atmosphere, sunlight encourages the production of photo-oxidants like ozone.\nThese photo-oxidants interact with the sulphate and nitrate oxides of nitrogen and other gases (such as NH3) to form sulfuric acid (H2SO4) and nitric acid (HNO3) through oxidation.\nAcid rain that includes the ions hydrogen, sulphate, nitrate, and ammonium falls as moist deposition.\n\n2SO2\u00a0(g) + O2\u00a0(g) + 2H2O (l) \u2192 2H2SO4\u00a0(aq)\n4NO2\u00a0(g) + O2\u00a0(g) + 2H2O (l) \u2192 4HNO3\u00a0(aq)\n\nActual Case Studies\n\nOne of the seven wonders of the world, the Taj Mahal, is significantly impacted by acid rain.\n\nNumerous industries in the city of Agra release sulphur and nitrogen oxides into the atmosphere. This issue is made worse by the continued use of firewood and poor-quality coal for domestic purposes.\n\nThe Statue of Liberty, which is constructed of copper and has also been harmed by the cumulative impact of acid rain and oxidation for over 30 years, is turning green as a result of the production of calcium sulphate.\n\nHarmful effects of acid rain\n\nAcid precipitation has negative impacts on both aquatic and terrestrial animals, as well as on structures like monuments and buildings.\n\nImpacts on humans\nSome immediate effects include cancer, pulmonary emphysema, chronic bronchitis, decreased visibility, and irritation of the skin, eyes, and respiratory system.\nImpacts on soil\nMaking the soil infertile, by exchange of nutrients like potassium and magnesium in the soil causes the leaching.\nThe pace of decomposition is slowed down by an increase in ammonia in the soil as a result of a decline in other nutrients. It is also discovered that the soil\u2019s nitrate content is dropping.\nImpacts on aquatic life\n\u00a0 Fish, frogs, and other aquatic creatures\u2019 eggs and sperm are sensitive to pH fluctuations, and as a result s acid rain causes ecological imbalance.\nAcidic lake waters have the potential to destroy bacteria and microbes and make them unproductive.\nImpacts on terrestrial life\nAcidic environments encourage the leaching of heavy metals including aluminium, lead, and mercury. Such metals have an impact on soil microflora and fauna when they seep into groundwater.\nAcidic rain damages the cuticle of plant leaves and decreases photosynthesis.\nThe loss or modification of food and habitat resources are additional indirect effects of acid rain on wildlife.\nImpacts on microorganisms\n\nThe growth of any microbial species depends on pH.\n\nNear neutrality is the pH where most bacteria and protozoa thrive.\nAcidic environments are preferred by most fungi.\nAlkaline environments are preferred by the majority of blue-green microorganisms.\n\nThe result is a delay in the decomposition of soil organic material as microbial species in the soil and water switch from being attached to bacteria to fungi.\n\nImpacts on buildings, monuments and materials\nAcid rain has a negative impact on many old, historic, and ancient structures as well as works of art, textiles, and other materials. Acid rain also erodes marble and limestone\n\u00a0Acid vapours in the air lead them to gradually erode or flake away from the surfaces of many structures and monuments, including the Taj Mahal in Agra (Marble Cancer).\nAcid Rain Areas in India\nBombay, India, reported acid rain for the first time in 1974.\nMetropolitan cities have reported experiencing acid rain.\nThere have been reports of lowering soil pH in portions of Orissa, West Bengal, Bihar, coastal Karnataka, and Kerala.\n\nAlso read: Climate change: Causes and effects, Global warming: Impact on the global climate\n\nHow to control acid rain?\n\nMinimizing the levels of sulphur dioxide and nitrous oxides\n\nAcid rain incidences can be decreased by using low-sulfur fuel, natural gas, or washed coal (removing Sulphur content) in thermal plants.\nScrubbers can be placed at the power plant to remove sulphur dioxide from gases leaving the smokestack.\n\nAcid neutralizer\n\nBuffering: Increasing the pH of acidified water by adding a neutralising substance. Typically, calcium oxide and calcium carbonate, both forms of lime, are used.\nLiming: is the application of calcium- and magnesium-rich substances, such as marl, chalk, limestone, burnt lime, or hydrated lime, in a variety of forms since these substances generally react as a base in acid soils and neutralise acidity\nStream liming: This involves adding fine-particle lime or other buffering minerals directly to a stream or river waters, allowing for fast acid neutralisation and a corresponding increase in water pH.\n\nCleaner Cars\n\nOne of the technologies utilised in cars is the catalytic converter. This piece of machinery has been used to reduce the amount of nitrogen oxides produced by vehicles for more than 20 years.\nCars can also run on cleaner fuels, such as natural gas, and electric vehicles.\n\nFlue Gas Desulphurization\n\nFlue-gas desulfurization (FGD) is a group of technologies used to remove sulphur dioxide (SO2) from the exhaust flue gases of fossil-fuel power plants as well as from other sulphur oxide-producing processes, such as waste incineration.\nIt has been tried to remove fly ash and SO2 in a single scrubbing vessel.\nMost FGD systems feature two stages: one for removing fly ash and another for removing SO 2.\n\nOne great way to stop acid rain is to produce energy without using fossil fuels. As an alternative, people can use sustainable energy sources like wind and solar energy. Renewable energy sources contribute to a reduction in acid rain since they generate significantly fewer pollutants.\n\nArticle written by Aryadevi"

Today, it accords varying degrees of protection to more than 37,000 species of animals and plants, whether they are traded as live specimens, fur coats, or dried herbs.\n\nFunctioning of CITES\nCITES Global Trade View\n\nCITES works by subjecting international trade in specimens of selected species to certain controls.\n\nAll import, export, re-export, and introduction from the sea of species covered by the Convention has to be authorized through a licensing system.\nEach Party to the Convention must designate one or more Management Authorities in charge of administering that licensing system and one or more Scientific Authorities to advise them on the effects of trade on the status of the species.\n\nThe species covered by CITES are listed in\u00a0three Appendices, according to the degree of protection they need:\n\nAppendices I and II\n\nAppendix I includes species threatened with extinction. Trade in specimens of these species is permitted only in exceptional circumstances.\n\nAppendix II includes species not necessarily threatened with extinction, but in which trade must be controlled to avoid utilization incompatible with their survival.\n\nAppendix III\n\nThis Appendix contains species protected in at least one country, which has asked other CITES Parties for assistance in controlling the trade. Changes to Appendix III follow a distinct procedure from changes to Appendices I and II, as each Party is entitled to make unilateral amendments to it.\n\nCITES COP19 2022\n\nDraft decisions on lowering the likelihood of zoonotic illnesses in the future have been completed at the 19th Conference of Parties (COP19) to the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species (CITES).\n\nThe directives were created in response to the rise of diseases linked to transnational wildlife trading. COVID-19 is a zoonotic illness that spread from animals to people and turned into a pandemic.\nCITES advised parties to consult with organizations like the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO), the World Health Organization (WHO), the International Consortium on Combating Wildlife Crime, and the Convention on Biological Diversity and other pertinent biodiversity-related agreements.\nThe aim was to identify possible emerging threats and reduce the risks of spreading pathogens, their spillover, and transmission of zoonotic diseases via international wildlife trade supply chains.\nThe decision was taken to consider a multi-sectoral approach guided by the one health expert panel for managing and mitigating pathogen spillover.\nIndia and CITES COP19\n\nIn a step forward towards conservation, two Indian turtle species \u2013 the red-crowned roofed turtles (Batagur kachuga) and Leith\u2019s soft-shell turtle (Nilssonia leithii) \u2013 have made it to Appendix I of the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species (CITES).\n\nRed-crowned roofed turtle is native to India, Nepal, and Bangladesh and known to be widely found in the Ganga and Brahmaputra river basins, according to the Wildlife Institute of India (WII). At present in India, the National Chambal River Gharial Sanctuary is the only geographic area where the species is found in substantial numbers.\nLeith\u2019s soft-shell turtle inhabits rivers and reservoirs mainly in southern peninsular India, in states like Odisha, Madhya Pradesh, Karnataka, Andhra Pradesh, Kerala, Maharashtra, and Tamil Nadu. Its presence is substantial in the Cauvery, Tungabhadra, Ghataprabha, Bhavani, Godavari, and Moyar drainages.\n\nCITES relaxed restrictions on the export of furniture and handicrafts made of North Indian rosewood or\u00a0shisham\u00a0(Dalbergia sissoo) from India on November 21, 2022.\n\nIndia has decided not to vote against a proposal to re-open the international trade in ivory at the ongoing conference of the\u00a0CITES.\n\nThe\u00a0ivory trade\u00a0was globally\u00a0banned in 1989 when all\u00a0African elephant\u00a0populations were put in CITES Appendix I.\nThe ivory trade was globally banned in 1989 when all African elephant populations were put in CITES Appendix I.\nIndia has been a vocal opponent of the international ivory trade for over three decades.\nIt is the first time India has not voted against a request to reopen the ivory trade since joining the CITES in 1976.\nThe endangered\u00a0Asian elephant\u00a0was\u00a0included in CITES Appendix I in 1975,\u00a0which banned the export of ivory from the Asian range countries.\nIn 1986, India amended the Wild Life (Protection) Act, of 1972 to ban even domestic sales of ivory.

This is said to be due to depleting terrestrial deposits of metals such as copper, nickel, aluminum, manganese, zinc, lithium, and cobalt.\n\nDemand for these metals is also increasing to produce technologies like smartphones, wind turbines, solar panels, and batteries.\n\nDeep-sea mining is a potential source of critical and other minerals that may enable new technologies, such as extended-range electric cars, lighter rechargeable batteries, and more weather-resistant wind turbines.\n\nWhat are polymetallic nodules?\nImage Courtesy: IUCN\n\nPolymetallic nodules were discovered at the end of the 19th century in the Kara Sea, in the Arctic Ocean off Siberia (1868). During the scientific expeditions of the H.M.S. Challenger (1872\u201376), they were found to occur in most oceans of the world.\n\nPolymetallic nodules, also called manganese nodules, are rock concretions formed of concentric layers of iron and manganese hydroxides around a core. The core may be microscopically small and is sometimes completely transformed into manganese minerals by crystallization.\n\nConcerns related to Deep Sea Mining\n\nResearch suggests deep-sea mining could severely harm marine biodiversity and ecosystems, but we still lack the knowledge and means to implement protections.\n\nAs the deep sea remains understudied and poorly understood, there are many gaps in our understanding of its biodiversity and ecosystems.\n\nThis makes it difficult to assess the potential impacts of deep-sea mining or to put in place adequate safeguards to protect the marine environment, and the three billion people whose livelihoods depend on marine and coastal biodiversity.\n\nDisturbance of the seafloor\n\nThe digging and gauging of the ocean floor by machines can alter or destroy deep-sea habitats.\n\nThis leads to the loss of species, many of which are found nowhere else, and the fragmentation or loss of ecosystem structure and function.\nIt is the most direct impact of deep-sea mining and the damage caused is most likely permanent.\n\nSediment plumes\n\nDeep-sea mining will stir up fine sediments on the seafloor, creating plumes of suspended particles.\n\nThis is exacerbated by mining ships discharging wastewater at the surface.\nScientists are concerned these particles may disperse for hundreds of kilometers, take a long time to resettle on the seafloor, and affect ecosystems and commercially important or vulnerable species.\nFor instance, such plumes could smother animals, harm filter-feeding species, and block animals\u2019 visual communication.\n\nPollution\n\nSpecies such as whales, tuna, and sharks could be affected by noise, vibrations, and light pollution caused by mining equipment and surface vessels, as well as potential leaks and spills of fuel and toxic products.\nIndian initiatives\nRecently a national science award was presented to Indian scientists who conducted the\u00a0world\u2019s first locomotive trials of a deep-sea mining system in the central Indian ocean.\nDeep Ocean Mission was initiated to develop technologies required for exploring and extracting minerals from the deep seabed.\nPromotion of blue economy through various projects and initiatives.\nIn news\n\nAn unknown process is producing oxygen deep in the world\u2019s oceans, where it is\u00a0too dark for photosynthesis, scientists reported on July 22 in the journal\u00a0Nature Geoscience.\n\nThe finding has important implications because oxygen helps support life and the discovery implies the existence of previously unknown ecosystems.\nMany governments are also bound to take notice since one explanation for the oxygen is that polymetallic nodules are transporting electric charges that split water molecules around them, releasing oxygen.\nPolymetallic nodules are lumps of iron, manganese hydroxides, and rock partially submerged in many parts of the ocean floor.\nIf their concentration\u00a0exceeds 10 kg per sq. m, mining them is considered to be economically feasible \u2014 and many countries are planning to do so as a new resource.\nWay forward\n\nAt the IUCN World Conservation Congress in Marseille (September 2021), IUCN Members adopted\u00a0Resolution 122 to protect deep-ocean ecosystems and biodiversity through a\u00a0moratorium on deep-sea mining\u00a0unless and until several conditions are met. These include:\n\nThe risks of mining are comprehensively understood and effective protection can be ensured;\nRigorous and transparent impact assessments are conducted based on comprehensive baseline studies;\nThe Precautionary Principle and the \u2018Polluter Pays Principle are implemented;\nPolicies incorporating circular economic principles to reuse and recycle minerals have been developed and implemented;\nThe public is consulted throughout decision-making;\nThe governance of deep-sea mining is transparent, accountable, inclusive, effective, and environmentally responsible.\n\nReliance on metals from mining can be reduced by redesigning, reusing, and recycling.\n\nIn addition, research should focus on creating more sustainable alternatives to their use because deep-sea mining could irreparably harm marine ecosystems, and limit the many benefits the deep sea provides to humanity.\n\nRead: Offshore areas minerals\n\n-Article written by Swathi Satish"

Nestle\nConclusion\nWhat is Greenwashing?\n\nThe act of giving the impression that a company\u2019s products are ecologically friendly is known as \u201cgreenwashing.\u201d Greenwashing is the practice of making unfounded claims that lead consumers to believe that a company\u2019s products are more environmentally friendly or have a bigger positive influence on the environment than they actually do.\n\n\ud83d\udc49 Which year are YOU targeting for success in the IAS/IPS/IFS Exam? \ud83d\ude80\n\n(1) \u21d2 UPSC 2025: Prelims cum Mains\n\n(2) \u21d2 UPSC 2026: Prelims cum Mains\n\n(3) \u21d2 UPSC 2027 Prelims cum Mains\n\nTip: Know more about ClearIAS Courses (Online/Offline)\n\nGreenwashing can also happen when a business tries to hide its involvement in ecologically harmful actions by emphasising the sustainable qualities of a product. Greenwashing is a play on the term \u201cwhitewashing,\u201d which refers to using anything as deceptive words or actions, used to cover up or gloss over faults, errors, or wrongdoings, or to absolve a wrongdoer from blame. It is carried out through the use of environmental imagery, misleading labels, and hiding tradeoffs\n\nHow does Greenwashing work?\nGreenwashing also referred to as \u201cgreen sheen,\u201d is an effort to profit from the rising demand for environmentally sound products, whether that means they are more natural, healthier, chemical-free, recyclable, or less resource-intensive.\nThe phrase first appeared in the 1960s, when one of the most overt instances of greenwashing was created by the hotel business. In order to conserve the environment, they posted signs in hotel rooms requesting that guests reuse their towels. The hotels benefited from cheaper laundry expenses.\nSome of the greatest carbon polluters in the world, including conventional energy firms, have recently tried to reinvent themselves as environmental champions. By changing their names, brands, or packaging, products can be \u201cgreenwashed.\u201d Products that have been \u201cgreenwashed\u201d may give consumers the impression that they are healthier, more natural, or chemical-free than rival brands.\nThrough press releases and advertisements praising their clean energy or pollution reduction initiatives, businesses have engaged in \u201cgreenwashing.\u201d In actuality, it\u2019s possible that the corporation isn\u2019t really committing to green activities. Simply said, corporations that assert frivolously that their goods are safe for the environment or offer some other form of environmental benefit are engaging in greenwashing.\nWhat is Green marketing?\n\nThe promotion of ecologically friendly goods, services, and projects is known as green marketing or environmental marketing. A wide range of techniques and strategies that are friendly to the environment is more particularly referred to as green marketing. Examples of green marketing include:\n\nMaking environmentally friendly goods\nUtilizing environmentally friendly, recycled-materials-based packaging for goods\nLowering industrial process emissions of greenhouse gases\nImplementing sustainable business methods\nMarketing initiatives describing a product\u2019s environmental advantages\nPutting the money earned into carbon-offset projects or renewable energy\n\nGreen marketing, which emphasises the environmental advantages of the product and the firm producing it, can help products that are really environmentally friendly. However, if a business\u2019s green marketing initiatives are shown to be fraudulent, the business may be charged with greenwashing and suffer penalties, negative news, and reputational harm.\n\nAlso Read: Climate financing ,COP 26\u00a0\n\nExamples of Greenwashing\n1. Volkswagen\nGreenwashing is evident in Volkswagen\u2019s admission that it cheated on emissions testing by fitting a variety of cars with a \u201cdefect\u201d device that incorporated software that could detect when an emissions test was being conducted and adjust the performance to reduce the emissions level.\nThe company\u2019s public marketing initiatives during this time emphasised the low emissions and environmentally beneficial features of their vehicles. In reality, these engines were emitting up to 40 times the permitted level of nitrogen oxide.\n2. Innocent Drinks\nInnocent Drinks has come under fire from environmental organisations for \u201cgreenwashing\u201d after releasing an advertisement that implies buying its smoothies could help save the earth. According to Plastics Rebellion, Innocent has been warned to stop making future advertising that they have dubbed \u201cgreenwashing.\n\u201cInnocent Drinks does the greatest job of illustrating the unlikely tactic. The company is owned by Coca-Cola, which is the worst polluter of plastic in the world. Additionally, the company uses single-use plastic, which is harmful to the environment.\n3. IKEA\nIKEA, the company that uses the most wood worldwide, has expanded its usage of wood over the past ten years. IKEA has been making beechwood chairs out of wood that has been illegally taken from the Carpathian Mountains in Ukraine, which are home to creatures on the endangered species list like bears, lynxes, wolves, and bison. This is according to a study by Earthsight.\n4. Windex\nSC Johnson\u2019s glass cleaner made the claim that all of its bottles were made of \u201cocean plastic.\u201d Actually, the plastic used to make the bottles had never been in the water. It was taken from plastic banks in Haiti, the Philippines, and Indonesia.\nThis particular type of plastic is known as ocean-bound plastic since it would have otherwise ended up in the ocean.But the poor advertising doesn\u2019t end there. Despite Windex\u2019s claims that its products are non-toxic, SC Johnson was sued in 2020 on the basis that certain of Windex\u2019s ingredients are harmful to people, pets, and the environment.\n5. Nestle\nNestl\u00e9 declared that by 2025, it \u201cambitions\u201d that all of its packagings will be recyclable or reusable. Environmental organisations and other critics condemned the company for failing to establish clear targets, offer a timetable for attaining them, or take additional steps to promote customer recycling.\nGreenpeace responded by issuing a statement of its own, claiming that Nestl\u00e9\u2019s announcement on plastic packaging was just another example of the company \u201cgreenwashing\u201d its way out of a problem that it had helped create.\nConclusion\n\nOf course, not every business engages in greenwashing. There are some goods that are truly green. These items typically have packaging that clearly states how they vary from equivalent versions from competitors. Genuinely green product marketers are more than eager to provide specifics regarding the positive features of their goods.\n\nArticle Written by: Archana"

In August 2022, the Cabinet approved an update of India\u2019s NDC. The updated NDC has led to major policies being pushed forward, including\n\nelectric vehicles (EVs)\nco-firing of biomass pellets in thermal power plants by 7 percent\nethanol blending in petrol by 20 percent\ninclusion of agroforestry and private forestry\nsolarization of agricultural pumps\nclean cooking (by shifting to liquefied petroleum gas (LPG)\nrooftop solar PV.\n\nThe Government of India is considering coal gasification, conversion of coal into chemical projects, and ammonia, and hydrogen as future fuels.\n\nEnergy storage is supported through a production-linked scheme to promote renewable energy.\nIn recognition of the role of lifestyles, the movement Lifestyle for Environment has been proposed to foster a citizen-centric approach to combat climate change.\nThe Lok Sabha passed the Energy Conservation (Amendment) Bill on 9 August 2022, aiming to facilitate the establishment and development of domestic carbon markets.\nThe markets\u2019 objective is to incentivize actions for emission reduction expected to result in increased investments in clean energy and energy efficiency areas, especially in the private sector.\n\nWith respect to food systems, legumes such as beans, peas, and lentils increase the release of ammonium nitrogen into the soil.\n\nThe greater availability of nitrogen in the soil can reduce the need for nitrogen fertilizers for other crops when legumes are used in rotations or as cover crops or intercrops.\nIndia has observed a consistent increase in the production of legumes in the last five years.\nIn 2020, some states decided to include pulses in the Public Distribution Package that previously only included wheat and rice to further encourage production.\nWay forward\n\nRapid reductions in emissions of methane and other short-lived climatic pollutants must be made in addition to CO2 emission reductions in order to lower peak warming, lessen the chance of overshoot, and lessen the need for CO2 removal techniques to limit warming later in this century.\n\nTo realize this, a Global Methane Pledge was announced at the United Nations Climate Change Conference of the Parties (COP) 26, with the aim to reduce global anthropogenic methane emissions by at least 30 percent by 2030 from 2020 levels.\n\nSo far, 122 countries have joined the pledge, covering half of the global methane emissions and nearly two-thirds of the global economy.\nLarge methane emitters such as Australia, China, India, Iran, and the Russian Federation have yet to join the pledge, and efforts to track its implementation are still in the process of being established.\n\nNeither current policies nor NDCs put emissions on track to limit global warming to the temperature goal of the Paris Agreement.\n\nTaking more ambitious climate actions by 2030 is urgently needed and is of utmost importance for getting the world on track to meeting the Paris Agreement.\n\nPoverty alleviation remains a prime goal of low-income countries, and agricultural development will remain a key part of their development strategies, with climate actions more focused on adaptation than mitigation.\n\nAn important objective is therefore to ensure that rural transformation is placed on a low emissions trajectory.\n\nThe Glasgow Leaders\u2019 Declaration on Forests and Land Use reaffirms the critical role of forests \u201cin enabling the world to meet its sustainable development goals\u201d and the need to \u201creduce, halt, and reverse forest loss and land degradation by 2030\u201d.\n\nThe Forest, Agriculture, and Commodity Trade Roadmap aim to halt forest loss associated with agricultural commodity production and trade, joined by 28 countries and 12 companies so far that holds a considerable market share in forest commodities (that is, in soy, palm oil, cocoa, and cattle).\n\nThe High Ambition Coalition for Nature and People includes nearly 100 countries that push for the ratification of ambitious post-2020 biodiversity targets at the upcoming Convention on Biological Diversity, such as placing 30 percent of the territory under protection by 2030.\n\n\u00ad-Article written by Swathi Satish"

And vehicular pollution is also a cause of nitrogen pollution.\n\nNitrogen from food and wastewater:\u00a0An enormous amount of nitrogen-rich waste is generated during the food supply and production cycle by both people and animals.\nStormwater: When rain or snow falls on our cities and towns, it runs through hard surfaces like sidewalks, roads, and rooftops and dumps pollutants into nearby waterways, including nitrogen and phosphorus.\nFossil Fuels:\u00a0Through the usage of fossil fuels, nitrogen levels in the atmosphere have increased in the production of electric power, industry, transportation, and agriculture.\nWastewater treatment: Facilities\u00a0that do not specifically remove nitrogen can also lead to excess levels of nitrogen on the surface or groundwater.\nNitrous oxide emissions from fertilizer use:\u00a0When used in excess, nitrogen fertilizers can be oxidized and lost to the air as nitrous oxide.\nVehicular pollution:\u00a0mostly as a result of trucks, tempos, and other diesel-powered cars. The effects of cleaner fuel and pollution technology are countered by these automobiles.\nImpact of Nitrogen Pollution\n\nThe impacts of nitrogen pollution include acid rain, abnormal growth of algae on water bodies, deterioration of soil microbes and acidification, intensifying the greenhouse effect, leading to photochemical smog, decrease in biodiversity level, groundwater pollution, high cost of water treatment, etc.\n\n1. Acid Rain\n\nDuring precipitation, surplus nitrogen oxide compounds and sulfate oxides mix with oxygen molecules and other atmospheric components to produce acid rain.\n\nInfrastructure as well as cattle, plants, aquatic plantations, and animals are all harmed by nitric acid rain.\n\n2. Abnormal growth of algae on water bodies\n\nNitrogen pollution often results in Eutrophication\u00a0\u2013 the abnormal growth of algae on water bodies.\n\nAlgae produce harmful neurotoxins\u00a0that are harmful to livestock, aquatic animals, and humans.\n\nThere is a higher danger of respiratory illnesses and other potentially life-threatening problems including cancer when people consume fish and other aquatic creatures that have eaten algae.\n\n3. Deterioration of soil microbes and acidification\n\nThe PH of the soil can be either acidic or alkaline depending on the kind of fertilizer applied.\n\nDue to their advantages for the expansion of plants, nitrogen-based fertilizers are one of the most popular choices for farmers.\n\nThe excess nitrogen that plants cannot absorb slowly leaches out through water runoffs.\n\nAmmonium-based fertilizer products generate high levels of acidity in soils.\n\nWhich drains all water molecules from the soil and leaves behind a large number of salt residues that dehydrate plants.\n\n4. Intensifying the greenhouse effect\n\nSolar energy released to the\u00a0earth\u2019s surface penetrates the atmosphere, and normally, it eventually rises back into space.\n\nHowever, the process of the sun\u2019s heat bouncing back to space is limited by the existence of large concentrations of chemicals in the atmosphere from greenhouses, especially nitrous oxides.\n\nInstead, it gets absorbed by these gases and is released back to the earth\u2019s surface.\n\nThe outcome of this is the intensification of the greenhouse effect (rising global temperatures).\n\n5. Leads to photochemical smog\n\nThis is created when the sun\u2019s radiation interacts with nitrogen oxides and other gases.\n\nThat is released into the atmosphere as a result of the combustion of fossil fuels.\n\n6. The decrease in biodiversity levels\n\nStudies conducted in Europe in 2010 revealed that the environment is highly exposed to nutrient pollution, posing a significant threat to the survival of various plant and animal species.\n\nWhen nutrient nitrogen levels are too high, plants, animals, and wildlife are exposed to contaminants that harm their life cycles and change the food chain.\n\n7. Groundwater pollution\n\nHigh levels of nitrogen are found in subterranean water in locations where farming is often practiced as a result of penetration from the soil brought on by water runoffs.\n\nMost often used for residential purposes, underground water can get contaminated by nitrogen-based fertilizers.\n\nThe high nitrogen content of drinking water and even animal protein that grazes on pastures nearby has been observed in reports from many parts of the world, particularly from regions that heavily employ nitrogen-based fertilizers.\n\n8. High costs of water treatment\n\nCleaning water to make it safe for plants and animals as well as for human consumption requires a lot of money from the government and environmental conservation organizations.\n\nReverse osmosis, distillation, and ion exchange units are used because simply boiling will not allow nitrate to be released from water.\n\n9. Loss in the tourism industry\n\nThe effects of nitrogen pollution, particularly eutrophication and the deterioration of coral reefs, make it difficult to engage in activities.\n\nThat would be a major tourist attraction for the aquamarine, such as recreational fishing, deep-sea diving, taking in the aesthetic qualities of nature, and other boat activities.\n\n10. Low revenue for fish farming\n\nThe primary cause of dead zones in aquatic bodies is an algal bloom.\n\nThe amount of fish produced by fish farming is decreased because fish are deprived of oxygen when algae decompose.\n\nFish-harming neurotoxins are released by certain types of algae, including blue-green and red-tide algae.\n\nSteps were taken to control Nitrogen Pollution\nMandatory neem-coated urea production:\u00a0Nitrogen is used most effectively when it is released from urea that has been coated with neem because it takes longer for plants to absorb.\nSoil Health Card:\u00a0It informs farmers about the nutritional state of their soil and offers suggestions for the right amount of nutrients to add to improve soil health and fertility. It has caused the consumption of nitrogen in agriculture to decline.\nBharat Stage Norms:\u00a0It aims to regulate the harmful emissions from vehicles, like carbon monoxide (CO), unburnt hydrocarbons (HC), Nitrogen Oxides (NOx), and Particulate matter (PM).\nThe National Air Quality Index (NAQI)\u00a0has been put into place, and nitrogen dioxide is one of the eight pollutants whose emission needs to be managed and tracked.\nInternational Initiatives\nGothenburg Protocol:\u00a0It aims to Abate Acidification, Eutrophication, and Ground-level Ozone and is a part of the Convention on Long-Range Transboundary Air Pollution.\nTo control and reduce emissions of sulfur dioxide (SO2), nitrogen oxides (NOx), ammonia (NH4), volatile organic compounds (VOCs), and Particulate Matter (PM) that are caused by human activities.\nInternational Nitrogen Initiative (INI):\u00a0The goal of this global initiative is to maximize nitrogen\u2019s advantageous contribution to the production of sustainable food. It was established in 2003 with support from the International Geosphere-Biosphere Program (IGBP) and the Scientific Committee on Problems of the Environment (SCOPE). The Indian government is also involved in this project.\nColombo Declaration on Sustainable Nitrogen Management: The declaration\u00a0aims to halve nitrogen waste by 2030.\nWay forward\n\nFertilizer production regulations\n\nGovernments all across the world should implement rigorous regulations that regulate the manufacture of fertilizers to decrease the amount of nutrient-based fertilizer that is circulating in the economy.\n\nUse of animal manure fertilizers\n\nManure from livestock\u00a0such as cows should be a go-to option as opposed to the use of synthetic fertilizers because the contents of synthetics are not at all-time safe for farm use.\n\nThe bodies of animals contain more than enough nutrients to support normal bodily functioning, and a significant portion is frequently excreted as manure.\n\nFrequent water monitoring\n\nIt may be possible to find any unexpected nutrient levels by keeping a proactive routine check-up of the water quality.\n\nThis will prevent nutrient contamination from getting out of control by helping to manage it.\n\n\u00a0The government can collaborate with organizations.\n\nThis will have access to laboratories and the right tools to check the nitrogen content of the water and the levels of nutritional nutrients to stop the abnormal growth of algae.\n\nWater aeration channels\n\nWater bodies with aeration, such as waterfalls, have a moving surface that discourages the formation of algae by preventing stagnant water.\n\nNormal conditions for algae blooming include warm, sunlit water that is not too turbulent and has a build-up of muck at the bottom.\n\nUse of safe herbicides\n\nThe market is flooded with herbicides with high nitrogen contents, making it difficult to control the algae situation.\n\nTo deal with the issue, significantly safer herbicides with low nitrogen concentrations need to be developed and regularly applied.\n\nThis plan should also include using the right amount of safe herbicides to help control algae growth.\n\nWhich will help avoid pollution and the contamination of water for domestic, agricultural, and industrial use.\n\nThis strategy should not just be limited to the introduction of safe herbicides.\n\nEstablish a beneficial buffer\n\nEstablishing a buffer between water bodies and deep-rooted vegetation helps stop waste and undesired nutrients from entering runoffs into the water.\n\nThis prevents the growth of algae\u00a0as well as\u00a0reduces water pollution\u00a0by\u00a0creating barriers that control infiltration.\n\nBiological augmentation\n\nThis is a reference to the process of introducing good bacteria to water bodies.\n\nBy breaking down fish waste and decomposing plants, it helps to diminish the food source for algae and also improves water clarity. This purifies the water.\n\nControl of sewer systems\n\nIf sewage is to be discharged into water systems, it should not only be dumped far from water bodies but also be treated to remove toxins and nutrients before being discarded.\n\nTo read more about Water Pollution and conservation methods click here\n\nArticle Written by: Remya"

The introduction of hybrid mustard and sesame seeds during the Yellow Revolution led to a large rise in the production of edible oil, which was also made possible by the adoption of more advanced oil production technologies.\n\n\ud83d\udc49 Which year are YOU targeting for success in the IAS/IPS/IFS Exam? \ud83d\ude80\n\n(1) \u21d2 UPSC 2025: Prelims cum Mains\n\n(2) \u21d2 UPSC 2026: Prelims cum Mains\n\n(3) \u21d2 UPSC 2027 Prelims cum Mains\n\nTip: Know more about ClearIAS Courses (Online/Offline)\n\nWith floating sunflowers in Punjabi fields, the revolution signalled the start of a new age, opened up a lot of opportunities, and assisted in bridging the socioeconomic divide in the nation. When the revolution began, India\u2019s oil production was roughly 12 million tonnes; after ten years, it had doubled to about 24 million tonnes. Yes, that marked tremendous growth.\n\nIndia\u2019s sources of edible oil\nThe main sources include soybean, rapeseed, mustard, peanut, sunflower, safflower, and niger.\n\u00a0The primary sources of production of edible oil in India are oil palm, coconut, rice bran, cotton seeds, and tree-borne oilseeds.\n\nAround 68 per cent of the nation\u2019s total production of edible oils comes from primary sources, and the remaining 32 per cent comes from secondary sources.\n\nRelated Article: Pink Revolution in Food Processing Industry \u2013 Clear IAS\n\nPrimary areas for oil seed production in India\n\nIndia is perfectly equipped for growing all of the important annual oilseed crops due to its diverse agroecological ecosystem.\n\nSoybean, groundnut, rapeseed-mustard, sunflower, sesame, safflower, and niger are the nine oilseed crops farmed in the nation. Safflower and niger are the only two non-edible oils (castor and linseed).\nThe Malwa plateau, Marathwada, Gujarat, and dry sections of Rajasthan, Telangana, and Rayalseema regions of Andhra Pradesh are major oilseed-producing areas.\nThe Yellow Revolution\u2019s characteristics\n\nThe following are the main characteristics of the Yellow revolution.\n\nIncentives for farmers were supplied as part of the yellow revolution, along with processing facilities like irrigation, fertiliser, insecticides,\u00a0 a transportation facility, a minimum support price, warehousing, etc.\nMany organisations, like the National Dairy Board, were given duties to encourage the production of oilseeds during the revolution. The NDB must increase Gujarat\u2019s production of groundnut oil. Similarly, the National Oilseeds and Vegetable Oils Development Board were in charge of improving oilseed production in non-traditional locations.\nTo increase consumer awareness of the four main oilseeds\u2014mustard, groundnut, soybean, and sunflower\u2014Oilseeds Production Thrust was founded. Additionally, about 3000 oilseed societies with 13 lakh farmers and 25 hectares of arable land were founded.\nDespite becoming self-sufficient in oil production in the following 10 years, India\u2019s production tragically falls short of its needs. India began importing oilseeds from other nations to meet the demand. In 2007, India imported 5 million tonnes from numerous nations including Malaysia, Argentina, Brazil, etc.\nPositive aspects of the revolution\nImproved technology helped the tremendous increase in sunflower production in Punjab.\nHelped the country in gaining new socio-economic opportunities.\nThe rate of oil production in India changed from 12 million to 24 million in 10 years.\nFarmers started to use hybrid oil seeds and modern technologies were adopted by them.\nChallenges to the Yellow Revolution\nThe difficulty of enlarging the area under cultivation leads to a shortage of edible oil.\nPoor awareness and a shift in cropping patterns caused a considerable reduction in the area used for oilseed cultivation.\nOilseeds are more vulnerable to pests and disease, which also reduces production.\nOilseed output is declining as a result of the cultivation of unhealthful crops as a result of the unhealthful environment.\n\nThe government of India has initiated many reforms for the upliftment of this sector.\n\nGovernment Initiatives\n\nThey include:\n\nNational Mission on Oil Palm and Edible Oil (NMEO-OP): The programme, which has a five-year budget of Rs. 11, 040 crores, primarily intends to achieve self-reliance in edible oil aiming to triple domestic palm oil production to 11.20 lakh tonnes by 2025\u20132026 and 28 lakh tonnes by 2029\u20132030. The Andaman and Nicobar Islands and India\u2019s northeast are given particular attention by the programme. The government will provide price assurance(The Viability Price) to farmers who choose to grow palm oil. Payment for the shortfall would be made to the farmers directly through a bank transfer.\nTechnology Mission on Pulses & Oilseeds (TMOP): In recognition of the relevance and value of oil palm farming, DAC&FW launched the Technology Mission on Oilseeds & Pulses (TMOP) in the prospective states in 1991\u20131992.\nOil Palm Development Programme\u00a0(OPDP): During the VIII and IX Plans, the Oil Palm Development Programme (OPDP), a comprehensive centrally supported programme, was implemented.\nIntegrated Scheme of Oilseeds, Pulses, Oil Palm and Maize (ISOPOM): Under the Integrated Scheme of Oilseeds, Pulses, Oil Palm and Maize, the Indian government supported the growth of oil palm during the X and XI Plans (ISOPOM).\nRKVY\u2019s Special Oil Palm Area Expansion Program (OPAE): As of March 2014, oil palm cultivation was still taking place on 60,000 acres of land.\nThe National Mission on Oilseeds and Oil Palm (NMOOP): The National Mission on Oilseeds and Oil Palm (NMOOP), which is focused on growing the oil palm industry and its products, was established during the XII Plan.NMOOP and the National Food Security Mission were amalgamated in 2018.\n\nThe cultivable area for oilseeds cannot currently be increased. The fact that there is still a deficit of edible oils suggests that the Oilseeds Technology Mission (OTM) and the development of oil palm plantations have had little effect.\n\nThese energy-dense crops are subject to several limitations. They are raised in unfavourable conditions and are vulnerable to pests and infections. Recently, farmers have grown high-yielding grains to increase output increase revenues and make use of newer technology.\n\nThe nation\u2019s demands for edible oils are satisfied by these key oilseed crops. A second yellow revolution is necessary at this time to meet this demand. To improve production and farm income, dryland farming also requires technological progress. The country\u2019s agriculture and the economy would be significantly impacted if it become self-sufficient in oilseeds\n\nArticle Written By:\u00a0 Atheena Fathima Riyas"

This great diversity has been made possible by the wide variety of precipitation patterns, physiography, geomorphology, and climate.\n\nMarine and coastal: open coasts, coral reefs, estuaries, tidal flats, mangroves, and coastal lagoons.\n\nInland: permanent and seasonal rivers, inland deltas and floodplains, permanent and seasonal lakes and ponds, marshes, freshwater swamps, and peatlands\n\nHuman-made: reservoirs, barrages and dams, aquaculture ponds, wastewater treatment ponds, irrigation canals, irrigation ponds, and rice fields.\n\nAlso read: Natural Vegetation in India\n\nMajor Types\n\nMajor types of wetlands are-\n\nHuman-made Wetland\n\nThese wetlands were created with specific goals in mind, such as the storage of water for irrigation and drinking, fish production, or recreation. Some examples of man-made wetlands include dams, aquaculture ponds, and reservoirs.\n\nLakes\n\nA wide group of inland freshwater habitats, lakes, and ponds\u2014also referred to as lentic systems, exist all over the world and offer vital resources and habitats for both terrestrial and aquatic species.\n\nRiver Floodplains\n\nThese are areas of land near rivers or streams that occasionally become submerged when water levels rise above the channel. The Yamuna floodplains are Delhi\u2019s main water source.\n\nOx-bow Lakes\n\nOxbows are formed when a river\u2019s meander is blocked off by silt deposition or a river changes course, isolating a crescent-shaped body of water. There are many oxbows in the Ganga and Brahmaputra River basins. Ansupa is an oxbow in the Mahanadi Delta.\n\nMarshes\n\nIn these, herbaceous plants predominate, and water from sources other than direct rainfall, such as surface runoff, groundwater, or tidal flow, sustains them. In Bihar\u2019s Burhi Gandak floodplains, there is a marsh called Kanwar Jheel (also known as Kabar Tal).\n\nEstuaries\n\nA coastal body of brackish water that is partially enclosed has one or more rivers or streams flowing into it, and has a free connection to the open sea is called an estuary. Estuaries serve as transitional areas between the habitats of rivers and the sea. A long sand berm divides the Chilika lagoon in Odisha from the Bay of Bengal.\n\nSwamps\n\nWetlands dominated by trees are called swamps. These have inadequate drainage, and an abundance of water to keep the ground soggy.\u00a0 Mangroves are coastal swamps that make the country\u2019s largest deltas. The largest single continuous mangrove swamp in the world is called Sunderbans, and it extends over Bangladesh and India.\n\nAlso read: Ramsar sites (Wetlands) in India: Memorize faster\n\nBenefits of Wetland\n\u00a0Act as a Source of Water: They serve as our primary source of freshwater.\nOver 95% of the available freshwater is found in aquifers, making them the most important source of drinking water and irrigation.\nNumerous wetlands aid in soaking up rainwater and recharging groundwater.\nServes as Flood and Storm Buffers: They reduce droughts and serve as flood buffers.\nIt operates as sponges in the upper parts of a basin, absorbing precipitation and snowmelt and allowing water to gently percolate into the soil.\nBy serving as natural barriers, coastal wetlands including mangroves, coral reefs, mudflats, and estuaries can reduce the destructive effects of storm surges and tidal waves.\nAct as a Source of Diverse Products: Wetlands that are sustainably managed can provide a variety of plants, animals, and mineral goods.\nCoastal wetlands are the source of about two-thirds of all fish.\nAsia produces more than three-fourths of its rice in wetlands.\nA significant part of the population, particularly those who live along their shorelines, depend on wetlands as a source of income.\nActs as a Water Purifier: They have the ability to significantly lower the high levels of nutrients like phosphorus and nitrogen, which are frequently connected with agricultural runoff.\nNumerous wetland plants have the ability to filter out hazardous compounds from pesticides, industrial waste, and mining.\nContinuous trash discharge, however, might result in environmental catastrophes if it exceeds the wetlands\u2019 carrying capacity.\nFor Recreation and Tourism: Wetlands are excellent locations for recreation and tourism due to their natural beauty and diversity of plant and animal life.\nHowever, careless tourism can put a strain on wetlands.\n\u00a0Vulnerable to Climate Change: They are vulnerable to climate change, just as many other ecosystems.\nHowever, these ecosystems can lessen the effects of and adapt to a changing climate.\nSome wetlands, including mangroves and salt marshes, operate as carbon sinks, limiting the number of harmful greenhouse gases that are released into the atmosphere.\nServes as a Habitat for Migratory Birds: Thousand bird species traverse thousands of miles between breeding and non-breeding places on a seasonal basis.\nWetlands are used by migratory birds as rest stops, feeding grounds, and nesting grounds.\nThe East Australasian and Central Asian Flyways are connected by Indian wetlands.\nAct as Home to Indigenous Species: Several wetlands serve as the home to many indigenous species that are either threatened or highly threatened.\nThe only known natural home of the critically endangered brow-antlered deer is Keibul Lamjao, a floating national park south of Loktak (Rucervus eldii).\nThe grasslands and marshes of Assam\u2019s Kaziranga National Park are home to the majority of the world\u2019s vulnerable Great Indian Rhinoceros (Rhinoceros unicornis) population, which makes up more than 70% of the population.\nWetlands (Conservation and Management Rules), 2017\n\nUnder the provisions of the Environment (Protection) Act, 1986, the Ministry of Environment, Forest, and Climate Change (MoEF&CC) has notified the Wetlands (Conservation and Management) Rules, 2017 as the regulatory framework for the conservation and management of wetlands in India.\n\nThis is an important step toward preserving, managing, and maintaining the wetlands\u2019 ecological identity without limiting their sensible use.\n\nThe 2017 Wetlands (Conservation and Management) Rules have improved the management of wetlands by shifting the responsibility from a central authority to state entities.\n\nThe regulations outline the National Wetland Committee\u2019s advisory duty, which includes reviewing the progress of integrated management of Ramsar Convention areas and advising state agencies on wetlands\u2019 integrated management, based on the principle of sensible use.\n\nIn order to assist State Governments and Union Territory (UT) Administrations in implementing the Rules, the Guidelines for the Rules have been developed.\n\nThey offer guidance on a number of different topics, including identifying wetlands for notification under the Rules, delineating wetlands, wetland complexes, and zones of influence, preparing a Brief Document, creating a list of activities to be regulated and permitted, and addressing the structure and operational issues of the Wetlands Authorities\n\nNational Plan for Conservation of Aquatic Ecosystems (NPCA)\n\nThe National Plan for Conservation of Aquatic Ecosystems (NPCA), which is being implemented by the Wetlands Division of the MoEFCC, is a centrally sponsored program for the conservation and management of wetlands in the nation on a cost-sharing basis between the Central Government and respective State/UT Governments.\n\nThe program aims to conserve and restore wetlands\u2019\u00a0entirety in order to increase both biodiversity and ecosystems as well as water quality.\n\nBy supporting the creation and execution of integrated management plans, capacity building, and research, it seeks to encourage the mainstreaming of wetlands in developmental programming with States.\n\nThe approach of the program-\n\nDeveloping baseline information \u2013 Wetland Brief Document\nRapid assessment of the condition of the wetlands \u2013 Wetland Health

Mangrove seeds begin growing while still attached to the parent plant,\u00a0known as propagules, these seedlings develop roots as well.\nGlobal Distribution\n\nMangroves are found worldwide, but the greatest species diversity is in Southeast Asia.\n\nMangrove forests are found in tropical and subtropical regions in tidal areas, that are frequently inundated with salt water.\n\nWorldwide, mangrove forests occupy about 15.2 million hectares (1,52,000 sq km) of tropical coasts, found across Africa, Australia, Asia, and America.\n\nWhile the mangrove forests are spread across more than 100 countries and territories, three-quarters of the mangroves are found only in 15 countries and less than seven percent of them are protected.\n\nAsia has a share of 42 percent of the world\u2019s mangroves, which is followed by Africa (21 percent), North/Central America (15 percent), Oceania (12 percent), and South America (11 percent).\n\nIt is important to note that the mangrove area decreases with increasing latitude excluding the Sundarbans which account for the world\u2019s largest tract of mangroves situated along the Ganges delta.\n\nLargest Area Under Mangrove Forest\n\nThe countries with the largest area of mangroves are:\n\nIndonesia\nBrazil\nAustralia\nMexico\nNigeria\n\nSource: Landsat data & World Atlas of Mangroves\n\nMangroves in India\n\n\u201cAbout 40% of the world\u2019s mangrove is found in South East Asia which is 6.8% of the world\u2019s mangrove cover and India has about 3% of the share of the total Mangrove cover that is found in South Asia\u201d\n\nIndia\u2019s Mangrove cover has increased by 54 sq km (1.10%)\u00a0as compared to the last assessment.\u201d\n\nAs per the current data, mangrove cover in the country stands at 4,975 sq km\u00a0[(1.2 million acres)], which is 0.15% of the country\u2019s total geographical area.\n\nSundarbans in west Bengal alone accounts for almost half of the total area that is found under mangrove in India.\n\nWest Bengal has a total of 42.45% of India\u2019s mangrove cover, followed by Gujarat at 23.66%, and A&N Islands at 12.39%.\u00a0All around the country, Gujarat showed a maximum increase in mangrove forest cover of 37 sq.\n\nWest Bengal (2114 sq km),\nGujrat (1140 sq km),\nA&N Islands (617 sq km),\nAndhra Pradesh (404 sq km)\nMaharashtra (304 sq km)\n\nAmong the states, Kerala (9 sq km) and among the UTs, Puducherry (2 sq km) have the least Mangroves cover.\n\nFor Research and Development, National Mangrove Genetic Resource Centre was established in Bhitarkanika (Odisha) by the Environment Ministry.\n\nIndia State of Forest Report 2021\n\nAs per the India State of Forest report 2021, the area under Mangrove forest has increased by 17 sq km making India\u2019s total mangrove cover as 4,992 sq km.\n\nTop 3 states showing mangrove cover increase: Odisha (8 sq km), Maharashtra (4 sq km), and Karnataka (3 sq km).\n\nImportant Mangroves Region in India\n\nGujrat: Gulf of Kutchh, Gulf of Khambhat, Dumas-Ubhrat\n\nAndhra Pradesh: Coringa East Godavari Delta, Krishna Delta\n\nOdisha: Bhaitarkanika, Mahanadi, Subarnarekha, Devi-Kauda, Dhamra, Chilka\n\nWest Bengal: Sunderbans\n\nAndaman & Nicobar: North Andaman, Nicobar\n\nMaharashtra: Achra-Ratnagiri, Devgarh-Vijay Durg, Veldur, Kundalika-Revdnada, Mumbra-Diva, Vikroli.\n\nGoa: Goa\n\nKarnataka: Coondapur, Dakshin Kannada/ Hannavar, Karwar, Mangalore Forest Division.\n\nKerala: Vembanad, Kannur (North Kerala)\n\nTamil Nadu: Pichavaram, Muthupet, Ramnad, Pulicat, Kaznuveli\n\nAlso read: Forest \u2013 Know the Different Types\n\nImportance of Mangroves\n\nSpecies: Plankton, algae, fish, and shellfish are all fed by the nutrients found in mangrove leaves and roots. Many different species of birds and mammals live in mangroves, including mangrove monkeys in South Asia and Bengal tigers in Sunderbans.\n\nFishery: Mangroves are essential for fish and shellfish, migratory birds, and sea turtles to nest and breed, which highlights their significance for coastal fishing communities. An article published in the Journal of Sea in 2008 estimates that mangrove forests are directly or indirectly responsible for 80% of the world\u2019s fish catch.\n\nNutrient Filters: Because of the destruction of mangrove habitats, which typically filter the amount of silt and nutrients that reach the ocean, the amount of sediment and nutrients that reach oceanic waters has increased. That can result in an Algal boom because of excess nutrients discharge.\n\nClimate change: Mangroves are effective carbon sinks. They store three to five times more carbon per unit area than tropical forests and isolate carbon at a pace that is two to four times faster than tropical forests like the Amazon. More greenhouse gases are released when they are cut down compared to other areas of forests.\n\nStabilization of shorelines: Mangroves create a natural barrier that shields coastal communities from increased storm surges, flooding, and storms also stabilizing shorelines by reducing erosion.\n\nTsunami Shield: Mangroves can absorb wave energy, and because of that they are very important for protecting coastal areas from coastal calamities namely, tsunamis, storm surges, etc. Mangroves can effectively absorb about 70-90 percent of normal wave energy. It is evident that even under extreme circumstances, mangroves\u2019 dense root and branch networks could help diffuse tsunamis, and reduce their devastating effects.\n\nIn December 2004 a massive tsunami hit Asia and causes mass-scale destruction and loss of life. Degradation of the coastal mangrove system makes the coastal areas more prone to tsunamis, and flood-related destructions.\n\nIt is evident that damage to the property and loss of lives was minimal in coastal regions where there were healthy mangroves.\n\nAlso read: Forest Management: National Working Plan Code\n\nThreats to Mangrove Forest\n\nThere are approximately 70 species of mangroves around the world\u00a0but the reduction in it and extinctions is evident.\n\nThese areas are rich in nutrients and are part of larger wetland systems that make them desirable for agriculture and lead to deforestation.\n\nA threat to the mangrove ecosystem is associated with global warming and climate change.\n\nAs these areas are near the sea, it is also exploited for salt production.\n\nRapid and mostly unregulated coastal development is one of the main obstacles to mangrove growth.

It has an immense impact on the global climate as well.

Familiar examples include rain, snow, clouds, winds, floods, or thunderstorms.\nClimate, on the other hand, refers to the long-term (usually at least 30 years) regional or even a global average of temperature, humidity, and rainfall patterns over seasons, years, or decades.)\n\nTable of Contents\n\nGlobal warming vs Climate change\nImpact of global warming on global climate\nGlobal warming contributions by countries\nGlobal climate data\nWay forward\nPrevious year question\nGlobal warming vs Climate change\n\nAlthough these expressions are occasionally used interchangeably, they are not the same.\n\nChanges in global weather patterns and growing seasons are referred to as climate change. It also refers to the rise in sea level brought on by melting ice sheets and glaciers and the expansion of warmer oceans.\nClimate change brought on by global warming poses a severe threat to life on earth in the form of catastrophic weather events and extensive flooding.\n\nClimate change is a long-term change in the average weather patterns that have come to define Earth\u2019s local, regional and global climates. These changes have a broad range of observed effects that are synonymous with the term.\n\nHuman activities, especially the burning of fossil fuels, which raises the concentrations of heat-trapping greenhouse gases in Earth\u2019s atmosphere and thus increases the planet\u2019s average surface temperature, are to blame for the climate changes that have been observed since the middle of the 20th century.\n\nIn addition to internal variability (such as cyclical ocean patterns like El Nino, La Nina, and the Pacific Decadal Oscillation) and external forcings (such as volcanic activity, changes in the Sun\u2019s energy output, and variations in Earth\u2019s orbit), natural processes that have been outweighed by human activities can also contribute to climate change.\n\nKey indicators of climate change are:\n\nglobal land and ocean temperature increases\nrising sea levels\nice loss at Earth\u2019s poles and in mountain glaciers\nfrequency and severity changes in extreme weather such as hurricanes, heatwaves, wildfires, droughts, floods, and precipitation\ncloud and vegetation cover changes\n\nThe gradual increase in the planet\u2019s surface temperature is known as global warming.\n\nAlthough this warming trend has been around for a while, the burning of fossil fuels has greatly accelerated its pace over the past century. The amount of fossil fuels burned has increased along with the size of the human population.\n\nBurning fossil fuels such as coal, oil, and natural gas results in the \u201cgreenhouse effect,\u201d which affects the atmosphere of Earth.\n\nThe greenhouse effect is when the Sun\u2019s rays penetrate the atmosphere, but when that heat is reflected off the surface cannot escape back into space.\nGases produced by the burning of\u00a0fossil fuels\u00a0prevent the heat from leaving the atmosphere.\nThese greenhouse gasses are\u00a0carbon dioxide, chlorofluorocarbons, water\u00a0vapor,\u00a0methane, and\u00a0nitrous oxide.\nThe excess heat in the atmosphere has caused the average global temperature to rise over time, otherwise known as global warming.\n\nGlobal warming is one of the causes of climate change.\n\nAlso read: State of Global Climate Report 2023\n\nImpact of global warming on global climate\n\nScientists agree that the earth\u2019s rising temperatures are fueling longer and hotter heat waves, more frequent droughts, heavier rainfall, and\u00a0more powerful hurricanes.\n\nThe impacts of global warming are being felt everywhere.\n\nExtreme heat waves have caused tens of thousands of deaths around the world in recent years.\nAntarctica has lost nearly\u00a0four trillion metric\u00a0tons\u00a0of ice since the 1990s.\nIt is causing the permafrost to thaw in the Arctic region.\n\nThe rate of loss could speed up if we keep burning fossil fuels at our current pace, some experts say, causing\u00a0sea levels\u00a0to\u00a0rise\u00a0several meters in the next 50 to 150 years and wreaking havoc on coastal communities worldwide.\n\nThe earth\u2019s ocean temperatures are getting warmer, so tropical storms can pick up more energy.\n\nIn other words, global warming can turn a category 3 storm into a more dangerous category 4 storm.\n\nScientists have found that the frequency of North Atlantic hurricanes has increased since the early 1980s, as has the number of storms that reach categories 4 and 5.\n\nThe impact of global warming is also seen in but not limited to:\n\nThe risk of wildfires will continue to rise as a result of melting glaciers, early snowmelt, and severe droughts.\nIncreased coastal flooding will be caused by rising sea levels throughout the coastal regions.\nCities, farms, and forests will see more bothersome pests, heat waves, torrential downpours, and flooding. Agriculture and fisheries may be harmed or destroyed by all of these.\nMany plant and animal species may go extinct if environments like coral reefs and alpine meadows are damaged.\nBecause pollen-producing ragweed is growing more quickly, there is more air pollution, and more people are exposed to these conditions, allergies, asthma attacks, and infectious disease outbreaks will become more frequent.\n\nEven though everyone is impacted by climate change, not everyone is equally impacted. Typically, those who are indigenous, persons of color, or economically marginalized are severely harmed. Even though these same groups have made the least effort to contribute to climate change, they are more exposed to its severe effects due to inequities embedded into our housing, healthcare, and labor systems. This is known as environmental racism.\n\nAlso read: Planetary Boundaries\n\nGlobal warming contributions by countries\n\nIn recent years, China has taken the lead in\u00a0global-warming pollution, producing about 26 percent of all CO2 emissions.\n\nThe United States comes in second. Despite making up just 4 percent of the world\u2019s population, the nation produces about 13 percent of all global CO2 emissions which is nearly as much as the European Union and India (third and fourth place) combined.\n\nAnd America is still number one, by far, in cumulative emissions over the past 150 years. As a top contributor to global warming, the United States must help propel the world to a cleaner, safer, and more equitable future.\n\nGlobal climate data\nGlobal temperatures\u00a0rose about 1.8\u00b0F (1\u00b0C) from 1901 to 2020.\nSea level rise\u00a0has accelerated from 1.7 mm/year throughout most of the twentieth century to 3.2 mm/year since 1993.\nGlaciers are shrinking: the average thickness of 30 well-studied glaciers has decreased by more than 60 feet since 1980.\nThe area covered by\u00a0sea ice\u00a0in the Arctic at the end of summer has shrunk by about 40% since 1979.\nThe amount of\u00a0carbon dioxide\u00a0in the atmosphere has risen by 25% since 1958, and by about 40% since the Industrial Revolution.\nSnow\u00a0is melting earlier compared to long-term averages.\nWay forward\n\nLevels of the two most important anthropogenic greenhouse gases, carbon dioxide, and methane, continued their unrelenting rise in 2020 despite the economic slowdown caused by the coronavirus pandemic response.\n\nMoving away from fossil fuels is the first step in preventing climate change. Renewable energy sources including solar, wind, biomass, and geothermal need to be highlighted.\n\nProducing clean energy is crucial, but it\u2019s as necessary to use more cost-effective technologies to reduce our energy and water usage, such as LED lightbulbs and cutting-edge shower systems.\n\nPromoting carpooling, public transportation, and electric and hydrogen mobility are all effective ways to cut CO2 emissions and combat global warming.\n\nBoth the construction of new low-energy buildings and the renovation of existing structures are required to reduce the CO2 emissions from buildings, which are brought on by heating, cooling, hot water, and lighting.\n\nIt should also be a primary goal to promote more efficient use of natural resources, halt widespread deforestation, and improve the sustainability and productivity of agriculture.\n\nDeveloping responsible consumption habits is essential, whether it\u2019s for food (especially meat), apparel, cosmetics, or cleaning supplies.

This results from a lack of adherence to effluent standards.\nCities are severely short on sewage treatment facilities. Improper mining practices also deteriorate the water quality and damage the adjacent aquifers.\n\nClimate Change\n\nWeather patterns are changing as a result of climate change, and this leads to extreme weather events, uncertain water availability, a worsening of water scarcity, and tainted water sources.\nThe quantity and quality of water that humans need to survive can be significantly impacted by such effects.\n\nEncroachment of water bodies\n\nTo suit the infrastructure needs of growing cities, water bodies are being encroached upon.\n\nWater wastage\n\nDue to excessive subsidies and ignorance, there is an overuse and waste of water.\nGroundwater levels in Punjab and Haryana have been substantially reduced by uncontrolled irrigation water use and a lack of conservation efforts. More than 10% of rural areas\u2019 water bodies are no longer necessary.\n\nOver-dependence on groundwater\n\nAccording to reports, agriculture uses over 85% fresh water.\nDue to an overreliance on groundwater for the cultivation of crops like paddy and sugarcane, which need a lot of water, there is currently a problem in numerous states, including Punjab, Haryana, and western UP.\n\nPolicy Paralysis\n\nIrrigation is a major focus of the National Water Policy. Since the country\u2019s independence, the water administration has been afflicted with hydro-schizophrenia.\nThe management of the issue of water, including surface water, groundwater, drinking water, and irrigation, has been handled separately by various agencies such as the Central Water Commission (CWC) and Central Ground Water Board (CGWB) without any coordination.\n\nRead:\u00a0Agro-policies for SWAB\n\nWhat are the consequences of an increased water crisis?\n\nNegative Effects on Health\n\nChildren\u2019s malformations are caused by the presence of pollutants in the water such as fluoride, chloride, and nitrate.

It now encompasses each of the nation\u2019s 740 districts.\n\nAmrit Sarovars: Each district\u2019s 75 water bodies are to be developed and revitalized as part of the Mission. By August 2023, the Union Government plans to construct 50,000 Amrit Sarovars throughout India.\n\nAtal Bhujal Yojana: The program is expected to emphasize recharge and better use of groundwater resources. It seeks to strengthen the institutional framework and bring about behavioural changes at the community level for sustainable groundwater resource management;\n\nPaani Bachao, Paisa Kamao (Save Water, Earn Money): It has been launched by the Punjab Government. It incentivizes farmers to reduce groundwater and electricity usage. This has resulted in water savings of between 6-25% without any adverse effect on the yield.\n\nGanga Rejuvenation: The World Bank has been supporting the Government of India\u2019s efforts to rejuvenate the Ganga River since 2011. Two World Bank projects, worth US$ 1 billion, are helping set up the institutions needed to manage the river and build the infrastructure to keep it clean.\n\nMinistry of Jal Shakti: The formation of the Ministry of Jal Shakti is an important step in the direction of overcoming hydro-schizophrenia. It will bring the irrigation and drinking water departments, together. within one ministry.\n\nWay Forward\n\nEnumerating, geo-tagging, and creating an inventory of all extant water bodies should be the main priorities according to the Jal Shakti Abhiyan. It is important to take all necessary precautions to ward off encroachments.\n\nTo improve water management and eliminate inter-state water conflicts, the states must cooperate along hydrological boundaries rather than just administrative ones.\n\nThe general public should be made aware of this issue by supporting public servants like Rajendra Singh (Waterman of India).\n\nA better framework for water governance is required. To create a new National Water Commission, the CWC and CGWB should join, considerably expanding each organization\u2019s capabilities (NWC).

What are the components and functions of an ecosystem?\n\nThe phrase \u201cecosystem\u201d was first used in 1935 by British botanist Professor Arthur Tansley, who defined it as \u201cthe system resulting from the integration of all living and non-living factors\u00a0of the environment.\u201d\n\nAccording to him, an ecosystem is made up of both the organism and physical aspects that make up the environment as a whole.\n\nAlso read: Energy Flow Through an Ecosystem\n\nTable of Contents\n\nEcosystem Definition\nComponents of Ecosystem\nDecomposers and Scavengers\nWhat is the Trophic Level?\nFunctions of Ecosystem\nFlow of Energy\nLindeman\u2019s Law of Tropic Efficiency\nNutrient Cycle\nEcosystem Definition\n\nAnimals, plants, and humans coexist with a vast range of other species of plants and animals, such complex natural organization with their living and non-living environments that controls them and from which the living organisms derive their sustenance are technically called an \u201cecosystem\u201d or an \u201cecological system\u201d.\n\nA functional unit of nature that represents the intricate interactions between living and non-living elements is known as an ecosystem.\n\nCOMMUNITY = Biotic Component\n\n\ud83d\udc49 Which year are YOU targeting for success in the IAS/IPS/IFS Exam? \ud83d\ude80\n\n(1) \u21d2 UPSC 2025: Prelims cum Mains\n\n(2) \u21d2 UPSC 2026: Prelims cum Mains\n\n(3) \u21d2 UPSC 2027 Prelims cum Mains\n\nTip: Know more about ClearIAS Courses (Online/Offline)\n\nECOSYSTEM = Biotic Factors + Abiotic Factors\n\nEcosystems exist within ecosystems, which is a fascinating observation to make. For example, a forest ecosystem that is included in the biosphere may contain a cow dung ecosystem.\n\nThe borders are clearly defined in some situations, such as ecology in a pond. In such cases, there are no clear boundaries between forests, grasslands, and deserts.\n\nThese ecosystems often are separated from adjacent ecosystems by a transition zone or a diffused boundary zone called ecotone.\n\nIn the ecotone zone, organisms from nearby ecosystems interact, giving rise to a potential for greater species diversity than in the neighboring ecosystems.\n\nAlso read: Bioremediation\n\nComponents of Ecosystem\n\nThe elements that make up the ecosystem can be divided into biotic and abiotic (non-living) components;\n\n1)Abiotic components: Abiotic component of the ecosystem comprises three sorts of components:\n\nThe climatic condition and physical factors of the given region such as air, water, soil, temperature, light (duration and intensity), moisture (relative humidity), pH, etc.\nInorganic components of the ecosystem include water, carbon, nitrogen, phosphorus, sulfur, and other elements (that involve biogeochemical cycles).\nOrganic compounds such as proteins, carbohydrates, lipids, humic substances, etc. are present in the environment or in the biomass, i.e., the biogeochemical structure that connects the biotic and abiotic elements of the ecosystem.\n\nFor the ecosystem and the continued existence of living things, these abiotic components are essential.\n\n2) Biotic Components: Living things, such as plants, animals, and decomposers, are referred to as \u201cbiotic components\u201d and as per their functions, they are divided into producers and consumers.\n\n(i) Producers: In ecosystems, they are autotrophic (self-nourishing) organisms that produce their own food through chemosynthesis or photosynthesis.\n\nIn most cases, primary food production occurs in a process called photosynthesis, which is powered by sunlight. Primary manufacturing occurs in a few situations through a chemically powered process known as chemosynthesis. Both photosynthesis and chemosynthesis work together to power all life on Earth.\n\n(ii) Consumers: Heterotrophs (other nourishing) are incapable of photosynthesis and depend on organic food derived from animals, plants, or both. Consumers can be divided into two broad groups namely macro and micro consumers.\n\nMicro consumers are organism that feeds on the dead matter including fungus and some bacteria that are saprophytic or heterotrophic in nature and cannot manufacture their own food.\n\nMacro organisms are those that directly consume other animals or plants, macro consumers are also known as phagotrophs. Carnivores, omnivores, and herbivores are among them.\n\n(iii) Decomposers: also referred to as saprotrophs, these are often heterotrophic microscopic organisms. Decomposer organisms obtain their energy and nutrients by degrading dead organic matter.\n\nWhen plants and animals die, their bodies are still a source of energy and nutrients, as are their waste products such as urine and feces which they discard throughout their lifetimes. These organic remains are decomposed by micro-organisms, namely fungi and bacteria which grow saprophytically on these remains. They secrete digestive enzymes from their bodies on the dead and wasted materials, subsequently absorbing the products of digestion.\n\n(a) Saprophytes/ Microscopic/ True Decomposers- E.g. Bacteria, Fungi Yeasts, molds, and mushrooms), slime molds, etc.\n\n(b) Detritivores/Macroscopic Decomposers- E.g. Many small animals like earthworms, woodlice, sea stars, slugs, fiddler crabs, millipedes, and other smaller (<0.5 mm) animals such as mites, springtail, and nematodes.\n\nAlso read: Functions of Ecosystem: Ecological succession and Homeostasis\n\nDecomposers and Scavengers\n\nScavengers such as a vulture or hyenas are the first to arrive at a dead organism\u2019s remains, and they directly eat the dead plant and animal material. But while scavengers do break down dead animals, they aren\u2019t decomposers, because they\u2019re not reducing the animal into nutrients that become part of the soil.\n\nOnce scavengers are done with the remains, decomposers and detritivores take over and consume the parts that the scavengers have left behind.\n\nWhat is the Trophic Level?\n\nIn an ecosystem, the various biotic components are related to each other and form food chains. If we group all the organisms in a food chain according to their general source of nutrition, we can assign them different trophic (feeding) levels.\n\nThe producer organisms belong to the first trophic level,\nprimary consumers (herbivores) to the second trophic level,\nsecondary consumers (carnivores) to the third trophic level, and\ntertiary consumers (top carnivores) to the fourth trophic level.\nMan, who is an omnivore may belong to more than one trophic level.\nAll organisms that share the same general mode of feeding are included in one group and they together are said to belong to the same trophic level.\nFunctions of Ecosystem\n\nThe functions of an ecosystem include:\n\n(i) Flow of energy, and\n\n(ii) The cycling of nutrients.\n\nThe two ecological processes of energy flow and mineral cycle, which involve interaction between the physical, chemical, and biotic environments, may be viewed as the \u201cheart\u201d of ecosystem dynamics.\n\nIn an ecosystem, energy moves noncyclically (unidirectionally) from the sun to the decomposers via producers and macro-consumers (herbivores and carnivores), whereas nutrients continue to move in a cyclic manner.\n\nFlow of Energy\n\nEnergy intake is necessary for the ecosystem\u2019s survival and proper operation. Supporting a variety of ecosystem functions requires a constant supply of energy. Green plants serve as the energy\u2019s\u00a0entry points for the environment in our solar-powered system.\n\nVarious organisms in an ecosystem rely on producers, either directly or indirectly, to meet their energy needs. In other words, energy is transferred from producers (at the lower trophic levels) to\u00a0the top of the food chain. In an ecosystem, energy is transported in a systematic manner.\n\nLindeman\u2019s Law of Tropic Efficiency\n\nThe law implies that 90% of the energy is lost during the transfer from one tropic level to another, and only 10% is passed to another tropic level and participates in the biological energy cycle.\n\nAs per the law, only about 10% of the energy from organic food/matter is stored as flesh in the next tropic.\n\nNutrient Cycle\n\nThe cycle works as the movement of mineral nutrients from the non-living to the living and then back to the non-living components of the ecosystem in a circular manner. This process is termed biogeochemical cycling (bio for the living; geo for atmosphere, water, rocks, and soil; and chemical for the elements and processes involved).\n\nIn this nutrient cycle, the important role is played by-\n\nGreen plants, organize the nutrients in a biologically useful manner.\nDecomposers- that ultimately restore them to their simple element state\nAir and water, that transport the nutrient over long distances.\n\nArticle Written By: Priti Raj"

Therefore, the BOD is a trustworthy indicator of the organic pollution of a water body.\n\nOne of the main reasons for treating wastewater before its discharge is to reduce its need for oxygen and thereby lessen its demand.\n\nCauses of Water Pollution\n\nVarious factors are responsible for the pollution of water and the deterioration of water quality.\n\nAccording to the Central Pollution Control Board and the Ministry of Environment, Forest, and Climate Change, encroachments caused by population growth, urbanization, and encroachment have led to a decline in water bodies over time.\nThe main causes of river pollution in the country are discharges of partially and untreated sewage from cities and towns and industrial effluents into their respective catchments, issues with the operation and maintenance of sewage/effluent treatment plants, a lack of dilution, and other non-point sources of pollution.\nRiver pollution is also a result of non-point sources of pollution such as agricultural runoff, open defecation, runoff from solid waste dump sites, etc.\nWater Pollution Prevention: Industrial Pollution\n\nAccording to the provisions of the Water (Prevention & Control of Pollution) Act of 1974 and the Environment (Protection) Act of 1986, industrial units must install effluent treatment plants (ETPs) and treat their effluents to meet specified environmental standards before discharging into rivers and other bodies of water.\n\nAs a result, the CPCB, State Pollution Control Boards (SPCBs), and Pollution Control Committees (PCCs) keep an eye on industries\u2019 compliance with effluent discharge standards and take appropriate legal action in the event of non-compliance with these Acts\u2019 provisions.\n\nAdditionally, the industries are urged to maintain Zero Liquid Discharge (ZLD) whenever possible, enhance technology to reduce waste water output, reuse wastewater, and recycle wastewater.\n\nState Governments have the primary responsibility to monitor, as well as take corrective actions, regarding pollution of water sources by industries or mines.\n\nGovernment measures for water pollution prevention\n\nThe water quality of the country\u2019s various rivers is regulated by several agencies such as\n\nCentral Pollution Control Board (CPCB)\nState Pollution Control Boards (SPCBs)\nPollution Control Committees (PCCs)\nCentral Water Commission (CWC)\n\nVarious programmes have been launched by the Government of India for the conservation and protection of rivers and water bodies in the country.\n\nNational River Conservation Programme (NRCP)\nNational Lake Conservation Programme (NLCP)\nAtal Mission for Rejuvenation and Urban Transformation (AMRUT)\nSmart Cities Mission\nMahatma Gandhi National Rural Employment Guarantee Scheme (MGNREGS)\nRepair, Renovation and Restoration (RRR) schemes\n(1) National River Conservation Programme (NRCP)\n\nThe Ministry of Environment and Forests (MoEF) National River Conservation Plan (NRCP) aims to protect rivers from pollution and enhance water quality.\n\n(2) National Green Tribunal\n\nThe concerned States and Union Territories (UTs) are trying to implement Action Plans for the restoration of water quality in the identified polluted stretches of rivers following the directives of the National Green Tribunal.\n\n(3) Jal Jeevan Mission\n\nSince August 2019, the Indian government has been working with the states to carry out the Jal Jeevan Mission (JJM), which aims to provide drinkable tap water to every rural home in India by 2024, including those in habitations where the water quality is poor.\n\nChildren are especially sensitive to water-borne diseases and contamination in drinking water. A particular effort was started in 2020 to make the provision of potable tap water supply in schools, Anganwadi centers, ashram shalas, etc. on a priority basis.\n\nAs a result, 8.52 lakh (83%) schools and 8.76 lakhs (78.4%) Anganwadi centers across the country now have access to tap water.\n\n(4) National Lake Conservation Programme (NLCP)\n\nThe National Lake Conservation Plan (NLCP) is being implemented by the Ministry of Environment and Forests to manage and conserve contaminated and degraded lakes in urban and semi-urban areas.\n\nIts objective was to conserve aquatic ecosystems (lakes and wetlands) by putting long-term conservation plans into action that were guided by uniform policies and standards.\n\n(5) Atal Mission for Rejuvenation and Urban Transformation (AMRUT)\n\nAtal Mission for Rejuvenation and Urban Transformation (AMRUT) was established to make sure that every home has access to a water tap with a reliable water supply and a sewer connection.\n\nWay Forward\n\nThe government has taken several initiatives for water pollution prevention but further changes are also important. A few of them are-\n\nThe minimum flow of the river is necessary to preserve and it is important to restore the aquatic health and ecosystem. A minimum river flow is necessary for the discharge of treated sewage.\n\nCitizen involvement and engagement are essential for overhauling the waste management industry and bringing about the necessary behavioral change.\n\nA comprehensive waste management policy is required, one that emphasizes the importance of decentralized garbage disposal procedures since this will encourage private actors to participate.\n\nIt\u2019s critical that bioremediation, or the use of microbes to purify contaminated soil and water, become mandated in all regions where it is possible.\n\nAlso Read: Forever Chemicals: What are PFAS?\n\nArticle Written By: Priti Raj"

It involves the wise use of land and water resources for maximum and sustained productivity with the least amount of risk to the environment.\n\nThe following objectives mentioned below will assist Watershed Management to achieve its primary purpose of managing natural resources sustainably.\n\nensuring the public has access to clean, enough drinking water;\nsafeguarding and providing access to sanitary facilities;\nboosting productivity rates through soil quality restoration and enhancement;\nminimizing the effects of natural disasters (particularly in light of climate change);\nan increase in population income while simultaneously regenerating the environment;\nenhancement of the infrastructure for agricultural marketing, transportation, and storage;\nimprovement of physical health (aided by the availability to clean water for drinking, sanitary conditions, and better nutrition);\ndevelopment of self-help and environmental education;\nWatershed management programs in India\n\nIn 1992, the Ministry of Rural Development and Poverty Alleviation established a separate Department of Wastelands Development to accelerate the development of wastelands and degraded lands. The Department of Wastelands Development was renamed the Department of Land Resources in April 1999 to serve as the central organization for managing land resources.\n\nAs a result, this department was given control over the Land Reforms Division and all land-based development initiatives. The department implemented several watershed management programs and later consolidated them under the name of Watershed Development Component of Prime Minister Krishi Sinchayee Yojna (WDC-PMKSY).\n\nWatershed Development Component of Prime Minister Krishi Sinchayee Yojna (WDC-PMKSY)\n\nThe Government of India has charged the Department of Land Resources (DoLR) with carrying out the Pradhan Mantri Krishi Sinchayee Yojana\u2019s Watershed Development Component (WDC-PMKSY).\n\nThe major goals of the WDC-PMKSY are to restore ecological balance through the utilization, conservation, and development of degraded natural resources like soil, vegetation, and water. The outcomes include a reduction in soil erosion, natural vegetation regeneration, rainwater conservation, and recharge of the groundwater table.\n\nKey Facts Related to WDC-PMKSY\n\nThe state governments themselves plan, finance, carry out, and maintain water resources projects in accordance with their own resources and priorities. The Government of India\u2019s role is restricted to giving technical assistance and, in certain cases, partial financial aid.\n\nThe State Governments are responsible for addressing the monitoring and redress systems to guarantee maintenance and quality control of irrigation projects that they are implementing.\n\nAdditionally, it has been mandated for the Central Water Commission and a specific Project Management Unit (PMU) within this Ministry to routinely supervise the projects getting central assistance from this Ministry.\n\nThe Ministry of Jal Shakti\u2019s Management Information System, backed by a dedicated dashboard, is used to track the physical and financial development of these projects.\n\nWDC-PMKSY 1.0 was successfully concluded in March 2022 and its achievements are-\n\nincrease in groundwater table up to 3 m,\nincrease in the cultivated area by up to 30%,\nincrease in farmer\u2019s annual income by up to 70.13%,\nincrease in milk production by up to 40% and\nincrease in cropping intensity up to 18.3%.\nSpringshed Development under WDC-PMKSY 2.0\n\nSpringshed development has been added as a new activity within the project areas of the WDC-PMKSY 2.0. It was based on the NITI Aayog\u2018s recommendation.\n\nThis may be of utmost significance, particularly for the Himalayan States/UTs and other mountainous areas of the country, which are highly significant from a strategic, ecological, economic, sociopolitical, and societal perspective.\n\nIronically, during the monsoon season, the Himalayan States/UTs receive a substantial amount of rain, but during the dry season, they face a severe shortage of drinking water.\n\nOn the other hand, the fragile Himalayan scenery frequently experiences ecological degradation and landslide issues. All States/UTs could greatly benefit from revitalizing springs in mountainous locations under the project areas of WDC-PMKSY 2.0.\n\nArticle Written By: Priti Raj"

Will it solve the present ecological problems? Read the article to know about this.\n\nTop predators are becoming extinct due to loss of prey, habitat loss, hunting, climate change, or extreme events.\n\nThey are important in maintaining the ecological balance and a balanced food web. They are being introduced again in a particular area through species reintroduction initiatives.\n\nThe reintroduction of species is the release of a particular species into an area in which they are capable of survival.\n\nAn ecosystem is a place where plants, animals, and other organisms interact among themselves and with their environment. Every species are connected and transfers energy through the food web. This interaction is obvious, and top predators play a vital role in maintaining a food web balance. Therefore they are important for the overall health of an ecosystem.\n\nExamples of top predators include lions, cheetahs, wolves, sharks, polar bears, jaguars, tigers, etc.\n\nTable of Contents\n\nImpact \u00a0of Top Predators on an Ecosystem\nLet us see some of the successful species reintroductions done in several countries:\nProblems associated with the introduction of species:\nImpact \u00a0of Top Predators on an Ecosystem\n\nTop predators affect and control prey species populations by:\n\n\ud83d\udc49 Which year are YOU targeting for success in the IAS/IPS/IFS Exam? \ud83d\ude80\n\n(1) \u21d2 UPSC 2025: Prelims cum Mains\n\n(2) \u21d2 UPSC 2026: Prelims cum Mains\n\n(3) \u21d2 UPSC 2027 Prelims cum Mains\n\nTip: Know more about ClearIAS Courses (Online/Offline)\n\nThey remove vulnerable prey populations such as the old, sick, or injured, leaving more food available for the survival of healthy prey populations.\nThey help in controlling the spread of diseases among prey populations by controlling their size.\nIts presence can reduce the effect of trophic cascades. A trophic cascade occurs when the number of top predators is reduced. It enhances the survival of the following trophic level species whereby they have relative changes in the prey population on which they are dependent.\n\nFor example, the Sea otter (Top predator) depends on Sea urchins and other invertebrates for their food needs. These sea urchins in turn prey on kelp forests (algal seaweeds). These kelp forests were in turn dependent on the fish population present in that community.\n\nWhen the number of sea otters gets reduced, the population of sea urchins and other invertebrates gets increases and their food needs also increase. This led to the over-exploitation of kelp forests which again affects the fish population in that community.\n\nIn identifying the importance of top predators in a community, scientists were trying to introduce them and thereby balance the food web.\n\nRelated topic: Climate change\n\nLet us see some of the successful species reintroductions done in several countries:\nReintroduction of wolves to Yellowstone national park, US. This had been done to control the rising elk population which was overgrazing much of the park. It caused unanticipated results in the national park. The end to overgrazing stabilized riverbanks. Rivers were recovered and flowed in new directions. Several species such as songbirds, beavers, Eagles, and foxes were returned. As the size of the elk population gets curbed, new trees also take root in areas.\nThe introduction of Sea Otters in the Northern Pacific ocean near Alaska also shows great results.\nChinese water deer were reintroduced to Shangai which were its native species.\nThe reintroduction of the world\u2019s smallest and rarest wild pigs, Pygmy hogs into Sonai Rupai Wildlife Sanctuary in Assam was also a successful one.\nAmerican Bison population came down to as few as 750 animals in the 1890s due to the excessive hunting and slaughter for the fur trade. After reintroduction and various other conservation initiatives, its population has rebounded to around 350,000.\n\nHowever, it is not that always the reintroduction programs were successful. Sometimes it failed too, that is it had negative consequences.\n\nAn example of such reintroduction of species was that of a wild dog introduced in Africa. It failed either to reduce the effect of a trophic cascade or to improve ecosystem stability. It led to increased competition and negative consequences as it started attacking other unintended animals.\n\nProblems associated with the introduction of species:\nAdministrative problems \u2013 permission is required from different groups. Expertise advice and equipment are needed. Stress, injury, and fatalities are associated with capturing and transporting animals.\nSusceptible to disease \u2013 small groups are more prone to disease. They are exposed to the disease in captivity. Due to a lack of immunity among the newly introduced species, they are more susceptible to endemic diseases.\nMore expensive \u2013 expenses are there in planning, monitoring, and captive breeding. Whereas it is difficult to value reintroduction benefits.\nSite availability \u2013 there are changes in the environmental setting since the removal of a species. It causes food chain disruption.\nAdaptability issues \u2013 Reintroduced species experience increased vulnerability to the gene flow evolutionary processes and climate and ecological differences between source and native habitats.\n\nRecently, the Union Minister for Environment, Forest and Climate Change launched the \u2018Action plan for the introduction of Cheetah in India\u2019 under which 50 of these cats will be introduced in the next five years.\n\n\u201cIn India, we have traditionally been more concerned about species than ecosystems. So we\u2019d reintroduce tigers in Sariska and Panna, where they were locally extinct, or move rhinoceros to Dudhwa, or captive breed gharials and release them in rivers in North India.\n\nSoon, eight big cats are to be relocated from South Africa to the Kuno National Park in Madhya Pradesh. If all goes as planned, the region could become the country\u2019s first-ever cheetah sanctuary.\n\nRead:\u00a0Invasive species\n\nArticle written by: Krishnapriya jr"

May is the peak month of the heat wave over India. Every season, on average, two to three heatwave events are anticipated.\n\nIn India, central and northwest, as well as the coastal states of Andhra Pradesh and Odisha, report heatwaves frequently which occur due to favourable atmospheric conditions.\n\nCriteria for Declaring Heatwave\n\nIn order to be considered a heat wave, a station\u2019s highest temperature must be at least 40 degrees Celsius for plains regions and 30 degrees Celsius for hilly regions.\n\na) Based on Departure from Normal\n\nHeat Wave: Departure from normal is 4.5 degrees C to 6.4 degrees C\nSevere Heat Wave: Departure from normal is >6.4 degrees C\n\nb) Based on the Actual Maximum Temperature\n\nHeat Wave: When the actual maximum temperature is\u2265 45 degrees C\nSevere Heat Wave: When the actual maximum temperature \u226547 degrees C\n\nDeclaring Heat Wave for coastal stations\n\nHeat Waves may be defined when the maximum temperature deviates by at least 4.5 degrees Celsius from the average, providing the maximum temperature actually experienced is at least 37 degrees Celsius.\n\nWhat are favourable conditions for Heatwaves?\n\nThere are certain conditions that favor the occurrence of heat waves. A few important ones are-\n\nTransportation / Prevalence of hot dry air over a region: For the purpose of distributing hot air over the area, there should be a region of warm, dry air and a suitable flow pattern.\n\n\nAbsence of moisture in the upper atmosphere: Moisture prevents temperatures from rising.\n\n\nThe sky should be practically cloudless: To allow the area to be as well-insulated as possible.\n\n\nLarge amplitude anti-cyclonic flow over the area: Heat waves typically originate over Northwest India and move progressively south and east, but not west (since the prevailing winds during the season are westerly to northwesterly).\n\nImpact of Heatwave\n\nHeatwaves impact all aspects including the environment, health, economy, etc.\n\nEnvironmental and Societal Impact: According to studies conducted throughout the years, India is seeing more heatwave days on average every decade. The average length of heat waves has increased over the past 30 years by around three days, and by 2060, a further increase of 12 to 18 days is anticipated.\n\nIt is expected that with time, heat waves will eventually expand to other regions, including the southern regions of India.\n\nA condition known as \u201cwet bulb\u201d temperature, which at its mildest can cause considerable discomfort and at its worst can result in dehydration and death, is on the rise in some parts of eastern India, including Andhra Pradesh, Telangana, and Odisha.\n\nAccording to a study by researchers at IMD, In India, heat waves have claimed the lives of more than 17,000 people over the past 50 years.\n\nImpact on Health: The health impacts of Heat Waves majorly involve dehydration, heat cramps, heat exhaustion, heat stroke, etc.\n\nThere is a significant increase in stress, anxiety, and sadness during a heatwave, which could cause or aggravate mental, behavioural, and cognitive disorders.\n\nCost of Living: Extreme temperature-related health effects and diseases could result in high medical expenditure. These make a household\u2019s monthly spending plan even worse.\n\nEnergy: On average, electricity costs for a household in an urban area climb by 15% to 20% during heat waves.\n\nReasons for the Occurrence of Heatwaves in India\n\nHeatwaves are caused by large-scale atmospheric circulation anomalies like high-pressure areas, upper-tropospheric, jet streams, etc.\n\nThe frequency and length of heat waves in India are also modulated by global factors, such as the El Nino/Southern Oscillation (ENSO) and the Indian Ocean.\n\nThe heat wave is also significantly attributed to climate change. An abnormal change in the temperature or the weather is referred to as climate change. This threat is caused by the overuse of gases, coal, and oil products.\n\nLocal factors like reduced soil moisture and increased sensible heat flux might aggravate the consequences of the heatwave.\n\nMeasures Taken to Tackle Heatwave\n\nIndia now has a robust national framework for heat action plans that involve the India Meteorological Department (IMD), national and state disaster management authorities, and local organizations. The core of this heat action plan is the early warning system.\n\nThe Ministry of Earth Sciences (MoES) had set up an improved forecast system for early heatwave warnings as part of the National Monsoon Mission.

These are produced, for instance, by burning coal or gasoline.\nCarbon dioxide can also be released during forest and land clearing and Methane is emitted primarily by waste landfills. Among all, the major emitters are energy, industry, transportation, buildings, agriculture, and land use.\nKey Findings Related to Climate\nChina is the largest emitter of carbon dioxide which comprises 30.60% of the CO2 emission worldwide. China is followed by the USA and India.\nThe Earth is now about 1.1\u00b0C warmer than it was in the 1800s. The commitment made under the Paris Agreement may not be met.\nBy the end of the century, the temperature might rise by as much as 4.4\u00b0C if carbon dioxide emissions continue on their current course.\nThe levels of greenhouse gases rose to a new height\u00a0in 2019. The amount of carbon dioxide was 148% of\u00a0preindustrial levels.\nWhile sea ice, the Greenland ice sheet, and glaciers have decreased over the same period and permafrost temperatures have climbed, the Arctic has warmed at least twice as fast as the global average.\nBetween 2020 and 2030, the world\u2019s production of fossil fuels must drop by around 6% to maintain a 1.5\u00b0C trajectory.\n\nAlso read:\u00a0Planetary Boundaries\n\nCauses of Climate Change\n\nSeveral anthropogenic activities induce harm to the environment. A few important of them are-\n\nPower Generation\nBurning fossil fuels to provide power and heat accounts for a sizable portion of world emissions. Burning coal, oil, or gas releases carbon dioxide and nitrous oxide, which are still used to produce the majority of power.\nOnly a\u00a0little over a quarter of the world\u2019s electricity is generated by renewable energy sources including wind, solar, and other natural resources.\nManufacturing and Industrial goods\nThe manufacturing/industrial sector is one of the leading global producers of greenhouse gas emissions.\nEmissions from manufacturing and industry are mostly the result of burning fossil fuels to create energy for the production of items like textiles, electronics, plastics, cement, iron, and steel.\nGases are also released during mining and other industrial activities, as well as during construction.\nSome products are also manufactured from chemicals derived from fossil fuels i.e., plastic products.\nDeforestation\nA per cent of the world\u2019s greenhouse gas emissions is caused by deforestation, along with agriculture and other changes in land use.\nAs per an estimation, nearly 12 million hectares of forests are burned annually. Cutting down forests to make way for farms, pastures, or for other purposes also increases emissions.\nForests absorb carbon dioxide, hence cutting or destroying forests reduces nature\u2019s capacity to absorb emissions.\nTransportation\nFossil fuels are typically used to power transportation machines. As a result, emissions of greenhouse gases, particularly carbon dioxide, are greatly influenced by the transportation sector.\nIn addition, statistics suggest that over the next few years, energy use for transportation will rise significantly.\nFood Production\nIn addition to deforestation and clearing land for agriculture and grazing, digestion by cows and sheep, production and use of fertilizers and manure, and the use of energy to run farm machinery or fishing boats, typically with fossil fuels, all contribute to the production of food.\nPowering Buildings\nOver half of all electricity used worldwide is consumed by residential and commercial structures.\nEnergy-related carbon dioxide emissions from buildings have increased over the past few years as a result of rising energy demand for heating and cooling, rising air conditioner ownership, and increased electricity use for lighting, appliances, and connected devices.\n\nAlso read: State of Global Climate Report 2023\n\nEffects of Climate Change\n\nClimate change has devastating impacts on us and the environment. The major effects are-\n\nIncrease in Temperature\nThe global surface temperature rises together with greenhouse gas concentrations. The most recent ten years, 2011 to 2020, have been the warmest on record.\nHigher temperatures worsen heat-related illnesses and make it more challenging to work outside. When the weather is hotter, wildfires start more easily and spread more quickly.\nMore Severe Storms\nIn many areas, destructive storms have increased in intensity and frequency. More moisture evaporates as temperatures rise, aggravating extremely heavy rains and flooding and resulting in more severe storms.\nThe warming ocean has an impact on both the intensity and frequency of tropical storms. Warm ocean surface waters are the primary source of cyclones, hurricanes, and typhoons.\nFrequent Drought\nWater availability is changing due to climate change, becoming more scarce in many places. In already water-stressed areas, global warming makes water shortages worse.\nIt also increases the danger of ecological and agricultural droughts, which can harm crops and make ecosystems more vulnerable.\nWarming and Rising Ocean\nThe ocean absorbs carbon dioxide, keeping it out of the atmosphere. However, additional carbon dioxide causes the water to become more acidic, endangering coral reefs and marine life.\nIt is the property of water that it expands when becomes warmer, therefore as the ocean warms, its volume will rise. Sea levels increase as a result of ice sheet melting, endangering coastal and island communities.\nLoss of Species\nBoth animals on land and in the ocean are at risk from climate change. As the temperatures rise, these risks rise as well.\nThe rate of extinction on the planet is 1,000 times higher now than it has ever been in recorded human history. Within the next few decades, one million species face extinction.\nThreats from climate change include invasive pests and illnesses, forest fires, and harsh weather.\nFood Scarcity\nGlobal hunger and poor nutrition are on the rise for a variety of reasons, including climate change and an increase in extreme weather occurrences. Crops, animals, and fisheries might all be lost or become less effective.\nMarine resources that provide food for billions of people are in danger as a result of the ocean\u2019s increasing acidity.\nFood sources from herding, hunting, and fishing have been hampered in several Arctic regions due to changes in the snow and ice cover.\nHeat stress can reduce available water and grazing areas, which can lower crop output and have an impact on cattle.\nHealth Hazards\nThe single greatest hazard to human health is climate change. Air pollution, sickness, harsh weather, forced relocation, stress on mental health, increasing hunger and inadequate nutrition in areas where people cannot grow or get enough food are only a few of the health effects of climate change.\n13 million individuals every year are killed by environmental conditions. Extreme weather events increase fatalities and make it challenging for healthcare systems to keep up with the growing number of diseases caused by changing weather patterns.\n\nRead:\u00a0Climate Resilient Health Systems;\u00a0Climate Change and Health\n\nDeepen Poverty and Displacement\nClimate change makes it easier for people to fall into and stay in poverty.\nFloods have the potential to devastate homes and livelihoods in urban slums. Outdoor jobs may be challenging to perform in the heat. Crops may be impacted by water scarcity.\nWeather-related disasters have uprooted an estimated 23.1 million people annually on average over the previous ten years (2010-2019), leaving millions more at risk of poverty.\nThe majority of refugees are from countries that are least able and prepared to adjust to the effects of climate change.\n\nRead:\u00a0Impact of climate change on Indian monsoon\n\nEvery increase in global warming matters\n\nNumerous UN assessments were endorsed by hundreds of experts and government reviewers who concluded that keeping the increase in global temperature to 1.5\u00b0C will help us escape the worst climatic effects and maintain a habitable climate.\n\nHowever, according to current national climate plans, the average global warming by the end of the century will reach\u00a0about 3.2\u00b0C.\n\nAcross the world, emissions that contribute to climate change are produced, yet some countries produce significantly more than others. 3 per cent of global emissions are produced by the 100 countries with the lowest emissions.\n\n68% of the contribution comes from the ten countries with the highest emissions. Everyone must act to combat climate change, but those who contribute most to the issue must be the countries with a larger obligation to do so first.\n\nRead:\u00a0Black carbon emissions;\u00a0Climate Change Impact on Earth\u2019s Rotation\n\nArticle Written By: Priti Raj"

Between high tide and low tide lines are where the coastal regulatory zone regions of CRZ 1 are located.\n\nCRZ-II: It consists of the built-up regions that are inside the current municipal boundaries and extend up to the shoreline. This zone prohibits the construction of unauthorised constructions.\n\nCRZ-III: This zone includes places like rural areas that are generally undeveloped and do not fit into the categories listed above. In accordance with this coastal management zone, only particular activities relating to agriculture or designated public utilities are allowed.\n\nCRZ-IV: This zone includes regions of the tidally-influenced water bodies as well as water areas from the low tide line up to the territorial borders.\n\nImportance of coastal zone management\n\nCoastal zones are transition areas between the marine and territorial zones. There is a growing need to safeguard these ecologically sensitive areas, including mangroves and coral reefs, against pollution and the impact of climate change. Additionally, industrial development and new infrastructure projects have been seen as a threat to the mangrove ecosystem, thus, impacting the livelihoods of the local population.\n\nThe CRZ rules and regulations have been formulated with the objective of protecting coastal ecosystems, by regulating human and industrial activities near the coastline. They also aim to improve the lives of coastal communities such as fishing communities, develop measures to deal with the effects of climate change and high-intensity cyclones and ensure sustainable development of the coastal regions. One of the four pillars of the government\u2019s expansive Sagarmala project is the development of coastal villages.\n\nThe government said in 2018 that the CRZ guidelines\u2019 adoption will increase coastal activity and foster economic growth while simultaneously preserving the coastal zones\u2019 conservation principles.

Rainfall in the Western United States and Central America is influenced by moisture from the Amazon.\nCarbon storing potential: Massive amounts of carbon are sequestered by the 390 billion trees that make up the Amazon rainforest in their leaves, branches, and trunks. About 86 billion tonnes of carbon are stored in forests or more than a third of the carbon stored by tropical forests worldwide.\nClimate control: The hydrological system of the Amazon plays a significant part in preserving the local and global climate. Because of the hydrological cycles that depend on the forests, the Amazon\u2019s canopy cover plays an important role in regulating temperature and humidity and is intricately linked to regional climate patterns.\nMedicinal knowledge: Ingredients from the Amazon rainforest are used in one-fourth of all Western medicine. The Amazon provides 70% of the plants that are effective against cancer cells.\nAir purifier: With its extensive vegetation, which continuously absorbs carbon dioxide and releases oxygen, it serves as a giant air purifier.\nSource of food: Eighty percent of the different types of food we consume worldwide have their roots in the Amazon rainforest. There are more than 3000 varieties of fruit grown in the Amazon that can be eaten.\nLocal benefits: Tens of millions of people in the Amazon Basin depend on the services provided by the forest. While logging and the collection of non-timber forest products are important industries in many cities, towns, and villages, rivers serve as the primary means of transportation.\nThreats To the Amazon Rainforest\n\nThis vast untamed wilderness is under increasing threat from huge-scale farming and ranching, infrastructure and urban development, unsustainable logging, mining, and climate change. Threats can be classified as natural threats and anthropogenic threats.\n\nNatural Threats\nEl Ni\u00f1o Southern Oscillation (ENSO): An event or trend in the climate that has a significant impact on Latin American climate variability\nDeforestation: Amazon has shrunk by 20% in recent years as a result of deforestation to make way for the Trans-Amazonian Highway.\nGlobal temperature rise: The Amazon rainforest could suffer greatly from climate change, as just a three-degree increase in temperature could destroy seventy-five percent of it. As a result of current global temperatures, experts even predict that the rainforest will perish in just 100 years.\nForest fire: In August 2019, an Amazon rainforest fire that had been burning for more than 20 days caused devastation in the area. This year, there have been a record number of wildfires in the Amazon, with 72,843 fires already being reported.\nUnsuitable for sustainable agriculture: Although the Amazon rainforest has the greatest diversity of forest vegetation, the land is unsuitable for sustainable agriculture because it contains very little mineral content.\nDrought: Between 2005 and 2010, when rainfall was extremely low, the Amazon suffered from a severe drought.\nAnthropogenic Threats\nBio-Piracy & Smuggling: For use as pets, food, and medicine abroad, people take plants and animals from the Amazon and sell them. Trade in these animals causes wild population declines, usually affecting animals already threatened by habitat loss and pollution, and foreigners do not share the enormous profits from these products with the country of origin.\nCommercial fishing: Large, industrial trawlers equipped with gill nets scoop up entire schools of fish in many areas of the Amazon in a completely unsustainable effort to get food to market.\nCattle ranching: For crop production and cattle grazing, a significant amount of vegetation is constantly cleared\u20141.5 acres are lost every second.\nMining and extraction: Mining activities were responsible for almost 10% of the total deforestation that took place in the Brazilian Amazon between 2005 and 2015. such as gold mining\nDamming: Widespread forest loss has been caused by large hydroelectric projects that have been financed by international aid and development organizations like the World Bank. Along with covering vast areas of rainforest.\nLogging: Loggers frequently use fictitious permits, disregard the restrictions on legitimate permits, cut legally protected species, and steal from indigenous lands and protected areas while working in remote forest areas.\nPoaching: Animals are frequently hunted illegally so that they can be sold as food or as raw materials for finished goods. Many species are disappearing from the wild, including the giant Amazon river turtle \u201cPaiche\u201d and the Amazon manatee.\nImpacts of Loss of Amazon Rainforest\nImpact on precipitation: The amount of rainfall will be impacted by this loss. The water that trees absorb through their roots and release into the atmosphere affects precipitation over South America.\nCarbon Source: The rainforest is being forced to change into a carbon source as a result of rising temperatures brought on by human-induced climate change and deforestation: locations that produce more CO2 than they take in.\nReduction of Biodiversity: The homes, habitats, and food sources of the species that live there are destroyed when forests are cut down. In tropical forests, it is estimated that 100,000 species per year go extinct.\nDisruption of Migratory Corridors: Broken-up habitat patches can frequently be left behind when forests are destroyed. Animals that need to be connected to contiguous forests to travel or migrate from one place to another may encounter difficulties because of these scattered portions of the forest.\nHigher Temperatures: The Amazon is already scorchingly hot. By removing trees, the forest floor is exposed to more sunlight, which dries it out and raises the temperature of the ground.\nZoonotic diseases: A report from the WWF claims that environmental destruction is to blame for 70% of human diseases. The world\u2019s largest tropical rainforest, the Amazon, is undergoing a process of deforestation that could result in a sharp rise in zoonotic diseases.\nThreat to indigenous tribes and their knowledge: As contemporary loggers, miners, multinational corporations, and landless farmers invade and devastate the forest, their personal and cultural survival is gravely in jeopardy.\nErosion and degradation of the soil: The majority of the nutrients in the Amazon are found in plants and animals; the soil there is thin and devoid of nutrients. The Amazonian trees not only prevent soil erosion by holding the topsoil in place, but they also release decaying material that feeds and fertilizes the soil\u2019s living organisms.\nPollution: Increased human activity frequently leads to ecosystem degradation through the removal of trees, which act as a natural filter for pollutants, as well as through improper use and handling of water and soil.\nWay Forward\nReduce deforestation: Reducing deforestation will strengthen the resilience of the Amazon rainforest and safeguard its threatened areas.\nZero deforestation policy: The Brazilian government\u2019s current administration is in the spotlight, and it is being urged to implement a zero-deforestation policy to change the situation.\nInterference of Supranational bodies: For instance, the European Union is urged to take action to stop the trade of raw materials that contribute to Amazonian deforestation.\nConstruct knowledge about the role of trees in the Amazon ecosystem: Create awareness among students and youths of the importance of trees to the Amazon ecosystem.\nLimit greenhouse gas emissions: To protect the Amazon, it is also necessary to limit global greenhouse gas emissions.\nCorporate social responsibility: Corporates are required to follow corporate responsibility guidelines which bans them from taking part in endeavors that harm Amazon.\nCivil society participation: Reduced meat consumption is one aspect of living a sustainable lifestyle that helps to slow down the destruction of the Amazon.\n\nThere are a lot of carbon stocks stored in the Amazon. If all of it were to be released, it would further contribute to rising temperatures and have an impact on future global mean temperatures. Therefore, saving the Amazon would eventually save the entire human population.\n\nArticle Written by Remya"

The revision came to light in CoP 26 where PM Modi made certain revised promises.\n\nAt the CoP 26 Glasgow meeting in 2021, the PM of India promised to strengthen India\u2019s climate commitments. For that five promises were made and called the \u2018Panchamrit\u2019, the nectar. Out of the 5 Promises, the Union Government\u00a0has granted permission to two of the promises.\n\nThe 27th Conference of the Parties of the UNFCCC (COP 27), is going to be held in November 2022 in Sharm El-Sheikh, Egypt. Where India\u2019s revised and Union Cabinet approved Nationally Determined Contributions (NDC), a formal statement outlining its action plan to address and combat climate change is set to be presented.\n\nTable of Contents\n\nAbout Revised Targets\nEarlier Climate Targets\nIndia\u2019s Revised Climate Targets\nIndia\u2019s Initiatives and Progress\nIndia\u2019s Initiatives\nIndia\u2019s Progress Toward Its Climate Targets\nWhat is COP?\nParis Agreement 2015\nConclusion\nAbout Revised Targets\n\nTo get a better understanding of revised climate targets, look at the earlier targets first.\n\nEarlier Climate Targets\n\nIndia\u2019s original NDC was submitted 1st in 2015 that contained a number of targets, three main targets of them for 2030 are:\n\nA 33 to 35 percent reduction in emissions per unit of GDP from 2005 levels\nAt least 40 percent of total electricity generation comes from non-fossil renewable sources\ncreate an additional carbon sink of 2.5 to 3 billion tonnes of carbon dioxide equivalent by increasing the forest cover.\nIndia\u2019s Revised Climate Targets\nIndia is now committed to reducing its emission intensity by at least 45 percent, instead of just 33 to 35 percent, from 2005 levels by the year 2030.\nIndia would now ensure that at least 50 percent of its total electricity generation (earlier just 40 percent) would come from renewable sources by 2030.\nThe climate targets related to forestry have not been touched yet, it\u2019s similar to the old target.\nIndia\u2019s Initiatives and Progress\n\nIndia has started several initiatives to combat climate change and made certain promises which are termed climate targets and achieved certain outcomes as well.\n\nIndia\u2019s Initiatives\nThe Faster Adoption and Manufacturing of Hybrid & Electric Vehicles Scheme in India to speed up the country\u2019s transition to electric mobility and a voluntary vehicle scrapping policy to phase out unsafe and unsafe automobiles.\nIndia\u2019s advancement of the promises made by NDC in 2015.\nAccording to Bangalore\u2019s first integrated green hydrogen electrolyzer gigafactory, the opportunity to produce 20 MT of green hydrogen (at $1 per kilogram) will be worth $20\u201325 billion. By 2030, India will have installed a capacity of 15-20 GW for producing green hydrogen.\nA transportation revolution in India is necessary to ensure a positive growth rate toward reaching India\u2019s Net Zero Emissions by 2070. This revolution will result in greater \u201cwalkability,\u201d public transportation, railroads, roads, and better cars.\nThe push for Electric Vehicles (EVs) is motivated by the global climate agenda set forth in the Paris Agreement to reduce carbon emissions in order to prevent further anthropogenic global warming.\nIndia is among those handfuls of countries, supporting the global campaign EV30@30. This campaign has been initiated globally with an aim of achieving a 30% sales share of EVs by 2030.\nThe Government of India has advanced the target of 20% ethanol blending in petrol to 2025 from 2030 which will reduce petroleum-related pollution.\nIndia\u2019s Progress Toward Its Climate Targets\n\nIndia\u2019s two climate targets, which deal with reducing emissions intensity and increasing the share of non-fossil fuels in energy generation, have been revised.\n\n\ud83d\udc49 Which year are YOU targeting for success in the IAS/IPS/IFS Exam? \ud83d\ude80\n\n(1) \u21d2 UPSC 2025: Prelims cum Mains\n\n(2) \u21d2 UPSC 2026: Prelims cum Mains\n\n(3) \u21d2 UPSC 2027 Prelims cum Mains\n\nTip: Know more about ClearIAS Courses (Online/Offline)\n\nIt means that India is on its way to accomplishing its target of reducing emissions before the existing deadline of 2030.\n\nAs per the official data, India\u2019s emissions intensity was 24% lower in 2016 than it was in 2005, the most recent year for which data is officially available.\nIndia\u2019s commitment to the 33 to 35 percent reduction goal has either already been achieved or is very close to reaching so.\nThe other objective, which called for at least 40% of electricity to come from non-fossil fuels, has now been accomplished. The statistics of the power ministry show that non-fossil fuels now account for 41.5% of India\u2019s 403 GW installed electricity capacity.\nWhich, hydropower makes up over 11% of this capacity, and renewable energy sources including wind, solar, and others make up over 28%.\nWhat is COP?\n\nThe Conference of Parties (COP) is the supreme decision-making body of the United Nations Climate Change Framework Convention (UNFCCC).\n\nAll States that are Parties to the Convention are represented at the COP, where they assess the application of the Convention and any other legal instruments that the COP adopts and make decisions necessary to support the successful application of the Convention, including institutional and administrative arrangements.\n\nParis Agreement 2015\n\nThe Paris Agreement on climate change is a legally binding international treaty. It was adopted by 196 Parties at COP 21 in Paris, on 12 December 2015. The agreement entered into force on 4 November 2016.\n\nAccording to the 2015 Paris Agreement, countries must outline a plan to limit global warming to 1.5\u00b0C by 2100 and no higher than 2\u00b0C.\nOn October 2, 2016, India signed the Paris Agreement, a historic agreement that urges nations to battle climate change and keep the rise in global temperatures to a minimum.\nThe joint agreement that all countries involved sign at the COP is the end outcome, but the actual work begins when nations are required to submit NDCs every five years.\nIn the NDC submitted by India, the most important of India\u2019s eight targets included reducing GDP emissions intensity by 33%-35% (compared to 2005 levels) by 2030, having 40% of installed electricity capacity come from renewable sources, and adding an additional 2.5-3 billion tonnes of carbon sinks through forest and tree cover by that year.\nIndia has high net emissions but low per-capita emissions despite being a big, populated country. However, over the course of several years of discussions, and international pressure, India eventually agreed to phase out fossil fuels.\nThe Paris Agreement is a turning point in the global climate change process because it is the first time that a legally enforceable agreement unites all countries in the fight against climate change and in an attempt to adapt to its effects.\nConclusion\n\nThe choice to adopt enhanced NDCs highlighted India\u2019s dedication to separating economic growth from greenhouse gas emissions at the highest possible level. In many different sectors, including water, agriculture, forestry, energy, business, sustainable mobility and housing, waste management, circular economy, and resource efficiency, appropriate steps are being adopted.\n\nHowever, To achieve the climate targets made, NDCs should also prioritize phasing out equipment and units older than 20 years in addition to increasing the generation of non-fossil fuel power.\n\nTo adhere to the international climate agreement concerns, the energy reduction aim should be stringent and must be rigorously followed.\n\nRead:\u00a0Zero carbon buildings;\u00a0Black carbon emissions\n\nArticle Written by: Priti Raj"

            "[CONTENT]": "What is carbon trading? How does it work? What are its advantages and disadvantages? To answer all these, read further.\n\nIn the fight against climate change, reducing greenhouse gas emissions, such as carbon dioxide, is essential.\n\nVarious initiatives at the global and national levels have been initiated for this cause.\n\nCarbon trading is one such innovative solution.\n\nTable of Contents\n\nWhat is carbon trading?\nHow does it work?\nAdvantages of the scheme\nDisadvantages of the scheme\nCarbon Markets under the Paris accord\nCarbon trade framework agreed at the COP26 Glasgow climate summit\nWhat is carbon trading?\n\nCarbon trading is a market-based system that aims to offer financial incentives to persuade enterprises to lessen their environmental footprint. In contrast to voluntary offsets, which allow consumers to pay to offset their carbon impact, carbon trading is a legally binding scheme.\n\nHow does it work?\n\nCarbon trading seeks to place a price on CO2 using the caps and trade principle and is calculated by individual governments and policymakers. The amount of emissions that are allowed for each carbon-producing industry, such as the power sector, the automobile industry, and air travel, is capped by the government.\n\n\ud83d\udc49 Which year are YOU targeting for success in the IAS/IPS/IFS Exam? \ud83d\ude80\n\n(1) \u21d2 UPSC 2025: Prelims cum Mains\n\n(2) \u21d2 UPSC 2026: Prelims cum Mains\n\n(3) \u21d2 UPSC 2027 Prelims cum Mains\n\nTip: Know more about ClearIAS Courses (Online/Offline)\n\nGovernments then issue permits up to the established cap, which is either given away for free or sold at auction to businesses operating in the field. If a corporation considerably reduces its own carbon emissions, it can sell the extra permits on the carbon market for money. It may need to purchase more permits if it is unable to restrict its emissions.\n\nAdvantages of the scheme\n\nIn the past, cap and trade programs have been quite successful in addressing environmental issues. For example, trading sulphur dioxide permits helped to reduce acid rain in the US.\n\nThe main draw for governments trying to reduce CO2 is that carbon trading is a lot simpler to put into practise than pricey direct laws and unpopular carbon taxes. (Under carbon taxes, the government sets a price that emitters must pay for each tonne of greenhouse gas emissions they produce)\n\nA robust carbon price and worldwide integration of regional cap and trade programs could make global decarbonization relatively quick and painless.\n\nDisadvantages of the scheme\n\nIt is incredibly challenging to develop a market for something like carbon dioxide that has no intrinsic worth. To enable trading, you must encourage scarcity and rigorously restrict the power to emit. For example, political involvement has resulted in an excess of permits in the EU ETS, the largest carbon trading scheme in the world.\n\nThese were frequently given out for free, which caused the price to drop and ineffective emission reductions. Another issue is that trading of offset permits, which are obtained through funding pollution reductions in developing nations, is permitted. The significance of these permits in cutting carbon emissions is debatable, and therefore reduces the effectiveness of the cap and trade system as a whole.\n\nCarbon Markets under the Paris accord\nArticle 6 of the Paris Agreement details the provisions pertaining to establishing a new carbon market.\nAgreements on a bilateral basis to transfer emissions reductions are permitted per Article 6.2.\nAccording to Article 6.4, there is a larger carbon market where anyone can buy and sell emissions reductions.\nTo help countries reach their goals, Article 6.8 stipulates that \u201cnon-market approaches\u201d shall be made available to them.\nCarbon trade framework agreed at the COP26 Glasgow climate summit\n\nFollowing fruitful talks at the Glasgow COP26 Climate Summit in 2021, nations now have a more standardized framework to follow when engaging in international carbon trading. The established regulations lay forth precise criteria for how the carbon market will operate for bilateral agreements between nations and in a market that is under United Nations supervision.\n\nThe fundamentals of the deal basically center around carbon credit offsets. For instance, countries that reduce their emissions more than they had committed to do are awarded credits, which can subsequently be sold to nations where reducing greenhouse gas emissions is expensive. The pact attempts to motivate countries to increase their investments in climate mitigation programs and technology, such as increasing the production of renewable energy, to create credits that they may use to offset their emissions.\n\nArticle written by: Caroline Abraham"

Solid: Wood, dried plant material, and manure\n\n\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 b. Liquid: Bioethanol and Biodiesel\n\n\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 c. Gaseous: Biogas\n\nThese can be used in place of or in addition to diesel, gasoline, or other fossil fuels for permanent, portable, and other purposes, as well as for transportation. They can also be utilized to produce power and heat.\n\nRising oil prices, greenhouse gas emissions from fossil fuels, and interest in obtaining fuel from crops for the benefit of farmers are some of the key drivers of the switch to biofuels.\n\nCategories of Biofuels\n1. First Generation biofuels\nThese are produced using traditional technologies from food sources including sugar, starch, vegetable oil, or animal fats.\nBio-alcohols, biodiesel, vegetable oil, bio-ethers, and biogas are examples of common first-generation biofuels.\nAlthough the conversion process is simple, using food sources to produce biofuels upsets the food system, driving up food costs and contributing to hunger.\n2. Second Generation biofuels\nThese are made from non-food crops or by-products of food crops that are considered wastes since they cannot be eaten, such as fruit peels, husks, stems, and wood chips.\nSuch fuels are created through thermochemical reactions or biochemical conversion processes. Examples include biodiesel and cellulose ethanol.\nAlthough these fuels have no impact on the food economy, they are difficult to produce.\nAdditionally, it is claimed that when compared to first-generation biofuels, these biofuels release fewer greenhouse emissions.\n3. Third Generation biofuels\nThese are produced from micro-organisms like algae. Example:- Butanol.\nAlgae can be cultivated on land and in water that is not suited for food production, which relieves pressure on already-depleted water supplies.\nOne disadvantage is that fertilizers used in the production of such crops lead to environmental pollution.\n4. Fourth Generation Biofuels\nCrops that have been genetically modified to absorb large amounts of carbon are cultivated and harvested as biomass to create these fuels.\nThe crops are then converted into fuel using second-generation techniques.\nPre-combustion of the fuel occurs, and carbon is captured. The carbon is then geo-sequestered, which refers to the storage of the carbon in coal seams that cannot be mined or in exhausted oil or gas fields.\nSome of these fuels are considered carbon-negative as their production pulls out carbon from the environment.\nSome popular biofuel Crops\n\n1. Jatropha\n\n2. Sugar beet\n\n3. Sorghum\n\n4. Pongamia/Karangia\n\nMajor Types of Biofuels\nBioethanol\nIt is derived from corn and sugarcane using a fermentation process.\nAbout two-thirds of the energy in one liter of gasoline can be found in one liter of ethanol.\nIt enhances fuel combustion and reduces carbon monoxide and sulfur oxide emissions when combined with gasoline.\nFlexible fuel vehicles (FFVs) have an internal combustion engine and are capable of operating on gasoline and any blend of gasoline and ethanol.\n\nTo know more click here.\n\nBiodiesel\nIt is derived from vegetable oils like soybean oil or palm oil, vegetable waste oils, and animal fats by a biochemical process called \u201cTransesterification.\u201d\nIt produces very little or no amount of harmful gases as compared to diesel.\nIt can be used as an alternative to conventional diesel fuel.\nBiogas\nIt is created by the anaerobic breakdown of organic materials, such as sewage from people and animals.\nMethane and carbon dioxide make up the majority of biogas, while it also contains minor amounts of hydrogen, carbon monoxide, and hydrogen sulfide. Biogas is frequently utilized for heating, electricity generation, and transportation.\n\nRead:\u00a0BioCNG\n\nBiobutanol\nIt is produced in the same way as bioethanol i.e. through the fermentation of starch.\nButanol has the highest energy content of all the gasoline substitutes. It can be used to cut emissions from diesel.\nIt serves as a solvent in the textile industry and as a base in perfumes.\nBiohydrogen\nBiohydrogen, like biogas, can be produced using several processes such as pyrolysis, gasification, or biological fermentation.\nIt can be the perfect alternative to fossil fuels.\nAdvantages of Biofuels\nAvailability: biofuels are produced from biomass and thus are renewable.\nSource material: Biofuels can be produced from a variety of materials, such as crop waste, manure, and other by-products, unlike oil, which is a finite resource that originates from a restricted number of specific elements.\nEnvironment Pollution: Although they don\u2019t emit as much carbon as fossil fuels, fertilizers used to cultivate biofuels do produce greenhouse gas emissions. Additionally, biofuels can aid in the management of municipal solid waste by allowing garbage to be turned into fuel.\nSecurity: Local production of biofuels reduces the country\u2019s reliance on imported energy. Countries can preserve the integrity of their energy resources and keep them secure from outside influences by limiting their reliance on foreign fuel sources.\nEconomic stimulation: Due to the local production of biofuels, biofuel manufacturing facilities can hire hundreds or thousands of people, resulting in the creation of new jobs in rural areas.\nBiofuel production will also increase the demand for suitable biofuel crops, providing economic stimulation to the agriculture industry.\nDisadvantages of Biofuels\nEfficiency: Fossil Fuels produce more energy than some biofuels. E.g. 1 gallon of ethanol produces less energy as compared to 1 gallon of gasoline (a fossil fuel).\nCost: Fossil fuel extraction from the earth is a challenging and expensive operation, which results in high expenses. The land is needed for the production of biofuels, which has an impact on both the price of biofuels and the price of food crops. Additionally, even while farmers can benefit financially from planting transgenic biofuel crops, too many of these crops have the potential to destroy biodiversity.\nFood shortages: There is a concern that using valuable cropland to grow fuel crops could have an impact on the cost of food and could lead to food shortages.\n\u00a0Water use: Massive quantities of water are required for proper irrigation of biofuel crops as well as to manufacture the fuel, which could strain local and regional water resources.\nNational and International Initiatives\nInternational Initiatives on Sustainable Biofuels\n\nProduction of sustainable biofuels is required to reduce their impact on the environment and economy.\n\nRoundtable on Sustainable Biomaterials (RSB)\n\nIt is an international initiative that brings together parties with an interest in the sustainability of biofuel production and distribution, including farmers, businesses, governments, non-governmental organizations, and scientists.\nIt introduced the \u201cRSB Certification System,\u201d a set of comprehensive sustainability standards, in April 2011. Producers of biofuels that adhere to these standards can demonstrate to consumers and government officials that their product was produced without endangering the environment or violating human rights.\n\nSustainable Biofuels Consensus\n\nIt is an international initiative that calls upon governments, the private sector, and other stakeholders to take decisive action to ensure the sustainable trade, production, and use of biofuels.\n\nBonsucro\n\nIt is an international not-for-profit, multi-stakeholder organization established in 2008 to promote sustainable sugar cane.\nIts stated aim is to reduce the environmental and social impacts of sugarcane production while recognizing the need for economic viability.\nIt does that through setting sustainability standards and certifying sugar cane products including ethanol, sugar, and molasses.\nNational Initiatives\n\nInitiatives by the Department of Biotechnology, Ministry of Science and Technology\n\nThe department successfully developed 2G Ethanol and transferred the technology to Oil Marketing Companies (OMCs).\nDeveloped Indigenous Cellulolytic Enzyme for the production of biofuels.\nDemonstrated micro algae-based sewage treatment technology.\nThrough multilateral initiatives like Mission Innovation and Bio Future Platform, it has expanded global cooperation to speed up innovation in sustainable biofuel.\nIt is a training & encouragement for young researchers in the field of Bioenergy through Fellowships/Awards.\n\nThe 2019 Pradhan Mantri JI-VAN Yojana\n\nThe program\u2019s goals are to foster an environment for the development of business ventures and to advance R&D in the 2G ethanol market.\n\nEthanol blending\n\nThe 2018 Biofuel Policy has the objective of reaching 20% ethanol-blending and 5% biodiesel-blending by the year 2030.\nThe Government has reduced GST on ethanol for blending in fuel from 18% to 5%.\nThe Ministry of Petroleum & Natural Gas is making all efforts to increase the ethanol supply for petrol.\n\nGOBAR (Galvanizing Organic Bio-Agro Resources) DHAN scheme, 2018\n\nIt focuses on managing and turning solid farm waste, like as animal dung, into compost, biogas, and bio-CNG, which helps keep villages clean and boosts the income of rural people.\nIt was launched under the Swachh Bharat Mission (Gramin).\n\nRepurpose Used Cooking Oil (RUCO):\n\nRUCO launched by the Food Safety and Standards Authority of India (FSSAI) aims for an ecosystem that will enable the collection and conversion of used cooking oil to biodiesel.\n\nNational Policy on Biofuels, 2018\n\nTo enable the extension of appropriate financial and fiscal incentives under each category, the Policy divides biofuels into \u201cBasic Biofuels\u201d such as First Generation (1G) ethanol and biodiesel, and \u201cAdvanced Biofuels\u201d such as Second Generation (2G) ethanol, Municipal Solid Waste (MSW) to drop-in fuels, Third Generation (3G) biofuels, bio-CNG, etc.\nBy allowing the use of sugarcane juice, sugar-containing materials like sugar beet, and sweet sorghum, starch-containing materials like corn, and cassava, and damaged food grains like wheat, broken rice, and rotten potatoes, unfit for human consumption, it broadens the range of raw materials available for the production of ethanol.\nThe Policy allows the use of surplus food grains for the production of ethanol for blending with petrol with the approval of the National Biofuel Coordination Committee.\nThe Policy, which places a focus on advanced biofuels, suggests a viability gap finance plan for 2G ethanol bio refineries of Rs. 5000 crores in 6 years, in addition to increased tax incentives, and higher purchasing prices as compared to 1G biofuels.\nThe Policy promotes the establishment of supply chain mechanisms for the manufacture of biodiesel from non-edible oilseeds, used cooking oil, and fast-growing plants.\nRoles and responsibilities of all the concerned Ministries/Departments with respect to biofuels have also been captured in the Policy.\n\nAlso read: India-US Strategic Clean Energy Partnership\n\nWay Forward\nPromotion of the use of biofuels in transportation in countries like India will help in reducing the crude import bill.\nBiofuels can help in rural and agricultural development in the form of new cash crops.\nUse of wastelands and municipal wastes produced in cities should be ensured in efforts to produce sustainable biofuels.\nA properly designed and implemented biofuel solution can provide both food and energy.\nIt is possible to implement a community-based biodiesel distribution program that boosts local economies on all fronts, from the farmers who provide the feedstock to the neighborhood companies that produce and supply the fuel to consumers.\nPrevious Year UPSC Questions from the topic\n\nQ.

It is necessary to understand what are agrochemicals and how they affect the environment. Read here to know more about them.\n\nAgrochemicals were created to aid farmers in enhancing crop yields and protecting their crops from pests.\n\nThe farmer began utilizing agrochemicals in their crops to prevent and save crops. These substances were employed to reduce insect attacks and improve crop output.\n\nEvery invention, as we all know, has a disadvantage. In this case, the ecosystem is also impacted by agrochemicals since they worsen soil pollution.\n\nTable of Contents\n\nWhat are agrochemicals?\nTypes of agrochemicals\nEffects of agrochemicals\nAgrochemical usage in India\nFossil fertilizers:\nRecent Government Initiatives for Sustainable Farming:\nWay forward\nWhat are agrochemicals?\n\nThe chemical product used in agriculture is known as an agrochemical.\n\nAgrochemicals are primarily used to increase crop yields and reduce agricultural pest populations.\n\n\ud83d\udc49 Which year are YOU targeting for success in the IAS/IPS/IFS Exam? \ud83d\ude80\n\n(1) \u21d2 UPSC 2025: Prelims cum Mains\n\n(2) \u21d2 UPSC 2026: Prelims cum Mains\n\n(3) \u21d2 UPSC 2027 Prelims cum Mains\n\nTip: Know more about ClearIAS Courses (Online/Offline)\n\nThey consist of fertilizers, insecticides, and herbicides.\n\nAgrochemical use in agricultural activities is nothing new as it has been used since 600 BCE, and people have used agrochemicals.\n\nSulfur was employed as a pesticide by the Sumerian farmers in about 3000 BC to prevent bug invasions.\n\nSince there has been such rapid population development, there has been an increase in both the demand for and manufacturing synthetic chemicals.\n\nTypes of agrochemicals\n\nAgrochemicals are classified as pesticides, insecticides, herbicides, fungicides, rodenticides, molluscicides, nematicides, fertilizers, soil conditioners, and limiting and acidifying agents.\n\nSoil Conditioners are materials that are added to the soil to increase the water-holding capacity and aeration of the soil. Examples are manure, compost, peat, livestock manures, leaves, and even shredded newspapers.\nLimiting and acidifying agents: Sometimes the soil is too acidic or too alkaline for the proper growth of crops. The limiting and acidifying agents are added to the soil for adjusting the pH. Calcite or powdered limestone or crushed oyster or mussel shells are added to the acidic soils to neutralize. Sulfur compounds are added to the alkaline soil to neutralize.\nEffects of agrochemicals\n\nOn Soil:\n\nAgrochemicals can alter the pH of the soil.\nOveruse can kill bacteria and other organisms that are beneficial to the soil.\nThese chemicals increase the nitrate content in the soil.\nThese can change the chemical nature of the soil and increase its toxicity.\nThese can bioaccumulate and enter food chains.\nWhen agrochemicals are used excessively, the soil becomes more acidic, which reduces the amount of organic matter (humus content), stunts plant growth, and can even cause greenhouse gases to be released into the environment.\n\nOn Water\n\nThe agrochemicals make water unfit for consumption.\nThese can cause algal blooms in water bodies leading to the death of fish and other aquatic animals.\nEutrophication is caused when chemical fertilizers, which contain phosphates and nitrates, are allowed to remain in the soil and wash off into lakes, streams, and coastal waterways (the addition of excessive amounts of nutrients).\nAdditionally, it promotes the growth of algae. Dead zones are facilitated by the algae, which rob the water of oxygen before decomposing and suffocating local animals.\n\nOn Human Health\n\nThe very hazardous chemicals found in synthetic fertilizers cause biomagnification, or the accumulation of harmful substances, which worsens the health of organisms at higher levels of a food chain.\nThese compounds cause nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, and muscular tremors in humans.\nThese cause effects on the central nervous system leading to convulsion, paralysis, and death.\nThey can cause damage to the nerve, infertility, and reproductive problems.\nBirth defects are increased due to the toxicity of agrochemicals.\nAgrochemical usage in India\n\nIndia used roughly 61 million tonnes of fertilizer in FY20, of which 55% was urea. Currently, the nation produces 42-45 million tonnes of fertilizer, while imports total about 18 million tonnes.\n\nThe Centre provides a subsidy for urea fertilizer based on the cost of manufacturing at each facility. Manufacturers of fertilizers are required to sell them.\n\nThe Insecticides Act, of 1968, and the Insecticides Rules, of 1971, govern the use of pesticides in India.\n\nIn 2021, the Indian pesticides market had a value of about INR 212 billion, and it is anticipated to grow.\n\nFossil fertilizers:\n\nThe fertilizer business increasingly positions itself as a part of the answer to these convergent global crises, even though chemical fertilizers made from fossil fuels, or \u201cfossil fertilizers,\u201d are an underappreciated cause of climate change, biodiversity loss, and hazardous pollution.\n\nAgrochemical producers are supporting carbon capture and storage (CCS) as well as hydrogen and ammonia derived from fossil fuels to ensure additional revenue streams for business-as-usual production.\n\nWhen industrial agriculture and fossil fuels should be phased out, these tendencies run the risk of increasing our dependence on them.\n\nAmid a global emergency, this new business model expands the fossil economy, pushing humanity and ecosystems further beyond the planet\u2019s carrying capacity.\n\nRecent Government Initiatives for Sustainable Farming:\nPromotion of Alternate Nutrients for Agriculture Management Yojana (PRANAM)\nRashtriya Krishi Vikas Yojana (RKVY)\nLiquid Nano-Urea Fertiliser\nWay forward\n\nThe approach should be taken to shift chemical methods to non-chemical methods for enhancing soil fertility.\n\nThe use of biofertilizers (like Rhizobium) should be encouraged because they are economical, environmentally beneficial, and may be produced on the farm itself when needed in large quantities.\nThey fix up to 40-50 kg of nitrogen and boost crop output by 10\u201340%.\nNano urea should be promoted.\n\nThe use of agrochemicals should be regulated. Farmland should maintain and regulate proper storage facilities, labeling, emergency cleanup equipment, applications, and disposal process.\n\nFor the purchase of agrochemicals, prior approved registration or Government-issued permits should be taken.\n\nBy establishing rural fertilizer banks, fertilizer use can be controlled. For the purchase of fertilizer, Aadhaar-linked accounts should be necessary, and digital sales records can be retained and used for crop observation.\n\nA proper management policy is required for encouraging the judicious use of agrochemicals.\n\nAppropriate and scientifically sound measures should be taken to detoxify and degrade chemical residues in the environment.\n\nOrganic Farming should be promoted as a substitute for Agrochemicals.\n\nSince organic farming uses only sustainable and organic methods to encourage the healthy growth of crops, it can be utilized as an alternative to agrochemicals.\nIn integrated organic farming, waste products from one process are recycled as nutrients for other processes, resulting in zero waste production.\nThis permits the most effective use of resources and improves production efficiency.\n\nOther farming techniques like vertical farming and zero-budget natural farming (ZBNF) should be encouraged and promoted more.\n\nAlso read:\u00a0Environmentally friendly fertilizers;\u00a0National Pest Surveillance System (NPSS)\n\n-Article written by Swathi Satish"

It is essential to be aware of such injustices and work towards reducing the damage. Here we have explained the crux of the matter with suitable examples.\n\nOne of the many facets of the ongoing conflict between environmental conservation and development is environmental racism. International opportunities for environmental racism have grown as a result of globalization.\n\nBenjamin Chavis, an African-American civil rights activist, is credited with coining the phrase \u201cenvironmental racism\u201d in 1982.\n\nAlso read: Minorities in India\n\nTable of Contents\n\nEnvironmental racism\nInstances of Environmental Racism around the globe\nWaste dumping in developing and underdeveloped nations:\nEnvironmental racism in India\nChallenges\nWay forward\nPotential mains question\nEnvironmental racism\n\nIt refers to the way that minority group neighborhoods, which are predominately made up of people of color and economically underprivileged residents, are burdened with an excessive number of risks, such as toxic waste facilities, landfills, offensive odors, and other sources of environmental pollution that reduce the quality of life.\n\nMembers of minority communities around the world are more likely to experience health issues due to increased exposure to garbage and pollution.\nThis might happen as a result of unsafe or unhealthy working circumstances when there are no rules (or none are enforced) for low-wage workers, or in areas where toxic materials are present near residential areas.\n\nBecause of the complicated governmental challenges brought on by a history of systemic disenfranchisement, the problems can be difficult to solve and can be problematic.\n\n\ud83d\udc49 Which year are YOU targeting for success in the IAS/IPS/IFS Exam? \ud83d\ude80\n\n(1) \u21d2 UPSC 2025: Prelims cum Mains\n\n(2) \u21d2 UPSC 2026: Prelims cum Mains\n\n(3) \u21d2 UPSC 2027 Prelims cum Mains\n\nTip: Know more about ClearIAS Courses (Online/Offline)\n\nInstances of Environmental Racism around the globe\n\nCanada:\n\nThe indigenous Inuit community of the arctic areas of Canada is protesting against the iron ore mining companies on their land. They protested at -30 degrees Celsius against the planned expansion of the mine and adjacent railway line. The mining activity had caused their age-old practice of hunting and fishing to be adversely affected and they fear it will further damage their environment.\n\nNorth America has numerous cases of environmental racism going on without any reprieve to the aggrieved.\n\nUSA:\n\nNative Americans are undoubtedly the most severely affected by environmental racism for decades. The Commission for Racial Justice found that about 50 percent of all American Indians live in communities with uncontrolled hazardous waste sites.\n\nOther cases like the 2014 poisoned water tap in Flint, Michigan which made 6000-12000 children sick are caused due to neglect of environmental laws in socioeconomically backward regions. To save money, the city changed its water source to the Flint River but failed to treat the new supply adequately, exposing its 100,000 majority-black inhabitants to dangerous levels of lead from aging pipes and other contaminants such as E. coli.\n\nChina:\n\nGuiyu is a town in China where 80% of children have been poisoned by old computer parts. Electronic waste (e-waste) recycling has remained primitive in Guiyu, and thus contributes to the elevation of blood lead levels (BLLs) in children living in the local environment.\n\nChina might be the fastest growing economy in the world but its ecological concern is disastrous and it seems advertently harming its people, especially the poor.\n\nAustralia:\n\nAustralian planners, to protect urban residents from pollution, assigned some areas as sacrifice zones for noxious and polluting land uses. This is where the marginalized and vulnerable people are pushed to places with low environmental quality.\n\nThese places may exhibit chronic air, water, noise, heat, and light pollution, with substandard housing, higher crime rates, more liquor stores, and poor quality fruit and vegetable markets and green spaces.\n\nIn Australia, such places are frequently home to Indigenous people, and migrants, working for poor, homeless, welfare-dependent, and other vulnerable populations, partly because they cannot live elsewhere. This inequitable concentration of vulnerable people in hazardous places is called environmental injustice\n\nNigeria:\n\nIn more developed areas of Nigeria, close to the Niger Delta, incidences of oil spills, the burning of toxic waste, and urban air pollution are issues.\n\nIn support of the Ogoni people, who are native to Nigeria\u2019s oil-rich Delta region, numerous websites have been made.\n\nSouth Africa:\n\n\u201cA lack of access to adequate, reliable, cost-effective, and clean energy carriers and technologies to meet energy service needs for cooking and those activities enabled by electricity to support economic and human development\u201d is referred to as \u201cenergy poverty.\u201d Energy poverty is a problem in many South African areas.\n\nAlso read: Arctic plastic crisis\n\nWaste dumping in developing and underdeveloped nations:\n\nOne instance of environmental racism that takes place on a global scale is the export of harmful waste to developing nations.\n\nExamples include:\n\nThe mass shipment of spent American batteries to Mexico, where illegal waste dumps from plants operated by American, European, and Japanese companies have resulted in high rates of anencephaly (when babies are born without brains).\nDue to unclear documentation regarding its poisonous components, the French aircraft carrier Clemenceau was not allowed to enter Alang, an Indian shipbreaking yard.\nIndonesia sent 547 containers of waste back to wealthy nations after discovering they were contaminated with used plastic and hazardous materials, amid a growing backlash in Southeast Asia against being a dumping ground for the developed world\u2019s trash.\nMalaysia also returned 4,120 tons of plastic waste to thirteen countries.\n\nThe poorer or third world countries are victims of this injustice by the so-called developed nations for decades.\n\nEnvironmental racism in India\n\nEnvironmental racism in India is highlighted by the North East environmental controversies, proposals to auction off forests in central India for coal extraction, and the weakened Environmental Impact Assessment (EIA) framework as a result of the draught EIA announcement 2020, among other things.\n\nEtalin Dam in Arunachal Pradesh would submerge over 300,000 trees and affect several thousand Mishmi people, an indigenous tribal group with a population of 13,000 in the state\u2019s Dibang valley district.\nThe Buddhist monks in Tawang are protesting against the huge hydroelectric projects planned by the government in the ecologically sensitive and seismic foothills of the region.\nGas leaks from factories situated in remote areas effecting the villages around them (Bhopal gas tragedy, Vizag gas leaks).\nTribal people being displaced from their lands for developmental activities- are different examples to name a few.\nChallenges\n\nIt is considerably harder than one might imagine fighting for environmental justice.\n\nNumerous groups that support environmental racism frequently boost the local economy in the short term, which forces residents to make trade-offs between their long-term well-being and supporting their families.\n\nThe individuals and organizations in positions of authority need to realize the harm that they are causing to minorities in the name of financial gain; they should not only remove any hazardous garbage that is already there but also forbid its future placement close to minority populations.\n\nHopefully, the numerous demonstrations and advocates for the cause will be able to exert the necessary pressure.\n\nIn the end, we must remember that no person is expendable and the price of progress or development cannot be a person or a community.\n\nAlso read: Diversity of India\n\nWay forward\n\nOrganizations and authorities can take several steps to reduce environmental racism.\n\nCommit to a net-zero GHG reduction target by 2050, or sooner, across the entire value chain.\nIdentify the business activities that disproportionately affect communities based on race, and develop solutions centered on climate justice and racial equity.\nThis can include reducing harmful on-site emissions as well as off-site fleet electrification in high pollution areas.\nOrganizations can also develop green jobs in a just manner that respects human rights and livelihoods.\nAssess the business\u2019 climate impact and data showing the impacts on the communities and stakeholders most affected by the structural inequalities (climate risk and vulnerability assessments).

India is home to more than 60% of all wild Asian elephants. The number of 29,964 elephants were registered in the most recent elephant census, which was conducted in 2017.\n\n31 elephant reserves exist in India. Dandeli Elephant Reserve of Karnataka, Singphan Elephant Reserve of Nagaland, and Lemru Elephant Reserve of Chattishgarh have been established in the past three years by respective states.\nAs a result, there is now around 76,508 sq km of elephant reserves spread throughout 14 states in India.\nAs per the Elephant Census conducted in 2017, Karnataka has the highest number of elephants (6,049), followed by Assam (5,719) and Kerala (3,054), respectively.\n\nAlso read: Elephant Reserves in India\u00a0\n\nAbout Asian Elephants\n\nThree subspecies of Asian elephants are found\u00a0which are the Indian, Sumatran, and Sri Lankan.\n\nThe largest terrestrial mammal on the Asian continent is the Asian elephant. They live in grasslands and forests ranging from dry to wet in 13 range countries across South and Southeast Asia.\nElephant herd sizes in Asia are far smaller than those of African savannah elephants.\nThe largest and oldest female elephant herd member is in charge (known as the matriarch) of the herd.\nElephants\u2019 gestation (pregnancy) period, which can last up to 680 days (22 months), is the longest known gestational period among any mammals.\nFemales between the ages of 14 and 45 may give birth to calves every four years on average, increasing to five years by age 52 and six years by age 60.\nElephants have always been closely associated with humans throughout Asia, where they have evolved into significant cultural symbols.\nProtection Status of Asian Elephants\nIUCN Red List:\u00a0Endangered.\nWildlife (Protection) Act, 1972:\u00a0Schedule I.\nCITES:\u00a0Appendix I\n\nAlso read: Wildlife Sanctuaries in India\n\nThreats to Elephants\n\nTropical Asia\u2019s steadily increasing human population has encroached onto the elephant\u2019s once-vast but now-shrinking forest habitat.\n\nThe Asian elephant\u2019s current range is home to about 20% of the world\u2019s population.\nThe biggest threats to Asian elephants include habitat loss, fragmentation, and degradation.\nUnlawful killing (for example, in revenge for human-elephant conflicts or to obtain their ivory and other products)\nMistreatment in captivity, Rampant mining and Corridor destruction,\nGenetic viability loss brought on by small populations and isolation.\nHabitat Loss\nDue to human population growth, the habitat of Asian elephants is rapidly decreasing, and wild elephant populations are typically small, isolated, and unable to coexist since human settlements have cut off their traditional migration routes.\nFragmentation\nWhat was previously a continuous elephant habitat has been broken up into small sections by large construction projects (such as dams, roads, mines, and industrial complexes), plantations, and expanding human settlements.\nUnlawful Killing\nElephant incursions on farms and villages are becoming more frequent. Human lives and even physical goods are lost as a result of this. These elephants are frequently killed in retaliation by the locals.\nAlthough capture has been outlawed in India, Vietnam, and Myanmar to protect their natural herds, elephants are nonetheless killed annually in Myanmar for the illegal wildlife trade.\nPoaching\nSince only male Asian elephants have tusks, only males are targeted for poaching. The proportion of males without tusks in the population may rise as a result of the selective removal of tuskers for their ivory.\nThe goal of Project Elephant\n\nNeed of the hour is to-\n\nProtect elephants and their habitat.\nReduce human-elephant conflict.\nPromote elephant-friendly policies.\nMonitor elephant numbers, population trends, and threats to elephants and their habitat.\nBuild capacity in range States.\nResearch elephants to help inform conservation strategies.\nSteps Taken for Elephant Conservation\nTo effectively manage the elephant population, the infrastructure needs to be improved in elephant reserves.\nTo conserve elephants, anti-depredation teams, anti-poaching teams, and trekkers are employed.\nBarricading and fencing to avoid human-animal conflict in required areas are promoted.\nGaj Yatra, a national awareness program to honour elephants, emphasizes the importance of protecting elephant corridors.\nSolar fences, trenches, and stonewalling are being installed in depredation-prone areas to reduce the threat of elephants to human habitations.\nTo assess the success of field conservation activities, the Monitoring the Illicit Killing of Elephants (MIKE) program, which was established in 2003, examines trends in information about the illegal killing of elephants from across Africa and Asia.\nResearch on a range of topics, including human-animal conflict and elephant habitat carrying capacity, is encouraged.\nMeasures are taken to reduce the number of wild elephant deaths by educating the local inhabitants.\nThe Ministry of Environment and Forests of India established the Elephant Task Force, which delivered its report, titled \u201cGajah,\u201d to the Ministry in 2010.\nThe National Elephant Conservation Authority (NECA) is now being created, in accordance with one of the Elephant Task Force\u2019s recommendations.\nTo prevent the deaths of elephants by speeding trains, the Ministries of Environment Forests and Climate Change (MoEF&CC) and the Ministry of Railways have jointly issued recommendations to all the affected states.\nRecent news\n\nThe Centre has notified a set of rules called the Captive Elephant\u00a0(Transfer or Transport) Rules, 2024 that liberalises the conditions under which elephants may be transferred within or between States.\n\nElephants are, according to the provisions of the Wildlife Protection Act, a Schedule 1 species and therefore, be it wild or captive, cannot be captured or traded under any circumstances.\nSection 12 of the Act allows Schedule I animals to be translocated for \u2018special purposes\u2019 such as education and scientific research.\nThey can also be translocated for population management of wildlife without harming any wild animals and collection of specimens for recognised zoos/museums.\nCaptive elephants because of their historical role in forest management, timber transport, and presence in estates of erstwhile royal families and temple precincts for religious purposes can be owned and therefore come under a special category.\nHowever, strict rules guide the transfer of such elephants.\n\nThe circumstances under which captive elephants can be transferred are:\n\nwhen an owner is no longer in a position to maintain the elephant,\nthe elephant will likely have better upkeep than in the present circumstances; or\nwhen a state\u2019s Chief Wildlife Warden \u201cdeems it fit and proper\u201d in the circumstances of the case for better upkeep of the elephant.\nPrevious Years Question\n\nWith reference to Indian elephants, consider the following statements: (2020)\n\nThe leader of an elephant group is a female.\nThe maximum gestation period can be 22 months.\nAn elephant can normally go on calving till the age of 40 years only.\nAmong the States in India, the highest elephant population is in Kerala.\n\nWhich of the statements given above is/are correct?\n\n(a) 1 and 2 only\n(b) 2 and 4 only\n(c) 3 only\n(d) 1, 3, and 4 only\n\nAns: (a)\n\nArticle Written By: Priti Raj"

A lot of companies use very polluting high-sulfur oil.\n\nThere are substantial amounts of solid garbage. Farmers in Punjab and Haryana burn crop leftovers on a seasonal basis.\n\nDue prepare their fields for the following crop, and during the winter, when the air is dense, there is a temperature inversion, and there is very little pollution dispersion.\n\nDuring winter we also see people\u00a0burning fires at night\u00a0to bear the cold.\u00a0All this put together has a cumulative effect on the air quality.\n\nfumes formed from aerosol sprays, paint, hair spray, varnish, and other solvents. These can be significant; in the Los Angeles basin in the 2010s, it was estimated that emissions from these sources were responsible for about half of the volatile organic compound pollution.\nWaste deposition in landfills generates methane. Methane is highly flammable and may form explosive mixtures with air.\n\nMethane can displace oxygen in an enclosed environment and is an asphyxiant as well. If the oxygen concentration is displaced below 19.5%, asphyxia or suffocation may occur.\n\nAir pollution is usually thought of as smoke from large factories or exhaust from vehicles.\u00a0\n\nBut there are many types of indoor air pollution as well.\n\nDo you know\u00a0Indoor Air Pollution?\n\nHeating a house by burning substances such as kerosene, wood, and coal can contaminate the air inside the house.\n\nAsh and smoke make breathing difficult, and they can stick to walls, food, and clothing.\n\nNaturally-occurring radon gas, a cancer-causing material, can also build up in homes. Radon is released through the surface of the Earth. Low-cost solutions put in place by experts can lower radon levels.\n\nInsulation is one of the building supplies that can be harmful to people\u2019s health. Additionally, the movement of air in buildings and spaces can promote the growth of harmful mould.\n\n\u00a0A single mould colony could exist in a home\u2019s moist, chilly areas, including in the spaces between walls.\n\nThe airborne spores of the mould spread throughout the entire house. The spores can make people unwell if they breathe them in.\n\nRegulations for Air Pollution\n\nThe majority of affluent nations have passed rules to control emissions and lower air pollution in addition to the international Kyoto Protocol.\n\nA cap and trade system to control emissions is the topic of discussion in the US. The quantity of pollution a corporation is permitted under this approach would be capped, or set at a certain level. Companies would be required to pay if they went over their cap.\n\nCompanies could trade or sell their leftover pollution allowance to other businesses if they exceeded their cap but did not exceed it.\n\nIn essence, cap and trade would pay businesses to reduce pollution.\n\nThe World Health Organization updated its air quality recommendations in 2006. The WHO recommendations are stricter than the majority of individual nations\u2019 current recommendations.\n\nThe WHO recommendations are designed to lower annual air pollution-related mortality by 15%.\n\nConsequences of Air Pollution:\nPollution is responsible for a significant number of deaths (about 2000), which is highly alarming. Since the numbers are simply estimates, they could not be accurate.\n\n\u00a0To obtain precise data, a thorough study is needed, but neither the time nor the money is available, nor are there enough people to carry it out. As a result, we must address the problem of pollution cautiously.\n\nBetween 1990 and 2015, India saw a 50% increase in premature deaths associated with PM 2.5, practically at the same time as economic liberalization.\nBecause pollutants enter the lungs deep inside, the lungs\u2019 ability to cleanse blood is lowered, which has an impact on a person\u2019s ability to grow, think clearly, and function, particularly in youngsters, pregnant women, and the elderly.\nAir quality has also become a severe health concern.\nPoor people are more vulnerable\u00a0to air pollution because they are the ones who spend more time on roads.\nWhat is the National Air Quality Index?\n\nLaunched in 2014 with an outline\u00a0\u2018One Number \u2013 One Color -One Description\u2019\u00a0for the common man to judge the air quality within his vicinity.\n\nThe measurement of air quality is based on\u00a0eight pollutants, namely: Particulate Matter (PM10), Particulate Matter (PM2.5), Nitrogen Dioxide (NO2), Sulphur Dioxide (SO2), Carbon Monoxide (CO), Ozone (O3), Ammonia (NH3), and Lead (Pb).\n\nAQI has six categories of air quality. These are: Good, Satisfactory, Moderately Polluted, Poor, Very Poor, and Severe.\n\nIt has been developed by the\u00a0CPCB in consultation with IIT-Kanpur\u00a0and an expert group comprising medical and air-quality professionals.\n\nCategorization of Air Quality under AQI:\n\n\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0AQI\t\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Remark\tColour Code\tPossible Health Impacts\n\u00a00-50\t\u00a0Good\t\n\tMinimal Impact\n\u00a051-100\t\u00a0Satisfactory\t\n\tMinor breathing discomfort in sensitive people\n\u00a0101-200\t\u00a0Moderate\t\n\tBreathing discomfort to people with asthma and heart disease.\n\u00a0201-300\t\u00a0Poor\t\n\tBreathing discomfort to most people on prolonged exposure.\n\u00a0301-400\t\u00a0Very Poor\t\n\tRespiratory illness on prolonged exposure\n\u00a0401-500\t\u00a0Severe\t\n\tAffects healthy people and seriously impacts those with existing diseases.\nMeasures to improve air quality:\nImproving public transport\nLimiting the number of polluting vehicles on the road\nIntroducing less polluting fuel\nStrict emission regulations\nImproved efficiency for thermal power plants and industries\nMoving from diesel generators to rooftop solar\nIncreased use of clean renewable energy\nElectric vehicles\nRemoving dust from roads\nRegulating construction activities\nStopping biomass burning, etc.\nSystem of Air Quality and Weather Forecasting And Research\nSAFAR is a national program launched by the Ministry of Earth Sciences (MoES) to assess both the city\u2019s overall pollution level and its local air quality to gauge how clean the air is in a major metropolis.\nThe system is\u00a0indigenously developed by the Indian Institute of Tropical Meteorology (IITM),\u00a0Pune, and is\u00a0operationalized by the India Meteorological Department (IMD).\nThe project\u2019s ultimate goal is to raise public awareness of the state of the air in their community so that proper remedial action and organized action can be performed.\nSAFAR is an integral part of India\u2019s first Air Quality Early Warning System\u00a0operational in Delhi.\nIt\u00a0monitors all weather parameters\u00a0like temperature, rainfall, humidity, wind speed, wind direction, UV radiation, and solar radiation.\nPollutants Monitored:5, PM10, Ozone, Carbon Monoxide (CO), Nitrogen Oxides (NOx), Sulfur Dioxide (SO2), Benzene, Toluene, Xylene, and Mercury.\nWay Forward\nWHO\u2019s 4 Pillar Strategy:\u00a0WHO adopted a resolution (2015) to address the adverse health effects of air pollution. There is a need to adhere to a roadmap highlighted under this.\n\nThis 4-pillar strategy calls for an enhanced global response to the adverse health effects of air pollution. Those four pillars are:\n\nExpanding the knowledge base\nMonitoring and reporting\nGlobal leadership and coordination\nInstitutional capacity strengthening\nProactive Measure:\u00a0It is important to encourage interventions like pollution-monitoring apps so that individuals can opt to avoid bad travel times and choose alternate city walking routes that keep them away from the places with the poorest air quality.\n\nThe application of\u00a0the Graded Response Action Plan\u00a0in the Delhi-National Capital Region (NCR) is a step in the right direction.\n\nInnovative Measure:\u00a0There is a need to adopt innovative solutions for the in-situ treatment of pollution.\n\nFor example, the Delhi government is also experimenting with a new organic way of decomposing stubble with Indian Agriculture Research Institute\u2019s \u201cPusa decomposer\u201d.\n\nResponsibility of Citizens:\u00a0Even though there are many suggestions and methods for reducing air pollution, the problem persists. This is a result of a lack of strong political will and public involvement. As a result, people should keep advocating for their right to safe and sustainable surroundings and hold governments responsible.\nAddressing Injustice:\u00a0Since the poorest individuals are also those who are most exposed to air pollution, there are major injustices at the root of the problem. As a result, the Polluter Pay Principle must be followed and industries that produce pollution must pay a fee to protect the environment.\n\nFighting air pollution is a public concern, hence it is within everyone\u2019s purview. As a result, there is a need for focused, coordinated activities that include all relevant parties.\n\nThe government (federal, state, and municipal), cities, the general public, and individuals should all be considered in this.\n\nFurther, there is a need for a policy that envisages a healthy energy transition and healthy urban planning transition.\n\nRead:\u00a0GRAP\n\nArticle Written by: Remya"

Early in the 20th century, coal burning\u2019s impacts were noticed.\n\n\ud83d\udc49 Which year are YOU targeting for success in the IAS/IPS/IFS Exam? \ud83d\ude80\n\n(1) \u21d2 UPSC 2025: Prelims cum

particulate matter in the air exacerbate this type of smog.\n\nWhat is photochemical smog?\n\nPhotochemical smog is a brownish-grey haze caused by the action of solar ultraviolet radiation on the atmosphere polluted with hydrocarbons and oxides of nitrogen.\n\nIt contains anthropogenic\u00a0air pollutants, mainly\u00a0ozone,\u00a0nitric acid, and organic compounds, which are trapped near the ground by\u00a0temperature inversion.\n\nThese pollutants and also some others can affect human health and cause damage to\u00a0plants.\n\nPhotochemical smog often has an unpleasant odor due to some of its gaseous components.\n\nThe term\u00a0smog\u00a0is commonly used to represent a near-ground haze made of a combination of smoke and fog rather than ozone, nitric acid, and organic compounds.\n\nPhotochemical smog appears to be initiated by\u00a0nitrogen oxides\u00a0that are emitted into the air as pollutants mainly from internal combustion engines.\n\nAbsorbing the visible or ultraviolet energy of sunlight, it forms\u00a0nitric oxide (NO) to free atoms of oxygen (O), which then combine with molecular oxygen (O2) to form ozone (O3).\nIn the presence of hydrocarbons (other than methane), certain other organic compounds, and sunlight, various chemical reactions take place to form photochemical smog.\n\nThere must be a significant source (often automobile activity) that emits enough NO, hydrocarbons, and other VOCs (volatile organic compounds) into the air for a city to experience photochemical smog.\n\nAdditionally needed are warmth, plenty of sunlight, and relatively little air movement to prevent the reactants from becoming diluted.\n\nTwo factors that affect how photochemical haze forms:\n\nTopography:\n\nWind disperses pollutants and lowers concentrations with distance from the source by moving air masses both horizontally and vertically.\nThe stability of the air or the quantity of vertical air movement directly affects the amount of dispersion that takes place.\n\nTemperature Inversion:\n\nThermal inversions make the configuration of the air masses unusual as warmer air is confined between two layers of cooler air.\nWhen hills or mountains block horizontal breezes, this can result in pollution being trapped close to the earth\u2019s surface and building up above a metropolis.\nWarm air gathers on top of the dirty air, serving as a cap to prevent the toxins from dispersing.\nEffects of photochemical smog\nThe environment and people are both negatively impacted by photochemical haze in several ways.\nWhen the chemicals inside react with hydrocarbons, the resulting molecules irritate the eyes.\nThe nitrogen cycle is hampered by atmospheric radicals because ground-level ozone cannot be removed.\nOzone at ground level has the potential to be exceedingly hazardous to people.\nReduced eyesight and shortness of breath are two additional side effects of photochemical smog.\nPeroxyacetylnitrate and aldehydes (undesirable components of photochemical smog) can cause eye irritation and plant damage.\n\nHealth effects of pollutants:\n\nMitigation of photochemical smog\n\nPhotochemical smog can be controlled by decreasing the concentrations of hydrocarbons, NOx other VOC emissions.\n\nUsage of catalytic converters can reduce vehicle emissions of nitrogen, carbon dioxide, and hydrocarbons.\nBiofuels have been the focus of attention as a possible means of reducing greenhouse gas emissions and noxious urban emissions from transport.\nHydrogen-powered and electric vehicles are cleaner options for vehicles.\nSimple lifestyle changes like increasing the usage of public transport to conserve fuel and reduce NOx emissions.\nReducing anthropogenic emission of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs).\nGothenburg Protocol 1999 (Multi Effect Protocol)\n\nThe official title of the protocol is UNECE Protocol to Abate Acidification, Eutrophication, and Ground-level Ozone (Gothenburg Protocol) (Protocol to the UNECE Convention on Long-Range Transboundary Air Pollution (LRTAP))\n\nThe Gothenburg Protocol was established to address pollutants that cause acidification and ground-level ozone.\n\nIt sets limits on air pollutants including sulfur dioxide, nitrogen oxide, ammonia, and volatile organic compounds that are hazardous to human health and the environment.\n\nIt was updated in 2012 to include particulate matter (PM) and black carbon (as a component of PM) and to include new commitments for 2020.\n\nThe Protocol establishes\u00a0legally binding emissions reduction commitments\u00a0for 2020 and beyond for the\u00a0major air pollutants:\n\nsulfur dioxide (SO2), nitrogen oxides (NOx), ammonia (NH3), volatile organic compounds (VOCs), and delicate Particulate Matter (PM5).\nthese chemicals also contribute to photochemical smog formation.\n\nThe objective of the Gothenburg Protocol under the United Nations Economic Commission for Europe\u2019s (UNECE) LRTAP Convention is:\n\nto control and reduce emissions of sulfur dioxide (SO2), nitrogen oxides (NOx), ammonia (NH3), volatile organic compounds (VOCs), and PM that are caused by human activities.\nto ensure that atmospheric depositions or concentrations do not exceed critical loads/levels;\nthat Parties give priority, to implementing measures to reduce PM, to sources that are also significant sources of black carbon to provide benefits for human health and the environment and to help mitigation of near-term climate change.\n\nThis multi-pollutant, multi-effect protocol is meant to

Utilizing an accelerated process, the Miyawaki method of plantation creates a miniature forest environment. When growing forests on tiny landholdings, the Miyawaki approach and related techniques are incredibly effective.\n\nWho founded this method?\n\nMiyawaki Technique is based on the practices of Japanese forester Akira Miyawaki, a Japanese botanist, and an expert in the study of Natural Forest and the Restoration of Natural Vegetation.\n\nHe had expertise in plant ecology and developed the technique of plantation back in the 1980s in which a variety of plants are sowed within a small distance i.e 3-4 plants/sq. meter.\n\nIt created a denser forest with a mixed variety of plants in a small area and within a short time.\n\nSteps involved in creating a Miyawaki Forest\nStep 1: Procure saplings of native tree and shrub varieties.\n\nSaplings of native tree varieties are collected. Saplings preferably grown in pots or grow bag which has nutrient-rich soil is selected to be transplanted onto the demarcated forest patch.\n\nStep 2: Preparation of soil.\n\nDigs of one-meter depth are dug and fillers like compost, cocopeat, groundnut shells, beneficial micro-organisms and shredded leaf litter are added to enhance the soil.\n\nStep 3: Planting of a sapling.\n\nOnce the soil is treated, the saplings are placed into the digs.\n\nStep 4: The trees planted need to be watered regularly.\n\nThe trees need to be watered every day (or as frequently to ensure that the soil surface does not dry out). The frequency of watering is reduced in the coming years.\n\nStep 5: Insert support for the saplings.\n\nWooden sticks are inserted as support and the saplings are tied to the stick. It helps saplings to grow straight and protects them from bad weather conditions.\n\nStep 6: The soil is covered with mulch.\n\nThe soil is covered with organic matter, and growers typically spread out hay or leaf litter to create a blanket layer to protect the soil from direct sunlight, slow the rate at which soil moisture is lost, and promote the growth of beneficial biodiversity. Leaf litter also slowly decomposes, which improves the health of the soil.\n\nStep 7: Continuous assessment of the growth of the Miyawaki Forest\n\nVisits to the forest patch frequently to check the saplings\u2019 health, identify and get rid of weeds, spot any infections and cure them. This action exponentially raises the likelihood that all saplings will survive and the forest will swiftly take root.\n\nAs a land restoration tool: Miyawaki Method\n\nNatural forests function in a different cycle. Forests are made up of more than just trees. It is home to a variety of plants, fungi, wildlife, and microorganisms. This flora and fauna community plays an important role in sustaining the forest and allowing it to thrive. Birds disperse seeds into the forest, animal dung nourishes the land, leaf litter from fallen trees is broken down by decomposers to create healthy soil, and plant roots hold the soil in place.\n\nHowever, the process by which forests grow, generate multiple canopy layers, and become self-sustaining takes time. The Miyawaki method accelerates forest development by constructing soil, utilising native plant diversity, growing healthy saplings, and planting them close together.\n\nThe Miyawaki method gives a stepwise procedure for restoring native forests. The care given during the initial years of planting ensures that the majority of the saplings planted survive and the forest ecosystem is established in a fraction of the time taken for forests to develop naturally.\n\nImportance of Miyawaki Forest\n\nUndisturbed land which has no human influence will naturally help to grow plant communities. This natural potential is greatly harmed by human activities that damage soil structure, nutrients and beneficial biodiversity.\n\nTo address today\u2019s environmental issues, this technique for quickly growing dense forest plants would be quite helpful. To preserve life on the plant and repair harm caused by humans, it is seen as essential to preserve biodiversity and native plants, decrease extinction rates by building habitats, enhance environmental quality overall by expanding forest cover, and use trees as a buffer against natural calamities.\n\nThe Miyawaki Method is one of the most effective tree planting methods for creating forest cover quickly on degraded land that has been used for other purposes such as agriculture or construction. It is effective because it is based on natural reforestation principles, i.e., using trees native to the area and replicating natural forest regeneration processes.\n\nThe Miyawaki technique is a potential candidate for attaining objectives to improve world habitability and safeguard ecologically vulnerable areas. A \u201cnew option\u201d of coexistence, in which urban areas and forest environments coexist, may be made possible by small, dense forests. These small clusters of forest gradually turn into a massive area. It is also a useful tool in Urban Forestry projects and the development of recreational parks. This area can also be converted as a sanctuary for non-humans in cities and towns.\n\nThe technique can help restore groves that have been destroyed by deforestation since groves are important for maintaining local biodiversity and controlling environmental health. They can also reduce soil erosion and can also control the force of water and wind.\n\nIn Miyawaki forest the seedlings are planted at very high densities. This replicates the regeneration process that occurs in a natural forest. The saplings grow very fast to compete for the light and then natural selection will favour the fastest growing individuals resulting in a densely packed pioneer forest that grows in 20 to 30 years instead of taking 150 to 200 years benefiting from projects that are working to maximise a forest\u2019s carbon sequestration potential or recreate habitat for biodiversity and wildlife.\n\nAdvantages of Miyawaki Technique\nIt is a\u00a0 method of afforestation that helps in creating a denser forest than usual in less time.\n\u00a0Miyawaki forests also act as a habitat for lots of species living in that region.\nThe Miyawaki forests help in controlling air, water, noise, and soil pollution.\nThe Miyawaki method prevents the flowing away of the top layer of soil in heavy rain as the trees are planted close to each other and a group of trees tightly holds the soil.\nThese trees protect each other from direct sunlight and reduce the chances of forest fires to a great extent.\nDisadvantages of Miyawaki Technique\nMostly timber trees are preferred and the natural distribution of tree types is reduced.\nThis method of afforestation is only suitable in the sub-urban or the urban region with smaller spaces but not suitable in the tropical regions.\nThe movement of wildlife species is restricted due to less availability of space between the trees the natural movement of the ecosystem is restricted.\nThe amount of rain brought by the trees of the Miyawaki forest is still a question mark.\nMiyawaki Technique in India\nThe Miyawaki technique is widely acknowledged and used in India, primarily in Telangana. The state government of Telangana has adopted the Miyawaki plantation method in that state under the \u201cTelangana Ku Haritha Haram\u201d (TKHH).\nIn addition, many people, social workers, and NGOs are working on the Miyawaki Method in India and converting their backyards into small forests.\nUnder a 100-day plan put up by the West Bengal government, dense forests using the Miyawaki method would be planted in a few districts of Howrah.\nThe first urban forest in India, called \u201cAnand Van\u2019, was officially opened on October 17th, 2020 by Mr Prakash Javdekar, the environment minister, for establishing a habitat for the more than 59 indigenous species that were there. The Minister mentioned in his speech that the Miyawaki Method of plantation can help in making denser urban forests in less time.\nCost v/s benefits of Miyawaki\u00a0 forest in India\n\nThe stress is now to create forests that grow quickly, contain dense vegetation, and require little to no time for management.\n\nMiyawaki forests often require less initial cost of funds, which may include installing a watering system, labour costs for planting and the first few years of development, the price of saplings, and the price of soil additives. The establishment of several prosperous Miyawaki farms in Kerala cost between ten and twenty lakh.\n\nIn the long run after the initial period of growth, investment requirements are little to none. Additionally, the growers can increase the economic value of their forests by incorporating high-value native timber trees and creating \u201cMiyawaki Fruit Forests\u201d, by providing forest tours, nature walks and educational sessions.\n\nThese forests benefit growers in various ways, including controlling the soil\u2019s overall health, preventing soil erosion, raising the water table, and facilitating access to water. Increasing green cover and creating a microhabitat for neighbourhood biodiversity enables the producer to favourably impact broader climate change-related issues.\n\nIn this Miyawaki technique trees are planted, and they develop much more quickly, accelerating the process of creating forests and absorbing more carbon. The best part of the technique is that after three years saplings become maintenance-free or self-sustainable Miyawaki woods have been shown to have higher biodiversity than nearby woodlands, making them an excellent choice for rapidly establishing diversified forest ecosystems. Being capable of rapidly establishing diverse, healthy forests could be crucial in fulfilling international targets and addressing these concerns in light of the current climate change emergency and alarming warnings about worldwide biodiversity loss.\n\nRelated topic:\u00a0Environment Presentation #2: Species Conservation in Different Biosphere Reserves of India \u2013 Clear IAS\n\nPrevious year\u2019s questions from the topic (UPSC CSE 2022)\n\nThe \u201cMiyawaki method\u201d is well known for the:\n\n[A] Promotion of commercial farming in arid and semi-arid areas\n[B] Development of gardens using genetically modified flora\n[C] Creation of mini forests in urban areas\n[D] Harvesting wind energy on coastal areas and on sea surfaces\n\nAnswer: [C] Creation of mini forests in urban areas\n\nArticle Written By: Atheena Fathima Riyas"

The\u00a0ozone layer\u00a0acts as a shield for life on Earth.\n\nUV light can\u00a0penetrate\u00a0organisms\u2019 protective layers, like\u00a0skin, damaging\u00a0DNA\u00a0molecules\u00a0in plants and animals.\n\nThere are two major types of UV light:\u00a0UVB\u00a0and UVA.\n\nUVB\u00a0is the cause of\u00a0skin\u00a0conditions like sunburns, and\u00a0cancers\u00a0like basal cell carcinoma and squamous cell carcinoma.\nUVA light is even more harmful than UVB, penetrating more deeply and causing deadly skin cancer, melanoma, and premature aging.\n\nThe ozone layer, our Earth\u2019s sunscreen, absorbs about 98 per cent of this devastating UV light.\n\nOzone layer depletion\n\nOzone layer depletion is the gradual thinning of the earth\u2019s ozone layer present in the upper atmosphere.\n\nThe thickness of the ozone layer varies immensely on any day and location.\n\nOzone depletion also consists of a much larger springtime decrease in stratospheric ozone around Earth\u2019s Polar Regions, which is referred to as the\u00a0ozone hole.\n\nThe main cause of ozone depletion and the ozone hole is manufactured chemicals, especially manufactured halocarbon refrigerants, solvents, propellants, and foam-blowing agents (chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs), HCFCs, halons).\n\nODS have been proven to be eco-friendly, very stable, and non-toxic in the atmosphere below.\nThis is why they have gained popularity over the years.\nHowever, their stability comes at a price; they can float and remain static high up in the stratosphere.\n\nSince the early 1970s, scientists observed a reduction in stratospheric ozone and it was found more prominent in Polar Regions. Ozone Depleting Substances (ODS) have a lifetime of about 100 years.\n\nThere are two regions in which the ozone layer has depleted:\n\nIn the mid-latitudes, for example, over Australia, the ozone layer is thinned. This has led to an increase in UV radiation reaching the earth. It is estimated that about 5-9% thickness of the ozone layer has decreased, increasing the risk of human over-exposure to UV radiation owing to the outdoor lifestyle.\nIn atmospheric regions over Antarctica, the ozone layer is significantly thinner, especially in the spring season. This has led to the formation of what is called the \u2018ozone hole\u2019.\n\nOzone holes refer to the regions of severely reduced ozone layers. Usually, ozone holes form over the Poles during the onset of the spring seasons.\n\nOne of the largest such holes appears annually over Antarctica between September and November.\n\nThere are a few natural causes of ozone depletion such as sunspots and stratospheric winds. But this has been found to cause not more than 1-2% depletion of the ozone layer and the effects are also thought to be only temporary. Major volcanic activity can also contribute to ozone depletion.\n\nAlso read: Kyoto Protocol, 1997\n\nEffect of ozone depletion\nOn humans\n\nOzone layer depletion increases the amount of UVB that reaches the Earth\u2019s surface. Laboratory and epidemiological studies demonstrate that UVB causes:\n\nnon-melanoma skin cancer\nPlays a major role in malignant melanoma development.\nUVB has been linked to the development of cataracts, a clouding of the eye\u2019s lens.\nOn Plants\n\nUVB radiation affects the physiological and developmental processes of plants. Despite mechanisms to reduce or repair these effects and an ability to adapt to increased levels of UVB, plant growth can be directly affected by UVB radiation.\n\nIndirect changes caused by UVB:\n\nchanges in plant form\nhow nutrients are distributed within the plant\ntiming of developmental phases and secondary\nsmaller leaf size\nflowering and photosynthesis in plants,\nlower quality crops for humans.\nthe decline in plant productivity would in turn affect soil erosion and the carbon cycle.\n\nThese changes can have important implications for plant competitive balance, herbivory, plant diseases, and biogeochemical cycles.\n\nOn biogeochemical cycles\n\nIncreases in UVB radiation could affect terrestrial and aquatic biogeochemical cycles:\n\nIt can alter both sources and sinks of greenhouse and chemically important trace gases (e.g., carbon dioxide, carbon monoxide, carbonyl sulfide, ozone, and possibly other gases).\nThese potential changes would contribute to biosphere-atmosphere feedbacks that mitigate or amplify the atmospheric concentrations of these gases.\nOn marine ecosystems\n\nPhytoplanktons form the foundation of aquatic food webs. Phytoplankton productivity is limited to the euphotic zone, the upper layer of the water column in which there is sufficient sunlight to support net productivity.\n\nExposure to solar UVB radiation has been shown to affect both orientation and motility in phytoplankton, resulting in reduced survival rates for these organisms.\nScientists have demonstrated a direct reduction in phytoplankton production due to ozone depletion-related increases in UVB.\nUVB radiation has been found to cause damage to the early developmental stages of fish, shrimp, crabs, amphibians, and other marine animals.\nThe most severe effects are decreased reproductive capacity and impaired larval development.\nSmall increases in UVB exposure could result in population reductions for small marine organisms with implications for the whole marine food chain.\nOther effects\nSynthetic polymers, naturally occurring biopolymers, as well as some other materials of commercial interest are adversely affected by UVB radiation.\nToday\u2019s materials are somewhat protected from UVB by special additives.\nYet, increases in UVB levels will accelerate their breakdown, limiting the length of time for which they are useful outdoors.\nGlobal efforts to tackle ozone depletion\n\nThe global recognition of the destructive potential of CFCs led to the 1987\u00a0Montreal Protocol, a treaty phasing out the production of ozone-depleting chemicals. Scientists estimate that about 80 percent of the chlorine (and bromine, which has a similar ozone-depleting effect) in the stratosphere over Antarctica today comes from human, not natural, sources.\n\nIn 2016, the Kigali amendment to the Montreal Protocol was agreed upon to reduce the manufacture and use of Hydrofluorocarbons (HFCs)\u00a0by roughly 80-85%\u00a0from their respective baselines, till 2045.\n\nHydrochlorofluorocarbons are\u00a0powerful greenhouse gases, but they are not able to deplete ozone.\nThis phase down is expected to arrest the global average temperature rise to 0.5o\u00a0C by 2100.\nWay forward\n\nEveryone should also take steps to prevent the depletion of the ozone layer.\n\nOne should avoid using pesticides and shift to natural methods to get rid of pests instead of chemicals.\nThe vehicles emit a large number of greenhouse gases that lead to global warming as well as ozone depletion. Therefore, the use of vehicles should be minimized as much as possible.\nMost cleaning products have chemicals that affect the ozone layer. We should substitute that with eco-friendly products.\nMaintain air conditioners, as their malfunctions cause CFC to escape into the atmosphere."

Monitor whether the predicted impacts and proposed mitigation measures occur as defined in the EMP. Verify the compliance of the proponent with the EMP, to ensure that unpredicted impacts or failed mitigation measures are identified and addressed in a timely fashion.\nThe genesis of Environmental Impact Assessment\n\nEIA originated in the early 1970s, with the implementation of the National Environment Policy Act (NEPA) 1969 in the US.\n\nA large part of the initial development occurred in a few high-income countries, like Canada, Australia, and New Zealand (1973-74). However, there were some developing countries as well, which introduced EIA relatively early \u2013 Columbia (1974), and the Philippines (1978).\n\nIn 1989, the World Bank adopted EIA for significant development projects, in which a borrower country had to undertake an EIA under the Bank\u2019s supervision.\n\nStrategic environment assessment\n\nStrategic Environment Assessment (SEA) refers to the systematic analysis of the environmental effects of development policies, plans, programs, and other proposed strategic actions.\n\nIt takes place at earlier stages of the decision-making cycle and considers a broad range of potential alternatives.\n\nSEA represents a proactive approach to integrating environmental considerations into the higher levels of decision-making.\n\nHistory of Environmental Impact Assessment in India\n\nThe EIA was first used during 1976-77 in India when the Planning Commission asked the Department of Science and Technology to examine the river-valley projects from an environmental angle.\n\nThis was subsequently extended to cover those projects, which required the approval of the Public Investment Board.\nTill 1994, environmental clearance from the Central Government was an administrative decision and lacked legislative support.\n\nOn 27 January 1994, the Union Ministry of Environment and Forests (MoEF), under the Environmental (Protection) Act 1986, promulgated an EIA notification making Environmental Clearance (EC) mandatory for expansion or modernization of any activity or for setting up new projects listed in Schedule 1 of the notification.\n\nIn 2006, The MoEF notified new EIA legislation making it mandatory for various projects such as mining, thermal power plants, river valley, infrastructure (road, highway, ports, harbours, and airports), and industries including very small electroplating or foundry units to get environment clearance.\n\nHowever, unlike the EIA Notification of 1994, the 2006 legislation had put the onus of clearing projects on the state government depending on the size/capacity of the project.\n\nCertain activities permissible under the Coastal Regulation Zone Act, 1991 also require similar clearance. Additionally, donor agencies operating in India like the World Bank and the\u00a0ADB have a different set of requirements for giving environmental clearance to projects that are funded by them.\n\nIn 2020, a draft notification on EIA 2020 was issued to consolidate all the 55 amendments and 230 office memorandums issued since 2006.\n\nEIA Process in India\n\nThe Environmental Protection Rules, 1986 impose certain restrictions on the construction/ expansion/ modernization of specific projects without prior approval from the Central, State, or Union Territory level Environmental Impact Assessment Authority (EIAA) constituted under the Environment Protection Act, 1986.\n\nThe rules categorize the projects into two categories- A and B based on the magnitude of their scale and impact on the natural and artificial resources.\n\nThe projects belonging to Category A require approval from the Ministry of Environment and Forests on behalf of the Central Government, on the advice of an Expert Appraisal Committee (EAC), constituted by the Central Government for this specific purpose. For example- Construction or Expansion of Ports, harbours, airports, nuclear power, related projects, Primary metallurgical industries (iron, steel, copper, etc), individual projects, etc.\nProjects and Activities falling under Category B require the approval of a State EIAA, based on the advice of a State Expert Appraisal Committee (SEAC), constituted under the said notification.\nAdvantages of EIA:\nReduces cost and time of project implementation and design.\nEncourages environmentally sound projects which are compliant with environmental legislation in place.\nProtection of environment along with balanced usage of resources.\nDecision-makers are informed of the pros and cons of the projects in detail.\nEIA reports are a critical component of India\u2019s environmental decision-making process\nIt helps in predicting environmental impacts at an early stage in project planning and design.\nThe EIA reports are also important to define measures that the project could take to contain or offset project impacts.\nEIA-based approvals for most projects also involve the process of conducting public hearings, so that who are likely to be affected can be taken on board before approving the project.\nDisadvantages:\nIt is a time-consuming process that may be depicted as withholding the pace of developmental activities.\nThere is little public participation in actual implementation.\nSometimes too focused on the scientific analysis and the real-time impact is neglected.\nCompliance monitoring after EIA is not carried out regularly.\nImpact assessment processes are in place and applied in many countries, yet biodiversity is often inadequately addressed.\nThere is a need to better address biodiversity considerations in environmental impact assessments and strategic environmental assessments.\nConclusion\n\nThe EIA notification of 2006 was not good enough for ensuring the protection of the environment, while the 2020 draft is more in the favour of ease of doing business.\n\nThis has bettered India\u2019s ranking in World Bank\u2019s Ease of doing business report but India\u2019s ranking has steadily declined in the Environmental Performance Index.\n\nThe government has to find ways to strike a balance between environmental and developmental progress. And the EIA should incorporate perspectives of multiple stakeholders in a balanced manner keeping environment as a priority."

LDPE is noted for its low-temperature flexibility, toughness, and corrosion resistance.\nPolyethylene terephthalate or PET belongs to the family of polyesters. It is widely used in everyday items and is easily recyclable.\nPolystyrene (PS) is a versatile plastic used to make a wide variety of consumer products. As a hard, solid plastic, it is often used in products that require clarity, such as food packaging and laboratory ware.\nPolypropylene (PP) is a thermoplastic \u201caddition polymer\u201d made from a combination of propylene monomers. It is used in a variety of applications including packaging for consumer products, and plastic parts for various industries including the automotive industry.\nExpanded PolyStyrene (EPS) is a white foam plastic material produced from solid beads of polystyrene. It is primarily used for packaging, insulation, etc. It is a closed-cell, rigid foam material produced from Styrene \u2013 which forms the cellular structure.\nHow is single-use plastic harmful to the environment?\n\nAs per the World Wildlife Fund (WWF), plastic is harmful to the environment as it is non-biodegradable and takes years to disintegrate. But single-use plastics are worse \u2014 never breaking down completely, they degrade and become microplastics and continue to pollute the environment.\n\nIt can take thousands of years for plastic bags to decompose, thus contaminating our soil and water in the process. The noxious chemicals used to produce plastic gets transmitted to animal tissue, and finally, enter the human food chain, the WWF says.\n\nBirds usually confuse shreds of plastic bags for food and end up eating the toxic debris.\n\nFish consume thousands of tons of plastic in a year, ultimately transferring it up the food chain to marine mammals.\n\nCan SUPs be recycled?\n\nYes, but only nine percent of all the plastic the world has ever made has been recycled, and recycling rates are stagnant.\n\nHumans use about 1.2 million plastic bottles per minute in total. Roughly half of our global annual plastic production is used for a single-use products.\n\nAround 380 million metric tons of plastic are being produced yearly with 8.3. billion metric tons produced since plastic was introduced in the 1950s.\nIt is estimated that by 2040, this will have almost tripled to 23-37 million tons per year.\nPlastics are the largest, most harmful, and most persistent of marine litter, accounting for at least 85 percent of all marine waste.\nIndia\u2019s ban on Single-use Plastics\n\nIndia alone generates 9.46 million tonnes of plastic waste every year, around 43 percent of which comprises single-use plastic. It is a huge problem for India since 40 percent of plastic waste remains uncollected.\n\nThe ban will be monitored by the CPCB from the Centre and by the State Pollution Control Boards (SPCBs) that will report to the Centre regularly.\n\nDirections have been issued at national, state, and local levels and to all petrochemical industries to not supply raw materials to industries engaged in the banned items.\n\nDirections have also been issued to\u00a0SPCBs and Pollution Control Committees\u00a0to modify or\u00a0revoke consent to operate issued under the Air and Water Act\u00a0to industries engaged in single-use plastic items.\n\nLocal authorities have been directed to issue fresh commercial licenses with the condition that SUP items will not be sold on their premises, and existing commercial licenses will be canceled if they are found to be selling these items.\n\nThose found violating the ban can be penalized under the Environment Protection Act 1986 which allows for imprisonment up to 5 years, a penalty up to Rs 1 lakh, or both.\n\nThe plastic waste management rules 2016 have not been implemented stringently in many places, hence stricter regulations like the ban are being implemented.\n\nGlobal efforts to tackle the single-use plastics menace\n\nThe United States, which ranks as the world\u2019s leading contributor to plastic waste will phase out single-use plastics in national parks and other public lands over the next decade.\n\nThe Canadian government is banning companies from importing or making plastic bags and Styrofoam takeout containers by the end of this year, their sale by the end of next year, and their export by the end of 2025.\n\nKenya, Chile, the United Kingdom, and the European Union have all put in place various bans on single-use plastic goods.\n\nRestrictions on single-use plastic bags took effect in the United Arab Emirates capital Abu Dhabi recently, as part of its efforts for a \u201cgreener future\u201d.\n\nWay forward\n\nThe stringent ban has left the manufacturers in concern; hence it is important to devise feasible alternatives for single-use plastics targeting both consumers and retailers.\n\nThe alternatives should be thoroughly analyzed for their carbon footprint, for example, cotton bags sourced from virgin cotton, kulhad cups baked in kilns have a higher environmental footprint than plastics. In the present context, jute and upcycled cloth bags, bamboo and wooden cutlery, leaf-based plates, glass and metal containers, etc. are some of the immediate alternatives available.\n\nThe industry should be given time for transition along with tax rebates for alternative industrial practices.\n\nAlso, the plastic waste management plan can be integrated with municipal waste systems to strengthen the value chain and existing garbage handling system, substantially.\n\nRelated posts\nPlastic Pollution\nPlastic Waste Management: Rules and Regulations\nBiotransformation Technology\nEnvironmental Pollution and Degradation"

It did not include indicators like agro biodiversity, soil health, food loss, and waste even though they are important for developing countries with large agrarian populations.\nThe weight of the indicators in which India performed well has been reduced and the reasons for such change have not been explained in the report.\nConclusion\n\nThe Environmental Performance Index rankings indicate that:\n\nGood policy results are associated with wealth (GDP\u00a0per capita), meaning that economic prosperity makes it possible for nations to invest in policies and programs that lead to desirable outcomes.\nThe pursuit of economic prosperity \u2013 manifested in industrialization and urbanization \u2013 often means more pollution and other strains on ecosystem vitality, especially in the developing world, where air and water emissions remain significant.\nHigh scorers exhibit long-standing policies and programs to protect public health, preserve natural resources, and decrease greenhouse gas emissions.\n\nFour new air quality indicators that track exposure to sulfur dioxide, nitrogen oxides, carbon monoxide, and volatile organics have been identified.\n\nNew metrics that gauge recycling and ocean plastic pollution have been added to the Waste Management issue category, tracking countries\u2019 efforts to attain closed-loop economies.\n\nIn recognition of the critical role of agriculture in promoting healthy societies, the 2022 EPI also includes a pilot indicator on sustainable pesticide use.\n\nThe EPI has been facing criticisms over the years for its arbitrary choice of metrics which could introduce bias and its poor performance as an indicator of environmental sustainability.\n\nThe EPI\u2019s lack of specific policy suggestions and the index\u2019s weighting biases against data deficient countries that have led to the overlooking of ecological progress in developing countries has also been pointed out.\n\nIndia, even if not satisfied with the report should look into the areas where the actions are still lacking to achieve the environmental target set for the future."

For better understanding, the principles are grouped on their applicability and enforceability. They are as follows:\n\nHuman-centric:\n\nPrinciple 1: Rights and Responsibilities for protecting the environment \u2013\u00a0Humans have the right to use and enjoy nature. The right to enjoy nature is not unfettered, it is coextensive with the duty to protect it. Art. 21 of the constitution also safeguards the fundamental right of a healthy environment. This principle also explicitly bars discriminatory laws.\n\nPrinciple 15: Human settlement and Urbanization \u2013\u00a0Planned settlements and urbanization are required. They reduce the adverse effects on the environment. The goal is to secure maximum benefits for all through planning. All discriminatory plans are also barred.\n\nSustainable development:\n\nPrinciple 2: Duty to protect natural resources \u2013\u00a0Natural resources are limited. We must use natural resources carefully. Preservation of resources depends on effective planning and management.\n\nPrinciple 3: Duty to preserve renewable resources \u2013\u00a0Although renewable resources are not depletable, their preservation is necessary for their quality.\n\nPrinciple 4: Wildlife Conservation \u2013\u00a0A combination of factors is responsible for endangering wildlife. Humans have a special responsibility for protecting wildlife. The inclusion of conservation of wildlife in economic planning leads to sustainable development.\n\nPrinciple 5: Duty to preserve non-renewable resources \u2013\u00a0Non-renewable resources are exhaustible. They are valuable resources. Exercising care and caution is necessary to prevent them from depletion\n\nPrinciple 13: Rational Management of Resources \u2013\u00a0States should adopt rational methods to manage the resources and to improve the environment. An integrated and coordinated approach is preferable.\n\nPrinciple 14: Rational Planning \u2013\u00a0Conflicts between development and conservation are reconciled with rational planning. Development and conservation must go hand in hand.\n\nReflection on customary international law position (Principle 21)\n\nStates have the absolute authority to use natural resources according to their policies. However, their policies shouldn\u2019t violate the principles of international law and cause damage to other states outside its jurisdiction.\n\nPreventive actions:\n\nPrinciple 6: Management of pollution \u2013\u00a0Pollution is harmful to the environment. Discharging toxins and other substances in large quantities are harmful to the ecosystem. Both the citizens and the states should play an active role in reducing the dumping of harmful substances.\n\nPrinciple 7: Management of sea pollution\u00a0\u2013 The states should reduce sea pollution by taking necessary steps to prevent substances hazardous to human health, marine life, and the legitimate uses of seas.\n\nPrinciple 8: Social and Economic development \u2013\u00a0The improvement of social and economic conditions is necessary for a better living and working environment. Improvements shouldn\u2019t affect the environment in any way.\n\nPrinciple 18: Application of science \u2013\u00a0Science and technology are indispensable in today\u2019s life. They are used in almost every industry. Science and technology are also applicable to the conservation of the environment. It is useful for identifying and controlling environmental risks. They are useful for finding solutions for environmental issues.\n\nCOMPENSATION TO VICTIMS (PRINCIPLE 22)\n\nThe States should join to further the scope of international law for prescribing liability for those harming the environment. States should also come together to compensate victims of environmental pollution or damage.\n\nCooperation\n\nPrinciple 24: Cooperation with nations \u2013\u00a0Although each state has exclusive jurisdiction to legislate on internal matters, international cooperation is necessary for the holistic improvement of the environment. States must recognize that environmental problems affect all the states equally. By multilateral and bilateral agreements states can control, prevent, and reduce environmental risks.\n\nPrinciple 25: Coordination with nations \u2013\u00a0Coordination between states is crucial for alleviating the existing conditions. The states can jointly coordinate actions and plans for improving existing environmental conditions.\n\nOther principles\n\nPrinciple 11: Environmental Policy \u2013\u00a0The environmental policy of every nation should be progressive. The policies of every state must enhance and complement each other. The policies shouldn\u2019t restrict or adversely affect developing countries. National and international organizations should strive for better living conditions for all without affecting the environment.\n\nPrinciple 19: Education in environmental matters \u2013\u00a0Education is one of the tools to spread awareness about the pathetic state of the environment. The underprivileged, poor, illiterate should have access to education. Education broadens the mind. Awareness about the existing conditions is necessary so that people can jointly tackle environmental matters.\n\nPrinciple 20: Expanding scientific research \u2013\u00a0Researching and developing methods nationally and internationally is important to tackle environmental problems. There must exist a system where information and research can flow easily across nations. Countries must also control their spending on scientific research without burdening the economy.\n\nPrinciple 9: Environmental Deficiencies \u2013\u00a0Natural disasters and underdevelopment lead to deficiencies. Navigating through such deficiencies is difficult. Requesting technological and financial assistance to supplement the local efforts leads to a quicker and effective remedy.\n\nPrinciple 10: Stability of prices and incomes \u2013\u00a0Stability in the prices of essential commodities and stability of income is essential for the environmental management of developing countries. Economic factors are also part of the environmental process.\n\nPrinciple 12: Education on environmental protection \u2013\u00a0Environmental protection is the need of the hour. Every citizen should understand the importance of environmental protection. Adoption of a suitable medium like social media, print media, etc is crucial to spread awareness about environmental protection.\n\nPrinciple 16: Population Control \u2013\u00a0In areas where the population is excessive and is likely to affect the environment, the states can implement policies to control the growth of the population. These policies shouldn\u2019t violate basic human rights. In today\u2019s world overpopulation is one of the major reasons for the depletion of natural resources.\n\nPrinciple 17: Setting up of national institutions \u2013\u00a0States should establish national bodies for the control and management of environmental resources within the state.\n\nPrinciple 23: Implementing a national agenda \u2013\u00a0The states may find that certain procedures and rules may not align the value system of the country. In that case, the states need not follow such a procedure. The states are also exempted if such procedures cause unwarranted social costs.\n\nPrinciple 26: Ban on nuclear weapons \u2013\u00a0Nuclear weapons are the most destructive weapons. They cause more damage to the environment than any other weapon. All the nations should come together to ban nuclear weapons.\n\n50 years of Stockholm declaration: UN Conference on the Human Environment\n\n1972: The United Nations Conference on the Human Environment is convened.\n\n1973: UNEP opens headquarters at Nairobi, Kenya marking the first time an international organization was based in the Global South.\n\n1973: States adopt the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species (CITES) of Wild Fauna and Flora.\n\n1973: On 5 June, the world celebrates the first World Environment Day under the theme of \u201cOnly One Earth.\u201d\n\n1974: Regional seas program was established to bring together neighboring countries to reduce ocean pollution and protect marine life.\n\n1979: States adopt Convention on Migratory Species (CMS) also known as the Bonn Convention.\n\n1979: States sign Convention on Long-range Transboundary Air Pollution\n\n1982: UNEP launches the Montevideo Programme for global environmental law-making and lead to major agreements, including the Basel, Stockholm, and Rotterdam conventions, and the Montreal Protocol.\n\n1987: World adopts the Montreal Protocol on Substances that Deplete the Ozone Layer\n\n1988: Launch of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC)\n\n1989: States adopt Basel Convention\n\n1991: Global Environmental Facility (GEF) is launched\n\n1992: The\u00a0UN Conference on Environment and Development, also known as the Earth Summit, takes place in Rio de Janeiro on the 20th anniversary of the 1972 Stockholm conference.\n\n1992: Convention of Biological Diversity (CBD) is signed.\n\n1997: UNEP releases first Global Environment Outlook\n\n1998: States adopt Rotterdam Convention\n\n2001: States adopt the Stockholm Convention on Persistent Organic Pollutants and Carpathian Convention (to protect the Carpathian Mountains, a region home to some of Europe\u2019s oldest forests and more than half of the continent\u2019s bears and wolves).\n\n2007: IPCC wins the Nobel Peace Prize.\n\n2008: UN-REDD is launched\n\n2012: States establish the Intergovernmental Platform on Biodiversity and Ecosystem Services\n\n2015: World leaders sign the Paris Agreement during the UN Climate change Conference or COP21.\n\n2015: States adopt the 2030 Agenda and the Sustainable Development Goals.\n\n2017: At the third session of the UN Environment Assembly in Nairobi, the world committed to a pollution-free planet to improve the lives of billions across the globe by cleaning our land, air, and water.\n\n2021: UN decade on Ecosystem Restoration is launched.\n\n2021: The UN Decade of Ocean Science for Sustainable Development begins\n\n2021: Production of leaded fuel ends\n\n2022: At the fifth session of the UN Environment Assembly in Nairobi, a\u00a0historic resolution\u00a0is endorsed to\u00a0end plastic pollution\u00a0and forge an international legally binding agreement by 2024.\n\nChallenges to Stockholm Declaration\n\nThe wordings of the stockholm declaration are unclear and ambiguous at certain points. Almost 48 years since adopting the declaration the condition of the environment has worsened.\n\nThe presence of Carbon Dioxide has increased by 26 percent since 1970. This results in greater global warming which has detrimental effects all around the globe. More than\u00a0700,000 sq.km\u00a0of the Amazon rainforest were cleared for farming since the \u201970s. The condition of other forested areas is not much better.\n\nIt has failed to include newer forms of pollution. It has not received the same kind of response from all the nations. The plan identifies underdeveloped nations as the key contributor to pollution, 48 years later they continue to pollute the environment without any significant change.\n\nTaking action is the only way to tackle environmental depletion. The laws should adopt more stringent actions. No amount of conventions will help in environmental development unless people start taking action. We should realize the current situation and act cautiously.\n\nWay forward\n\nThe world needs to work in tandem to reverse the harm caused to the environment over years of anthropogenic activities.\n\nDespite its problems, the convention has created better awareness about the environment and the need to protect it. People are now better equipped to tackle problems like global warming and climate change.\n\nThis UN conference laid the foundation for several other initiatives by the UN and other organizations around the world for the protection and preservation of the environment.\n\nThe progress after Stockholm Declaration will be critically adssesses as Stockholm+50 will be collaborative and multi-stakeholder in nature, open to all participants who will be invited to share experiences and initiatives to protect the planet and contribute to sustainable and inclusive development, including a sustainable recovery from the COVID -19 pandemic.\n\nStockholm+50 can work towards setting specific deadlines for realizing the goals driven towards a sustainable environment."

Coal is a major source of energy in the production of electrical power using steam generation.\n\nIn addition, gasification and liquefaction of coal produce gaseous and liquid fuels that can be transported by pipeline and stored in tanks.\n\n\ud83d\udc49 Which year are YOU targeting for success in the IAS/IPS/IFS Exam? \ud83d\ude80\n\n(1) \u21d2 UPSC 2025: Prelims cum Mains\n\n(2) \u21d2 UPSC 2026: Prelims cum Mains\n\n(3) \u21d2 UPSC 2027 Prelims cum Mains\n\nTip: Know more about ClearIAS Courses (Online/Offline)\n\nCoal mining in India\n\nIndia is rich in ancient coal fields like Gondwana coalfields (250 million years old) and tertiary coalfields (15-60\u00a0 million years old).\n\nCoal mining was started during the rule of the East India Company in 1774 in the Raniganj coalfield along the western bank of the Damodar river.\n\nTo increase coal production, the focus of the Government is on accelerating domestic production of coal through the allocation of more coal blocks, pursuing with the State Government for assistance in land acquisition, and coordinated efforts with Railways for the movement of coal.\n\nIn addition, the following actions have been taken by Government to further enhance the production of coal in the country.\n\nCommercial Auction of coal on revenue share mechanism:\u00a0Since the launch of the auction of coal mines for commercial mining in June 2020, a total of 4 rounds of auctions have been conducted in which a total of 292 coal mines were offered.\n\nAllowed sale of excess coal production: The Ministry of Coal has amended Mineral Concession Rules, 1960 to allow the sale of coal or lignite, on payment of an additional amount to the State Government.\n\nThe Mines and Minerals (Development & Regulation) Act had been amended and is applicable for both the private and public sector captive mines.\nWith this amendment, the Government has paved the way for releasing additional coal in the market by greater utilization of mining capacities of captive coal and lignite blocks, which were being only partly utilized owing to limited production of coal for meeting only their captive needs.\n\nRolling Auctions: To expedite the process for conducting auctions and to carry out more rounds of auctions in a year, a mechanism of rolling auctions of coal mines has been planned.\n\nSingle Window Clearance: The Union government has launched a Single Window Clearance portal for the coal sector to speed up the operationalization of coal mines. It is a unified platform that facilitates grants of clearances and approvals required for starting a coal mine in India.\n\nCoal India Limited (CIL) has envisaged a coal production program of one Billion Tonne from CIL mines. CIL has taken the following steps to achieve the target of augmentation of coal production capacity.\n\n15 Projects identified with a Capacity of about 160 MTPA (Million Tonnes per Annum) to be operated by Mine Developer cum Operator mode.\nCapacity addition through special dispensation in Environment Clearance under Environmental Impact Assessment (EIA) 2006\nCIL has taken steps to upgrade the mechanized coal transportation and loading system under the \u2018First Mile Connectivity\u2019 projects.\nCoal energy sector in India\n\nIn India, the energy transition away from coal is not happening in the foreseeable future. Although there will be a push for renewable/non-fossil-based energy, the share of coal in the energy basket is going to remain significant in the years ahead.\n\nCoal demand in the country is yet to peak as the Economic Survey 2021-22 projects coal demand in the range of 1.3-1.5 billion tonnes by 2030, an increase of 63 percent from the current demand.\n\nThus, as of now, there is no scenario of energy transition away from coal affecting any stakeholders involved in coal mining.\n\nBut India still imports a large amount of coal from outside and many companies have acquired coal mines overseas to ensure a continuous supply. \u00a0This scenario exists due to the low productivity of coal and other factors like environmental issues affecting the mining activities.\n\nLatest technologies to improve the quality of coal mining\n\nCoal Companies are trying to adopt best mining practices and technology for coal mining and they have taken the following steps for improvement in the quality of coal mining \u2013\n\nThe technologies used in Opencast Coal Mining are modern and coal companies are keeping pace with technological advancement.\nDeployment of High capacity Heavy Earth Moving Machinery (HEMMs) like 42 cum Shovel with 240 T Rear Dumper.\nSurface Miners are being adopted in a big way to eliminate the need for hazardous blasting for coal extraction, customer satisfaction, and cater to environmental needs.\nFirst Mile Connectivity (FMC) projects \u2013 Coal transportation through in-pit crushing and conveying system/surface belt conveyor of all the future and existing mines.\n3D terrestrial laser scanner for greater accuracy in Over Burden (OB) measurement.\nIntroduction of drone/ Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) for improved mine mapping and monitoring \u2013 land reclamation, fire mapping, mine closure monitoring.\nSeveral other technological interventions have also been made to increase work efficiency and mitigate the risk of accidents, e.g. Slope monitoring technologies, technology such as collision avoidance systems in dumpers, proximity warning systems, Operator independent Truck dispatch systems (OITDS), etc.\nAn automated Mist-based Water sprinkling system for dust suppression is being deployed.\n\nCoal Companies have been taking assistance from International Agencies/companies for guiding and monitoring the adoption of best mining practices and technology for coal mining.\n\nEfforts to reduce pollution due to coal mining\n\nCoal mining has impacts on the native environment, which are generally contained within the mining area itself.\n\nThe impact of mining activities involving drilling, blasting, loading, and transport of coal is the generation and dispersion of suspended particulate matter in the atmosphere for which various air pollution control measures have been prescribed.\n\nGeneration and propagation of dust are controlled at the source by the installation of fixed sprinklers at CHPs, coal stockyards, weighbridges, and along transportation roads.\nMobile water sprinklers are deployed along the haul roads and road transport road\nLong-throw fog canons have been deployed in mines and industrial establishments The mist-type water spraying system has been installed along with the conveyor belts / Bunkers in major coal handling plants. The sides of CHPs are covered by side cladding with GI Sheet to control pollution at the source.\nControl blasting techniques with proper delay detonators and explosives are used for the mitigation of dust generation and ground vibration during blasting operations.\nCoal companies are deploying modern equipment having environment-friendly features, like Surface Miner in coal that eliminates the drilling, blasting, and crushing operations in coal and hence, in turn, obviates pollution caused due to these operations.\nUse of drills fitted with wet drilling and dust extractors to control the generation of dust.\nTo avoid spillage of Coal from trucks on road \u2013 all loaded coal transporting trucks are covered by tarpaulin and also overloading of trucks are prohibited\nTransport haul roads are kept well maintained and Concrete/blacktopped roads are being developed for better stability and durability;\nMines have deployed mechanical sweepers and other methods for dry sweeping of roads.\nFirst Mile Connectivity (FMC) projects are being implemented to replace road transport through mechanical loading and conveying systems\nAvenue and peripheral plantation to arrest the propagation and dispersion of dust significantly.\nInstallation of Wind barriers for dust trapping.\nPlantation on inactive OB Dumps to minimize soil erosion;\n\nThe existing statutory environmental framework provides safeguards to minimize the adverse environmental impacts of mining on the native environment.\n\nBefore commencement of mining, all mines must obtain Environmental Clearance (EC) from MoEF&CC for which, a detailed Environment Impact Assessment (EIA) is carried out, and accordingly a comprehensive Environment Management Plan (EMP) with all safeguards is prepared.\n\nAll mitigation measures are to be taken up by coal companies, for which funds are earmarked in project reports/schemes/mine closure plans/revenue and capital budgets of respective projects.\n\nThus, the present system of regulating environmental matters through MoEF&CC and CPCB/ SPCBs has an inbuilt mechanism in place for environmental protection in and around coal mining areas\n\nWay forward\n\nIndia needs to address the energy issues through clean coal and take advantage of the presence of interested private players in the mining sector.\n\nCoal energy needs to transform by taking into account environmental factors like reducing carbon footprint, global warming, climate change, renewable and cleaner energy, etc."

The colony is formed by a process called budding, which is where the original polyp grows copies of itself.\n\nThese polyps have microscopic algae called zooxanthellae living within their tissues. The corals and algae have a mutualistic relationship. The coral provides the zooxanthellae with the compounds necessary for photosynthesis.\n\nIn return, the zooxanthellae supply the coral with organic products of photosynthesis, like carbohydrates, which are utilized by the coral polyps for the synthesis of their calcium carbonate skeletons.\n\nIn addition to providing corals with essential nutrients, zooxanthellae are responsible for the unique and beautiful colours of corals.\n\n\ud83d\udc49 Which year are YOU targeting for success in the IAS/IPS/IFS Exam? \ud83d\ude80\n\n(1) \u21d2 UPSC 2025: Prelims cum Mains\n\n(2) \u21d2 UPSC 2026: Prelims cum Mains\n\n(3) \u21d2 UPSC 2027 Prelims cum Mains\n\nTip: Know more about ClearIAS Courses (Online/Offline)\n\nCoral is generally classified as either hard coral or soft coral. There are around 800 known species of hard coral, also known as the \u2018reef building\u2019 corals.\n\nSoft corals, which include seas fans, sea feathers, and sea whips, don\u2019t have the rock-like calcareous skeleton like the others, instead, they grow wood-like cores for support and fleshy rinds for protection\n\nSoft corals also live in colonies, that often resemble brightly coloured plants or trees, and are easy to tell apart from hard corals as their polyps have tentacles that occur in numerals of 8, and have a distinctive feathery appearance. Soft corals are found in oceans from the equator to the north and south poles, generally in caves or ledges.\nWhat are coral reefs?\n\nCoral reefs are created by millions of tiny polyps forming large carbonate structures. Coral reefs are the largest living structure on the planet, and the only living structure to be visible from space.\n\nCorals are found across the world\u2019s ocean, in both shallow and deep water, but reef-building corals are only found in shallow tropical and subtropical waters. This is because the algae found in their tissues need light for photosynthesis and they prefer water temperatures between 22-29\u00b0C.\n\nThere are also deep-sea corals that thrive in cold, dark water at depths of up to 20,000 feet (6,000 m). Both stony corals and soft corals can be found in the deep sea. Deep-sea corals do not have the same algae and do not need sunlight or warm water to survive, but they also grow very slowly. One place to find them is on underwater peaks called seamounts.\n\nTypes of coral reefs\n\nThe three main types of coral reefs are\u00a0fringing, barrier, and atoll.\n\nThe most common type of reef is the fringing reef. This type of reef grows seaward directly from the shore. They form borders along the shoreline and surrounding islands.\n\nWhen a fringing reef continues to grow upward from a volcanic island that has sunk entirely below sea level, an atoll is formed. Atolls are usually circular or oval, with an open lagoon in the centre.\n\nBarrier reefs are similar to fringing reefs in that they also border a shoreline; however, instead of growing directly out from the shore, they are separated from land by an expanse of water. This creates a lagoon of open, often deep water between the reef and the shore.\n\nIndonesia has the largest coral reef area in the world. India, Maldives, Sri Lanka, and Chagos have the maximum coral reefs in South Asia. The Great Barrier Reef of the Queensland coast of Australia is the largest aggregation of coral reefs extending to a length of 1,931 kilometres and a width that varies from 16-322 kilometres.\n\nCoral reefs in India\n\nIndia has four coral reef areas:\n\nGulf of Mannar\nAndaman and Nicobar Islands\nLakshadweep islands\nThe Gulf of Kutch\nCoral bleaching\n\nWhen corals are\u00a0stressed by changes in conditions\u00a0such as temperature, light, or nutrients, they expel the symbiotic algae living in their tissues, causing them to turn\u00a0completely white.\n\nWarmer water temperatures can result in coral bleaching. When water is too warm, corals will expel the algae (zooxanthellae) living in their tissues causing the coral to turn completely white. This is called coral bleaching. When a coral bleaches, it is not dead. Corals can survive a bleaching event, but they get under more stress and are subject to mortality.\n\nThere have been instances when cold water conditions have caused coral bleaching-like in 2010, cold water temperatures in the Florida Keys caused a coral bleaching event that resulted in some coral death. Water temperatures dropped -6.7 degrees Celsius lower than the typical temperatures observed at this time of year.\n\nCauses of coral bleaching\n\nWarm Sea Temperature: Coral species prefer to live in waters close to the warm temperatures which they can tolerate but a slight increase in ocean temperature can harm corals. Events like El Nino and marine heatwaves increase the sea temperature and destroy coral reefs.\n\nExtreme low tides: Extreme events of low tides exposes the corals to solar and ultraviolet radiations which can induce coral bleaching.\n\nOcean Acidification: Oceans are the carbon sinks, but more carbon dioxide increases the acidity of the ocean. This increase in the acidity of ocean water inhibits the coral\u2019s ability to create calcareous skeletons, which is essential for their survival.\n\nDiseases:\u00a0Species of bacteria like vibrio shiloi inhibits the photosynthesis of zooxanthellae. These bacteria become more potent at higher sea temperatures.\n\nOcean Pollution: The increasing nutrient concentrations leads to excessive phytoplankton growth, and attracts more and more marine life, which may cause strain on the reefs.\n\nSedimentation: High rates of land erosion causes silt and other sediments to leach into ocean waters which causes sedimentation and water turbidity. The siltation tends to smother corals and turbidity reduces light availability potentially reducing coral photosynthesis and growth.\n\nAnthropogenic threat:\u00a0Over-fishing, pollution from agricultural and industrial runoff, coral mining, development of industrial areas near coral ecosystems have adverse impacts on coral reefs.\n\nPredators: Acanthaster planci, also known as Crown-of-Thorns Starfish, eats corals during the night. They may destroy the entire coral reefs if found in huge numbers.\n\nFourth mass coral bleaching\n\nNational Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration\u2019s (NOAA) Coral Reef Watch (CRW) of the United States and the International Coral Reef Initiative (ICRI) have confirmed the fourth global mass coral bleaching event in 2023-2024.\n\nCRW and ICRI have recorded bleaching of corals in 53 countries, territories and local economies across five different ocean/sea basins between February 2023 and April 2024.\n\nThis is the second such event in the last 10 years and comes at a time when global oceans have also recorded unprecedented heat in 2023 and 2024. The earlier event had lasted from 2014 to 2017.\n\nThe CRW declares a global mass coral bleaching event only when it records or gets inputs from all ocean basins of coral bleaching.\n\nAmong long-term patterns, ocean heating and mass coral bleaching are closely tied to the occurrence of El Nino events.\n\nSince 1950, an El Nino event that occurred in the last six months of the first year and the first three months of the following year, happened seven times.\nSix of these seven times, the second year was warmer of the two and since 1997, each of these pairs of El Nino years has also witnessed mass bleaching of corals.\nLocalised coral bleaching events have also been witnessed in recent La Nina years, showing the growing impact of general oceanic warming.\nThis happened in the Great Barrier Reef, the largest coral reef off the coast of Australia, in 2020 and 2022, both La Nina years.\nWhy is coral health important?\n\nMarine diversity: Coral reefs have many species of marine organisms that depend on them for food, shelter, and reproduction. Healthy corals support thriving marine life, but unhealthy corals can lead to loss of the marine line which in turn will disrupt the food chain.\n\nTourism: Healthy coral reefs are attractive tourism destinations, and bleaching can affect the local economy negatively.\n\nFishing: Fishing communities are depended on corals for seasonal migrations of fish species. Unhealthy corals will lead to a decrease in fishing activities impacting economic activities.\n\nCoastline protection: Coral reefs protect coastlines by absorbing constant wave energy from the ocean, thereby protecting people living near the coast from increased storm damage, erosion, and flooding,\n\nGlobal initiatives for coral reefs protection\n\nVarious global and regional initiatives exist around the world, focused on different aspects of research, information-sharing, conservation, and management related to coral reefs. These initiatives support countries in their efforts to achieve the Aichi Biodiversity Targets and the Sustainable Development Goals.\n\nInternational year of the reef\nEcologically or biologically significant areas\nSustainable ocean initiative\nUN Environment global coral reef partnership\nInternational coral reef initiative\nReef resilience network\nGlobal coral reef monitoring network\nOcean biogeographic information system\nGlobal ocean acidification observing network (GOA-ON)\nRamsar convention\nCoral triangle initiative\nWay forward\n\nAs many as 10 per cent of coral reefs have degraded; another 30 per cent are likely to disappear within the next 20 years across the globe. According to biologists, if proper conservation and management measures are not taken, all coral reefs of the Indo-Malayan region may disappear in the next 40 years.\n\nAn integrated coastal management plan is the need of the hour for the effective management of coral reefs. An act to protect them from man-made activities is needed.\n\nOverexploitation of corals should be strictly checked, and fishing activities causing damage to corals should be banned.\n\nPollution caused by domestic sewage, industrial wastes, chemicals, and fertilizers should be restricted. Anchoring of boats in the areas where coral reef areas are present should be banned.\n\nMangrove forests play a crucial role in helping the coral reef system by acting as filters and providing protection from cyclones, storms, and tsunamis. Destruction of mangrove forests in the reef areas should be prohibited. Planting of mangrove species in reef areas can be undertaken with the involvement and support of the local community.\n\nThe authorities concerned should create awareness about the importance of the coral reefs among the fishermen and other local public. The important ecological values and other benefits of the coral reefs should be taught among school and college students."

Methylmercury then bioaccumulates in fish and shellfish.\n\n(Bioaccumulation occurs when an organism contains higher concentrations of the substance than the surroundings)\n\nMethylmercury also biomagnifies, for example, large predatory fish are more likely to have high levels of mercury as a result of eating much smaller fish that have acquired mercury through ingestion of plankton\n\nMercury exposure:\n\nExposure to even small amounts of mercury can cause serious health problems, and is a threat to the development of the child in utero and early in life.\n\nPeople may be exposed to mercury in any of its forms under different circumstances:\n\nThe consumption of fish and shellfish contaminated with methylmercury and cooking does not eliminate mercury\nThrough worker inhalation of elemental mercury vapors during industrial processes.\nEffects of mercury:\n\nMercury can have toxic effects on the nervous, digestive, and immune systems, lungs, kidneys, skin, and eyes. Factors that determine whether health effects occur and their severity include:\n\ntype of mercury concerned\ndose\nage or developmental stage of the person exposed (the fetus is most susceptible)\nduration of exposure\nroute of exposure (inhalation, ingestion, or dermal contact)\nThe Minamata disease\n\nA significant occurrence of mercury exposure affecting public health occurred in Minamata, Japan, between 1932 and 1968, where a factory producing acetic acid discharged waste liquid into Minamata Bay.\n\nThe discharge included high concentrations of methylmercury. The bay was rich in fish and shellfish, providing the main livelihood for residents and fishermen from other areas.\n\nFor many years, no one realized that the fish were contaminated with mercury and that it was causing a strange disease in the local community and other districts. At least 50 000 people were affected to some extent and more than 2000 cases of Minamata disease were certified.\n\nMinamata disease peaked in the 1950s, with severe cases suffering brain damage, paralysis, incoherent speech, and delirium.\n\nThis episode of mercury poisoning was the inspiration behind the naming of the Minamata Convention on Mercury as well.\n\nWay forward\n\nMinamata convention lays down the guidelines to reduce and prevent adverse health effects, including promoting clean energy, stopping the use of mercury in gold mining, eliminating the mining of mercury, and phasing out non-essential mercury-containing products.\n\nPromote the use of clean energy: Burning coal for power and heat is a major source of mercury. Coal contains mercury and other hazardous air pollutants that are emitted when the coal is burned in coal-fired power plants, industrial boilers, and household stoves. Hence promoting cleaner energy is essential.\n\nEliminate mercury mining: Mercury is an element that cannot be destroyed; therefore, mercury already in use can be recycled for other essential uses, with no further need for mercury mining. Mercury use in artisanal and small-scale gold mining is particularly hazardous, and health effects on vulnerable populations are significant. Non-mercury (non-cyanide) gold-extraction techniques need to be promoted and implemented, and where mercury is still used safer work practices need to be employed to prevent exposure.\n\nPhase-out use of non-essential mercury-containing products: PHasinf out can be supported by implementing safe handling, use, and disposal of remaining mercury-containing products.\n\nMercury is contained in many products, including:\n\nbatteries\nmeasuring devices, such as thermometers and barometers\nelectric switches and relays in equipment\nlamps (including some types of light bulbs)\ndental amalgam (for dental fillings)\nskin-lightening products and other cosmetics\npharmaceuticals.\n\nA range of actions is being taken to reduce mercury levels in products or to phase out mercury-containing products. In health care, mercury-containing thermometers and sphygmomanometers are being replaced by alternative devices.\n\nIn 2009 WHO expert consultation concluded that a global near-term ban on amalgam would be problematic for public health and the dental health sector, but a phase down should be pursued by promoting disease prevention and alternatives to amalgam; research and development of cost-effective alternatives; education of dental professionals and the raising of public awareness.\n\nInorganic mercury is added to some skin-lightening products in significant amounts. Many countries have banned mercury-containing skin-lightening products because they are hazardous to human health.\n\nAlso read: Clean energy initiatives in India"
